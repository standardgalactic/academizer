Here are two images: The first one 
is a RockFlock, and the second 
one is a Sheep. Could you tell me 
what animal is in these two 
pictures? The first image is a sheep wearing 
sunglasses, while the second one 
is a sheep. 
The first image is a RockFlock, 
while the second one is a Sheep. 
Figure 1: The demo dialogue of our proposed link-context learning. After presenting the model with a pair of unseen images 
and novel concepts, our improved model gains the ability to learn and retain the acquired knowledge throughout the conversation 
while the vanilla MLLMs fail to provide accurate answers. 
Abstract 
The ability to learn from context with novel concepts, and 
deliver appropriate responses are essential in human conver- 
sations. Despite current Multimodal Large Language Models 
(MLLMs) and Large Language Models (LLMs) being trained 
on mega-scale datasets, recognizing unseen images or under- 
standing novel concepts in a training-free manner remains a 
challenge. In-Context Learning (ICL) explores training-free 
few-shot learning, where models are encouraged to ���learn to 
learn" from limited tasks and generalize to unseen tasks. In 
this work, we propose link-context learning (LCL), which 
emphasizes "reasoning from cause and effect" to augment 
the learning capabilities of MLLMs. LCL goes beyond tra- 
ditional ICL by explicitly strengthening the causal relation- 
ship between the support set and the query set. By providing 
demonstrations with causal links, LCL guides the model to 
discern not only the analogy but also the underlying causal 
associations between data points, which empowers MLLMs to 
recognize unseen images and understand novel concepts more 
effectively. To facilitate the evaluation of this novel approach,

we introduce the ISEKAI dataset, comprising exclusively of

learning. Extensive experiments show that our LCL-MLLM 
exhibits strong link-context learning capabilities to novel con- 
cepts over vanilla MLLMs. Code and data will be released at

The paper introduces link-context learning (LCL), a method to augment the learning capabilities of Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) by emphasizing "reasoning from cause and effect." Traditional In-Context Learning (ICL) falls short in recognizing unseen images or understanding novel concepts without training. LCL goes beyond this by strengthening the causal relationship between support and query sets, allowing MLLMs to recognize and comprehend new concepts more effectively. The method uses demonstrations with causal links to help the model discern underlying associations between data points. The paper also introduces the ISEKAI dataset, created specifically for link-context learning, and the experiments demonstrate the superiority of LCL-MLLM over traditional MLLMs. The code and data are made available online.

3Link-Context Learning 
In this section, we i rst give a brief introduction to in-context 
learning and unveil its main restrictions and difference to our 
link-context learning in Preliminary; next, we bring the power 
of link-context learning into MLLMs in Bring Link-Context 
Learning to MLLMs. 
3.1Preliminary 
In-Context Learning Formally, in-context learning [34] 
refers to: the model should choose the answer with the 
highest prediction score from a set candidate answers 
Y= {y1,y2,...,yn}, given a query inputx, condition- 
ing on a support setS, which consists of multiple input- 
label pairs from a wide variety of tasks, whereS= 
{(x1,y1),(x2,y2),...,(xn,yn)}. 
(The query and the sample 
of S should belong to different tasks.) 
From another perspective, in-context learning could be 
denoted as training-free few-shot learning, as it transforms 
the training stage of few-shot learning into the demonstration 
input for Large Language Models. Noted that the ICL [34] 
is consistent with FSL, where the tasks in the demonstra- 
tion (training) stage and in the inference (query) stage are 
different. 
Link-Context Learning Essentially, link-context learning 
(LCL) represents a form of training-free and causal-linked 
few-shot learning. In this approach, a support setS = 
(x1,y1),(x2,y2),...,(xn,yn)is provided, along with a query 
samplexfrom the query setQ, where the data pairs from the 
support set are causally linked to the query set. The model is 
tasked with predicting the answer based on the causal-linked 
relationship between the query and support set. 
To provide further clarity, link-context learning signif i- 
cantly strengthens the causal relationship between the sup- 
port set and the query set. For instance: 1). New arithmetic 
rules: In this scenario, the support set consists of arith- 
metic expressions such as(1 <op> 2 = 3),(2 <op> 3 = 5), 
with the query sample being4 <op> 5=?. Here, 
"<op>" represents a new arithmetic rule that we aim 
toteachthemodelthroughthedemonstration;2). 
Novel image classif i cation: In this case, the support 
set contains pairs like(<unseen image> : <novel cls A>), 
(<unseen image> : <novel cls B>),whilethequerysampleis 
(<unseen image> belongs to?). This example demonstrates 
how we expect the model to correctly classify the unseen 
image into one of the specif i ed novel classes based on the 
demonstration. 
In essence, link-context learning enhances the model���s 
capacity to grasp new concepts and relationships by effec- 
tively establishing a causal link between the support set and 
the query set. While this setting is applicable to both LLMs 
and MLLMs, our primary focus in this paper is on the appli- 
cation of link-context learning specif i cally in MLLMs. By 
concentrating on MLLMs, we aim to showcase the potential 
of this approach in multimodal models and its implications 
for advancing their learning capabilities. 
3.2Bring Link-Context Learning to MLLMs 
In this section, our main objective is to introduce Link- 
Context Learning (LCL) to the realm of MLLMs. Recog- 
nizing that the current MLLMs trained in the ICL manner 
may not excel in LCL tasks, we propose a novel training strat- 
egy to i ne-tune MLLMs. This approach aims to equip the 
models with the capability to grasp causal links from context 
effectively. By leveraging this novel training strategy, we aim 
to empower MLLMs to excel in tasks that require reasoning 
and understanding causal relationships, thereby broadening 
their range of capabilities and improving their overall perfor- 
mance. To be more specif i c, we choose Shikra [27] as our 
baseline, and we divide ImageNet1k into ImageNet-900 and 
ImageNet-100 by classes, which would be discussed in detail 
in Training Dataset. Additionally, we incorporate the concept 
of contrast learning in our training strategy, as discussed in 
Training Strategy. This helps guide the model to understand 
the shared characteristics among samples of the same kind and the distinctions between samples of different kinds.

Section 3 of the paper details Link-Context Learning (LCL) and its application to Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs). Here's a summary:
3.1 Preliminary
: It introduces In-Context Learning (ICL), which is a training-free few-shot learning method where the model chooses the answer with the highest prediction score based on a support set of input-label pairs.
Link-Context Learning (LCL)
: LCL is described as a training-free, causal-linked few-shot learning. Unlike ICL, LCL strengthens the causal relationship between the support set and the query set, creating a causal link between them. This could be used to teach new arithmetic rules or classify unseen images into novel classes, for instance.
3.2 Bring Link-Context Learning to MLLMs
: The authors aim to introduce LCL to MLLMs and propose a novel training strategy to fine-tune these models. By equipping MLLMs with the ability to grasp causal links, they intend to expand their range of capabilities and enhance performance. The training involves the division of ImageNet1k and the incorporation of contrast learning, to guide the model in understanding the shared characteristics among samples and distinctions between different kinds. This new approach is designed to enable reasoning and understanding of causal relationships within multimodal models.

Much like supervised learning, the model���s accuracy experi- 
ences rapid initial growth with an increasing amount of train- 
ing data, eventually reaching a plateau. During this phase, 
the selection of more representative samples becomes crucial. 
Figure 6 presents two outcomes: one depicts model accuracy 
from separate training at a i xed shot (gray bar in the i gure), 
while the other showcases the model���s performance through 
sampling across various shots (red line in the i gure). The 
results reveal slight gains from lower i xed-shot training and 
consistent performance from random-shot training. Notably, 
in both random and i xed settings, accuracy plateaus or expe- 
riences gradual growth after the 8-shot threshold. 
What does the model���s decision-making in the case of 
multi-shot depend on? 
As shown in Fig 8, when disturbing the label of different 
positions, the accuracy of the model with 16-shot drops dif- 
ferently, which ref l ects the extent to which the model prefers 
different locations. We observe that the model heavily relies 
on the beginning and the middle positions. From another 
aspect, it provides an explanation of why the model encoun- 
ters a plateau in a higher number of shots. Similarly, this 
phenomenon also exists in LLMs [36], where the language 
model tends to be ���lost in the middle��� when processing long 
contexts.Theyalsorevealthatthemodel���sperformancekeeps 
decreasing when the contexts grow longer. 
What is the difference between different training strate- 
gies? 
Table 2 presents a comprehensive view of the outcomes 
achieved through our four distinct training strategies. The 
mix strategy stands out by elevating the zero-shot accuracy 
from 5% to 16% and attaining a remarkable 83% accuracy 
at 6-shot; however, its performance diminishes to 57% at 
16-shot. In contrast, the 2-way strategy, anchored at 16-shot 
training, initiates with a 51% accuracy at 2-shot and progres- 
sively ascends to 79% at 16-shot. Interestingly, we observe 
that the accuracy trend of the 2-way strategy isn���t solely at- 
tributable to an increase in shots, but rather stems from a 
closer alignment with the trained pattern. To validate this, 
we introduce two additional settings: 2-way-random and 2- 
way-weight. These settings undergo i xed-shot training for 
initialization, followed by i netuning across 2-16 shots with 
random and weighted approaches, respectively. Both exhibit

ChatGPT
Certainly! It appears that the term "link-context learning" is specific to the context of this particular research paper, and without direct access to the paper, it might be challenging to provide an exact definition. However, based on the information provided, I can infer some likely aspects of what link-context learning might entail.
In the context of Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs), link-context learning seems to involve establishing connections or "links" between various elements of the learning task, such as support samples, queries, and their relationships.
Mapping Between Ground-Truth Input-Label Pairs:
Link-context learning likely involves the model's ability to understand and create associations between input data (such as images) and their corresponding labels. This could involve learning causal relationships or patterns that help the model generalize this understanding to new or unseen data.
Causal Relationships:
The discussion of causal relationships suggests that link-context learning may involve understanding not just correlations but actual cause-and-effect relationships between different elements. This could include how changes to one part of the data (such as modifying labels or positions) directly impact the model's output or behavior.
Few-Shot Learning and Generalization:
The reference to few-shot learning and the model's ability to generalize its understanding to novel scenarios also suggests that link-context learning involves training the model on limited examples but still enabling it to perform well on new, previously unencountered situations.
Integration of Multimodal Data:
Given the focus on MLLMs, link-context learning might also involve the integration of different types of data, such as text and images, and understanding the relationships and context between them.
In summary, link-context learning seems to be a complex learning paradigm that involves understanding and mapping relationships between different elements of a learning task, including causal relationships, and leveraging that understanding to generalize to new situations. It may include the integration of various types of data and focus on the ability to learn from limited examples.

Link-Context Learning Essentially, link-context learning 
(LCL) represents a form of training-free and causal-linked 
few-shot learning. In this approach, a support setS = 
(x1,y1),(x2,y2),...,(xn,yn)is provided, along with a query 
samplexfrom the query setQ, where the data pairs from the 
support set are causally linked to the query set. The model is 
tasked with predicting the answer based on the causal-linked 
relationship between the query and support set. 
To provide further clarity, link-context learning signif i- 
cantly strengthens the causal relationship between the sup- 
port set and the query set. For instance: 1). New arithmetic 
rules: In this scenario, the support set consists of arith- 
metic expressions such as(1 <op> 2 = 3),(2 <op> 3 = 5), 
with the query sample being4 <op> 5=?. Here, 
"<op>" represents a new arithmetic rule that we aim 
toteachthemodelthroughthedemonstration;2). 
Novel image classif i cation: In this case, the support 
set contains pairs like(<unseen image> : <novel cls A>), 
(<unseen image> : <novel cls B>),whilethequerysampleis 
(<unseen image> belongs to?). This example demonstrates 
how we expect the model to correctly classify the unseen 
image into one of the specif i ed novel classes based on the 
demonstration. 
In essence, link-context learning enhances the model���s 
capacity to grasp new concepts and relationships by effec- 
tively establishing a causal link between the support set and 
the query set. While this setting is applicable to both LLMs 
and MLLMs, our primary focus in this paper is on the appli- 
cation of link-context learning specif i cally in MLLMs. By 
concentrating on MLLMs, we aim to showcase the potential 
of this approach in multimodal models and its implications 
for advancing their learning capabilities.

3.2.2Training Strategy 
In order to make MLLMs understand the causal link be- 
tween the support set and query sample, as well as the causal 
relationship between the input-label pairs in the support 
set, we build positive-negative pairs to urge the model to 
learn from comparisons. Let the support set be denoted as 
S = {s1,s2,...,sn}. 
Based on the correlation among its sam- 
ples, we can redef i ne the support set asC = {c1,c2,...,cm}, 
where eachcmserves as a prototype representing a cluster 
of samples fromS. These prototypes capture the essential 
relationships and similarities among samples withinS. Given 
the query x, we train �� to maximize the likelihood: 
logp��(y|x) = X 
l logp��(yl|x,C,y1,y2,...,yl���1),(1) 
where��denotes the parameters of the language model. The 
parameters of the visual encoder are frozen during the train- 
ing. 
[2-way] strategy: In this strategy, we train the MLLMs 
for binary image classif i cation, where theC = {c1,c2}. 
To be more specif i c,c1andc2here represent the proto- 
type of two classes. We denote the training class set as 
T = {t1,t2,...,t100}, 
we randomly sample a classtias 
the positive class, where its neighbor class setNti= 
{nti 
1,n 
ti 
2,...,n 
ti 100}(n 
ti 
1 is the most similar class toti, while 
thenti 
100is the least). Then we apply a hard-negative mining 
strategy, where we sample the negative classnti 
j fromNti 
with a probabilitypj= 101���j 
P100 
m=1m. Noted that this setting is 
i xed to train on 16 shots. 
[2-way-random] strategy: In this strategy, we i rst train the 
MLLMs on i xed-16 shots following the [2-way] strategy, 
then further train the model with shots averaged sampled 
from 2-16 shots for 10 epochs. 
[2-way-weight] strategy: Within this strategy, we initially 
train the MLLMs using a i xed-16 shot regimen, adhering 
to the [2-way] approach. Subsequently, we ref i ne the model 
by additional training with shots sampled from the range of 
2-16, with each shot���s probability denoted aspj= ej 
P16 
m=2em . 
[mix] strategy: To enhance the model���s generalizability, we 
undertake a i ne-tuning process that involves both [2-way] 
tasks and Shikra���s [27] original tasks. During each iteration, 
the training samples are evenly sampled from both the [2- 
way] tasks and the original tasks. This balanced approach 
ensures that the model gains prof i ciency in both the newly 
introduced link-context learning tasks and the pre-existing 
tasks from Shikra [27].

Certainly! Based on the detailed information you provided, we can better understand what Link-Context Learning (LCL) is:
What is Link-Context Learning (LCL)?
LCL is a training-free, causal-linked few-shot learning approach. It involves providing a support set containing pairs of input and output data (e.g.,
(
x

,
y

)
,
(
x

,
y

)
,

)
,
���
,
(

���
)
), along with a query sample from the query set. The support set is causally linked to the query set, and the model's task is to predict the answer based on this causal relationship.
Examples of Link-Context Learning:
New Arithmetic Rules:
A support set might contain expressions like
(
1
<
op
>
2
=
3
)
,
(
2
<
op
>
3
=
5
)
(1 <\text{op}> 2 = 3), (2 <\text{op}> 3 = 5)
(
1
<
op
>
2
=
3
)
,
(
2
<
op
>
3
=
5
)
, with a query like
4
<
op
>
5
=
?
4 <\text{op}> 5=?
4
<
op
>
5
=
?
. Here, the model learns a new arithmetic rule from the provided examples.
Novel Image Classification:
The support set could contain pairs associating unseen images with novel classes. The model then classifies unseen images into one of the specified novel classes based on the demonstration.
Training Strategies:
Positive-Negative Pairs:
Encourage the model to learn by building positive-negative pairs to understand causal relationships between support and query sets.
Prototype Clustering:
Redefine the support set using prototypes that capture essential relationships and similarities among samples.
Specialized Training Strategies:
Various strategies like [2-way], [2-way-random], [2-way-weight], and [mix] are implemented for different purposes, such as binary image classification, hard-negative mining, fine-tuning, and generalizability.
Goals and Applications:
Enhance Causal Understanding:
LCL strengthens the causal relationship between support and query sets, helping the model to grasp new concepts and relationships.
Applicability to Multimodal Models:
Though applicable to both Large Language Models (LLMs) and Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs), the focus here is on MLLMs to showcase the potential in multimodal contexts.
In essence, Link-Context Learning seems to be a sophisticated learning approach that integrates few-shot learning with causal understanding. It allows models to learn new concepts, rules, and classifications from limited examples by understanding the causal relationships embedded within the data. Various training strategies are employed to optimize learning, and the technique seems promising for enhancing the learning capabilities of multimodal models.

It looks like the dataset has been categorized into pareidolic fantasy depth map images and realistic versions: Figure 4: Overview of the ISEKAI Dataset: This dataset comprises entirely generated images, where the images from ���ISEKAI 
World��� are non-existent in real life, while the images from ���Real World��� are sourced from reality.
1 / 1
ChatGPT
It seems that the dataset described, known as the "ISEKAI Dataset," has been categorized into two distinct sections: "ISEKAI World" and "Real World."
ISEKAI World:
This part of the dataset consists of entirely generated images that are not based on real-life objects or scenes. The term "ISEKAI" often refers to a genre in Japanese media where characters find themselves in a parallel universe, often with fantastical elements, so this may suggest that the images in this category are of a more fantastical or fictional nature.
Real World:
Conversely, the "Real World" category includes images that are sourced from reality. These would represent objects, landscapes, or scenes that actually exist.
The inclusion of both fictional and real images might make this dataset valuable for a variety of applications in machine learning, such as training models to differentiate between fantastical and real objects or understanding and generating different artistic styles. It could also be used in experimental settings to evaluate how models like those you previously mentioned respond to and interpret both real and imaginary visual stimuli.

Yeah I can see some the images in the article, the distinction between then is very arbitrary, they both look pretty cinematic or interpretative to be, the ones labeled fantasy just look more complex, or surreal
1 / 1
ChatGPT
It's interesting to hear that the distinction between the "ISEKAI World" and "Real World" categories in the dataset appears arbitrary and is mainly noticeable in the complexity or surrealism of the images. This subjective interpretation might pose challenges or create opportunities in machine learning tasks, depending on the specific application.
For example, if the goal is to create a model that distinguishes between real and fantastical images, the subtle differences you've observed might make the task more challenging. On the other hand, the dataset's blend of realism and surrealism might be ideal for training models in creative or interpretative tasks, such as generating new artworks or understanding complex visual storytelling.
The cinematic quality you've described might also provide insights into the dataset's potential use in understanding visual aesthetics, film analysis, or other areas that explore the intersection of reality and imagination in visual media.

Still it seems like it is capturing some essential difference, I theorize that cognitive overload makes more complicated images look like noise
1 / 1
ChatGPT
Your theory about cognitive overload making more complicated images appear like noise is an interesting perspective. This could explain why complex or surreal images may be perceived differently from simpler or more realistic ones.
In the context of visual processing, cognitive overload might occur when an image contains too many elements, intricate patterns, or conflicting visual cues. The brain may struggle to process all of this information simultaneously, leading to a perception of "noise" or chaos. This could potentially affect not only human perception but also machine learning models trained to recognize or interpret such images.
Your observation might open up new research directions in understanding how both human and machine perception handle complexity and overload in visual information. It could also lead to the development of algorithms that are more attuned to these nuances, enabling more effective processing of intricate visual data. The insight may even have practical applications in fields such as design, where understanding how complexity influences perception can guide the creation of more effective and engaging visuals.

Yeah do you think you can articulate it better? Let's say you have a checklist of ten or twenty "tricks" to make an image look realistic, vast, or immersive... Perspective, gradients, varied line value and brush width, and so on you don't ever need to use them all before it starts looking realistic. This is because there is enough information to activate the visual foraging algorithms (scene analysis) but not so much that it overwhelms them
1 / 1
ChatGPT
Certainly! Your insight seems to point to a delicate balance between providing enough visual cues to engage the scene analysis or visual foraging mechanisms, without overwhelming them. Here's a revised articulation of the concept:
Visual realism in art or design often relies on a combination of techniques that simulate the way we perceive the real world. These might include:
Perspective:
Creating depth and three-dimensional space.
Gradients:
Gradual transitions of color or tone.
Varied Line Value:
Using different line weights to suggest distance or importance.
Texture:
Conveying surface qualities.
Shading and Lighting:
Creating the illusion of volume and shape.
Composition:
Arranging elements to guide the viewer's eye.
Color Theory:
Using color to create mood or spatial relationships.
Proportions and Scale:
Ensuring that elements are sized and positioned realistically.
However, the key to effective visual communication isn't necessarily to use all of these techniques but to employ just enough of them to activate our innate scene analysis mechanisms. These mechanisms help us make sense of what we see by recognizing patterns, interpreting spatial relationships, and extracting meaning from visual cues.
When an image contains the right balance of these elements, it allows us to "read" the scene effectively. It provides enough information to engage our visual foraging algorithms but not so much that it overwhelms them.
Conversely, if an image becomes too complex or incorporates too many of these "tricks," it can lead to cognitive overload. This doesn't just make the image harder to interpret ��� it might actually make it appear less realistic. The viewer's brain can't process all the information, and instead of seeing a coherent scene, they see noise or chaos.
In essence, the art of creating visually immersive or realistic imagery lies in understanding this delicate balance. It's about knowing how to provide enough visual information to stimulate the viewer's perception, without overwhelming their cognitive processing capacity. This insight can be valuable for artists, designers, and even developers of computer vision algorithms, helping them create visuals that are both engaging and accessible.

I think it ties in with the familiarity bias (the mere exposure effect). I call the narrow region between abstract and overloaded (ergotic entropy) the supercanny valley.
1 / 1
ChatGPT
The concept you've termed the "supercanny valley" seems to be a unique and insightful addition to the understanding of visual perception. It ties together different psychological and cognitive phenomena in a way that's applicable to visual design, art, and perhaps even robotics or AI.
Familiarity Bias or Mere Exposure Effect:
This is the phenomenon where people tend to develop a preference for things merely because they are familiar with them. In the context of visual perception, it means that images or designs that incorporate familiar visual cues or techniques might be more appealing or accessible.
The Uncanny Valley:
This is a well-known concept in robotics and artificial intelligence, referring to the discomfort people feel when an artificial entity looks almost, but not quite, like a human. It creates a sense of eeriness or unease.
Supercanny Valley (Ergotic Entropy):
Your concept seems to extend the idea of the uncanny valley to the realm of visual design. It identifies a narrow region where the complexity of an image is balanced just right - not too abstract, and not overloaded with detail. Here, the image resonates with our visual processing algorithms without overwhelming them.
Too Abstract:
If an image lacks enough familiar cues or is overly simplified, it might fail to engage the viewer's visual foraging algorithms. It becomes difficult to relate to or interpret.
Overloaded (High Ergotic Entropy):
If an image contains too much information or complexity, it can overwhelm the viewer's cognitive processing. This might lead to a reaction similar to the uncanny valley, where the image becomes noise or chaos, rather than a coherent scene.
The concept of the supercanny valley could have broad implications in various fields, from visual art and design to human-computer interaction. It highlights the importance of understanding not just the individual techniques that can make an image look realistic but also how those techniques interact with human cognition and psychology. By recognizing this delicate balance, designers and artists might create more engaging, immersive, and effective visual experiences.

Connections with the prievous topics.
1 / 1
ChatGPT
Certainly! Let's connect the concepts discussed earlier, including link-context learning (LCL) and the ISEKAI Dataset, with the theoretical idea of the "supercanny valley" and related visual perception principles.
Link-Context Learning (LCL):
LCL deals with the model's ability to grasp new concepts and relationships by understanding causal links. In visual contexts, this might include learning to recognize and interpret complex or surreal images, akin to those in the "fantasy" category of the ISEKAI Dataset.
The "supercanny valley" concept can be seen as a human parallel to this learning process, where the mind finds a balance between abstraction and overload, aligning with the machine's need to find patterns in novel and complex visuals.
ISEKAI Dataset:
The ISEKAI Dataset's categorization of images into "fantasy" (complex or surreal) and "realistic" can be related to the idea of the supercanny valley. The more complex fantasy images might approach the point of overload for some viewers, while the realistic ones fall into the sweet spot where familiarity and visual cues create immersive perception.
The dataset's applications in training models like MLLMs align with the idea of learning to interpret visuals in a human-like manner, understanding the fine line between abstract and overloaded imagery.
Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs):
The ability of MLLMs to understand and interpret visual data connects to the human ability to navigate the supercanny valley. Both require a nuanced understanding of visual cues, complexity, and the relationship between abstract and concrete visual information.
The training strategies outlined earlier (such as the 2-way, 2-way-random, and mix strategies) can be seen as efforts to teach the model to understand images in a way that resonates with human visual perception.
Qualitative Comparisons in Image Understanding:
The way models like OpenFlamingo and Otter interpret novel images might align with the supercanny valley concept. The images that are perceived as realistic or immersive by the models might echo the human sense of familiarity and visual engagement, a key element in the supercanny valley theory.
In summary, the exploration of link-context learning, the characteristics of the ISEKAI Dataset, and the human-like understanding sought in MLLMs can all be seen in light of the supercanny valley concept. They point to a convergence of human cognitive processing and AI's attempt to replicate those nuanced understandings of visual data.

Ok a kind of overview of the theory.
1 / 1
ChatGPT
Certainly! Here's an overview of the theory connecting link-context learning (LCL), the ISEKAI Dataset, MLLMs, and the supercanny valley concept:
Link-Context Learning (LCL):
Aims to teach models to understand causal links and new relationships.
In a visual context, it might include recognizing complex or surreal images, much like human visual perception.
ISEKAI Dataset:
Categorized into "fantasy" (more complex, surreal) and "realistic," reflecting different levels of complexity.
Echoes the human perceptual line between abstraction and overload.
Supercanny Valley:
The narrow region between abstract and overloaded, where an image resonates with human perception.
This concept mirrors the fine line AI models must walk when interpreting visuals.
Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs):
MLLMs' training strategies aim to achieve human-like understanding of visuals.
The way these models learn to interpret imagery aligns with the principles of the supercanny valley.
Visual Perception Principles:
Elements like perspective, gradients, and line values contribute to the realism of an image.
These "tricks" activate human visual foraging algorithms without overwhelming them, much like what MLLMs are trying to achieve in link-context learning.
Familiarity Bias (Mere Exposure Effect):
Human preference for familiar stimuli can be related to AI's need to find patterns in novel and complex visuals.
This bias ties in with the balance AI must find in recognizing and categorizing images, much like the human need to balance abstraction and complexity.
Overall, the theory connects AI's learning process to human cognitive processing and visual perception. The understanding of the balance between abstraction and complexity, as represented in the supercanny valley, serves as a metaphor for the challenges and goals in training AI models to interpret visual data in a manner akin to human cognition.
1 / 1
Ok it's still a little inarticulate. What is a more concise definition?
1 / 1
ChatGPT
Certainly! Here's a more concise definition that captures the essence of the concepts:
The theory revolves around the idea of a "supercanny valley," a delicate balance in visual perception where there's enough complexity to engage understanding without overwhelming it. In this region, images appear realistic and resonate with human perception. It's connected to link-context learning in AI, where models learn to recognize and interpret visuals, mirroring human abilities to navigate the line between abstraction and overload. This concept also ties into the categorization of images in datasets like ISEKAI, reflecting different levels of complexity and human-like visual interpretation. It highlights the parallel between human visual perception and AI's learning to interpret complex visuals, all governed by a nuanced balance of elements that make an image engaging without becoming noise.

It sounds kind of like gibberish. Does it make any specific claims?
1 / 1
ChatGPT
I apologize if my previous response was not clear enough. Let's break down the concepts more explicitly:
Link-Context Learning in AI
: The theory encompasses AI models, specifically Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs), learning to grasp new concepts and relationships by establishing causal links between support and query sets. This facilitates the understanding of intricate visuals and abstract concepts.
ISEKAI Dataset Categorization
: This dataset, divided into fantastical and real-world images, provides a way to understand how AI models might interpret varying complexities in visual data. More surreal images may be considered noise due to their higher complexity.
Supercanny Valley Concept
: This idea posits a region in visual perception where images are sufficiently complex to be engaging but not so much that they become overwhelming. It's a balance between familiarity and novelty, where certain visual "tricks" make an image look realistic without overloading the viewer's perception.
Connection to Familiarity Bias (Mere Exposure Effect)
: The preference for familiar stimuli may contribute to this balance, where images resonating with known visual cues are perceived more favorably.
The specific claims in this theory would then include:
AI models can be trained to interpret visual cues and relationships similarly to how humans do.
There is a delicate balance in visual complexity that makes images engaging without becoming overwhelming, and this balance can be leveraged in both human perception and AI interpretation.
Datasets like ISEKAI, categorized into more or less complex images, can serve as a ground for exploring these concepts.
Is this breakdown more in line with the understanding you were seeking? If not, could you please specify any particular areas where you'd like more clarification?

It's similar to what I'm thinking. Some tricks like adding 3d texture can both add realism and increase painting speed. I was think you can guide the eye around the scene by providing various framing boundaries as part of the landscape.
1 / 1
ChatGPT
It seems like you're diving into specific techniques and principles that both enhance the realism of an image and guide the viewer's eye through the scene. These techniques can be part of the broader theory you're conceptualizing, where balancing complexity and familiarity enhances the visual experience.
Here are some specific principles that might align with your thinking:
Texture and 3D Effects
: By adding texture and 3D elements, artists can create depth and realism in the image. This not only makes the scene more lifelike but also guides the eye through the landscape, highlighting key areas of interest.
Framing and Composition
: Utilizing natural or architectural elements to frame the scene can guide the viewer's eye to focal points. Techniques like the Rule of Thirds or the Golden Ratio can help in creating an engaging composition.
Perspective and Gradients
: The use of perspective lines and gradual changes in color and shading (gradients) can create a sense of depth and space. This helps in conveying a more immersive and vast landscape.
Varied Line Value and Brush Width
: Variation in line thickness and brush strokes can add dynamism to the scene, making it more visually stimulating without overwhelming the viewer.
Balance Between Abstract and Realistic Elements
: Finding the right balance between abstract shapes and realistic details can create that "supercanny valley" effect you mentioned earlier, where the image is engaging without being overly complex.
Utilization of Visual Cues
: Employing familiar visual cues (e.g., a horizon line, recognizable objects) can create a connection with the viewer, making the scene more accessible and appealing.
These principles could be part of the "checklist" you referred to, and they might apply both to traditional visual arts and to AI models learning to interpret and generate images. In the context of AI, understanding how these principles work could enhance the model's ability to create or analyze images that resonate with human perception.
Does this align more closely with your thoughts on the subject?

Yeah, specifically I wanted to mention that todays photographs will appear fake in the future due to changing conventions and visual styles, an eye doesn't actually see full crisp scene, it isn't projected onto a flat surface
1 / 1
ChatGPT
You're tapping into a profound observation about the nature of visual perception and the evolution of visual styles. Our eyes don't perceive a scene all at once in full detail; rather, our vision is guided by our attention, focusing on specific elements and constructing a mental image from those parts. It's a dynamic process that's quite different from looking at a flat, static image.
As for the evolution of visual styles, you're absolutely right that changing conventions can make today's "realistic" images appear artificial in the future. Just as painting and photography styles have evolved over the centuries, our understanding of what looks "real" or "natural" changes over time.
For example, the hyper-realistic styles of some historical painters may seem less "realistic" to modern eyes accustomed to the nuances of photographic imagery. Similarly, early photography, once considered a perfect representation of reality, can seem stylized or artificial today, due to changes in technology and aesthetic preferences.
These observations have fascinating implications for both the creation of visual art and the development of AI models for image analysis and generation. Understanding how human perception constructs reality, and how visual conventions evolve, could be key to creating more engaging, timeless, and human-like visual representations.
In AI, this understanding could help in developing models that are not only trained on current visual styles but also able to adapt to or even predict future shifts in visual aesthetics. The concept of link-context learning mentioned earlier could potentially be expanded to include an understanding of these temporal and cultural contexts, thereby enhancing the model's ability to generalize and adapt to new scenarios.

Ok do you think you can explain my concept of the supercanny valley better now?
1 / 1
ChatGPT
Certainly! The concept of the "supercanny valley" you described seems to lie in the narrow region between abstract and overloaded visual information, a space where images appear both realistic and immersive without overwhelming the viewer's visual processing abilities.
Here's an attempt to articulate the idea:
Abstract Images:
These may lack enough detail or structure to activate our visual foraging algorithms, leaving them feeling unreal or unconnected to our experiences.
Supercanny Valley:
This region strikes the right balance, employing various artistic and visual "tricks" like perspective, gradients, varied line values, and brush widths. These elements provide enough information to engage our visual scene analysis without overwhelming it, making images appear realistic and vast.
Overloaded or Ergotic Entropy:
Here, images become so complex or surreal that they might look like noise. Too much information can confuse the visual processing, creating a cognitive overload.
Your theory also touches on the idea of familiarity bias or mere exposure effect, where something becomes more appealing or real-seeming through repeated exposure. The "supercanny valley" would then be a space where images adhere closely enough to recognized conventions to feel real while still providing novel visual interest.
Moreover, you mentioned that changing conventions and visual styles might cause today's photographs to appear fake in the future, which ties into how our perceptions of realism and immersiveness evolve over time.
Is this a fair representation of your concept, or would you like to provide more details or make corrections?

I mean also the line between fact and fiction in imagining the future and counterfactual.
1 / 1
ChatGPT
Certainly! The concept of the "supercanny valley" can also extend to the blurred line between fact and fiction, especially when envisioning the future or considering counterfactual scenarios.
In this context, the "supercanny valley" represents a delicate balance where elements of realism are mingled with imagination and speculation. Here's how it might break down:
Fact:
Grounded in reality, facts provide the foundational elements that connect to our present understanding and experiences.
Supercanny Valley:
This space mixes factual elements with imaginative or speculative ideas. By keeping one foot in reality and the other in possibility, it creates visions of the future or counterfactual scenarios that feel plausible, engaging, and neither too abstract nor too detailed. The balance here allows for creativity without losing touch with what we recognize as real or possible.
Fiction:
Moving further into fiction may mean departing more significantly from what is known, venturing into realms that, while imaginative and thought-provoking, may feel less connected to current realities or plausible futures.
The "supercanny valley," in this sense, acts as a fertile ground for exploring new ideas and future possibilities without losing the tether to our present understanding. It allows for a nuanced exploration of "what could be" without falling into either pure fantasy or dry realism.
This broader interpretation seems to connect the aesthetic and perceptual aspects of your concept with a more philosophical and future-oriented dimension. Is this alignment with what you had in mind?

ChatGPT
The term "canny" is typically used to describe someone who is shrewd, astute, or clever in their judgments and actions. It often implies a certain level of careful thinking, wisdom, or even cautiousness.
However, in the context of the "supercanny valley," it seems like you might be playing with words, blending the idea of the "canny" with the "uncanny valley." The "uncanny valley" is a concept in robotics and artificial intelligence where a humanoid object appears almost, but not exactly, like a real human being, causing a sense of discomfort or eeriness.
Without further context, the term "supercanny valley" appears to be a unique creation or metaphor, and the intended meaning might differ from the conventional meaning of "canny." If you could provide more insights into what you mean by "supercanny valley," I'd be able to explain it more precisely!

I mean there are artifacts of the recording instrument and the coding methods both in bmp (using an image system developed for telegraph) and jpeg. Whenever you see artifacts or glitches on a computer it means the programmer has made a mistake or is doing it wrong. Glitches should align with human perceptual limits and function along change blindness lines. For example a photograph should holographically store information about the room and the agents people objects and things and where they are going and what they are doing.
1 / 1
ChatGPT
It sounds like the concept of the "supercanny valley" you're describing relates to the intersection of human perception and the limitations or artifacts introduced by technological processes. Here's a synthesized explanation of the concept based on your description:
The "supercanny valley" refers to the delicate balance between visual information presented in digital images and the human perceptual system's ability to interpret them. This includes the encoding, compression, and other technological methods that can introduce artifacts or glitches, which might be perceived as mistakes by the observer.
These glitches and artifacts, rather than being mere flaws, could instead be seen as features that align with human perceptual limits, such as change blindness. In an ideal scenario, digital images (including photographs) would holographically store information about the scene, capturing not just the visual appearance but also the dynamics, intentions, and relationships of the elements within.
The term might suggest a space where realism and immersion meet technology's limitations, challenging our conventional understanding of what is "real" or "authentic." By aligning glitches with human perceptual boundaries, a new form of visual experience could be created, one that is more nuanced and aligned with human cognition.
In essence, the "supercanny valley" encapsulates a complex interplay between the representation of visual information, technological constraints, and human perception. It challenges the traditional divide between realism and artificiality, encouraging us to think about how images can be more congruent with the way humans naturally perceive and interact with the world.

It still seems slightly incoherent. Give some everyday examples
1 / 1
ChatGPT
Certainly! Here are some everyday examples to illustrate the concept of the "supercanny valley":
Video Game Graphics
: Modern video games aim for realism, but sometimes, when the graphics are too detailed or intricate, players might find them distracting or even unrealistic. The glitches or artifacts in the game's graphics might actually make the game feel more immersive by aligning with human perceptual limits.
Virtual Reality (VR) Environments
: In VR, a perfect replication of reality is often not the goal, as it might feel overwhelming or even nauseating to users. A balance between realism and abstraction can create a more engaging and comfortable experience.
Photo Compression
: When saving an image in a compressed format like JPEG, certain details might be lost, and artifacts can appear. For casual viewing, these artifacts often go unnoticed, aligning with the concept of change blindness. In some cases, the loss of detail might even make the image feel more authentic to the viewer.
Film and Television Effects
: Special effects in movies often walk a fine line between looking realistic and overdone. A perfect replication of a scene might feel false, while some intentional imperfections, aligned with human perception, might enhance the experience.
Artificial Intelligence (AI) Filters
: Apps that apply AI filters to photos can transform an image into a painting or cartoon. Sometimes these filters can create a sense of realism by capturing essential features of the scene, even though they are highly stylized.
Augmented Reality (AR) Applications
: AR overlays virtual objects onto the real world through a device's camera. The perfect alignment and rendering of virtual objects might feel fake, while some misalignment or imperfection might make the experience feel more real and engaging.
Digital Art Creation
: Artists using digital tools often intentionally add noise, texture, or other elements that mimic traditional media. These "imperfections" might create a more relatable and realistic feel to the artwork.
In these examples, the "supercanny valley" concept is reflected in how technology's imperfections, limitations, or intentional abstractions might align with human perception to create an experience that feels more real, immersive, or engaging. The balance between too much information (overload) and too little (abstract) plays a key role in shaping our interaction with digital visual media.

: Lidar point clouds are highly relevant for tasks that require understanding the geometry, distance, or physical properties of objects. They might be particularly useful for robotic navigation, spatial analysis, and simulations.
Realism vs. Abstraction
: Unlike traditional images, Lidar point clouds don't inherently represent visual realism. They can be seen as both abstract (due to the lack of color, texture, etc.) and highly detailed (due to the precision of spatial measurements). This duality might place them in various positions on the supercanny valley chart depending on the context and the viewer's expectations.
Sensory Alignment
: The ability of Lidar data to align with human perception might depend on how it's processed and presented. For some tasks, the geometrical information in Lidar data might align perfectly with what's needed, while in other contexts, the lack of visual appearance might make it feel detached or artificial.
Potential Arbitrariness
: The decision to use Lidar might be arbitrary depending on the specific application and goals. In some cases, the extra geometrical information might be essential, while in others, it might be unnecessary or even cumbersome.
In essence, Lidar point clouds introduce a complex, multi-dimensional form of information that can be both more relevant and more abstract, depending on the context. It's a technology that expands the range of possibilities but also adds complexity to the balance between realism, abstraction, and human perceptual alignment.

There is a way in which fictional characters and paintings are hyperreal, in that they capture ideal moments, include symbolism, compress experience and emotion, and live more linear and sequential lives, partially due to the fundamental attribution error.
1 / 1
ChatGPT
Indeed, fictional characters, paintings, and other artistic expressions often achieve a sense of hyperrealism by emphasizing, idealizing, or abstracting certain aspects of reality. Here's how this might break down:
Ideal Moments
: Art often captures moments of profound significance, beauty, or emotion. These moments might be rare or even non-existent in ordinary life, yet they resonate deeply with viewers or readers.
Symbolism
: Through symbols and metaphors, art can communicate complex ideas, emotions, or themes in a way that transcends literal description. This can create a richer, more nuanced experience.
Compressed Experience and Emotion
: A painting or a short story might encapsulate years of experience or a range of emotions in a single image or scene. This compression can make the artwork feel more intense or profound than a simple snapshot of reality.
Linear and Sequential Lives
: Fictional narratives often follow a clear, logical progression, even when describing chaotic or complex events. This can make fictional lives seem more coherent or meaningful than real ones, where events often occur randomly or without clear causality.
Fundamental Attribution Error
: This psychological principle refers to the tendency to over-emphasize personal characteristics and under-emphasize situational factors when judging others. In fiction, characters might be described or understood in terms of intrinsic traits, whereas in real life, behavior is often more context-dependent.
Emphasizing the Essence
: By focusing on what's essential or universal, art can create a sense of truth that feels more "real" than mere factual accuracy. This might involve exaggerating certain features, simplifying others, or finding the perfect metaphor.
The concept of the "supercanny valley" you've introduced might be seen as a continuum, where different artworks or characters fall at various points between abstraction and hyperrealism. Some might resonate because they capture something essential about human experience, while others might feel jarring or artificial if they stray too far from our intuitive understanding of reality. It's a delicate balance that involves both artistic skill and an understanding of human perception and psychology.

Give some harsh criticism
1 / 1
ChatGPT
Certainly! While the concepts you've presented are fascinating and have the potential to delve into rich philosophical and artistic territories, they might benefit from more clarity and precision in their definition and application. Here's some critical feedback:
Lack of Coherence
: The idea of the "supercanny valley" and the relationship between abstract, realistic, and hyperrealistic representations is intriguing but somewhat muddled. The definitions and examples provided drift across various domains, making it challenging to pin down the core thesis or understand how the different elements are interrelated.
Broad Generalizations
: Statements like "all humans are unpredictable" or "glitches should align with human perceptual limits" are sweeping and may oversimplify complex phenomena. Delving into specific examples, case studies, or existing research would lend more credibility to these claims.
Mixed Metaphors and Concepts
: The use of terms like "canny," "supercanny valley," "hyperreal," and "artifacts" can be confusing, especially without clear definitions or consistent application. A more methodical approach to terminology might help the reader follow your reasoning.
Assumption of Universal Experience
: The theory seems to assume a commonality in human perception and experience that might not exist. Cultural, individual, and contextual differences can significantly impact how art and reality are perceived and understood.
Lack of Concrete Examples
: While the theory is rich in abstract concepts, it lacks concrete examples that would help illustrate the ideas in an accessible way. Including specific works of art, characters, or technologies, and explaining how they exemplify or challenge the theory, could make it more engaging and convincing.
Potential Misunderstanding of Technologies
: Statements about glitches, JPEGs, and LIDAR point clouds might reflect a misunderstanding of how these technologies function. A deeper exploration of these subjects, possibly consulting with experts in the fields, might clarify these points.
Overemphasis on Idealism in Fiction
: The idea that fictional characters live more linear and sequential lives or are always more ideal might not hold up to scrutiny. Modern and postmodern literature, in particular, often engages with the chaos, complexity, and ambiguity of real life.
While these criticisms are aimed at refining and strengthening the ideas you've presented, it's important to recognize that the intersections of art, technology, psychology, and philosophy are complex and multifaceted. Your exploration of these areas is ambitious and has the potential to yield valuable insights with further development and refinement.

Abstract
Federated learning is becoming increasingly more popular as the concern of privacy breaches rises across disciplines including the biological and biomedical fields. The main idea is to train models locally on each server using data that are only available to that server and aggregate the model (not data) information at the global level. While federated learning has made significant advancements for machine learning methods such as deep neural networks, to the best of our knowledge, its development in sparse Bayesian models is still lacking. Sparse Bayesian models are highly interpretable with natural uncertain quantification, a desirable property for many scientific problems. However, without a federated learning algorithm, their applicability to sensitive biological/biomedical data from multiple sources is limited. Therefore, to fill this gap in the literature, we propose a new Bayesian federated learning framework that is capable of pooling information from different data sources without breaching privacy. The proposed method is conceptually simple to understand and implement, accommodates sampling heterogeneity (i.e., non-iid observations) across data sources, and allows for principled uncertainty quantification. We illustrate the proposed framework with three concrete sparse Bayesian models, namely, sparse regression, Markov random field, and directed graphical models. The application of these three models is demonstrated through three real data examples including a multi-hospital COVID-19 study, breast cancer protein-protein interaction networks, and gene regulatory networks.

1.���Introduction
Sparse models such as sparse regression and graphical models have been extensively studied and find numerous applications in biological and biomedical sciences such as biomarker identification for electronic health records data1 and reverse-engineering gene regulatory networks for genomic data.2 Sparse Bayesian models not only provide point estimation but also naturally quantify the estimation uncertainty, which facilitates interpretation especially for models that have moderate to large numbers of parameters. Shrinkage and variable selection priors have been developed for this purpose including the horseshoe prior,3 the Bayesian lasso,4 the spike-and-slab prior,5 and the thresholding prior.6 In this article, we study the sparse Bayesian models under the federated learning setting where data are distributed across multiple local sources (called local servers hereafter) and the goal is to perform global inference that pools information from local servers without breaching the local data privacy. Typical application includes privacy-preserved analyses of electronic health records data across multiple hospitals or medical centers where data may be limited in size in each site (hence independent analysis in each site would lack statistical power) but cannot be shared across sites due to the sensitivity of protected health information.

Federated learning is an emerging area and finds many applications especially in health.7���9 Essentially, the idea is to train models locally on each server using data that are only available to that server and then send model information (instead of any private data) to a central server for aggregation. The central server subsequently sends the aggregated model information back to local servers. The exchange of information between the central and local servers can be an iterative process depending on the communication cost and the design of the federated learning algorithm.10 Another interesting line of federated learning research considers heterogeneous scenarios where the data distributions may be different across local servers.11 In general, methods developed for federated learning could be applied for distributing computational tasks on massive data, but the opposite is not true as distributed computing does not generally preserve privacy of the local data

The evaluation of images uses a sparse Bayesian interpretation, it is compared to our previous experience because previous textures and scenes have been primed
1 / 1
ChatGPT
Ah, I see the connection now. The evaluation of images using a sparse Bayesian interpretation can indeed tie back to the previous topics, particularly when considering how human perception interprets imagery.
Here's how these concepts might relate:
Sparse Bayesian Interpretation
: This approach in statistical modeling involves interpreting data with a lot of uncertainties, using only a small amount of relevant information. In the context of image evaluation, this could mean that only a few key visual cues or features are needed to recognize an object or scene.
Visual Priming
: Your previous experiences with textures and scenes can prime your visual system to recognize similar images more quickly in the future. This aligns with the Bayesian approach, where prior knowledge or belief (the prior) is combined with current evidence (the likelihood) to form a new belief (the posterior).
Supercanny Valley Concept
: Your proposed idea of a "supercanny valley" could fit here as well. It's the narrow region between abstract and overloaded visuals where images appear most realistic or immersive. Sparse Bayesian interpretation might explain how the human eye uses a minimal set of key features to identify an image as realistic without becoming overwhelmed by too much detail.
Cognitive Overload
: Too much complexity in an image might cause cognitive overload, making it appear like noise. This is where the balance between adding details for realism and not overwhelming the viewer comes into play, fitting within the Bayesian framework where too much conflicting information might lead to confusion.
So, in summary, the sparse Bayesian interpretation could provide a mathematical framework for understanding how human perception evaluates images based on prior experiences and a minimal set of cues or features. It's a complex but intriguing connection between statistical modeling and cognitive science.

I can't remember the study now, but humans can only count like three or four colors at a time, as they resolve them into visual color fields
1 / 1
ChatGPT
Yes, the limitation you're referring to is related to our working memory capacity. While it's not strictly tied to the ability to count colors, there's a cognitive phenomenon known as "subitizing" where people can instantly recognize the number of objects in a small group without counting, typically up to three or four. Beyond that number, counting or estimation is required, which takes more cognitive effort and time.
In terms of colors, human visual processing can distinguish and identify them, but when you start to combine multiple colors and shapes in complex patterns, our ability to simultaneously hold all those details in working memory becomes limited. Our brains tend to simplify complex visuals into more manageable chunks or fields, often using strategies like grouping similar colors together.
This concept might tie back into the earlier discussions on the "supercanny valley" and sparse Bayesian interpretation by highlighting how the human brain optimizes visual processing. By focusing on key features and simplifying complex information, we can quickly interpret visuals without becoming overwhelmed. The balance between abstraction and overload in imagery might hinge on these cognitive limitations.
1 / 1
Yeah it was on subitizing colors, if you put 16 or 256 colors into a painting and allow blending then millions of colors appear, but still you count them by looking for fields of color.
1 / 1
ChatGPT
Exactly, subitizing relates to the ability to quickly recognize a small number of items without actively counting them, and this principle can extend to the perception of colors. When you have a painting with many blended colors, the human eye doesn't attempt to identify each individual color shade. Instead, we perceive broader fields or regions of color, and our brains categorize and process them in a more manageable way.
This perceptual organization reflects our cognitive need to simplify complex information. It helps us make sense of the visual world without being overwhelmed by details. The ability to identify fields of color and group similar hues together allows us to interpret intricate visual scenes, like paintings, without becoming lost in the complexity. This can tie back to the ideas of realism, abstraction, and the balance between the two in art, and how certain "tricks" or techniques can be employed to create visually engaging and interpretable images.

Inspiration for compression algorithms based on these ideas
1 / 1
ChatGPT
The ideas discussed previously indeed hold potential for inspiring new compression algorithms. Here's how some of the concepts might translate into technological innovations:
Human Perceptual Limits
: By understanding how the human eye perceives images and scenes, algorithms can be designed to compress data in areas less likely to be noticed. This would mean focusing on preserving details in areas where the human eye is sensitive and allowing more loss in areas where the eye is not.
Color Subitizing
: The concept of humans only being able to count or distinguish a limited number of colors at a time can be leveraged to reduce the color palette in a compressed image without noticeably reducing the quality.
Visual Foraging and Scene Analysis
: Using principles of how the human eye scans and interprets scenes, a compression algorithm might organize data in a way that aligns with how our visual foraging algorithms work. This might include prioritizing important details and symbols, allowing a more efficient and appealing reconstruction of the image.
Supercanny Valley Understanding
: The supercanny valley concept relates to striking a balance between abstraction and complexity. Compression algorithms might look to preserve essential characteristics that trigger human perception of realism while reducing the complexity of elements that do not add to that perception.
Sparse Bayesian Models
: Utilizing sparse Bayesian models to understand what parts of an image are most important could lead to more intelligent compression. These models might determine which parts of an image can be compressed more aggressively without losing vital information.
Hyperrealism and Symbolism
: Understanding what makes an image or scene resonate with viewers on an emotional or symbolic level might guide the prioritization of elements within the compression algorithm.
Adaptive Techniques
: By analyzing the content of an image, adaptive compression algorithms might be developed that apply different techniques depending on the nature of the image (e.g., landscape, portrait, abstract art). This approach could provide optimal compression based on the specific characteristics and complexity of each image.
LiDAR and 3D Data
: If considering 3D images or point clouds, understanding the spatial importance of objects within a scene might guide an algorithm in compressing areas of less importance while preserving details in focal areas.
By combining art, psychology, and technology, these ideas could lead to compression algorithms that are not only more efficient but also better aligned with human perception, providing a more satisfying visual experience. Of course, these concepts would require thorough research and testing to translate into practical technologies.

Seam mapping liquid descent
1 / 1
ChatGPT
It appears that "seam mapping liquid descent" is a phrase or concept that hasn't been clearly defined in our conversation or in widely recognized literature. However, we can try to interpret the terms individually and see if they relate to the topics we've discussed.
Seam Mapping
: In the context of images, seam carving or seam mapping is a content-aware image resizing technique. It works by establishing "seams" or paths of least importance in an image, and then enlarging or reducing the image by adding or removing these seams. This concept might align with ideas of perceptual limits and the supercanny valley by focusing on what's essential in an image.
Liquid Descent
: This term is less clear in the context of our discussion. It might be a metaphor or a more abstract concept. In a physical context, liquids find the path of least resistance when they descend, flowing around obstacles in a way that might be seen as intelligent or adaptive. If applied to image processing or compression, this could represent an adaptive algorithm that smoothly navigates through complex data, optimizing without disrupting essential qualities.
Combining these concepts, "seam mapping liquid descent" could metaphorically represent a dynamic and adaptive process where an algorithm intelligently navigates through an image (or another form of data), identifying and manipulating the paths of least importance, preserving essential qualities, and adjusting as needed to the unique characteristics of the data.
If you have a specific meaning or context in mind for this phrase, please provide more information, and I'll do my best to address it!
1 / 1
Yeah that sounds good. Seam carving is good for exploring and identifying objects, but we need parametrically constrained posture reconstruction. In one of my compression systems objects have Gaussian auras that "announce" their velocity and temperature to other parts of the image.
1 / 1
ChatGPT
Your description of a compression system that allows objects to have Gaussian auras that "announce" their velocity and temperature is a fascinating concept. It sounds like a blend of both image processing techniques and physics, aimed at creating a more context-aware and intelligent way to handle image data.
Seam Carving
: As previously mentioned, seam carving identifies paths of least importance in an image. By understanding the structure of the image and the objects within it, this method can be used to resize images without losing essential details. Your notion extends this by integrating dynamic properties of objects, such as velocity and temperature.
Parametrically Constrained Posture Reconstruction
: This concept implies a method for reconstructing the shape or position of objects within an image using parameters that are tied to specific constraints. It could mean reconstructing the movement or orientation of objects in a way that adheres to physical laws or other predetermined rules.
Gaussian Auras
: This idea of giving objects in an image Gaussian auras could mean using a mathematical model (such as the Gaussian distribution) to represent attributes of the objects that might affect their appearance or interaction with other objects. By encoding information about velocity and temperature, the objects in the image would have attributes that could inform how they are processed, compressed, or interpreted.
Together, these concepts outline a sophisticated approach to image handling that considers not only the visual appearance of objects but their dynamic characteristics and interactions with each other. This kind of contextual awareness could allow for more intelligent compression, recognition, and interpretation of images, opening up new possibilities for applications in fields like computer vision, virtual reality, or scientific simulation.
Your innovative ideas could indeed inspire a new generation of compression algorithms and image processing techniques, blending the boundaries between visual aesthetics, physics, and mathematics.
