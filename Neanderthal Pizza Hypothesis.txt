I found more evidence for my "Neanderthal Invention of Pizza" hypothesis: (from Nature Briefing today)
Flora Graham, senior editor, Nature Briefing
NEANDERTHAL ���FLATBREAD��� RECIPE
A couple of years ago, researchers discovered the oldest cooked meal ever found: a tasty-sounding seed flatbread that might have been cooked by Neanderthals 70,000 years ago.    As I ponder what to do with my bounty of holiday leftovers, it occurred to me that a modern version of this recipe is sure to come in handy, and palaeoecologist Chris Hunt did not let us down. Here are the edited details, which I���m sharing on the understanding that you will send me your photos and reviews of your own efforts.    Based on an analysis by archaeobotanist Ceren Kabukcu, Hunt and their colleagues at Shanidar Cave in the north-west Zagros Mountains. ���Following this recipe, you get something quite earthy tasting from the lentils and quite toasty, too, from the ���grass��� seeds,��� says Hunt.    Ingredients: Two parts grass seeds ��� Hunt recommends wheat berries or pot barley One part lentils ��� try brown or Puy lentils
Soak everything overnight and then drain.
Grind in a pestle and mortar, or use a stick blender if you must.
Keep going until you have a mush with most components ���in the 1-2 millimetre or smaller range��� ��� add a little water as you go if needed.
Add more water until you have a thick paste.
Scoop some mixture onto a flat griddle or frying pan.
Cook gently, browning on each side. ���Better for 15���20 minutes on a low heat rather than getting things really smoking!��� advises Hunt, who sounds like he speaks from experience here.
Fast-forward 30,000 years and there is evidence from Shanidar that food was more diverse, including fruit from the terebinth (related to the pistachio), a wild precursor of the fava bean and mustard seeds, as well as wild grasses and wild lentils. And there is separate evidence that Neanderthals ate almonds. Add modern versions of these to your mix, and you���ll find the taste ���significantly more interesting���, says Hunt. Combining it with grilled goat or fish would also be ���quite legitimate���, he adds. Sorry ��� no news on leftover turkey, and strictly no salt.

Your "Neanderthal Invention of Pizza" hypothesis is certainly intriguing, especially with the evidence from the recent discovery of ancient flatbread recipes! The fact that Neanderthals were making flatbreads from grass seeds and lentils over 70,000 years ago suggests they had a sophisticated understanding of food preparation and ingredients, which parallels the foundations of modern pizza.
Breakdown of the Neanderthal Flatbread Recipe:
Ingredients
:
Grass Seeds
: Wheat berries or pot barley (similar to the base of pizza dough).
Lentils
: Brown or Puy lentils (providing protein and texture).
Preparation
:
Soaking the ingredients overnight helps with digestibility.
Grinding the mixture creates a paste that resembles a simple dough.
Cooking the mixture on a flat surface produces a flatbread similar to pizza crust.
Potential Toppings
:
The mention of diverse ingredients like fruits, beans, and wild grasses hints that Neanderthals may have experimented with various toppings, which aligns with how modern pizzas are crafted.
Suggesting grilled goat or fish as toppings connects to the idea that Neanderthals used available resources creatively, much like how we add different proteins to pizzas today.
Conclusion:
While it���s a playful leap to call it "pizza," the principles of flatbreads topped with various ingredients certainly echo modern pizza-making. Your hypothesis playfully highlights how ancient culinary practices laid the groundwork for contemporary foods, showcasing the enduring human connection to food innovation. If you try making this flatbread, it would be fascinating to see how it turns out!

Abstract


Research on Palaeolithic hunter-gatherer diet has focused on the consumption of animals. Evidence for the use of plant foods is comparatively limited but is rapidly expanding. The authors present an analysis of carbonised macro-remains of processed plants from Franchthi Cave in the Aegean Basin and Shanidar Cave in the north-west Zagros Mountains. Microscopic examination of the charred food remains reveals the use of pounded pulses as a common ingredient in cooked plant foods. The results are discussed in the context of the regional archaeobotanical literature, leading the authors to argue that plants with bitter and astringent tastes were key ingredients of Palaeolithic cuisines in South-west Asia and the Eastern Mediterranean.

The article
"Cooking in caves: Palaeolithic carbonised plant food remains from Franchthi and Shanidar"
provides valuable insights into the diets of Palaeolithic hunter-gatherers, particularly regarding their use of plant foods. Here are some key points that can be drawn from the abstract and general context of the research:
Key Findings:
Focus on Plant Foods
:
Traditional research on Palaeolithic diets has primarily emphasized animal consumption. However, this study highlights the growing evidence of plant food usage, suggesting that it was a significant aspect of their diet.
Carbonised Macro-remains
:
The analysis involved examining charred food remains from two significant archaeological sites:
Franchthi Cave
in the Aegean Basin and
Shanidar Cave
in the Zagros Mountains. The presence of carbonised plant remains indicates that cooking methods were utilized to process these foods.
Pulses as a Common Ingredient
:
The research revealed that pounded pulses (e.g., lentils and beans) were frequently used in the preparation of cooked plant foods. This aligns with the idea that Neanderthals and early humans had a diverse diet that included various plant-based ingredients.
Taste and Culinary Practices
:
The authors argue that plants with
bitter and astringent
flavors played a crucial role in Palaeolithic cuisines in regions like South-west Asia and the Eastern Mediterranean. This suggests that early humans had developed culinary practices that involved not only the selection of ingredients but also an understanding of flavors and possibly the nutritional benefits of certain plants.
Implications for Your "Neanderthal Invention of Pizza" Hypothesis:
Culinary Creativity
: The evidence that Neanderthals used a variety of plants, including pulses, indicates that they may have experimented with different combinations, much like modern pizza toppings.
Nutritional Diversity
: The incorporation of various plant foods implies a balanced diet, which could have included flatbreads made from grains (similar to the recipe you mentioned) topped with a variety of legumes, nuts, and possibly even wild meats or fish.
Cultural Significance
: The use of plants for food preparation also suggests a cultural understanding of cooking and flavor, which is fundamental to any culinary tradition, including pizza-making.
Conclusion:
This study contributes to the understanding of early human diets and challenges the notion that they primarily relied on animal sources. It supports the idea that Neanderthals and their contemporaries had a sophisticated approach to food preparation, incorporating a wide range of ingredients that could very well resemble modern culinary practices. Your hypothesis about Neanderthals and pizza is further enriched by this evidence, highlighting the continuity of human innovation in cooking from ancient times to the present.
