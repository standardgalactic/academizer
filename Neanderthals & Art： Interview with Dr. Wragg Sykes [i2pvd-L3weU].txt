Hey everyone, how's it going? Steph in here. Whether Neanderthals made art or not is one of the most
controversial but interesting aspects of modern research for sure.
Luckily for me and you, Dr.
Ragh Sykes, a
paleolithic archaeologist, Neanderthal, expert, author, and all-round good egg for hopping onto my channel,
agreed to talk through some of these issues, from the controversy to the evidence and how it affects our
perspective of Neanderthals and our relationship to them.
Super interesting, really changed how I view Neanderthals, so sit back, relax, make yourself a cup of tea.
I'm sure you will enjoy what she has to say. Thank you so much for joining me on here and
sharing your knowledge with my viewers. I know we all really appreciate it.
Oh, you're welcome, it's always nice to talk about something that you're passionate about.
Exactly, yeah, and we're all definitely passionate about Neanderthals here on my channel.
So, can I start by asking how
controversial is the idea of Neanderthal symbolism and art in the
wider academic community, and is it still very controversial or is it gaining acceptance?
I think it's safe to say it's the
key area where there are still large disputes.
Since really the past 10 years or just under 10 years, since we had
the ancient genetic evidence that has
laid out that there were deep connections between our population and Neanderthals,
so when I say our population, I mean Homo sapiens, living people, the majority of living people
have a small percentage of Neanderthal ancestry.
That didn't used to be believed to be the case. The dominant
theory in human origins was based on a lot of different evidence, including the mitochondrial
DNA, which suggested that there wasn't any ancestry in us, but it took the nuclear DNA
which arrived in 2010 to show that that wasn't the case, and they are part of our direct Hominin
ancestry. Until that point, that was one of the big issues of debate. Now that has been pretty much
laid to rest. We can't argue about that. The issue of symbolism, cognition, parallels in behavior
has really remained debated over and quite contentious in some aspects, definitely.
So what are the points of contention mainly revolving around the dating of the sites?
Is that the issue and whether they are sort of accurately dated enough to
predate Homo sapiens in Europe? Is that where the controversy still lies?
No, not really, I'd say. The real controversy, I suppose, is what one
regards as evidence of particular levels of behavioral sophistication in terms of,
if you want to talk about technological complexity, but in terms of symbolic thought,
sort of abstract thought, the ability to displace yourself in time and space and imagine other
things and play in your imagination, so play with categories of ideas and things like that.
That does still raise issues in that one scholar might see a kind of evidence, say a site with
red pigment, and interpret that in a particular way that would support symbolic behavior,
whereas another scholar might see the same evidence and see it quite differently.
Nobody would be able to have an argument that could be supported these days where you could say
that there's drastic differences in the actual archaeology, with the exception of a couple of
factors that I can go into more detail about. But in terms of comparing Neanderthals to
contemporary Homo sapiens, so when I'm talking about contemporary I'm talking
older than 40,000 years, so that would be Homo sapiens from mostly the Middle Stone Age in Africa
pre-40,000, although that has begun to change. But generally the evidence that we used to regard
as quite sort of striking and not shared with Neanderthals, so things like shells or pigments,
bone tools, those borders between early Homo sapiens and Neanderthals have really become
fuzzy in terms of the actual evidence that we now have, so the remaining argument is about what
those things mean, and that's really where you kind of have to go off into
understanding other fields like neuroscience or sort of art theory and things like this, so it does
become sort of bedded somewhat into particular scholars who may have long-standing theories
that look very different with the evidence we have now compared to what they might have looked
like 20 years ago, so that's kind of where the controversy still exists.
Okay, that's interesting, that's not where I thought it would be. I thought the debate would
be more that the presence of symbolism wasn't up for debate, it was about whether it could be
accurately dated to a Neanderthal time period, so that's where-
Well, it's kind of both, I mean if you want to take, if we take pigment, so pigment, so I mean
like minerals that produce colour, so that could be red ochre which will be like iron,
is produced in the colour there, and there's variations on that, you can have yellowy ones
or orange ones or very red ones, or you could have black pigment which could be charcoal,
but you can also have mineral pigments and manganese pigments often, but there are others,
so the reason people get so excited about pigment obviously is because the use of colour
is a foundational thing that most people understand is a, you know, the visual basis of art,
visual art is other kinds of art obviously, so if we have a prehistory going way back where people
are collecting minerals, processing them into powders, the question then is why, and because
we are coming from a position of hindsight, we're looking back with the wonders of the upper
Paleolithic painted caves in our eyes, and we're trying to see the origin of that, looking for the
use of pigment in the absence of any art, it seems obvious as a place to begin trying to understand
whether there was a sort of a nascent symbolic understanding purely through the use of colour,
the problem is that you can potentially use minerals like ochre for other things, so
in the history of sort of where we see pigment and when, it's quite different now as I say,
then it was a few decades ago, everybody was looking to see the earliest painted caves and
things like that, and that remains now, it's still about 40,000, 39, 40, that's the earliest dates that
we have for any kind of painting on a wall, the big change is that what was the really early sites
which were chauvet in Europe, or some potential early pieces of stone in Africa that had some
figurative designs in black on that may have come off a wall, they weren't so well dated,
but they could have been about 40, but that's not quite so sure, so it was like Africa and
Europe which seemed to make sense if you were coming from a traditional understanding that
Homo sapiens evolved in Africa and then moved out of Africa, so that made sense, but the big
change there is that we now have painted caves dated to exactly the same time, 40,000 in East
Asia, Southeast Asia, so that has changed, but that still gives what we currently have, there
is still like a border there that we don't find any painted caves earlier than that, and those are
all as far as we can tell associated with Homo sapiens, so in terms of what we have for Neanderthals,
the age of what we have for Neanderthals is not really an issue because we have very old
use of pigment in Europe between 250 to 200,000, and that's interesting because it's not just sort
of a lump of red stuff from a cave, it's actually an open air site where analysis of the sediments
pulled out very tiny, basically splashes of what must have been a liquid red ochre essentially,
so that immediately sort of doesn't really fit in with the use of dry powders for something,
it still doesn't mean that that has to be related to any kind of painting in the sense of what we
would be thinking of with Upper Paleolithic paintings, but are Neanderthals processing
pigment into liquids during a time when we have absolutely no evidence, there's Homo sapiens
around, yes, there's no question that that was going on very, very early, but yeah, the question
then is, well, all these pigments that we find, is there any evidence that would push it towards
being something that is non-functional? Can I ask what are the sort of alternate uses of the pigment,
if they weren't using it for art, what else could they have possibly been doing with it?
You can use pigments for any range of stuff, I mean, it's once you start to kind of get your head
colour or just pigment doesn't have to be about art and you actually look at ethnographic literature,
there is a lot of different things, so you might use ochres for halting, so they use when you want
to stick a stone tool to a wooden or some other kind of handle and you need to make an adhesive,
we know Neanderthals, we're doing that in actually quite varied ways now, we have multiple different
materials, they use bitumen, natural bitumen, they use birch tar and they used pine tar mixed
quite amazingly with beeswax, that's a very recent find, just this year that came out,
that still blows my mind actually, I haven't quite worked out what to think about that,
but in ethnographic context and in the early homo sapiens sites in South Africa,
people were using hematite or other minerals in the adhesive stuff that they had which was
plant-based but different to what Neanderthals were using because it improves basically the
material qualities, so that's been an argument that maybe it was to do with halting, we have never
found any traces of minerals being used by Neanderthals in halting, so that's possible, maybe not,
but people use minerals traditionally on their bodies for protection from the sun,
it doesn't have to be something that's to do with aesthetics, it can just be to do with skincare.
That sort of never even crossed my mind before, I'd have used this for something like that.
Yeah, you could be putting it on you for camouflage purposes, we're assuming that
based on biological and thermoregulation principles, a lot of the time when it was
in the cooler periods, in the glacial periods, Neanderthals had to have been wearing some kind
of reasonably tailored clothes, so we're not talking about fur slapping around in the icy winds,
that wouldn't have cut it, but during the warmer periods because they did live in interglacial,
in times warmer than today even, or rather where we are heading, they wouldn't have needed those
clothes, and it was quite hot during some time, so potentially if they had fairer skin, which we
believe that they did, some of them did, not all of them, some had darker skin, then some kind of
covering of the skin using mineral pigments, that might make sense too, and also you can use one
of the big things that we know that they spent a lot of their time doing, was processing animal
skins, and again that could be closed, but there's so many other things you can use skins for,
including bags, you know, you had to carry their stuff around somehow, and then you know,
hide wraps for babies, could be the original reason why you would begin to process skins, but
anyway, using mineral pigments as an aid to processing animal skins is another real possibility,
so there are actually a lot of different angles that you might think of as to why
powdered or liquid minerals could be in a Neanderthal site, so what you want really
is a context where the pigments are associated with something that doesn't have any obvious
functional use. Something really unambiguous. Well yeah, I mean that's the caveat there is that
Western philosophical traditions like to separate things into binaries, nature, culture,
art, practical, you know, everyday stuff, that's not how all cultures think, so it's perfectly
possible for something to be massively symbolic and aesthetic and art, and also just be something
that you use every day and it's vital to your survival, so bearing that in mind that something
can be both, we still as archaeologists want to have a situation where it's very difficult to say that
pigment associated with something else is actually, you know, just something that they were
using and there isn't some other explanation, so that's what we need for Neanderthals,
and now there are sort of more cases of that than there used to be.
So let me ask you this then whilst we're on it, what are some of the more clear-cut examples of
Neanderthal symbolism, or at least some of the most promising ones that we have?
Okay, well if I stick with the pigment, because actually pigment sort of doesn't sound very
exciting, but it has been one of the areas where we've just slowly amassed a lot of different
cases where we have this sort of setting where it's very difficult to see a practical purpose, so
one of these is in a site in Belgium, there is some black pigment, black pigment has been argued
potentially in other sites where it's from manganese, people have done some really cool
experimental work recently that's shown that actually manganese can be a useful accelerant
when you're starting fires, it can basically like reduce the heat, the point at which the fire will
spark and it just makes your fire lighting easier, so black pigment itself does have a
practical purpose, but in this site in Belgium they have small pieces of a silt stone basically
that leaves nice marks when it's rubbed and it looks like in terms of the size of the piece,
everything they could have been used, they actually washed them before they realised that
they were important, that the archaeologist so they can't see traces on it, but it's interesting,
so that's one case that there is a black pigment with no possible practical use that we can see,
but that's not sort of that impressive, there are other sites where you get pigment on weird
things, so one of those is pigment being associated with stalagmites in Romania,
in the Carpathians, I think it's in Romania yeah, and there's a connection between a very weird
geological object that was found, it's basically it's a geode, it's sort of about the size of a
ball that would fit in your hand, it's very very heavy, like you would know if you picked up it's
just odd you know like it, it doesn't feel like a normal rock because it's just naturally heavy
and it's very very dense and the researchers found this when they were digging the site and
they scanned it and they found it was a geode, but what they noticed was that there were remnants of
colour on the surface, it had a crust, a carbonate crust that had formed over it and when they removed
parts of that they could see that there was pigment and it was red ochre and that was actually
overlaid by some sort of black as well which they couldn't identify what that was, so this is a very
odd geological object that would fit into a long tradition we see in Neanderthals and in other
hominins where they seem to be attracted to odd things, so sort of rocks and basically it's usually
rocks but fossils as well that cannot have come from the sites that they are found in, they had to
have been brought in, there's no you know like it wasn't a flood or anything like that, they had to
have been brought in, there's no clear explanation for why they would bring those in and generally
people just refer to them as curiosities, this object would fit into that, I think it could
have come from the local geology but the fact it has pigment on it, that's two strange things,
there's this odd geological object and then you've got the pigment associated with it, so that's kind
of like interesting but in the same cave from a different layer they were also found some small
sections of stalagmites, so stalagmites are the ones that come up from the ground and if you get
quite thick ones and you chop them in half or if they're still forming you can get like little
bowls basically, natural bowls that you can sort of grind a little bit if you need to but some of
those and there are eight of them I think that they found so far and some of those only on the
insides of the little bowl area there's more of black and red residues, so it's a different layer,
it's a later layer but it's just very interesting that at this site you have pigments that's not
naturally you know forming within the geology of the site that pigment couldn't have got on there
by accident basically and that's on two different strange things in that site and so that's an
interesting case but if it was alone you'd be like okay strange but it would be an anomaly
but it's not, there are other cases in various sites where we see pigment associated with shells
and shells where, do we presume that they were sort of used as mixing bowls or something like
that? No, no, well we don't know I mean in some cases it might be, generally it doesn't look like
these are shells that are sort of food waste, in some cases it's possible but in others it really
doesn't look like that. There's two nice examples, one or there's this couple of sites from Spain
one of them has pigment mixes basically like recipes where there's different kinds of pigment,
different colors, reds and oranges and yellows but they also have what is some kind of black
carbon in it which might be charcoal or bone but also pyrite which is sparkly as fools gold
if you grind that up that's going to have quite a striking aesthetic quality if you mix it with
other powders and these are associated with shells in in one particular site so there were a lot of
headlines when that came out like oh Neanderthals had makeup or they had shell jewelry, we cannot
say that but there was a a mix of minerals that would have been visually striking on shells,
some of these were probably collected for food but other ones may not have been so that's interesting
again if it was just one site with shells and pigment okay fine but it's not there is
another really cool site which for me is is a bit of a clincher really, this is an Italian site
called Grotta Formane and in this well it's an amazing site anyway it has just vast amounts of
cool evidence for many different kinds of behavior from a layer that's somewhere between about 47
and 45,000 years, just for the record sorry in case the people listening aren't aware what's
sort of the rough time for Homo sapiens entering Europe just so we can have that in the back of
our minds. At the moment well the the fossil evidence for early Homo sapiens is really minimal
but in terms of the combination of their archaeological signature what we would believe
to be their archaeological signature and any fossils there's no nobody in southern Europe
pre 41,000 okay similarly in northern Europe there may be in eastern Europe it looks like
sort of there at the fringes more like 44 45 maybe maybe not that early or it's difficult to tell
because there are a lot of I mean we'll have to get on to this later in terms of what
transitional industries are but generally we would be assuming on the fossil evidence that
there was no Homo sapiens in western Europe until 41 at the earliest more like 40 okay
so anything earlier than 40,000 if you're talking 45 plus I think most people would accept that
just on a date but also in in Firmani this is in a layer which is absolutely unarguably
classic Neanderthal artefacts there would be no question about that so this object is only one
of them it's a tiny fossil shell so it's a shell but more interestingly it's a fossil so it's nothing
to do with food and that fossil came from deposits and outcrops roughly 100 kilometers away so this
was not that arrived by accident and microscopic very careful analysis found that there is red
mineral pigment in tiny tiny little natural pits on the outside of this shell and if you zoom it
right in you can see it it's only on the outside of the shell and sort of the little lip of the
hole something that makes it sort of more exciting but I don't think it even needs it to be a good
evidence of symbolism is that this shell may also have once been threaded onto something because
there is some very sort of distinctive abrasion marks that appear to be sort of linear as if
they were rubbed in the same direction on the on the lip of the shell just the tiny microscopes you
have to use like very high magnification to see it but potentially it means that that shell had
some kind of thread or something going through it and out through through a hole in the side
wow but even without that you have a fossil which has nothing to do with food it came from a very
long distance and it has pigment on it those three things if that was in a homo sapiens site
you wouldn't look twice you'd just be like yeah okay that is something symbolic
so yeah I mean you can't carry something for 100 kilometers by accident well and that's
that's the crow flies as well you know I mean in terms of how how many days that object was held
on to for you know it's interesting we can't tell but given that Neanderthals were
all of our evidence says that they were highly mobile they moved around a lot they don't seem to
stayed anywhere particularly long the stuff that they carried was meaningful to them whether it was
vital for survival or something else but they were they would have been very choosy about what
they chose to carry because they had to carry everything they had no no transport no you know
dogs or whatever to to help carry the load so it was all on their own backs so even if you're
talking about a tiny shell that's still something that's got to be packed and carried with you so
there's a choice happening there I can still think of a practical use in a sense if you I mean like
potentially shells if they were all strung together could have rattled and maybe that was
some kind of thing to do with hunting but I can't really believe that I think this site this shell
from Fomani is really strong evidence for me and because you then look out from that site all the
rest of the sites where we have pigment and there's pigments where they've clearly been rubbed on
things some pigments have got strange sort of little lines engraved on them there's the associations
of shell at other sites there's this strange geodes you know once you start to see the whole
picture that we have now it really starts to look as if something is going on doesn't mean everything
is symbolic you know every site but once you kind of have this accumulation of stuff it becomes
difficult to say well we have nothing we do have a record that is broadly I would say equivalent to
what we have for early homo sapiens in in the African contexts and there is shells there there's
pigment there's a there's a much sort of more impressive little pigment processing kit from a
South African site an early South African site so that's like about I think 80,000 where they
have a shell and there's pigment inside it and things like this and it's just like it was all
found together and so that's kind of you know that's like the whole package they've got there
but in terms of if those objects have been found distributed through the cave it's not that different
and there's no painted art at all in South Africa so we have to sort of think well what were they
using their pigment for some aesthetic things and some practical things in as we can see in the
halting so there's no reason why Neanderthals couldn't have been doing both things in different
sites in different places yeah that's fascinating that's why the pigment is really a good example
because the overall amount of stuff we now have means that we have to look at the individual
sites differently I think yeah I mean I'm totally it has just talking to you now totally changed how
I view Neanderthals in my mind I mean I know I shouldn't get carried away like the newspapers
always do with imagining them in sparkly makeup but well I don't know I mean color and visual
appearance it's a really basic thing for mammals you know and chimpanzees in in the world you know
they're always brought up being our closest primate relative they don't really do anything
like that in the wild but if you give them in a captive setting if you give them paint they go for
it yeah they are aesthetically stimulated by painting and that's kind of an interesting
angle to look at things really because the other thing that has kind of been getting
people excited about Neanderthals is engravings and sort of interactions about sort of you know
cutting into materials rather than covering them with with a substance as you would be doing with
pigment sorry I was just going to say when I was researching the videos that I did on the Neanderthals
one of the examples where I said people were debating and I think it was is it Gorham's Cave
yeah where there's sort of like a hash mark on the rock yeah yeah Gorham's I mean
different I think different people are still of different opinions about that um oops sorry that
was my cat that's okay yeah I mean in terms of the context of that marking the the hashtag as
yeah it was called in the headlines that is under a load of archaeology basically so it has to be
pretty old and old enough to to be Neanderthal and it's covered by layers that look as if they
are Neanderthal archaeology and the question of well is the experimental archaeology that's
been done to claim that that was created intentionally it wasn't like a bear or something
um I think for me I I I would buy that as a as an intentionally created form partly because
there is a lot of evidence from other sites that they were interested in not only in sort of
engraving but just in material properties of things so and this is the other thing that you
kind of have to have in mind when you're talking about aesthetics or art or engraving is that Neanderthals
were like they were incredibly picky about what they ate and the materials they used for their
practical tools so they were really careful generally to to choose the best rocks for whatever
they task they were doing they would carry the higher quality rocks um as tools for further they
would reach up and most preferentially they would only transport the bits of animals from kill sites
that had the highest fat or marrow content and you know those patterns are repeated everywhere
and then if they're making bone tools tools from bone they're really picky about the species or the
actual part of the skeleton that they use so they're like they're like gourmetes for materials you
know they they know what they want very much so they're aware of of the physical properties of
things so that I think is interesting in that we we see across a number of sites not only this
interesting pigments but of sort of cutting into bones and there's a lot of engravings on bones
that people have debated for a long time some of those have really not held up they're just natural
but other ones when they're examined with modern technologies modern microscopic analysis you can
see that they're not they're not some sort of natural scratches and numerous cases have now
emerged from sites that are in good context you know they're not old and random stuff where you have
parallel markings and it seems to be that there is in some cases a concern to create series of
markings very careful they're not sort of graphic designs in the way that the Gibraltar thing
seems to have a graphic character to it and with having you know lines that intersect each other
they're just single lines they either sort of have an an origin point that they all come out from
it kind of looks like a fan shape or they have these small sort of cuts that seem to be they're
parallel and some really cool analysis has been done and basically like looking at whether you
can argue that they're trying to keep the gaps between them consistent and on some pieces that
does seem to be true so that at its basic level that's an aesthetic activity you're trying to
create a visual effect whatever the meaning of that is is uncertain but you have that in
many sites it's on animal bones sometimes it's on animal bones from species that are not particularly
interesting other cases it's from species that are a little bit less common like bears or birds
and in one case there's a Neanderthal skull that seems to have some of these markings on
they're very small but they don't really fit into into butchery because this is from a site where
they appear to have been butchering the dead as well which is a whole other topic but the interesting
thing about engravings is it's it's an interaction with the material and you get lines in some sites
not hardly any of the pigment sites but they are still there where there's pigment seems to have
lines on that doesn't really necessarily fit in with trying to get powder off these lumps of pigment
so there's a overlap between two different things that we would otherwise if it wasn't the Neanderthals
we would say that's potentially symbolic and it's overlapping between those two different
sort of aesthetic realms if you want to call it that and that really I think because we're
getting so many different signals for behavior that doesn't really fit anything obviously practical
it all starts to build up and in terms of comparing it to early homo sapiens in some cases Neanderthals
have got more depending on what sort of one you what area you look at that's incredible I love that's
totally uh that sounds very convincing to me for that like you said it's a if it was found in a
homo sapiens site it wouldn't it's symbolic nature perhaps wouldn't be questioned only
and in Neanderthals ones it is important to remember as well that we talk about the Neanderthals
as if they're sort of a monolithic thing and they definitely wouldn't have been and they lived across
a massive geographical range you know from Uzbekistan to Wales
into the Altar Mountain that would make a good show Uzbekistan to Wales Neanderthals story
yeah you know it's it's it's a huge huge range of landscapes of environments of animals you know
like what they ate in in Palestine compared to Germany would have you know probably surprised each
other you know very different so we we shouldn't expect everything to look the same everywhere
we should expect that what Neanderthals were doing in one place would not have made sense to what
other ones did somewhere else and it's the same thing we you know we wouldn't expect necessarily
that to be the case for early homo sapiens and also there's the question of
change through time as well it has been a trope for Neanderthals for a long time in
sort of human origins textbooks that it's always claimed oh the middle Paleolithic so that's their
their culture their broad culture basically did nothing and didn't evolve at all for the
entire time that they were around from about 400 350 000 until 40 000 and that's that's totally
changed nobody I think who who who knows the the stone tools would argue that there was massive
change over time in terms of sort of little flowerings of what was going on in particular
regions there were there were technological traditions that were very long lived but it
wasn't just sort of one thing happening the entire time it was really varied and so we should expect
that other things aesthetic traditions symbolic activities would have been changing over time
as well as across space and I was actually going to say one of the other really intriguing sites
that probably well I know it has because I asked colleagues to tell me what they thought the most
sort of jaw-dropping recent thing was and basically everybody came out with the same site
which is a French site called Bruniquel in southwest France that doesn't have pigment
but it does have a stalagmite again and this is a site people can find it online because there's
lots of there's lots of images of it basically it's very deep cave 300 meters or so deep into this hill
and there's a chamber where people cavers had found these bizarre large sort of rings of broken
pieces of stalagmite and it was dated radiocommodated it came out as older than 40 000 so people
like oh okay well that's interesting but if you date really old stuff with radiocarbon it's
basically gives you infinite dates and it could be anything so when that was reexamined that came
out to be about 174 000 years old oh wow really yeah it's it's super interesting that site because
it's kind of described as just arranged rings of stalagmites and then like with these little
piles in the middle but it's a lot more than that it's a built structure albeit on a small
level so it's not like a big built wall but in micro scale it is a built wall because
they don't they haven't just kind of like shoved them together there are parts in these rings where
they've got like two or three things balanced on top of each other like verticals and then a flat
one and then other ones on top of that and all there's like several long ones all lined up together
leaning against the wall that is an absolute sort of miniature megalithic structure if you
want to call it that it's it's not just kind of like something there's not bears didn't do it
megalithic structure exactly yeah I mean we don't we don't have the language for this it's it's
interesting you know questions to what we actually call it but there's sort of burning as well and
in amongst this the the stalagmites some of them were really heavily burned and there seems to be
like halves that were built along the or in I don't know it's really hard it's so hard to know what's
going on that site was very recently found and a couple of years ago it were not found but published
an analysis is still ongoing there is a a flowstone floor that this is basically on so we we can't see
the surface of the of the cave floor because it's covered by the natural flowstone that came over
afterwards that's also incidentally how some of this was dated because there was flowstone that was
over these rings later in time so we the dating is very good for this site but nobody really would
be living in that cave because it's 300 meters in you would have terrible smoke if you try to
illuminate it not to mention sort of having to continually bring fuel in to have light do anything
so there's no way this is a site that they were living in so and then if you add up
it just goes to show the extraordinary amount of effort they must have had to put into
yeah you can do like you can do a back of the envelope calculation on on how long it would
have taken to make that and even if you sort of assume several of them doing it's about two
tons is the amount of stuff that is arranged it would be at least six or seven hours you know
that's that's my little basic calculation they must have been under their like hours hours maybe
even days doing this we have no clue why so that that's not pigment it's not paintings on the wall
it's not carving but that is something I I don't even if I call that aesthetic because
the it's a little bit you know like the the arrangements of stones in in South America
you can only see the visual effect from above but but the arrangement is not necessarily the
visual side of it is not the important thing necessarily the creation of it itself could
have been the thing that was meaningful and this is where I want to come back to the engravings
because for some of those we might be focusing too much from a cultural position which values
final visual effects of things like paintings whereas actually that's not necessarily the thing
that may have had the meaning it may have been the actual creative act itself could have had
a meaning or an importance to the person doing it or people watching or whatever and so I think
really we need to open up how our own expectations of what symbolic behaviour might actually look
like or feel like um or sound like you know anything and so that's kind of where we are
with Neanderthals for me that there is an abundance of archaeology that we have now it's just
bringing together what that means in terms of their minds is the really really difficult thing
that's incredible so so let me ask you this we have all this evidence of symbolic behaviour
does this affect how we view the demise of the Neanderthals in any way and
and perhaps transitional stone industries or our relationship with them how how does this
affect our view of that well I guess there's there's two aspects to that one is the transitional
industries which we don't really have time to talk about they are actually I would say even more
contentious than the issue of symbolism and the question of who made what is still very much
very much argued over and that would be something that would cause the biggest you know shouting
matches or that doesn't happen um if people were going to get into big debates at conferences it
would be that um because the problem with those what they are basically is at the very end of
the time that we see Neanderthals the very youngest fossils seem to be followed by stone tool cultures
that appear to be presaging that upper paleolithic so they're very blady well lots of blades generally
that's the main thing and they also have objects associated with them that we don't really see
in the Neanderthals so Neanderthals might have engraved bone put lines on them and things but
they we haven't seen any like carved forms that are obviously not just changing the shape of your
bone tool you know there's there's no sort of pendants or anything whereas in the French case
the Chateauperonian there are apparently pierced teeth um other carved bone things ivory um so that's
just one of them so there's multiple of these weird what people call transitional because
the assumption became that this was some kind of transition between Neanderthals and the incoming
modern what I say homo sapiens we shouldn't really say modern human because it's a terrible term
that's slipped out um but yeah the question is those layers are often quite thin they're covering a
very short period of time so dating them is difficult and in the sites where it appears
that there may be Neanderthal material as in fossil material with them bones or teeth they
don't have the best contexts there is either uncertainty as to whether those layers are
we're actually in the original position or whether there's been erosion and for example some of the
most quoted sites nobody's ever done full refitting so that's where you get all your stuff out across
different layers and you check to see if anything is broken that is between two different layers if
that is the case that that was one object that has now is now in two layers that tells you that
that material has moved and that those layers are not 100 reliable you know you can't be sure
whether the pendant that is in that layer really was in that layer so the sites where which have
most of the very impressive stuff that also seems to have Neanderthal fossils
also remain to be proven to be completely well we can't ever say completely but
very confidently undisturbed basically so that's the problem with the transitional industries
especially the classical ones in France and elsewhere so I would say for me I don't think
there's great evidence that Neanderthals made those whereas other people would argue the opposite
but for me I like to be very cautious and I would like to see them all have refitting studies and
I'd like to only look at sites where we have very solid dating and then old sites dug a long time
we go things like that so if you remove all of those it doesn't leave a lot of great evidence
that Neanderthals made that stuff so if we say okay we're not going to talk about the transitional
industries if we're only going to talk about what we know which is that there certainly was some
late interbreeding between Neanderthals and Homo sapiens looks like there was a lot of
stuff going on much earlier but we know there was some some late interbreeding because there is a
modern human jaw from Eastern Europe that dates to about 39 000 and that individuals had any
ancestor somewhere between four I think to six or seven generations before so that is very very
close in time to when that interbreeding happened whether that was in Eastern Europe or not you
know how much space could a group move over six or seven generations probably quite a lot but it's
still the point is still there that we know that there was definitely interbreeding going on
at a late period in time when we therefore have a big history of Neanderthals having aesthetic
interesting things that they were doing whether it's with pigments or whatever the question there
for me is what does that mean in terms of their symbolic capacity well it just adds to the reasons
why we would want to make babies with each other that I don't I don't really buy the explanation
that everything was some sort of territorial argument with you know forced intercourse between
you know groups that got I don't know cut off I mean you can look at chimpanzee cases they sometimes
do that but it's very rare as I understand it I'm not DNA specialist at all and but as I understand
the amount of material genetic material that is in living people is high enough that these can't
have been sort of one-off encounters like a handful of them over 50 60 100 000 years there's multiple
phases of when it happened but we're probably looking at contexts where interactions were
happening in reasonable numbers can't put a case on that but but it wasn't an isolated incident
no I don't think so and if that's the case then you you have to talk about you know who is raising
the babies and then you start you stop talking about sort of like physical encounters and you
say well a baby that is brought into a group whether it was going into a Neanderthal group
or to a homo sapiens group or whether they merged groups we have no idea if that was happening
there had to have been enough of a comparable I guess broad cultural worldview that that those
children would not sort of you know just be be left or or abandoned or sort of grow up unable
to function and you know they had to hybrids had to be able to function in whichever societies
they were brought up in and therefore there had to have been there couldn't have been a massive
gulf is what I'm trying to say yeah even if there were groups with different traditions or different
aesthetic or symbolic understandings I think there had to have been some common ground in terms of
there being more than simply they were hunting you know they could recognise that they were both
hunters or something like that and you know that they were peoples that hunted and that would be a
common ground I think there probably was something beyond that that would explain why and you would
have so many hybridisations that were successful basically and you know that those hybrids then
went on to have their own children and stuff otherwise we wouldn't have that material in us
today they must have been able to fit in with their society for people to
want to reproduce with them and continue having families with them exactly there had to be a
level of communication there had to have been yeah all those things so that's not necessarily I don't
want to say they were the same because I don't think there there are clear differences still
in in the record I mean I think the way that homo sapiens were living I think they were probably
hunting differently I think they were organising themselves in the landscape differently I think
they they probably were had more extensive social networks I think that's pretty
well supported and the the the key difference by 40 000 is that as I said that's when you have
the early estates for cave art that's representational images animals basically
and hand prints there is very new research that suggests that there may be a hand print
one hand print in Spain that's much old and that's sort of maybe 50 000 but at the moment that's
those sites for me I I'd like to see a more extensive analysis of the of the caves where
those are and to see if there's more of those and of hand prints with the same similar ages
before I want to sort of be sure about what those actually are but in terms of what we
accept as was there anybody around that was homo sapiens in Europe where these
paintings on on walls and this potential hand it's not a print actually it's a negative it's
it's probably had the pigment blown around and they take your hand away yeah those those could
be Neanderthal stuff or they could be odd little very brief incursions of homo sapiens
and that is possible because there is also a transitional industry before the transitional
industries if you want to call it that in France in southern France southeast France
and called the Neuronian which has some aspects that look similar to what Neanderthals do but
also not some of the stone tool technology there is is comparable to what Neanderthals do but it's
much smaller and it has very definite similarities to the earliest transitional industries in
eastern Europe which are only about five to ten thousand years younger which okay I'm saying only
five to ten thousand years younger but that's that's how we talk when we talk about the Palithic
yeah that's a short time yeah that that that stands out that's a strange thing the Neuronian
so I think basically the red lines that we used to have that everything what I was saying earlier
everything before forty thousand oh we can be sure it's Neanderthal in some cases it is a little bit
uncertain um but certainly Neanderthals were still around until forty thousand but there may be
brief movements of people into Europe um before that that didn't go anywhere because that's also
something we should remember that wasn't just Neanderthals that went extinct although technically
they're not extinct because their material are still in us and John Hawkes who I guess some of
your listeners might know his website he's had a great calculation he did was like there's there's
more genetic material in living people now than ever walked around you know in the Pleistocene
in terms of what's around now so they they're not actually extinct in that sense just in terms of the
sheer numbers of people yeah bodies um as them by themselves walking around yeah but but they're
still here in that sense um but there certainly are very early Homo sapiens in Eurasia uh where we
can tell from the the DNA that they have no living relatives so there were waves of people coming and
going possibly coming and going backwards again um through Eurasia we we're only at the very beginning
of trying to actually map out what the genetics means in terms of the sites that we have but some
of those uh individual fossils that we have which we know are Homo sapiens they they went extinct
more than the Neanderthals there's nobody alive that has their material in now so
in terms of yeah this this idea that that we we succeeded and you know we were the victors and
the the upper panific mox you know some kind of great victory you know it's it's not as simple as
that at all no it sounds extremely complicated but that's really uh changed my perspective on the
Neanderthals because I am a very cautious guy as well I didn't want to uh sensationalize my
viewers with tales of Neanderthal art but that all sounds uh really very convincing and very
interesting and I know uh everyone who's listened to this who's found it fascinating so I'd really
like to thank you for coming on my channel and uh help explaining that to me and the and the
viewers I know we appreciate it a great deal so thank you well I know you're welcome you're welcome
it's it's it's it's difficult to explain because the stuff that hits the headlines is often really
exciting but it's kind of having that context around it and understanding the the breadth
of what we have it can really change you know what one site might mean and that's what doesn't
always sort of get communicated um in in the press or you know on tv or whatever like that so
then yeah I mean that's that is what I I'm trying to do with with my book is is give people a deep
dive into the data that will make more sense of why people you know why there's headlines coming out
all the time that can seem contradictory like oh Neanderthals weren't so stupid or oh that's why
they died out you know that's that's very contradictory for people to hear those two different narratives
that they weren't so stupid but here's why they were rubbish and you know actually the the symbolism
and the aesthetics is is a really key area where it's not often explained well enough to people
and when is your book coming out um summer next year 2020 summer next year look out for everyone
dr rags sags she's going to set the record straight on the context is key yes okay thank you so much
thanks
you
