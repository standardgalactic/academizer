"Finger" is actually a protocol or program used in the early days of the Internet to obtain information about users on other network sites. It could provide details like the user's name, whether they were currently logged in, and their recent activity. This tool was particularly popular in university and research environments. It's different from search tools or "finders" that we commonly use today to locate general information on the Internet. The "finger" protocol is much less common now due to privacy concerns and the evolution of the Internet.YouIn computer networking, the Name/Finger protocol and the Finger user information protocol are simple network protocols for the exchange of human-oriented status and user information.

Name/Finger protocol
edit
The Name/Finger protocol is based on Request for Comments document RFC 742 (December 1977) as an interface to the name and finger programs that provide status reports on a particular computer system or a particular person at network sites. The finger program was written in 1971 by Les Earnest who created the program to solve the need of users who wanted information on other users of the network. Information on who is logged in was useful to check the availability of a person to meet. This was probably the earliest form of presence information for remote network users.

Prior to the finger program, the only way to get this information on WAITS was with a WHO program that showed IDs and terminal line numbers (the server's internal number of the communication line, over which the user's terminal is connected) for logged-in users. In reference to the name FINGER, Les Earnest, wrote that he saw users of the WAITS time-sharing system run their fingers down the output of the WHO command.[1]ChatGPTChatGPTThe Name/Finger protocol, as described in RFC 742 (December 1977), is indeed a network protocol for exchanging user information. Developed by Les Earnest in 1971, the finger program was created to address the need of network users wanting information about other users, like their login status. This early form of remote user presence information was a significant step in computer networking.Before the finger program, user information was limited to basic details like IDs and terminal line numbers, obtainable through a command like WHO. The name "FINGER" was inspired by how users would physically run their fingers down the output of the WHO command to find specific information. This protocol played a crucial role in the early days of internet development.YouSupplying such detailed information as e-mail addresses and full names was considered acceptable and convenient in the early days of networking, but later was considered questionable for privacy and security reasons.[citation needed]

Finger information has been used by hackers as a way to initiate a social engineering attack on a company's computer security system. By using a finger client to get a list of a company's employee names, email addresses, phone numbers, and so on, a hacker can call or email someone at a company requesting information while posing as another employee.

The finger daemon has also had several[citation needed] exploitable security holes crackers have used to break into systems. For example, in 1988 the Morris worm exploited an overflow vulnerability in fingerd (among others) to spread.[2]

For these reasons, by the late 1990s the vast majority of sites on the Internet no longer offered the service.[citation needed]ChatGPTChatGPTOver time, the detailed information provided by the Finger protocol, such as e-mail addresses and full names, raised privacy and security concerns. This protocol became a target for hackers who used it to gather employee information for social engineering attacks. Additionally, the finger daemon had vulnerabilities that were exploited, notably by the Morris worm in 1988.Due to these security risks, by the late 1990s, most sites on the Internet stopped offering Finger services. This shift reflects the evolving understanding of cybersecurity and the need for protecting user privacy in the digital age.YouThe Finger user information protocol is based on RFC 1288 (The Finger User Information Protocol, December 1991). Typically the server side of the protocol is implemented by a program fingerd or in.fingerd (for finger daemon), while the client side is implemented by the name and finger programs which are supposed to return a friendly, human-oriented status report on either the system at the moment or a particular person in depth. There is no required format, and the protocol consists mostly of specifying a single command line.

The program would supply information such as whether a user is currently logged-on, e-mail address, full name etc. As well as standard user information, finger displays the contents of the .project and .plan files in the user's home directory. Often this file (maintained by the user) contains either useful information about the user's current activities, similar to micro-blogging, or alternatively all manner of humor.ChatGPTChatGPTThe Finger User Information Protocol, defined in RFC 1288 (December 1991), involves a server-side program (like fingerd or in.fingerd) and client-side applications (name and finger programs) designed to provide user-friendly, human-oriented status reports about a system or an individual. This protocol does not mandate a specific format and mainly specifies a single command line.The information provided by the Finger protocol includes user login status, email addresses, full names, and more. Significantly, Finger also displays the contents of the .project and .plan files from the user's home directory. These files, often updated by users, can contain information about their current activities, akin to micro-blogging, or various forms of humor.YouIt kind of makes me think of how the yellow pages had a stylized logo of fingers and a slogan like "let your fingers do the walking"ChatGPTChatGPTThe comparison you draw between the Finger protocol and the Yellow Pages slogan "Let your fingers do the walking" is quite apt. Both concepts revolve around the idea of using a simple, direct method to access a wealth of information. In the case of the Yellow Pages, it was about flipping through a directory to find businesses and services. For the Finger protocol, it involved a quick command to gather information about network users. Both are about convenience and efficiency in accessing information, facilitated by a "fingertip" approach.YouSo it looks like the protocol still exists in some way: WebFinger is a protocol specified by the Internet Engineering Task Force IETF in RFC 7033 that allows for discovery of information about people and things identified by a URI.[1] Information about a person might be discovered via an acct: URI, for example, which is a URI that looks like an email address.


Logo of WebFinger
WebFinger is specified as the discovery protocol for OpenID Connect,[2] which is a protocol that allows one to more easily log in to various sites on the Internet.[3]

The WebFinger protocol is used by federated software, such as GNU social,[citation needed] Diaspora,[4] or Mastodon,[5] to discover users on federated nodes and pods, as well as the remoteStorage protocol.[6]

As a historical note, the name "WebFinger" is derived from the old ARPANET Finger protocol, but it is a very different protocol designed for HTTP.[7]

The protocol payload is represented in JSON formatChatGPTChatGPTWebFinger is a modern evolution of the traditional Finger protocol, adapted for the web and specified by the IETF in RFC 7033. It allows for the discovery of information about entities identified by a URI, such as an acct: URI, which resembles an email address. This protocol is significant in the context of OpenID Connect, facilitating easier login processes across various websites.Moreover, WebFinger is utilized by federated software like GNU social, Diaspora, and Mastodon for discovering users across different nodes and pods.

ABSTRACT

Internet, the global network of computer networks, has aroused enormous popular interest. Indeed, the Internet could rightly be called the phenomenon of the decade. In the early days (1993), interest was driven in part by the availability of free or inexpensive shareware software for Microsoft Windows. In 1997, interest was driven by companies giving away free software in order to establish themselves in a potentially lucrative market. Now there is so much to do on the Internet that everyone can find good reason to spend some time logged on.

It is now technically simple for anyone to make their personal computer a host on the Internet. The casual user can find, retrieve, and view information gathered from around the world without having to learn complicated computer commands. Perhaps more amazingly, the casual computer user can become an international author and publisher.

In this paper, I describe the principal functions and services available via the Internet. Then I outline the technical background and terminology needed by the beginner who wants to make his PC a host on the Internet. Finally, I describe several Windows software packages and programs that facilitate using Internet services. All the software I describe is freely available over the Internet.

Note: I am pleased to note that this paper was included on PC Week's list of primers and tutorials useful to information technology professionals who must rely on serial connections to the Internet. The list was published in "PC Week," Vol. 12, No. 13, p. 13 (April 3, 1995).

Note: If you are more interested in publishing on the Internet, rather than simply retrieving what others have published, you can learn how to operate your own Web site by reading my paper Teaching and Publishing in the World Wide Web.

I published the first Web version of this paper in September 1994 when running TCP/IP under Windows was still something of a novelty. I updated it with some regularity until summer 1999. By then this little document had served its purpose of helping thousands get started on the Internet, and I moved on to other interests. Those interested in more modern introductory lessons in using TCP/IP applications under Windows should consult the hundreds of books and articles now available.

Those interested in the early days of Internet access by amateurs such as myself may want to browse around. In particular the section on Trumpet Winsock indicates something of the complex details we had to contend with so long ago when we were young.

Prior to creating the Web version, I released the first version of this tutorial via Internet news and BITNET listserv on November 15, 1993. I released revised and expanded versions on January 16, February 9, and March 21, 1994. O'Reilly Associates published a version in the March 1994 issue of the "Global Network Navigator Toolkit," which was then accessible at http://nearnet.gnn.com/GNN-ORA.html.

I wrote Release 05 (June 21, 1994) as a major expansion of the tutorial at the request of the Virginia Tech College of Engineering. The College included that version on the CD-ROM 1994-95 VT Engineering Tools. A print version of Release 05 also was published by the Computing and Systems Technology Division of the American Institute of Chemical Engineers in CAST Communications, Vol. 17, No. 2, pp. 6-14 (Summer 1994).

Release 06 of the ascii version was also published in Adobe Acrobat format (PDF file, 346,917 bytes) in WindoWatch, Vol 1, No. 2 (January 1995). It was available at the time of publication in the WindoWatch directory at ftp.channel1.com.

The final plain text (ascii) version of this paper was Release 07 dated September 16, 1995, after which the ascii version was no longer updated.

============
INTRODUCTION

Internet, the world-wide network of computer networks, has
captured the imagination of the general public. In mid-1993 the
Internet was barely mentioned in the popular computing magazines.
By mid-1994 it was the topic of articles in national news
magazines, local newspapers, and grocery-store tabloids.

Awareness of the Internet spread initially by word of mouth.
Computer pundits were not discussing the Internet in Spring 1993
when I first began investigating the Internet in my work as a
librarian. Indeed, most pundits seemed to acquire Internet access
only in the Spring of 1994. Thus, computer magazines were not
helpful for those wishing to learn about the Internet.

By December 1994, there was something of a feeding frenzy of
interest in the Internet. Bookstores were flooded with guides to
the Internet. Software vendors were rushing to market with
collections of software designed for navigating the resources on
the Internet. It was almost as if the crest of the Internet wave
had passed. Pundits who did not have access to the Internet in
1993 were in late 1994 already writing negative opinions about
the difficulties of navigating Internet resources, and about the
uselessness of those resources. This frenzy of media interest,
praise, and criticism continues to this day.
ChatGPTChatGPTThe introduction to the document highlights the rapid rise of the Internet's popularity from obscurity to mainstream attention in the mid-1990s. It notes that awareness of the Internet initially spread through word of mouth, as computer pundits were not discussing it at that time. By late 1994, there was a surge of interest in the Internet, with books and software flooding the market. However, some pundits were already critical of the Internet's usability. The document sets the context for the Internet's growth and changing perceptions during that period.YouComplaints about the Internet are many. Certainly it can be
difficult to find information and resources on the Internet. A
great deal of information is unvalidated, non-authoritative, or
otherwise questionable. Some resources should not be available to
children. Some would argue that some of the information should
not be distributed even to adults.

It is important to remember that the Internet is not a service.
Rather, it is a means of gaining access to services and of
retrieving information and other objects that can be represented
electronically. In considering complaints about the Internet, one
might draw an analogy between the Internet and New York City.

New York is big, complicated, and disorganized. The city's myriad
resources can be hard to find. Some of what happens or what is
available in New York should not be seen by children. For those
wishing to navigate the complexity of New York, there are
guidebooks, phone directories, magazine articles, and individuals
with expert knowledge about areas of particular interest. One can
navigate the complexity of the city by subway, taxi, and bus. One
can even hire a private guide to conduct a tour of the city.

The Internet can be compared to the streets of New York City. The
services available on the Internet have their analogies in the
city's libraries, department stores, bookshops, art galleries,
street vendors, and street-corner zealots passing out literature
or lecturing the passing crowds. It is safe to assume that
somewhere on the streets of the city there will be found
information and services of interest to almost anyone. However,
finding that information might take some time for someone who is
new to the city and its resources. Similarly, somewhere on the
Internet there also will be found information and services of
interest to almost anyone.ChatGPTChatGPTThe document addresses common complaints about the Internet, acknowledging challenges in finding reliable information and the need for content filtering. It draws an analogy between the Internet and New York City, emphasizing that the Internet is a complex network of services and information, akin to the diverse offerings found in a bustling city. Navigating the Internet, like exploring New York, may require guidance and familiarity to discover valuable resources.YouTraveling on the Internet requires only a few basic tools. First
is a computer with a network connection to the Internet. A direct
connection to the Internet uses a PC equipped with a network
interface card that interfaces with a local area network that is
in turn linked to the Internet. Such a connection is common at
universities, and becoming more common in businesses. If a direct
network connection is not available, an alternative is to connect
to the Internet through the computer's serial port. This involves
a telephone connection to a terminal server that offers SLIP
(Serial Line Internet Protocol) or PPP (Point to Point Protocol)
service. Any of these connections can be used with a variety of
commercial or shareware software to make your local computer a
host on the Internet and to access services and information from
the entire earth. This paper emphasizes the use of freeware and
shareware versions of software running under Microsoft Windows
3.x or Windows 95.
ChatGPTChatGPTTo travel on the Internet, you need a computer with a network connection. This connection can be direct, such as at universities or businesses, using a network interface card. Alternatively, you can use a serial port connection via a telephone line to a terminal server offering SLIP or PPP service. Various commercial or shareware software, particularly for Windows 3.x or Windows 95, can be used to access the Internet and its services. This paper focuses on using freeware and shareware software for Internet access.You=================
INTERNET SERVICES

The Internet services of interest to most people consist of four
basic functions. These are electronic mail (e-mail), Internet
news, file transfer between computers (FTP), and remote login to
another computer (telnet). Access systems like Gopher and World
Wide Web now supplement these basic Internet functions by
assisting the user in browsing and searching the Internet for
relevant information in a user-friendly manner.

Until recently, Internet functions were accessible primarily
through character-based interfaces using a variety of complex
command sets. Thus, until recently, best-selling books on the
Internet contained page after page of screen displays or command
sequences captured from UNIX-based systems executing basic
Internet functions.

Affordable Internet software for Windows first became available
in Spring 1993. Prior to that time, Windows users were dependent
for Internet access on expensive, proprietary, commercial
products in which each vendor's offerings were mutually
incompatible with every other vendor's offerings. Publication of
the Winsock applications programming interface (API) provided a
way for individual client software (such as a telnet or FTP
client) to be compatible with every vendor's networking products.
As a result, beginning in 1993 there was a blossoming of
freeware, shareware, and commercial Internet software for
Windows.ChatGPTChatGPTThis section discusses the four fundamental Internet services: email, Internet news, file transfer (FTP), and remote login (telnet). It highlights that until the early '90s, accessing these functions required complex, character-based interfaces. However, affordable Windows-based Internet software emerged in Spring 1993, thanks to the Winsock API. This development led to a proliferation of freeware, shareware, and commercial Internet software for Windows, making Internet access more accessible and user-friendly.YouOf special interest has been the development of Windows
interfaces to the World Wide Web. Mosaic and Netscape are the
best known Web browsers. The Web was developed by the high energy
physics community to distribute technical papers and other forms
of data. WWW is now widely viewed as a means for educators,
businesses, and hobbyists to distribute multimedia information to
a world-wide audience. Graphical WWW clients enable publication
of data over the Internet in a manner which allows the user to
view text, color graphics, sound, and video in a manner that
approaches the usability, and surpasses the functionality, of a
printed magazine. Those interested in using the Web for teaching
or publishing may find it useful to read my paper "Teaching and
Publishing in the World Wide Web." It is available as a hypertext
document at http://learning.lib.vt.edu/webserv/webserv.html. It
is also available in plain text by anonymous ftp from
nebula.lib.vt.edu in directory /pub/www/ under the filename
websrv02.asc.ChatGPTChatGPTThis section highlights the development of Windows interfaces for the World Wide Web (WWW), with Mosaic and Netscape being prominent web browsers. Originally created for sharing technical papers, the WWW has evolved into a platform for educators, businesses, and hobbyists to distribute multimedia content globally. Graphical WWW clients enable the publication of text, color graphics, sound, and video in a user-friendly manner, similar to printed magazines. The paper "Teaching and Publishing in the World Wide Web" provides valuable insights for those interested in using the web for educational or publishing purposesââ.You

E-MAIL
Electronic mail is probably the most widely used Internet
function. A commonly used configuration requires that a user have
an account on a POP (Post Office Protocol) mail server. The e-
mail client software accesses the server and downloads any
incoming messages to the user's PC. Mail composed at the user's
PC is transmitted to the Internet through the mail server.

-------------
INTERNET NEWS
Internet news, also referred to as USENET news, is a conferencing
system made up of thousands of topical conferences known as news
groups. Those familiar with electronic bulletin board systems
will compare Internet news to echo conferences. Others will draw
an analogy to mailing lists such as listserv on BITNET. The user
reads the news by using client software to subscribe to a
selection of news groups. When the client software accesses an
NNTP (Network News Transfer Protocol) server, the server
downloads to the client a list of subjects for all unread
messages stored on the server for the selected news group. The
user can then select any message for reading, post a response to
the message to the group, or reply directly to the original
poster of the message. The client software maintains on the
user's PC a list of all available groups on the server, along
with records of which messages have been read or skipped over.
Only the messages selected for reading are actually downloaded to
the user's PC.

FTP
FTP (File Transfer Protocol) allows the transfer of files between
any two computers of any type. Thus, files can be transferred
from PC to PC, PC to mainframe, PC to Mac, PC to UNIX machine,
and vice versa. Any kind of computer file, whether it be a text
file or a binary file representing software, graphics images, or
sounds, can be transferred. Of course, whether the file is usable
on the receiving machine depends on the nature of the file and
the availability of software to make use of the file.

------
TELNET
Telnet enables the user of a PC to login to a host computer at
another site on the Internet. The user's PC then acts as a dumb
terminal attached to the remote host. Such access usually
requires that the user have an account on the remote host. For
instance, a student or faculty member at one university might
have an account on a computer located at another university. An
increasing number of commercial services are becoming available
via telnet, including services such as the Dow Jones News Service
and the Lexis/Nexis service. In addition, some services are
available without charge. For example, hundreds of libraries in
all parts of the world allow free remote access to their
computerized catalogs and to some specialized databases.
ChatGPTChatGPTFTP (File Transfer Protocol) facilitates file transfers between computers of different types, including PCs, mainframes, Macs, UNIX machines, and more. It supports the transfer of various file types, whether text, binary, software, images, or sounds, but usability on the receiving machine depends on compatibility and available software.Telnet allows a PC user to log in to a remote host computer on the Internet, turning the PC into a dumb terminal for the remote host. Access often requires having an account on the remote host. Commercial services, like Dow Jones News and Lexis/Nexis, are accessible via telnet, as are free services such as remote library catalogs and specialized databases.YouGOPHER
Gopher is a system that enables the user to find files and other
Internet services by navigating a system of text menus and
submenus. As a corollary, it provides a means for information
providers to publish information on the Internet in a
discoverable manner. Prior to the development of Gopher at the
University of Minnesota, information on the Internet was located
by asking friends and strangers where to look.

The first step in using a Gopher client is to "point" the client
at the address of a known Gopher server. The client then
retrieves that Gopher's menu of topics. Typically, many of the
topics on a Gopher menu are pointers to yet other menu items on
other Gopher servers. The fact that each item in the sequence of
selections might come from different Gopher servers in widely
scattered parts of the world is transparent to the user. The
Gopher client software presents the many different Gopher servers
as if they represented a single application on a single machine.
Navigating such menus can lead the user to skip from one Gopher
server to another, literally retrieving information from servers
scattered around the world in just a few minutes.

Items on Gopher menus can be of many different data types in
addition to menus listing choices of topics. When an item such as
a text, graphics, or sound file is selected, the Gopher client
transfers the file to the user's PC. Then, as an option, it may
load the file into an appropriate "viewer" selected by the user.
A simple text file could be loaded into Windows Notepad. A
graphics file in GIF or JPEG format might be loaded into LVIEW, a
popular freeware graphics viewer for Windows. A binary program
file would simply be downloaded into a designated directory for
use at some other time. Finding relevant Gopher menu items is
facilitated through the use of Veronica, which is a database of
the text of Gopher menus. Most Gopher servers will include
Veronica access as a menu selectionChatGPTChatGPTGopher is a menu-based system that simplifies finding files and Internet services. Users select a Gopher server, which provides menus of topics and links to other servers. Gopher seamlessly connects users to servers worldwide, presenting them as a single application. Various data types, including text, graphics, and sound files, can be accessed and viewed. Veronica, a database of Gopher menus, assists in finding relevant items. Gopher revolutionized information retrieval on the early Internet by organizing resources into a navigable structure.YouWORLD WIDE WEB
World Wide Web (WWW) is a system that enables users to find and
retrieve information by navigating a system of hypertext
documents. In a hypertext document, selecting a highlighted word
or phrase causes a new document to be retrieved and displayed.
Thus, WWW leads the user to skip from one document to another,
retrieving information from servers scattered around the world.

Viewing a WWW document with a Windows graphical client such as
Cello, Mosaic, Netscape, or WinWeb is similar to reading a
magazine. Information is displayed with typographic fonts and
color graphics. Unlike a magazine, the static display can be
supplemented by sound and video clips that are played by clicking
an icon embedded in the document. Clicking on a highlighted word
or phrase in the document may cause the reader to skip to another
part of the displayed document, or it may cause yet another
document to be retrieved.ChatGPTChatGPTThe World Wide Web (WWW) is a hypertext-based system that allows users to navigate and retrieve information by selecting highlighted words or phrases in documents. It functions as a global network of servers, providing access to documents from around the world. Graphical web browsers like Cello, Mosaic, Netscape, or WinWeb display information with fonts, color graphics, and multimedia elements. Users can interact with documents by clicking on links, which may lead to other parts of the same document or retrieve new documents altogether. This user-friendly approach revolutionized information retrieval on the internet, making it akin to reading a magazine with multimedia enhancements.YouTECHNICAL DETAILS

It is helpful to know some Internet terminology when working with
your local network specialist or Internet service provider to
make your PC a host on the Internet. The two common modes of
Internet access are through a direct network connection or
through a serial connection to a SLIP or PPP server.

A direct network connection involves installing a network
interface card (NIC) in your PC. Most likely this will be an
ethernet card. This card in turn is connected to your
organization's local area network. Wiring usually consists of
coaxial cable (as in thin-wire ethernet) or twisted pair
telephone wiring (as in 10Base-T ethernet). The local network in
turn must be connected to the Internet, and it must be capable of
handling TCP/IP data packets.

TCP/IP (Transmission Control Protocol/Internet Protocol) is the
method by which data on the Internet is divided into packets of
bytes. Each packet is delimited with header information that
includes the destination address where the packet is to be routed
when it is transmitted over the Internet. The local network and
your PC may also be using other network protocols simultaneously
with TCP/IP. For instance, your PC may already be connected to a
network using Novell, LANtastic, or Windows network protocols.ChatGPTChatGPTTechnical details of internet access include two common modes: direct network connection and serial connection to a SLIP or PPP server. For a direct network connection, a network interface card (NIC), often ethernet, is installed in the PC, connecting to the local area network, which should support TCP/IP for internet data. Additionally, PCs may use other network protocols alongside TCP/IP, such as Novell or LANtastic. Understanding these terms is essential when configuring PC internet access with local network specialists or service providers.YouOk it looks like we are going to have to make a wikipedia page.

[Summary]
Launched in 1995 by the WorldWide Language Institute (WWLI), an
institute providing language instruction via the internet, NetGlos
-- which stands for "Multilingual Glossary of Internet
Terminology"  -- was compiled as a voluntary collaborative project
by a number of translators and other language professionals
worldwide. In September 1998, NetGlos was available in 13
languages (Chinese, Croatian, English, Dutch/Flemish, French,
German, Greek, Hebrew, Italian, Maori, Norwegian, Portuguese,
Spanish). As explained by Brian King, director of the WorldWide
Language Institute, in September 1998: "Before a new term becomes
accepted as the 'correct' one, there is a period of instability
where a number of competing candidates are used. Often an English
loan word becomes the starting point  -- and in many cases the
endpoint. But eventually a winner emerges that becomes codified
into published technical dictionaries as well as the everyday
interactions of the non technical user."ChatGPTChatGPTNetGlos, launched in 1995 by the WorldWide Language Institute (WWLI), is a collaborative project that created a "Multilingual Glossary of Internet Terminology." It involved translators and language professionals worldwide. By September 1998, NetGlos was available in 13 languages, including Chinese, Croatian, English, Dutch/Flemish, French, German, Greek, Hebrew, Italian, Maori, Norwegian, Portuguese, and Spanish. During its development, various terms competed for acceptance before a consensus emerged, which was then codified into technical dictionaries and everyday language useââ.You
As explained by Brian King, director of the WorldWide Language
Institute, in September 1998: "Much of the technical terminology
on the web is still not translated into other languages. And as we
found with ({~HORIZONTAL ELLIPSIS~}) NetGlos, the translation of these terms is not
always a simple process. Before a new term becomes accepted as the
'correct' one, there is a period of instability where a number of
competing candidates are used. Often an English loan word becomes
the starting point  -- and in many cases the endpoint. But
eventually a winner emerges that becomes codified into published
technical dictionaries as well as the everyday interactions of the
non technical user. The latest version of NetGlos is the Russian
one and it should be available in a couple of weeks or so [in late
September 1998]. It will no doubt be an excellent example of the
ongoing, dynamic process of 'russification' of web terminology."

How about the future? "As a company that derives its very
existence from the importance attached to languages, I believe the
future will be an exciting and challenging one. But it will be
impossible to be complacent about our successes and
accomplishments. Technology is already changing at a frenetic pace.
Lifelong learning is a strategy that we all must use if we are to
stay ahead and be competitive. This is a difficult enough task in
an English-speaking environment. If we add in the complexities of
interacting in a multilingual/multicultural cyberspace, then the
task becomes even more demanding. As well as competition, there is
also the necessity for cooperation  -- perhaps more so than ever
before. The seeds of cooperation across the internet have
certainly already been sown. Our NetGlos Project has depended on
the goodwill of volunteer translators from Canada, U.S., Austria,
Norway, Belgium, Israel, Portugal, Russia, Greece, Brazil, New
Zealand and other countries. I think the hundreds of visitors we
get coming to the NetGlos pages everyday is an excellent testimony
to the success of these types of working relationships. I see the
future depending even more on cooperative relationships  --
although not necessarily on a volunteer basis."ChatGPTChatGPTBrian King, Director of the WorldWide Language Institute, emphasized the complexity of translating technical web terminology into other languages. He noted that competing candidates for translation often arise before a consensus is reached. English loanwords are sometimes used as a starting point, but eventually, a definitive term emerges and is included in technical dictionaries. King mentioned the ongoing process of translating web terminology into Russian as an example. He also highlighted the importance of cooperation and the role of volunteer translators in projects like NetGlos, which has received support from individuals worldwideââ.YouReference tag: https://101science.com/Terminology.htmChatGPTChatGPTI apologize, but I couldn't find a reference tag related to "https://101science.com/Terminology.htm."

Here is the main link https://web.archive.org/web/20020603145922/http://wwli.com/translation/netglos/netglos.htmlChatGPTChatGPTNetGlos was a collaborative project launched in 1995 by the WorldWide Language Institute (WWLI). Short for "Multilingual Glossary of Internet Terminology," NetGlos aimed to compile a comprehensive glossary of internet-related terms in multiple languages. The project involved translators and language professionals worldwide. By September 1998, NetGlos was available in 13 languages, including Chinese, Croatian, English, Dutch/Flemish, French, German, Greek, Hebrew, Italian, Maori, Norwegian, Portuguese, and Spanish. It addressed the challenge of translating technical internet terms and played a vital role in making internet terminology accessible across different languages. The project's director, Brian King, emphasized the importance of ongoing collaboration and the dynamic nature of web terminology.For more detailed information, you can visit the original NetGlos page.(Note: This is a concise summary. A full Wikipedia page would provide more extensive information.)YouThe reason I'm making the page is to get help from others gathering information about the project. Like when did it end and so onChatGPTChatGPTCreating a Wikipedia page is a great way to gather information and collaborate with others. To find out when the NetGlos project ended and gather more details, you can consider the following steps:Reach out to former participants: Try to contact individuals who were involved in the NetGlos project, if possible. They may have valuable insights into its history and its eventual conclusion.Explore archived sources: Use web archives and historical records to trace the project's timeline. The Wayback Machine is a useful tool for accessing archived web pages.Check academic sources: Look for academic papers, articles, or research that might mention the project's duration or its impact on multilingual internet terminology.Collaborate on Wikipedia: Start the Wikipedia page with the information you have and make it clear that you are seeking contributions and additional details from others. Wikipedia's collaborative nature often attracts experts in various fields who can provide valuable insights.By combining these approaches, you can gradually build a comprehensive and accurate Wikipedia page for NetGlos while gathering more information from contributors.ChatGPT can make mistakes. Consider checking important information.?ChatGPT
