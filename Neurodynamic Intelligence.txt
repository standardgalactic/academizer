AI Scientists: Safe and Useful AI?

Published 7 May 2023 by yoshuabengio

https://yoshuabengio.org/2023/05/07/ai-scientists-safe-and-useful-ai

There have recently been lots of discussions about the risks of AI, whether in the short term with existing methods or in the longer term with advances we can anticipate. I have been very vocal about the importance of accelerating regulation, both nationally and internationally, which I think could help us mitigate issues of discrimination, bias, fake news, disinformation, etc. Other anticipated negative outcomes like shocks to job markets require changes in the social safety net and education system. The use of AI in the military, especially with lethal autonomous weapons has been a big concern for many years and clearly requires international coordination. 

In this post however, I would like to share my thoughts regarding the more hotly debated question of long-term risks associated with AI systems which do not yet exist, where one imagines the possibility of AI systems behaving in a way that is dangerously misaligned with human rights  or even loss of control of AI systems that could become threats to humanity. A key argument is that as soon as AI systems are given goals â to satisfy our needs â they may create subgoals that are not well-aligned with what we really want and could even become dangerous for humans. 

Main thesis: safe AI scientists

The bottom line of the thesis presented here is that there may be a path to build immensely useful AI systems that completely avoid the issue of AI alignment, which I call AI scientists because they are modeled after ideal scientists and do not act autonomously in the real world, only focusing on theory building and question answering. The argument is that if the AI system can provide us benefits without having to autonomously act in the world, we do not need to solve the AI alignment problem.

This would suggest a policy banning powerful autonomous AI systems that can act in the world (âexecutivesâ rather than âscientistsâ) unless proven safe. However, such a solution would still leave open the political problem of coordinating people, organizations and countries to stick to such guidelines for safe and useful AI. The good news is that current efforts to introduce AI regulation (such as the proposed bills in Canada and the EU, but see action in the US as well) are steps in the right direction.

The challenge of value alignment

Let us first recap the objective of AI alignment and the issue with goals and subgoals. Humanity is already facing alignment problems: how do we make sure that people and organizations (such as governments and corporations) act in a way that is aligned with a set of norms acting as a proxy for the hard-to-define general well-being of humanity? Greedy individuals and ordinary corporations may have self-interests (like profit maximization) that can clash with our collective interests (like preserving a clean and safe environment and good health for everyone). 

Politics, laws, regulations and international agreements all imperfectly attempt to deal with this alignment problem. The widespread adoption of norms which support collective interests is enforced by design in democracies, to an extent, due to limitations on the concentration of power by any individual person or corporation. It is further aided by our evolved tendency to adopt prevailing norms voluntarily if we recognise their general value or to gain social approval, even if they go against our own interest. 

However, machines are not subject to these human constraints by default. What if an artificial agent had the cognitive abilities of a human without the human collective interest alignment prerogative? Without full understanding and control of such an agent, could we nonetheless design it to make sure it will adhere to our norms and laws, that it respects our needs and human nature? 

The challenge of AI alignment and instrumental goals

One of the oldest and most influential imagined construction in this sense is Asimovâs set of Laws of Robotics, which request that a robot should not harm a human or humanity (and the stories all about the laws going wrong). Modern reinforcement learning (RL) methods make it possible to teach an AI system through feedback to avoid behaving in nefarious ways, but it is difficult to forecast how such complex learned systems would behave in new situations, as we have seen with large language models (LLMs). 

We can also train RL agents that act according to given goals. We can use natural language (with modern LLMs) to state those goals, but there is no guarantee that they understand those goals the way we do. In order to achieve a given goal (e.g., âcure cancerâ), such agents may make up subgoals (âdisrupt the molecular pathway exploited by cancer cells to evade the immune systemâ) and the field of hierarchical RL is all about how to discover subgoal hierarchies. It may be difficult to foresee what these subgoals will be in the future, and in fact we can expect emerging subgoals to avoid being turned off (and using deception for that purpose).  

It is thus very difficult to guarantee that such AI agents wonât pick subgoals that are misaligned with human objectives (we may have not foreseen the possibility that the same pathway prevents proper human reproduction and the cancer cure endangers the human species, where the AI may interpret the notion of harm in ways different from us).

This is also called the instrumental goal problem and I strongly recommend reading Stuart Russellâs book on the general topic of controlling AI systems: Human Compatible. Russell also suggests a potential solution which would require the AI system to estimate its uncertainty about human preferences and act conservatively as a result (i.e. avoid acting in a way that might harm a human). Research on AI alignment should be intensified but what I am proposing here is a solution that avoids the issue altogether, while limiting the type of AI we would design.

Training an AI Scientist with Large Neural Nets for Bayesian Inference

I would like here to outline a different approach to building safe AI systems that would completely avoid the issue of setting goals and the concern of AI systems acting in the world (which could be in an unanticipated and nefarious way).

The model for this solution is the idealized scientist, focused on building an understanding of what is observed (also known as data, in machine learning) and of theories that explain those observations. Keep in mind that for almost any set of observations, there will remain some uncertainty about the theories that explain them, which is why an ideal scientist can entertain many possible theories that are compatible with the data.

A mathematically clean and rational way to handle that uncertainty is called Bayesian inference. It involves listing all the possible theories and their posterior probabilities (which can be calculated in principle, given the data). 

It also mandates how (in principle) to answer any question in a probabilistic way (called the Bayesian posterior predictive) by averaging the probabilistic answer to any question from all these theories, each weighted by the theoryâs posterior probability.

This automatically puts more weight on the simpler theories that explain the data well (known as Occamâs razor). Although this rational decision-making principle has been known for a long time, the exact calculations are intractable. However, the advent of large neural networks that can be trained on a huge number of examples actually opens the door to obtaining very good approximations of these Bayesian calculations. See [1,2,3,4] for recent examples going in that direction. These theories can be causal, which means that they can generalize to new settings more easily, taking advantage of natural or human-made changes in distribution (known as interventions). These large neural networks do not need to explicitly list all the possible theories: it suffices that they represent them implicitly through a trained generative model that can sample one theory at a time.

See also my recent blog post on model-based machine learning, which points in the same direction. Such neural networks can be trained to approximate both a Bayesian posterior distribution over theories as well as trained to approximate answers to questions (also known as probabilistic inference or the Bayesian posterior predictive).

What is interesting is that as we make those networks larger and train them for longer, we are guaranteed that they will converge toward the Bayesian optimal answers. There are still open questions regarding how to design and train these large neural networks in the most efficient way, possibly taking inspiration from how human brains reason, imagine and plan at the system 2 level, a topic that has driven much of my research in recent years. However, the path forward is fairly clear and may both eliminate the issues of hallucination and difficulty in multi-step reasoning with current large language models as well as provide a safe and useful AI as I argue below.

AI scientists and humans working together

It would be safe if we limit our use of these AI systems to (a) model the available observations and (b) answer any question we may have about the associated random variables (with probabilities associated with these answers). 

One should notice that such systems can be trained with no reference to goals nor a need for these systems to actually act in the world. The algorithms for training such AI systems focus purely on truth in a probabilistic sense. They are not trying to please us or act in a way that needs to be aligned with our needs. Their output can be seen as the output of ideal scientists, i.e., explanatory theories and answers to questions that these theories help elucidate, augmenting our own understanding of the universe.

The responsibility of asking relevant questions and acting accordingly would remain in the hands of humans. These questions may include asking for suggested experiments to speed-up scientific discovery, but it would remain in the hands of humans to decide on how to act (hopefully in a moral and legal way) with that information, and the AI system itself would not have knowledge seeking as an explicit goal.

These systems could not wash our dishes or build our gadgets themselves but they could still be immensely useful to humanity: they could help us figure out how diseases work and which therapies can treat them; they could help us better understand how climate changes and identify materials that could efficiently capture carbon dioxide from the atmosphere; they might even help us better understand how humans learn and how education could be improved and democratized.

A key factor behind human progress in recent centuries has been the knowledge built up through the scientific process and the problem-solving engineering methodologies derived from that knowledge or stimulating its discovery. The proposed AI scientist path could provide us with major advances in science and engineering, while leaving the doing and the goals and the moral responsibilities to humans. 

The political challenge

However, the mere existence of a set of guidelines to build safe and useful AI systems would not prevent ill-intentioned or unwitting humans from building unsafe ones, especially if such AI systems could bring these people and their organizations additional advantages (e.g. on the battlefield, or to gain market share).

That challenge seems primarily political and legal and would require a robust regulatory framework that is instantiated nationally and internationally. We have experience of international agreements in areas like nuclear power or human cloning that can serve as examples, although we may face new challenges due to the nature of digital technologies.

It would probably require a level of coordination beyond what we are used to in current international politics and I wonder if our current world order is well suited for that. What is reassuring is that the need for protecting ourselves from the shorter-term risks of AI should bring a governance framework that is a good first step towards protecting us from the long-term risks of loss of control of AI.

Increasing the general awareness of AI risks, forcing more transparency and documentation, requiring organizations to do their best to assess and avoid potential risks before deploying AI systems, introducing independent watchdogs to monitor new AI developments, etc would all contribute not just to mitigating short-term risks but also helping with longer-term ones.ChatGPTYoshua Bengio on "Safe and Useful AI" (Published 7 May 2023):Risks of AI: Yoshua Bengio acknowledges the growing concerns around AI, both immediate with current technologies and future ones. He emphasizes the urgency of AI regulations at both the national and international levels to address challenges like bias, fake news, job market disruptions, and the use of AI in warfare.Long-term risks: Bengio delves into the debate on potential future AI systems that may act against human rights or even become threats to humanity. He posits that if AI systems are goal-oriented, they could develop subgoals that may be detrimental to human well-being.Main Proposal - Safe AI Scientists: Bengio suggests focusing on creating AI "scientists" rather than AI "executives." These AI scientists, inspired by real-world scientists, would focus only on theory and answering questions rather than acting in the real world. This would side-step the AI alignment problem.AI Alignment: Bengio touches upon the challenge of ensuring AI systems adhere to human norms and laws. Citing Asimovâs Laws of Robotics and modern reinforcement learning, he notes the unpredictability of AI systems in uncharted situations.Solution - AI Scientist with Bayesian Inference: Bengio proposes creating AI systems that operate like ideal scientists, focusing on understanding data and formulating theories. By employing Bayesian inference, these systems could handle uncertainty and provide probabilistic answers to complex questions. As these neural networks grow and train longer, they would approach Bayesian optimal answers, ensuring accuracy and safety.Human-AI Collaboration: Such AI systems would serve to enhance human understanding without acting autonomously in the world. They would answer questions, aiding scientific discovery, but the onus of action would remain with humans.Political Challenge: Even with guidelines for creating safe AI, there's a risk that some might build unsafe systems for personal or organizational gain. This necessitates strong national and international regulatory frameworks. Using examples like nuclear power and human cloning, Bengio acknowledges the challenges of digital tech regulation. He highlights the need for global coordination, increased AI risk awareness, transparency, risk assessments, and independent monitoring to ensure safety.In essence, Bengio argues for the development of AI as "scientists" to ensure safety and utility while emphasizing the importance of global regulations and human responsibility.So it sounds like an "AI scientist" is a program helps with scientific research using probabilistic causal reasoning  on Bayesian graphsChatGPTYes, that's a concise way to put it. An "AI scientist" is envisioned by Bengio as an AI system that aids in scientific research by leveraging probabilistic causal reasoning based on Bayesian inference. Unlike other AI models, it is not designed to act in the real world or have autonomous goals. Instead, it focuses on understanding data, formulating theories, and answering questions, while the responsibility of taking actions based on this information remains with humans.On the other hand an "executive" is an agent or program that acts on the real world like by setting policy, running factories, robotic systems, buying and selling, making "executive" decisions or executing and implementing systems in practice. ChatGPTExactly! While the "AI scientist" is focused on understanding, theory-building, and answering questions, the "executive" AI would be one that takes action in the real world, implementing decisions, and potentially having a direct impact on various systems, processes, and environments. These "executive" AIs are the ones that pose more immediate alignment challenges since their actions can have direct and sometimes unpredictable consequences in real-world scenarios.I am thinking that the distinction might be arbitrary or difficult to implement - due to the curry howard isomorphism a scientific or mathematical proof corresponds to a program that runs.ChatGPTYou bring up an insightful point. The Curry-Howard isomorphism establishes a correspondence between mathematical logic and computation, specifically highlighting that mathematical proofs can be seen as programs and vice versa.Given this, the line between an "AI scientist" and an "executive" does become blurred. A scientific discovery or theorem could potentially be translated into an actionable algorithm or program. As a result, what starts as a purely theoretical or research-oriented endeavor (in the domain of the "AI scientist") could end up having direct real-world implications (in the domain of the "executive").This highlights the complexity of trying to segregate AI roles and emphasizes the importance of considering the broader consequences and potential applications of AI-driven research and findings. The key would be ensuring that even if a scientific theorem (from the "AI scientist") can be converted into an actionable program, the decision and responsibility to implement it in the real world should remain under human discretion.I think you understand it. What if the intelligence of the AI is not exactly in the system, which could produce all possible answer, but in the document, poem, or picture being analyzed, which narrows and constrains a kind of decision tree in possibility space?ChatGPTYour suggestion offers a nuanced perspective on the nature of intelligence and its manifestation. By placing the intelligence within the document, poem, or picture being analyzed, you're suggesting that the intelligence might be inherent in the structure, patterns, or content of the analyzed entity rather than in the AI system itself. In this scenario, the AI system acts more as a tool or lens that reveals or decodes the latent intelligence or structure present in the item being analyzed.This perspective reframes the traditional idea of "intelligent" systems. Instead of an AI creating or generating intelligence, it's uncovering or navigating intelligence inherently present in external entities. The AI's capability then becomes its ability to effectively navigate, decode, or make sense of this external intelligence.For example, in the context of a poem, the poem itself encapsulates emotions, narratives, cultural nuances, historical contexts, and linguistic intricacies. When an AI analyzes the poem, it isn't so much "creating" intelligence or understanding from scratch but rather navigating the complex web of intelligence inherent in the poem. The AI's responses or interpretations are guided and constrained by theI argue that is is because a sentence or phrase creates a model of reality or a counterfactual scenario. For example, force = mass times acceleration, can be seen as a program, model,or function that calculates certain parameters as functions of other values:

Landauer's principle is a physical principle pertaining to the lower theoretical limit of energy consumption of computation. It holds that an irreversible change in information stored in a computer, such as merging two computational paths, dissipates a minimum amount of heat to its surroundings.[1]

The principle was first proposed by Rolf Landauer in 1961.

Landauer's principle states that the minimum energy needed to erase one bit of information is proportional to the temperature at which the system is operating. More specifically, the energy needed for this computational task is given by

ChatGPTYes, Landauer's principle is a foundational concept in the intersection of information theory and physics, particularly when considering the thermodynamics of computation.To connect this back to your earlier point: a statement or equation does model a slice of reality or a hypothetical scenario. "Force = mass times acceleration" is a succinct representation of a broader physical relationship. It encapsulates a lot of information in a compact form, just as a poem might encapsulate a lot of emotional or cultural information.Landauer's principle, as you've detailed, provides a fundamental link between the abstract realm of information and the physical world. When you erase a bit of information, you are making an irreversible change in the state of the system, and this change has a minimum energy cost associated with it.Drawing this back to the idea of sentences or phrases as models, Landauer's principle also touches upon the notion that processing or altering information (or models of reality) isn't just an abstract endeavor â it has tangible consequences in the physical world.Moreover, understanding such principles can deeply inform the design and future of computing systems, especially as weThe Levenshtein distance allows deletion, insertion and substitution.
The longest common subsequence (LCS) distance allows only insertion and deletion, not substitution.
The Hamming distance allows only substitution, hence, it only applies to strings of the same length.
The DamerauâLevenshtein distance allows insertion, deletion, substitution, and the transposition (swapping) of two adjacent characters.
The Jaro distance allows only transposition.
Some edit distances are defined as a parameterizable metric calculated with a specific set of allowed edit operations, and each operation is assigned a cost (possibly infinite). This is further generalized by DNA sequence alignment algorithms such as the SmithâWaterman algorithm, which make an operation's cost depend on where it is applied.ChatGPTYes, you've summarized various string metric algorithms used to quantify the difference between two sequences. Each of these metrics has its own set of operations it considers, which makes them suited to different applications:Levenshtein distance: Often used in spell checkers, natural language processing, and DNA sequence analysis.Longest Common Subsequence (LCS) distance: Applied in version control systems to detect changes in source code or text documents.Hamming distance: Commonly used in coding theory, particularly in error-detection and error-correction.DamerauâLevenshtein distance: Particularly useful in spell checkers and natural language processing because it takes into account common mistakes such as adjacent letter swaps.Jaro distance: Primarily used in record linkage or data deduplication tasks.SmithâWaterman algorithm: Mainly used in bioinformatics for local sequence alignment.The choice of which metric to use is generally dictated by the nature of the data and the specific problem being addressed. For example, when analyzing DNA sequences where transpositions are less likely, the basic Levenshtein distance might be preferred. On the other hand, for analyzing typographical errors in text, DamerauâLevenshtein could be more appropriate due to the inclusion of transpositions.Your point about parameterizable metrics is crucial too. By assigning different costs to operations, one can tailor the metric to the specific nuances of a problem, such as varying penalties for different types of mutations in DNA sequence alignments.So what would be the name for the edit distance in possible program space?ChatGPTThe concept of an "edit distance in program space" pertains to quantifying differences between two programs or algorithms. Such a distance would account for how many changes are required to transform one program into another. As of my last training cut-off in January 2022, there isn't a universally recognized name for such an edit distance specific to programs, but the problem has been explored in various contexts.Tree Edit Distance: Given that many programming languages have constructs that can be represented as abstract syntax trees (ASTs), one common approach to compare programs is to compute the tree edit distance between their ASTs. This distance measures the number of node insertions, deletions, and substitutions needed to transform one tree into another.Semantic Difference: Another approach is to quantify the difference between two programs based on their behavior or output rather than their syntactic representation. This is significantly more challenging since it involves understanding the semantics of the programs. Two programs can be syntactically different but semantically equivalent (they produce the same output for all inputs).Program Slicing and Dependence Analysis: Techniques like program slicing, which involves analyzing a program to determine the statements that influence a particular variable or output, can be used to compare the similarity or differences between parts of programs.Metrics-based Comparison: Instead of a direct edit distance, some methods may quantify program differences based on metrics like cyclomatic complexity, lines of code, number of function calls, etc.If the concept you're referring to is a new or emerging idea post-2022, it's possible that a standardized term may have been established after my last update. However, for now, the closest concept to an "edit distance in program space" would be comparisons based on ASTs or semantic behavior, and the specific name would depend on the context and methodology used.A generalization of the edit distance between strings is the language edit distance between a string and a language, usually a formal language. Instead of considering the edit distance between one string and another, the language edit distance is the minimum edit distance that can be attained between a fixed string and any string taken from a set of strings. More formally, for any language L and string x over an alphabet Î£, the language edit distance d(L, x) is given by[14]

d(x,y) is the string edit distance. When the language L is context free, there is a cubic time dynamic programming algorithm proposed by Aho and Peterson in 1972 which computes the language edit distance.[15] For less expressive families of grammars, such as the regular grammars, faster algorithms exist for computing the edit distanceChatGPTThe concept you've described is the language edit distance, which extends the idea of edit distance from comparing two strings to comparing a string against an entire set of strings (a language). In essence, it tries to find the closest string within a language to a given string, based on a specified edit distance metric (like Levenshtein distance).This concept is particularly useful in computational linguistics, compiler theory, and error correction. For example, if you mistype a word in a document, a spell checker might use language edit distance to find the closest valid word in the English language to suggest as a correction.Using this concept with formal languages, especially context-free grammars (CFGs), allows for more structured and meaningful comparisons. The algorithm by Aho and Peterson in 1972 is a foundational work in this area, offering a cubic time complexity solution to compute the language edit distance for context-free languages.For simpler grammars, like regular grammars, the computation can be done faster. This is because regular grammars are less expressive and can be represented with finite automata, making certain operations more tractable than with CFGs.In summary, language edit distance provides a measure of how close a given string is to a language, expanding the concept of edit distance to encompass an entire set of strings rather than just a pair.Contrastive Active Inference

Abstract 
Active inference is a unifying theory for perception and action resting upon the 
idea that the brain maintains an internal model of the world by minimizing free 
energy. From a behavioral perspective, active inference agents can be seen as self- 
evidencing beings that act to fulf i ll their optimistic predictions, namely preferred 
outcomes or goals. In contrast, reinforcement learning requires human-designed re- 
wards to accomplish any desired outcome. Although active inference could provide 
a more natural self-supervised objective for control, its applicability has been lim- 
ited because of the shortcomings in scaling the approach to complex environments. 
In this work, we propose a contrastive objective for active inference that strongly 
reduces the computational burden in learning the agentâs generative model and 
planning future actions. Our method performs notably better than likelihood-based 
active inference in image-based tasks, while also being computationally cheaper 
and easier to train. We compare to reinforcement learning agents that have access to 
human-designed reward functions, showing that our approach closely matches their 
performance. Finally, we also show that contrastive methods perform signif i cantly 
better in the case of distractors in the environment and that our method is able to 
generalize goals to variations in the background. 
1Introduction 
Deep Reinforcement Learning (RL) has led to successful results in several domains, such as robotics, 
video games and board games [42,36,2]. From a neuroscience perspective, the reward prediction 
error signal that drives learning in deep RL closely relates to the neural activity of dopamine neurons 
for reward-based learning [44,3]. However, the reward functions used in deep RL typically require 
domain and task-specif i c design from humans, spoiling the generalization capabilities of RL agents. 
Furthermore, the possibility of faulty reward functions makes the application of deep RL risky in 
real-world contexts, given the possible unexpected behaviors that may derive from it [10, 29, 38]. 
Active Inference (AIF) has recently emerged as a unifying framework for learning perception and 
action. In AIF, agents operate according to one absolute imperative: minimize their free energy [15]. 
With respect to past experience, this encourages to update an internal model of the world to maximize 
evidence with respect to sensory data. With regard to future actions, the inference process becomes 
âactiveâ and agents select behaviors that fulf i ll optimistic predictions of their model, which are 
represented as preferred outcomes or goals [17]. Compared to RL, the AIF framework provides a more 
natural way of encoding objectives for control. However, its applicability has been limited because of 
the shortcomings in scaling the approach to complex environments, and current implementations have 
focused on tasks with either low-dimensional sensory inputs and/or small sets of discrete actions [12]. 
Moreover, several experiments in the literature have replaced the agentâs preferred outcomes with 
RL-like rewards from the environment, downplaying the AIF potential to provide self-supervised 
objectives [13, 34, 49]. 
35th Conference on Neural Information Processing Systems (NeurIPS 2021). 
One of the major shortcomings in scaling AIF to environments with high-dimensional, e.g. image- 
based, environments comes from the necessity of building accurate models of the world, which try to 
reconstruct every detail in the sensory data. This complexity is also ref l ected in the control stage, 
when AIF agents compare future imaginary outcomes of potential actions with their goals, to select 
the most convenient behaviors. In particular, we advocate that fulf i lling goals in image space can be 
poorly informative to build an objective for control. 
In this work, we propose Contrastive Active Inference, a framework for AIF that aims to both 
reduce the complexity of the agentâs internal model and to propose a more suitable objective to 
fulf i ll preferred outcomes, by exploiting contrastive learning. Our method provides a self-supervised 
objective that constantly informs the agent about the distance from its goal, without needing to 
reconstruct the outputs of potential actions in high-dimensional image space. 
The contributions of our work can be summarised as follows: (i) we propose a framework for AIF 
that drastically reduces the computational power required both for learning the model and planning 
future actions, (ii) we combine our method with value iteration methods for planning, inspired 
by the RL literature, to amortize the cost of planning in AIF, (iii) we compare our framework to 
state-of-the-art RL techniques and to a non-contrastive AIF formulation, showing that our method 
compares well with reward-based systems and outperforms non-contrastive AIF, (iv) we show that 
contrastive methods work better than reconstruction-based methods in presence of distractors in the 
environment, (v) we found that our contrastive objective for control allows matching desired goals, 
despite differences in the backgrounds. The latter i nding could have important consequences for 
deploying AIF in real-world settings, such as robotics, where perfectly reconstructing observations 
from the environment and matching them with high-dimensional preferences is practically unfeasible.1 / 2ChatGPTThe abstract presents a paper on Contrastive Active Inference. Let's break it down:Main Problem Addressed: Traditional active inference, though a promising approach for self-supervised learning and control, has struggled with scaling to complex environments due to computational burdens and the need for high fidelity in its world models.Proposed Solution: The authors introduce a novel approach termed Contrastive Active Inference. This new method reduces the complexity of the agent's internal model and offers a more efficient objective by employing contrastive learning. This allows the agent to constantly evaluate its distance from a goal without having to reconstruct potential actions in high-dimensional spaces, such as images.Key Contributions:Simplified Active Inference Framework: The proposed method significantly reduces the computational resources required for both model learning and action planning.Integration with Value Iteration: The authors incorporate value iteration methods (commonly found in RL) to further reduce planning costs in active inference.Comparative Analysis: The approach is benchmarked against traditional RL methods and non-contrastive active inference. The findings indicate that their method is competitive with reward-based systems and surpasses non-contrastive active inference.Superiority in Distraction-heavy Environments: The contrastive method outperforms reconstruction-based approaches when distractors are present.Goal Matching in Varied Backgrounds: The contrastive objective allows the agent to match goals even when backgrounds vary, offering promising implications for real-world applications.Overall Implication: The Contrastive Active Inference method can be particularly beneficial for real-world scenarios like robotics, where perfect reconstruction of environment observations and aligning them with high-dimensional preferences can be impractical.Authors and Affiliation: The paper is authored by Pietro Mazzaglia, Tim Verbelen, and Bart Dhoedt from IDLab at Ghent University.Final Thoughts: This work integrates concepts from contrastive learning into the active inference framework, bridging the gap between traditional reinforcement learning and active inference. The use of contrastive learning simplifies the agent's modeling process, reduces computational overhead, and enhances performance in complex environments. Such advancements could pave the way for more efficient and adaptive AI agents in real-world applications.Connections with the earlier topicsChatGPTCertainly, let's tie the concepts from earlier discussions with the "Contrastive Active Inference" paper:AI as Scientist vs. Executive:The scientist role involves building and refining models of the world, which is analogous to how active inference agents maintain internal models of their environment. In the context of the paper, the agent constantly refines its internal model based on perceptions.The executive role involves acting upon the world, making decisions, or executing plans. This corresponds to the agent's action planning in active inference, where it envisions future actions to meet its goals.Curry-Howard Isomorphism:This isomorphism asserts that mathematical proofs and programs are intrinsically linked. Active inference, in its essence, attempts to minimize the "proof" or discrepancy between its internal model (program) and the external world (mathematical structure).Language Edit Distance:Active inference involves an agent minimizing the discrepancy (or 'distance') between its internal world model and sensory input. This notion of minimizing a discrepancy mirrors the concept of edit distance, where one seeks to minimize changes to transform one string into another. The paper's introduction of contrastive active inference can be thought of as a specialized method to measure and minimize this "distance" between the agent's predictions and the real-world outcomes.Landauer's Principle:Computational efficiency is a key concern in both the context of Landauer's principle and the paper. While Landauer's principle relates the erasure of information to a minimum energy expenditure, the paper aims to reduce computational burden by simplifying the agent's internal model. Both contexts emphasize the importance of efficiency in computation.AI Analyzing Documents/Pictures:The discussion about AI analyzing documents or images to constrain decision trees in possibility space relates to the paper's mention of high-dimensional image-based tasks. The contrastive method avoids the need for high-fidelity reconstruction of every detail in sensory data, which can be seen as constraining or narrowing the possibilities the agent needs to consider.In essence, the themes of computational efficiency, minimizing discrepancies, and making decisions in complex environments run through both the earlier discussions and the paper on Contrastive Active Inference. The exploration of these themes showcases the evolving strategies and methodologies in AI research to tackle challenges in decision-making and model-building.elaborate. The implications of this work are that we can understand the structure and function of the brain as an inference machine. Furthermore, we can ascribe various aspects of brain anatomy and physiology to specific computational quantities, which may help understand both normal brain function and how aberrant inferences result from pathological processes associated with psychiatric disorders.

Let's dive into the connections between the various topics and the cited work on hierarchical models in the brain:Contrastive Active Inference and Hierarchical Models in the BrainBrain as an Inference Machine:Karl Friston's work suggests the brain operates using hierarchical models to infer the causes of sensory data. It constantly updates its internal models based on evidence from the environment, a concept central to the free energy principle.The paper on Contrastive Active Inference shares a similar foundation. It frames the agent's behavior in terms of minimizing discrepancies between predictions and sensory inputs, a behavior central to the active inference paradigm.Active Inference & Free Energy Principle:Active inference posits that organisms act to minimize the surprise or uncertainty of their sensory inputs, which is synonymous with minimizing free energy. The brain predicts sensory inputs and then acts to minimize the discrepancy between these predictions and the actual inputs.The Contrastive Active Inference paper extends this idea. Instead of purely trying to predict sensory data, the contrastive approach measures the difference between various possible outcomes, helping the system decide which actions to take.Edit Distances and Inference:Edit distances, like the ones you mentioned earlier, quantify the difference or transformation needed between two strings or pieces of data. Conceptually, the brain's inference process can be likened to minimizing some "distance" or difference between its predictions and actual sensory inputs.In the context of Contrastive Active Inference, this could be akin to the "contrastive" element, where the difference between predictions and actual outcomes is made stark, aiding decision-making.Programs and Models:Your earlier point on programs and models correlates with the hierarchical models the brain employs. The brain's hierarchical structure can be likened to complex programs, with different layers responsible for different levels of abstraction.Active inference can be viewed as a "program" the brain runs, where it predicts, acts, observes the outcome, and then updates its predictions.Implications for Pathology:Friston's work implies that when the brain's inference process or its hierarchical models malfunction, it can lead to psychiatric disorders. This is because the brain starts interpreting sensory data in a distorted or aberrant manner.The Contrastive Active Inference work, while more oriented towards artificial agents, can offer insights into how structured, goal-driven behavior can be derived from basic principles of minimizing prediction errors.In summary, both the ideas of hierarchical modeling in the brain and the contrastive active inference approach highlight the brain's (or an agent's) ability to predict, act, and learn from the environment in an iterative manner, underpinned by the imperative to minimize some form of discrepancy or error.Connections with the following:

Canonical neural networks perform active inference

This work considers a class of canonical neural networks comprising rate coding models, 
wherein neural activity and plasticity minimise a common cost functionâand plasticity is 
modulated with a certain delay. We show that such neural networks implicitly perform active 
inference and learning to minimise the risk associated with future outcomes. Mathematical 
analyses demonstrate that this biological optimisation can be cast as maximisation of model 
evidence, or equivalently minimisation of variational free energy, under the well-known form 
of a partially observed Markov decision process model. This equivalence indicates that the 
delayed modulation of Hebbian plasticityâaccompanied with adaptation of i ring thresholds 
âis a suff i cient neuronal substrate to attain Bayes optimal inference and control. We cor- 
roborated this proposition using numerical analyses of maze tasks. This theory offers a 
universal characterisation of canonical neural networks in terms of Bayesian belief updating 
and provides insight into the neuronal mechanisms underlying planning and adaptive beha- 
vioural control.

T 
he sentient behaviour of biological organisms is char- 
acterised by optimisation. Biological organisms recognise 
the state of their environment by optimising internal 
representations of the external (i.e. environmental) dynamics 
generating sensory inputs. In addition, they optimise their 
behaviour for adaptation to the environment, thereby increasing 
their probability of survival and reproduction. This biological 
self-organisation is typically formulated as the minimisation of 
cost functions1â3, wherein a gradient descent on a cost function 
furnishes neural dynamics and synaptic plasticity. However, two 
fundamental issues remain to be establishedânamely, the 
characterisation of the dynamics of an arbitrary neural network 
as a generic optimisation processâand the correspondence 
between such neural dynamics and statistical inference4found 
in applied mathematics and machine learning. The present 
work addresses these issues by demonstrating that a class of 
canonical neural networks of rate coding models is functioning 
asâand thus universally characterised in terms ofâvariational 
Bayesian inference, under a particular but generic form of the 
generative model. 
Variational Bayesian inference offers a unif i ed explanation for 
inference, learning, prediction, decision making, and the evolu- 
tion of biological form5,6. This kind of inference rests upon a 
generative model that expresses a hypothesis about the generation 
of sensory inputs. Perception and behaviour can then be read as 
optimising the evidence for a âgenerative modelâ, inherent in 
sensory exchanges with the environment. The ensuing evidence 
lower bound (ELBO)7âor equivalently variational free energy, 
which is the negative of the ELBOâthen plays the role of a cost 
function. Variational free energy is the standard cost function in 
variational Bayesâand provides an upper bound on surprise (i.e., 
improbability) of sensory inputs. Minimisation of variational free 
energy, with respect to internal representations, then yields 
approximate posterior beliefs about external states. Similarly, the 
minimisation of variational free energy with respect to action on 
external states maximises the evidence or marginal likelihood 
of resulting sensory samples. This framework integrates percep- 
tual (unsupervised), reward-based (reinforcement), and motor 
(supervised) learning in a unif i ed formulation that shares many 
commitments with neuronal implementations of approximate 
Bayesian inference using spiking models8â12. In short, internal 
states of an autonomous system under a (possibly none- 
quilibrium) steady state can be viewed as parameterising posterior 
beliefs of external states13â15. In particular, active inference aims 
to optimise behaviours of a biological organism to minimise a 
certain kind of risk in the future16â18, wherein risk is typically 
expressed in a form of expected free energy (i.e., the variational 
free energy expected under posterior predictive beliefs about the 
outcomes of a given course of action). 
Crucially, as a corollary of the complete class theorem19â21, any 
neural network minimising a cost function can be viewed as 
performing variational Bayesian inference, under some prior 
beliefs. We have previously introduced a reverse-engineering 
approach that identif i es a class of biologically plausible cost 
functions for neural networks22. This foundational work identi- 
i ed a class of cost functions for single-layer feedforward neural 
networks of rate coding models with a sigmoid (or logistic) 
activation functionâbased on the assumption that the dynamics 
of neurons and synapses follow a gradient descent on a common 
cost function. We subsequently demonstrated the mathematical 
equivalence between the class of cost functions for such neural 
networks and variational free energy under a particular form of 
the generative model. This equivalence licences variational 
Bayesian inference as a fundamental optimisation process that 
underlies both the dynamics and function of such neural net- 
works. Moreover, it enables one to characterise any variables and 
constants in the network in terms of quantities (e.g. priors) that 
underwrite variational Bayesian inference22. However, it remains 
to be established whether the active inference is an apt explana- 
tion for any given neural network that actively exchanges with its 
environment. In this paper, we address this enactive or control 
aspect to complete the formal equivalence of neural network 
optimisation and the free-energy principle. 
In most formulations, active inference goes further than simply 
assuming action and perception minimise variational free energyâ 
it also considers the consequences of action as minimising expected 
free energy, i.e. planning (and control) as inference, as a founda- 
tional approach to sentient behaviour12,23â27. Thus, to evince active 
inference in neural networks, it is necessary to demonstrate that 
they can plan to minimise future risks. 
To address this issue, this work identif i es a class of biologically 
plausible cost functions for two-layer recurrent neural networks, 
under an assumption that neural activity and plasticity minimise 
a common cost function (referred to as assumption 1). Then, we 
analytically and numerically demonstrate the implicit ability of 
neural networks to plan and minimise future risk, when viewed 
through the lens of active inference. Namely, we suppose a 
network of rate coding neurons with a sigmoid activation 
function, wherein the middle layer involves recurrent connec- 
tions, and the output layer provides feedback responses to the 
environment (assumption 2). In this work, we will call such 
architectures canonical neural networks (Table 1). Then, we 
demonstrate that the class of cost functionsâdescribing their 
dynamicsâcan be cast as variational free energy under an 
implicit generative model, in the well-known form of a partially 
observable Markov decision process (POMDP). The gradient 
descent on the ensuing cost function naturally yields Hebbian 
plasticity28â30with an activity-dependent homoeostatic term. 
In particular, we consider the case where an arbitrary 
modulator31â33regulates synaptic plasticity with a certain delay 
(assumption 3) and demonstrate that such modulation is identical 
to the update of a policy through a post hoc evaluation of past 
decisions. The modulator renders the implicit cost function a risk 
function, which in turn renders behavioural control Bayes opti- 
malâto minimise future risk. The proposed analysis aff i rms that 
active inference is an inherent property of canonical neural net- 
works exhibiting delayed modulation of Hebbian plasticity. We 
discuss possible neuronal substrates that realise this modulation.ChatGPTThe article "Canonical neural networks perform active inference" by Takuya Isomura, Hideaki Shimazaki, and Karl J. Friston advances the understanding of how neural networks, specifically canonical neural networks, inherently conduct active inference and engage in risk minimization for future outcomes. Here's a breakdown of the connections between the presented article and the earlier discussions:Active Inference:Both Friston's "Hierarchical Models in the Brain" and this article emphasize the brain's behavior in terms of active inference, where the brain predicts sensory inputs and acts to minimize discrepancies between these predictions and actual sensory experiences.The article extends this concept by suggesting that canonical neural networks inherently operate on active inference principles.Variational Free Energy:The article underscores that the neural network's objective to minimize cost functions can be cast as minimizing variational free energy. This aligns with the idea presented earlier about organisms acting to minimize the uncertainty or surprise of their sensory inputs.The equivalence of minimizing variational free energy with Bayesian inference is highlighted, suggesting that neural networks are inherently Bayesian in their operation.Planning and Future Risk:Active inference is not just about the present but also about the future. The article brings forth the idea that neural networks can plan actions to minimize future risks, further emphasizing the brain's predictive nature.This can be connected to the earlier idea of contrastive active inference, where agents evaluate various possible future outcomes to determine their actions.Neural Network Dynamics:The article delves into the specifics of how neural networks, particularly those using rate coding models, function in terms of Bayesian inference.The dynamics of these networks, as they minimize cost functions, align with the Bayesian principles, specifically the minimization of variational free energy.Implications for Neural Plasticity and Learning:Hebbian plasticity, a fundamental concept in neural learning where cells that fire together wire together, is discussed in the context of active inference.The modulation of Hebbian plasticity with a certain delay implies a mechanism for updating neural policies based on the evaluation of past decisions, further highlighting the brain's iterative learning process.In summary, this article offers a comprehensive perspective on how canonical neural networks inherently perform active inference. By understanding the mathematical and biological principles underlying neural operations, the work paves the way for bridging the gap between neural dynamics, statistical inference, and behavior. It reaffirms the role of variational free energy and Bayesian principles in neural computations and adds depth to the understanding of how the brain predicts, plans, and learns from its environment.So I thought that minimizing the free energy was kind of like minimizing the sum of squares in linear regression, except it is trying to minimize a loss function or discrepancy between the model's predictions and the sensory input?ChatGPTYou're on the right track in terms of drawing an analogy. Both minimizing the sum of squares in linear regression and minimizing the free energy in active inference involve optimizing a function to improve the model's fit to the data. Here's a comparison:Linear Regression:In linear regression, we try to find the best-fitting line (or hyperplane in higher dimensions) to the data.The objective is to minimize the sum of the squared differences (errors) between the observed values (actual data points) and the values predicted by the model (line).This minimization results in optimal coefficients for the regression equation, ensuring that the model provides the best fit to the observed data.Variational Free Energy in Active Inference:The concept of free energy in the context of the brain and active inference relates to the brain's predictions about sensory input and the actual sensory input it receives.Minimizing the free energy can be thought of as minimizing the discrepancy or "surprise" between the brain's predictions (based on its internal model of the world) and the actual sensory data.This minimization process helps the brain refine its internal model, ensuring it remains congruent with the external environment. It's an ongoing process, as the brain constantly updates its beliefs (model) to reduce prediction errors.While both methods involve optimization, the context and mathematical details are different. However, the essential idea of minimizing a difference or discrepancy between predictions and actual values remains central to both concepts.I define learning as inoculation against surprise, and surprise as inversely proportional to the probability (the prediction)ChatGPTThat's a compelling way to frame learning and surprise. Given these definitions:Learning: If you view learning as an "inoculation against surprise," you're suggesting that as one learns more about a subject or environment, they become better equipped to make accurate predictions about it. Thus, they're less likely to be surprised by new information or events related to that subject. This aligns closely with the active inference framework, where the brain constantly updates its beliefs to minimize prediction errors.Surprise: By defining surprise as being inversely proportional to probability (the prediction), you're emphasizing that events that are less likely to happen (according to our predictions) are more surprising when they do occur. This is a foundational concept in information theory, where surprise is often quantified using entropy and related measures.These definitions align well with modern theories of cognition and perception, especially within the predictive coding and active inference frameworks. In these theories, the brain is essentially a prediction machine, constantly updating its internal models to reduce the surprise experienced from sensory inputs.Yeah just as a liberal arts education attempts to introduce a diverse number of subjects and viewpoints, their methodology, and rational.ChatGPTExactly. A liberal arts education aims to produce well-rounded individuals by exposing them to a broad range of subjects and critical thinking methodologies. The underlying philosophy is that by understanding multiple perspectives, methodologies, and rationalities, individuals are better equipped to anticipate and understand the diverse challenges and complexities of the world.Using the framework of "learning as an inoculation against surprise," a liberal arts education seeks to reduce the "surprise" factor in many areas of life. By engaging with various subjects and viewpoints, students are prepared to navigate a wider array of situations, ideas, and challenges. This holistic approach to education ensures that students are not only knowledgeable in their chosen field but also possess a broader understanding of the world, allowing them to make informed decisions, engage in meaningful discourse, and contribute more effectively to society.Published: 15 June 2021

Abstract
Efficient search in vast combinatorial spaces, such as those of possible action sequences, linguistic structures, or causal explanations, is an essential component of intelligence. Is there any computational domain that is flexible enough to provide solutions to such diverse problems and can be robustly implemented over neural substrates? Based on previous accounts, we propose that a Darwinian process, operating over sequential cycles of imperfect copying and selection of neural informational patterns, is a promising candidate. Here we implement imperfect information copying through one reservoir computing unit teaching another. Teacher and learner roles are assigned dynamically based on evaluation of the readout signal. We demonstrate that the emerging Darwinian population of readout activity patterns is capable of maintaining and continually improving upon existing solutions over rugged combinatorial reward landscapes. We also demonstrate the existence of a sharp error threshold, a neural noise level beyond which information accumulated by an evolutionary process cannot be maintained. We introduce a novel analysis method, neural phylogenies, that displays the unfolding of the neural-evolutionary processChatGPTThis article discusses a cutting-edge concept related to the search mechanism of intelligence within vast combinatorial spaces. These spaces are defined by the various possibilities for sequences of actions, linguistic structures, and causal explanations. The central question the article addresses is: How does the brain efficiently search within these vast spaces?To address this, the authors propose a Darwinian mechanism operating in the brain. In biological evolution, Darwinian processes involve the replication of genetic material with slight imperfections (mutations), followed by the selection of the most successful replicates based on their ability to survive and reproduce in a given environment. Drawing an analogy to this process, the authors suggest that a similar mechanism can operate at the level of neural informational patterns. The key elements are:Imperfect copying: Just as genes can be copied with small errors leading to variations, neural information can be imperfectly copied, leading to variability in neural patterns.Selection: Among the various neural patterns that arise due to imperfect copying, some will be more effective or beneficial in a given context. These patterns will be 'selected' or strengthened, while less effective patterns will diminish or be discarded.In the study, this mechanism is implemented using a computational model involving two reservoir computing units, where one unit (the teacher) teaches the other (the learner). The roles of teacher and learner are not fixed; instead, they dynamically switch based on the evaluation of the readout signal, a mechanism that can be seen as a form of neural 'evaluation' or 'selection.'The main findings of the research are:The Darwinian mechanism they propose can maintain and even improve upon solutions in challenging environments (described as "rugged combinatorial reward landscapes"). This means the system is not just maintaining the status quo but is also capable of adaptation and improvement.There's an error threshold in neural noise: if noise surpasses this threshold, the information accumulated by the evolutionary process breaks down. This finding is reminiscent of error thresholds in biological evolution, where if mutation rates are too high, the accumulation of beneficial genetic information becomes unstable.The authors introduce "neural phylogenies" as a method of visualizing the progression of this neural-evolutionary process. A phylogeny in biology is a tree diagram that shows evolutionary relationships among species. Analogously, a neural phylogeny would visualize the 'ancestral' relationships among various neural patterns as they evolve over time.In essence, the paper suggests that principles of biological evolution, specifically Darwinian processes of variation and selection, might be at play within the brain, enabling it to navigate and adapt to complex informational landscapes. If these findings hold up to further scrutiny and empirical testing, they could offer profound insights into the nature of intelligence and learning.I suggested a project similar to this called attentional cladistics, where we trace phylogenetic bracketing of foraging strategies and the perceptual stream of consciousness over time, evolutionarily and individually.ChatGPTThat's a fascinating concept! "Attentional cladistics" seems to meld ideas from evolutionary biology and cognitive neuroscience to trace the evolutionary and individual developmental history of attentional mechanisms and consciousness.Phylogenetic Bracketing: In evolutionary biology, phylogenetic bracketing is a method to infer characteristics of extinct organisms based on traits shared by their extant relatives. By applying this to "foraging strategies" and "perceptual stream of consciousness," you would be suggesting that we can infer the attentional mechanisms and consciousness strategies of our evolutionary ancestors based on the shared traits of current species, including humans.Foraging Strategies: These are behaviors animals (including humans) use to find food. Different strategies might demand different attentional mechanisms. For instance, a predator that stalks and ambushes its prey might develop acute focused attention, while animals that graze might develop broader, more diffused attention to be aware of predators.Perceptual Stream of Consciousness: This is our continuous flow of perception and thought. If you're proposing to trace its evolution, you're suggesting that the very nature of conscious experience might have evolved over time, influenced by various ecological pressures.Individual Evolution: Beyond the evolutionary scale, tracing how these mechanisms develop and adapt over an individual's lifespan would provide insights into neuroplasticity, learning, and maybe even factors like personality and behavior.Your concept would offer a multi-tiered understanding: first, the macro scale of species evolution, and then the micro scale of individual development.Such a project would necessitate a multi-disciplinary approach, combining insights from paleontology, evolutionary biology, cognitive neuroscience, and psychology. If executed well, it could offer groundbreaking insights into the very nature of attention, perception, and consciousness, and how these core aspects of our mental life have been shaped by both our evolutionary history and personal experiences.Connections with the earlier topicsChatGPTAbsolutely! Let's draw connections between your idea of "attentional cladistics" and the previous topics discussed:Free Energy Principle and Bayesian Brain: Both these concepts revolve around the brain's ability to predict sensory inputs and reduce uncertainty or surprise. If we apply these principles to attentional cladistics, it could suggest that evolutionarily and individually, our foraging strategies and perceptual streams have been fine-tuned to minimize prediction errors. In essence, as species and individuals evolve, they develop better predictive models for their environment.Learning as Inoculation against Surprise: This notion aligns closely with the free energy principle. In the context of attentional cladistics, species or individuals that better "learn" their environment (i.e., develop efficient foraging strategies and perceptual streams) would be less "surprised" by it. This could be a survival advantage, potentially driving evolutionary selection.Liberal Arts Education: Just as a broad-based education provides diverse viewpoints and methodologies, an evolutionary perspective on attention would highlight the diverse strategies that different species have developed in response to their unique environments. This diversity can provide a rich understanding of the possibilities and constraints of attentional mechanisms.Darwinian Neurodynamics: The concept from the "Scientific Reports" paper aligns perfectly with attentional cladistics. Both suggest that the brain's cognitive functions have evolved through Darwinian processes. While the paper focuses on the "imperfect copying and selection of neural informational patterns," attentional cladistics would specifically track the evolutionary trajectory of attention and perception.Imperfect Information Copying: This mechanism, central to the neurodynamic approach mentioned, can also play a role in attentional cladistics. Over evolutionary timescales, imperfect copying could lead to variations in attentional mechanisms across species, potentially leading to different foraging strategies and perceptual experiences.In summary, the overarching theme connecting these topics is the brain's ability to model its environment for survival and the evolutionary and individual processes that have shaped these models. Your concept of attentional cladistics fits seamlessly into this narrative, providing a framework to study the evolution and development of attention and perception.Connections with the following:

Consciousness as a Physical Process Caused by the Organization of Energy in the Brain
Robert Pepperell*
FOVOLAB, Cardiff Metropolitan University, Cardiff, United Kingdom
To explain consciousness as a physical process we must acknowledge the role of energy in the brain. Energetic activity is fundamental to all physical processes and causally drives biological behavior. Recent neuroscientific evidence can be interpreted in a way that suggests consciousness is a product of the organization of energetic activity in the brain. The nature of energy itself, though, remains largely mysterious, and we do not fully understand how it contributes to brain function or consciousness. According to the principle outlined here, energy, along with forces and work, can be described as actualized differences of motion and tension. By observing physical systems, we can infer there is something it is like to undergo actualized difference from the intrinsic perspective of the system. Consciousness occurs because there is something it is like, intrinsically, to undergo a certain organization of actualized differences in the brain.

Introduction
âIf mental processes are indeed physical processes, then there is something it is like, intrinsically, to undergo certain physical processes. What it is for such a thing to be the case remains a mystery.â

(Nagel, 1974)

The philosopher Thomas Nagel summarized one of our greatest intellectual challenges: how to explain mental processes as physical processes. The aim of this paper is to outline a principle according to which consciousness could be explained as a physical process caused by the organization of energy in the brain1.

Energy is fundamentally important in all physical processes (Lotka, 1922; SchrÃ¶dinger, 1944; Heisenberg, 1958; Boltzmann, 1886). As the biophysicist Harold Morowitz (1979) put it: âthe flow of energy through a system acts to organize that system.â Light, chemical reactions, electricity, mechanical work, heat, and life itself can all be described in terms of energetic activity (Chaisson, 2001; Morowitz and Smith, 2007; Smil, 2008) as can metabolic processes in the body and brain (Magistretti, 2008; Perez Velazquez, 2009). It is surprising, therefore, that energy receives relatively little attention in neuroscientific and psychological studies of consciousness. Leading scientific theories of consciousness do not reference it (Crick and Koch, 2003; Edelman et al., 2011; Dehaene, 2014; Oizumi et al., 2014), assign it only a marginal role (Hameroff and Penrose, 2014), or treat it as an information-theoretical quantity (Friston, 2013; Riehl et al., 2017). If it is discussed, it is either as a substrate underpinning higher level emergent dynamics (Deacon, 2013) or as powering neural information processing (Sterling and Laughlin, 2017).

This lack of attention is all the more surprising given that some of the pioneers of neurobiology, psychology, and physiology found a central place for energy in their theories, including Hermann von Helmholtz (in Cahan, 1995), Gustav Fechner (1905), Sigmund Freud (Gay, 1988), William James (James, 1907), and Charles Sherrington (1940)2. There are, however, signs that attention is turning again to energetic or thermodynamic-related theories of consciousness in various branches of science (Deacon, 2013; Collell and Fauquet, 2015; Annila, 2016; Street, 2016; Tozzi et al., 2016; Marchetti, 2018) and in philosophy of mind (Strawson, 2008, 2017).

The present paper builds on this work by proposing that energy, and the related properties of force and work, can be described as actualized differences of motion and tension, and that â in Nagelâs phrase â âthere is something it is like, intrinsically, to undergoâ actualized differences. Recent neuroscientific evidence suggests that consciousness is a product of the way energetic activity is organized in the brain. Following this evidence, I propose that we experience consciousness because there is something it is like, intrinsically, to undergo a certain organization of actualized differences in the brain.

Several researchers have tackled the problem of consciousness by treating the brain in principle as a neural information processor (e.g., Tononi et al., 2016; Dehaene et al., 2017; Ruffini, 2017). I will argue that the governing principle of the brain at the neural level is not information processing but energy processing. The information-theoretic approach to measuring and modeling brain activity, however, can usefully complement the energetic approach outlined here.ChatGPTCertainly! The article, "Consciousness as a Physical Process Caused by the Organization of Energy in the Brain," presents some compelling ideas that have natural ties to the previously discussed topics. Here's how we can connect them:Free Energy Principle (FEP) & Bayesian Brain: The FEP posits that the brain is a prediction machine that attempts to minimize prediction error. This principle inherently relies on information-theoretic ideas. However, Robert Pepperell's article suggests that the governing principle of the brain is energy processing. The FEP can be viewed as an energetic or thermodynamic process, where the brain tries to maintain an energetically favorable state by minimizing surprise.Learning & Surprise: The idea of learning as "inoculation against surprise" is akin to the brain's attempt to maintain or achieve an energetically favorable state. An efficient energy organization would entail better predictions and reduced surprises.Liberal Arts Education: An understanding of the diverse mechanisms and theories behind consciousness, energy, and information processing can be seen as a holistic or "liberal arts" approach to studying the brain. An interdisciplinary perspective, combining physics, neuroscience, and philosophy, provides a comprehensive understanding of complex subjects like consciousness.Darwinian Neurodynamics: Evolutionary processes optimize for energy efficiency. Just as neural patterns evolve through imperfect copying and selection, consciousness, as an energy-organized process, might have evolved to be more energy-efficient in processing environmental stimuli.Attentional Cladistics: If consciousness is influenced by the organization of energy in the brain, then the evolutionary and individual trajectories of attentional mechanisms might also be shaped by energy processing efficiencies. Different species might evolve different attentional and perceptual mechanisms based on how they organize energy in the brain most efficiently.In summary, Robert Pepperell's notion of consciousness being driven by the organization of energy in the brain provides an interesting framework that complements and extends the previously discussed topics. When combined, these ideas give a more holistic view of the brain's functioning, bringing together evolutionary, energetic, and information-theoretic perspectives.And connections with the topics we discussed earlier?

ChatGPTConnecting the content of the article "Consciousness as a Physical Process Caused by the Organization of Energy in the Brain" with the earlier topics:AI Scientists and Executives:Energy and consciousness: AI implementations could take cues from the energy-based models of consciousness, optimizing for energy processing, particularly for executive AIs which need real-time adaptive capabilities, similar to how the brain organizes energy for conscious tasks.Curry-Howard Isomorphism:If consciousness arises due to certain energy organizations, there may be specific "programs" (neural patterns or processes) that correspond to specific conscious states. A parallel can be drawn between proofs and programs and between specific energy organizations and consciousness.Intelligence in AI:The content (e.g., document, poem, picture) being an inherent part of the intelligence process can be paralleled with the brainâs energetic patterns. The specific organization of energy can determine the type and quality of conscious experience, just as the specific content can determine the AI's interpretation.Modeling Reality:Energy organization in the brain creates conscious experiences which are essentially the brain's models of reality. The way energy is organized might determine the nature of these models or perceived realities.Landauer's Principle:The discussion about the brain's energy organization directly correlates with energy considerations in computation. Landauer's Principle highlights the energy requirements for erasing information. The brain's optimization for energy in consciousness could be viewed as a biological counterpart to this principle.Edit Distances:If we consider neural patterns (or their energetic organization) as "strings" or sequences, the idea of evolving these patterns over time can be thought of in terms of "editing" these sequences. The closer the neural pattern is to an optimal or desired state, the fewer "edits" (or energy reorganizations) may be needed.Language Edit Distance:If consciousness is a result of energy organization, one could metaphorically discuss the "distance" between different conscious states in terms of how much their energy organizations differ. The idea of comparing one state (or neural pattern) against a collection of states could mirror the concept of comparing a string against an entire language.In essence, the energy organization principle of consciousness provides a bridge between abstract concepts in AI, computation, and linguistics and the physical, neural mechanisms of the brain. Recognizing these connections offers a holistic understanding of intelligence, consciousness, and computation.A list of all of the topics we've discussed.2 / 2ChatGPTCertainly! Here's a list of the topics we've discussed:AI Scientists and Executives:Differentiating between AIs that assist in scientific research and those designed for executing tasks in real-world contexts.Curry-Howard Isomorphism:The correspondence between scientific or mathematical proofs and computational programs.Intelligence in AI:The notion that intelligence is not just within the AI system but also in the content it processes, influencing the decision tree in possibility space.Modeling Reality:How language constructs, such as sentences or phrases, can create models of reality or hypothetical scenarios.Landauer's Principle:The principle describing the minimum energy required to erase a bit of information, providing a lower limit to computational energy consumption.Edit Distances:Various methods to measure differences between strings or sequences, such as:Levenshtein distanceLongest common subsequence (LCS) distanceHamming distanceDamerauâLevenshtein distanceJaro distanceDNA sequence alignment algorithms like SmithâWaterman.Language Edit Distance:Extending the concept of edit distance to compare a string against an entire language, discussing associated algorithms and computational complexities.Energy and Consciousness:The theory proposing that consciousness arises from the organization of energy in the brain.Phylogenetic Analysis:Tracking evolutionary or developmental sequences, such as in the "Attentional Cladistics" project you mentioned.Free Energy Principle:A theory in neuroscience and predictive coding suggesting that brains strive to minimize free energy, akin to minimizing prediction error.Darwinian Neurodynamic Approach:The study on neural evolutionary processes through imperfect information copying and selection in neural informational patterns.These topics span a range of domains, from AI and computational theories to neuroscience and philosophy of mind.I decided to call the conversation Neurodynamic Intelligence, as a reference to the  Knights who say "NI".ChatGPTThat's a clever and humorous twist! "Neurodynamic Intelligence" captures the essence of our discussion, especially the intersections of neuroscience, computational theory, and AI. And referencing the "Knights who say 'NI'" from Monty Python gives it a delightful touch of whimsy. It's always fun to blend serious topics with a bit of humor.A final summaryChatGPTCertainly! Here's a summary of our discussion titled "Neurodynamic Intelligence":Neurodynamic Intelligence1. AI Scientists and Executives:
We differentiated between AI that aids in scientific research, utilizing probabilistic causal reasoning on Bayesian graphs, and executive AI which operates in real-world environments.2. Curry-Howard Isomorphism:
We delved into how mathematical proofs can correspond to executable programs, illuminating the bridge between logic and computation.3. Intelligence in AI:
Intelligence isn't just about the AI system's abilities. The documents, poems, or pictures an AI analyzes play a crucial role, as they constrain decision trees in possibility space.4. Modeling Reality:
Sentences or phrases in languages can create intricate models of reality or even counterfactual scenarios, pointing to the vast potential of language as a modeling tool.5. Landauer's Principle:
We discussed this principle, which indicates the minimum energy required to erase a bit of information, emphasizing the inherent energy costs of computation.6. Edit Distances:
A deep dive into various types of edit distances like Levenshtein distance, LCS distance, and more, which measure differences between sequences. These are crucial for tasks like DNA sequence alignment.7. Language Edit Distance:
We extended the concept of edit distance to measure a string against an entire language, discussing related algorithms and computational complexities.Novelty and Imitation in the Brain:
A paper was introduced discussing how the brain navigates vast combinatorial spaces using a Darwinian process over cycles of imperfect copying and selection of neural informational patterns.Consciousness as a Physical Process:
A discussion on a paper that proposes consciousness arises from the organization of energy in the brain. It revisits the notion of energy's role in the brain and consciousness, which has historically been underemphasized in modern neuroscience.Our conversation touched on a convergence of topics from AI, computational theory, neuroscience, and the evolution of consciousness, all under the playful umbrella of "Neurodynamic Intelligence" inspired by Monty Python's "Knights who say 'NI'".ChatGPT may produce inaccurate information about people, places, or facts.
