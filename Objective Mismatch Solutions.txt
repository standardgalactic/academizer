Abstract 
Model-based reinforcement learning (MBRL) is a powerful framework for data-eff i ciently learning 
control of continuous tasks. Recent work in MBRL has mostly focused on using more advanced 
function approximators and planning schemes, with little development of the general framework. 
In this paper, we identify a fundamental issue of the standard MBRL framework ��� what we call 
objective mismatch. Objective mismatch arises when one objective is optimized in the hope that a 
second, often uncorrelated, metric will also be optimized. In the context of MBRL, we characterize 
the objective mismatch between training the forward dynamics model w.r.t. the likelihood of the 
one-step ahead prediction, and the overall goal of improving performance on a downstream control 
task. For example, this issue can emerge with the realization that dynamics models effective for 
a specif i c task do not necessarily need to be globally accurate, and vice versa globally accurate 
models might not be suff i ciently accurate locally to obtain good control performance on a specif i c 
task. In our experiments, we study this objective mismatch issue and demonstrate that the likelihood 
of one-step ahead predictions is not always correlated with control performance. This observation 
highlights a critical limitation in the MBRL framework which will require further research to be 
fully understood and addressed. We propose an initial method to mitigate the mismatch issue by 
re-weighting dynamics model training. Building on it, we conclude with a discussion about other 
potential directions of research for addressing this issue. 
1. Introduction 
Model-based reinforcement learning (MBRL) is a popular approach for learning to control nonlinear 
systems that cannot be expressed analytically (Bertsekas, 1995; Sutton and Barto, 2018; Deisenroth 
and Rasmussen, 2011; Williams et al., 2017). MBRL techniques achieve the state of the art perfor- 
mance for continuous-control problems with access to a limited number of trials (Chua et al., 2018; 
Wang and Ba, 2019) and in controlling systems given only visual observations with no observations 
of the original system���s state (Hafner et al., 2018; Zhang et al., 2019). MBRL approaches typically 
learn a forward dynamics model that predicts how the dynamical system will evolve when a set of 
control signals are applied. This model is classically i t with respect to the maximum likelihood of 
a set of trajectories collected on the real system, and then used as part of a control algorithm to be 
executed on the system (e.g., model-predictive control). 
In this paper, we highlight a fundamental problem in the MBRL learning scheme: the objective 
mismatch issue. The learning of the forward dynamics model is decoupled from the subsequent

This paper discusses a fundamental issue in Model-based reinforcement learning (MBRL) called "objective mismatch". This mismatch arises when one objective is optimized with the hope that a second, often uncorrelated, metric will also be optimized. Specifically in MBRL, there's a mismatch between training the forward dynamics model with respect to the likelihood of one-step ahead prediction, and the overall goal of improving performance on a downstream control task.
The researchers argue that globally accurate models may not necessarily be effective for a specific task and that a locally accurate model might not be globally effective. Through experiments, they demonstrated that the likelihood of one-step ahead predictions doesn't always correlate with control performance, suggesting a critical limitation in the MBRL framework.
To mitigate the mismatch issue, the paper proposes re-weighting the dynamics model training and concludes with a discussion about other potential research directions for addressing this problem.

3. Objective Mismatch and its Consequences 
The Origin of Objective Mismatch: The Subtle Differences between MBRL and System Iden- 
tif i cationMany ideas and concepts in model-based RL are rooted in the i eld of optimal control 
and system identif i cation (Sutton, 1991; Bertsekas, 1995; Zhou et al., 1996; Kirk, 2012; Bryson, 
2018). In system identif i cation (SI), the main idea is to use a two-step process where we i rst

generate (optimal) elicitation trajectories��to i t a dynamics model (typically analytical), and 
subsequently we apply this model to a specif i c task. This particular scheme has several assumptions:

tories are designed off-line to cover the en- 
tire state-action space. (Right) In MBRL 
instead, the data collected during learning 
isoftenconcentratedintrajectories towards 
the goal, with other parts of the state-action 
space being largely unexplored (grey area). 
1) the elicitation trajectories collected cover 
the entire state-action space; 2) the presence 
of virtually inf i nite amount of data; 3) the 
global and generalizable nature of the model 
resulting from the SI process. With these as- 
sumptions, the theme of system identif i cation 
is effectively to collect a large amount of data 
covering the whole state-space to create a suf- 
i ciently accurate, global model that we can 
deploy on any desired task, and still obtain 
good performance. If these assumptions are 
true, using the closed-loop of MBRL should 
further improve performance over traditional 
open-loop SI (Hjalmarsson et al., 1996). 
When adopting the idea of learning the 
dynamics model used in optimal control for 
MBRL, it is important to consider if these 
assumptions still hold. The assumption of 
virtuallyinf i nitedataisvisiblyintensionwith 
the explicit goal of MBRL which is to reduce 
the number of interactions with the environment by being ���smart��� about the sampling of new 
trajectories. In fact, in MBRL the off l ine data collection performed via elicitation trajectories is 
largely replaced by on-policy sampling to explicitly reduce the need to collect large amount of 
data (Chua et al., 2018). Moreover, in the MBRL setting the data will not usually cover the entire 
state-action space, since they are generated by optimizing one task. In conjunction with the use of 
non-parametric models, this results in learned models that are strongly biased towards capturing 
the distribution of the locally accurate, task-specif i c data. Nonetheless, this is not an immediate 
issue since the MBRL setting rarely tests for generalization capabilities of the learned dynamics. 
In practice, we can now see how the assumptions and goals of system identif i cation are in contrast 
with the ones of MBRL. Understanding these differences and the downstream effects on algorithmic 
approach is crucial to design new families of MBRL algorithms. 
Objective MismatchDuring the MBRL process of iteratively learning a controller, the reward 
signalfromtheenvironmentisdilutedbythetrainingofaforwarddynamicsmodelwithaindependent 
metric, as shown in Fig. 1. In our experiments, we highlight that the minimization of some network 
training cost does not hold a strong correlation to maximization of episode reward. As dynamic 
environments becoming increasingly complex in dimensionality, the assumptions of collected data 
distributions become weaker and over-f i tting to different data poses an increased risk. 
Formally, the problem of objective mismatch appears as two de-coupled optimization problems 
repeated over many cycles of learning, shown in Eq.(1a,b), which could be at the cost of minimizing 
the i nal reward. This loop becomes increasingly diff i cult to analyze as the dataset used for model 
training changes with each experimental trial ��� a step that is needed to include new data from 
previously unexplored states. In this paper we characterize the problems introduced by the interaction of these two optimization problems, but, for simplicity, we do not consider the interactions added by 
the changes in the dynamics-data distribution during the learning process. In addition, we discuss 
potential solutions, but do not make claims about the best way to do so, which is left for future work.

This section of the paper examines the origins of objective mismatch and its consequences in Model-Based Reinforcement Learning (MBRL).
It starts by comparing MBRL with System Identification (SI). In SI, a two-step process is used to first generate trajectories and fit a dynamics model, then apply this model to a specific task. The paper notes several assumptions inherent in SI that may not hold for MBRL:
The trajectories collected cover the entire state-action space.
There's virtually infinite data.
The model resulting from the SI process is globally generalizable.
However, these assumptions might not apply to MBRL, which aims to reduce interactions with the environment by being "smart" about the sampling of new trajectories. Furthermore, the data in MBRL will not usually cover the entire state-action space as they're generated by optimizing one task.
The paper then discusses Objective Mismatch in the context of MBRL. During the iterative learning of a controller in MBRL, the reward signal from the environment gets diluted by the training of a forward dynamics model with an independent metric. The authors have observed that minimizing network training cost doesn't necessarily correlate with maximizing episode reward.
Finally, the paper highlights that objective mismatch appears as two decoupled optimization problems that are repeated over multiple learning cycles, which can potentially minimize the final reward. The paper concludes by acknowledging that while it identifies the problems introduced by these two optimization issues, it doesn't propose a definitive solution, leaving it as a topic for future research.

4. Identifying Objective Mismatch 
We now experimentally study the issue of objective mismatch to answer the following: 1) Does the 
distribution of models obtained from running a MBRL algorithm show a strong correlation between 
LL and reward? 2) Are there signs of sub-optimality in the dynamics models training process that 
could be limiting performance? 3) What model differences are ref l ected in reward but not in LL? 
Experimental SettingIn our experiments, we use two popular RL benchmark tasks: the cartpole 
(CP) and half cheetah (HC). For more details on these tasks, model parameters, and control properties 
see Chua et al. (2018). We use a set of 3 different datasets to evaluate how assumptions in MBRL 
affect performance. We start with high-reward, expert datasets (cartpoler > 179, half cheetah 
r > 10000) to test if on-policy performance is linked to a minimal, optimal exploration. The two 
other baselines are datasets collected on-policy with the PETS algorithm and datasets of sampled 
tuples representative of the entire state space. The experiments validate over a) many re-trained 
models and b) many random seeds, to account for multiple sources of stochasticity in MBRL. 
Additional details and experiments can be found at: https://sites.google.com/view/mbrl-mismatch. 
4.1. Exploration of Model Loss vs Episode Reward Space 
The MBRL framework assumes a clear correlation between model accuracy and policy performance, 
which we challenge even in simple domains. We aggregatedMcp= 1000cartpole models and 
Mhc= 2400half cheetah models trained with PETS. The relationships between model accuracy and 
reward on data representing the full state-space (grid or sampled) show no clear trend in Fig. 3c,f. 
The distribution of rewards versus LL shown in Fig. 3a-c shows substantial variance and points 
of disagreement overshadowing a visual correlation of increased reward and LL. This bi-model 
distribution on the half cheetah expert dataset, shown in Fig. 3(d)subf i gure, relates to a unrecoverable 
failure mode in early half cheetah trials. The contrast between Fig. 3(e)subf i gure and Fig. 3d,f shows 
a considerable per-dataset variation in the state-action transitions. The grid and sampled datasets, 
Fig. 3c,f, suffer from decreased likelihood because they do not overlap greatly with on-policy data 
from PETS. 
If the assumptions behind MBRL were fully valid, the plots should show a perfect correlation 
between LL and reward. Instead these results conf i rm that there exists an objective mismatch which 
manifests as a decreased correlation between validation loss and episode reward. Hence, there is no 
guarantee that increasing the model accuracy (i.e., the LL) will also improve the control performance. 
4.2. Model Loss vs Episode Reward During Training 
This section explores how model training impacts performance at the per-epoch level. These 
experiments shed light onto the impact of the strong model assumptions outlined in Sec. 3. As a 
dynamics model is trained, there are two key inf l ection points- the i rst is the training epoch where

This section presents experimental studies to investigate the issue of objective mismatch in Model-Based Reinforcement Learning (MBRL). The researchers want to answer whether there's a strong correlation between log-likelihood (LL) and reward, if sub-optimalities exist in the dynamics model training that could limit performance, and what model differences are reflected in reward but not in LL.
The experiments are performed on two popular reinforcement learning tasks: the cartpole (CP) and half cheetah (HC). Three different datasets are used to evaluate how assumptions in MBRL affect performance. These datasets include expert datasets, datasets collected on-policy with the PETS algorithm, and datasets of sampled tuples representative of the entire state space.
The research finds that there is no clear correlation between model accuracy and policy performance, even in simple domains. This challenges the assumption that model accuracy should correlate with policy performance in MBRL. The experiments indicate a significant variation in state-action transitions per dataset.
The results confirm that an objective mismatch exists in MBRL, as there's a decreased correlation between validation loss and episode reward. This means there's no guarantee that increasing model accuracy (LL) will improve the control performance.
The second part of the experiment explores how model training impacts performance at the per-epoch level. The analysis suggests two key inflection points during model training: when the episode reward is maximized, and when error on the validation set is optimized. The implications of these inflection points are not elaborated on here, but are likely explored in a subsequent section of the paper.

hand, while maintaining knowledge of nearby transitions for robustness under a stochastic controller. 
Intuitively, it is more important to model accurately the dynamics along the optimal trajectory, rather 
than modeling part of the state-action space that might never be visited to solve the task. For this 
reason, we now propose a model loss aimed at alleviating this issue. �� 
Figure 9:We propose to re-weight 
the loss of the dynamics 
model w.r.t. the distance? 
from the optimal trajec- 
tory. 
Given a element of a state space(si,ai), we quantify the 
distance of any two tuples,di,j. With this distance, we re- 
weight the loss,l(y), of points further from the optimal policy 
to be lower, so that points in the optimal trajectory get a weight 
��(y) = 1, and points at the edge of the grid dataset used in 
Sec. 4 get a weight��(y) = 0. Using the expert dataset dis- 
cussed in Sec. 4 as a distance baseline, we generated 25e6 tu- 
ples of(s,a,s0)by uniformly sampling across the state-action 
space of cartpole. We sorted this data by taking the minimum 
orthogonal distance,d���, from each of the points to the200ele- 
ments in the expert trajectory. To create different datasets that 
range from near-optimal to near-global, we vary the distance 
bound?, and number of training points,S. This simple form of 
re-weighting the neural network loss , shown in Eq.(2a,b,c), 
demonstrated an improvement in sample eff i ciency to learn 
the cartpole task, as seen in Fig. 8. Unfortunately, this ap- 
proach is impractical when the optimal trajectory is not known 
in advance. However, future work could develop an iterative 
method to jointly estimate and re-weight samples in an online 
training method to address objective mismatch.

6. Discussion, Related Work, and Future Work 
Objective mismatch impacts the performance of MBRL ��� our experiments have gone deeper into this 
fragility. Beyond the re-weighting of the LL presented in Sec. 5, here we summarize and discuss 
other relevant works in the community. 
Learning the dynamics model to optimize the task performanceMost relevant are research 
directions on controllers that directly connect the reward signal back to the controller. In theory, 
this exactly solves the model mismatch problem, but in practice the current approaches have proven 
diff i cult to scale to complex systems. One way to do this is by designing systems that are fully 
differentiable and backpropagating the task reward through the dynamics. This has been investigated 
with differentiable MPC (Amos et al., 2018) and Path Integral control (Okada et al., 2017), Universal 
Planning Networks (Srinivas et al., 2018) propose a differentiable planner that unrolls gradient 
descent steps over the action space of a planning network. Bansal et al. (2017) use a zero-order 
optimizer to maximize the controller���s performance without having to compute gradients explicitly. 
Add heuristics to the dynamics model structure or training process to make control easierIf 
it is infeasible or intractable to shape the dynamics of a controller, an alternative is to add heuristics 
to the training process of the dynamics model. These heuristics can manifest in the form of learning a

latent space that is locally linear, e.g., in Embed to Control and related methods (Watter et al., 2015), 
by enforcing that the model makes long-horizon predictions (Ke et al., 2019), ignoring uncontrollable 
parts of the state space (Ghosh et al., 2018), detecting and correcting when a predictive model steps 
off the manifold of reasonable states (Talvitie, 2017), adding reward signal prediction on top of 
the latent space Gelada et al. (2019), or adding noise when training transitions Mankowitz et al. 
(2019). Farahmand et al. (2017); Farahmand (2018) also attempts to re-frame the transitions to 
incorporate a notion of the downstream decision or reward. Finally, Singh et al. (2019) proposes 
stabilizability constraints to regularize the model and improve the control performance. None of 
these paper formalize or explore the underlying mismatch issue in detail. 
Continuing ExperimentsOur experiments represent an initial exploration into the challenges of 
objective mismatch in MBRL. Sec. 4.2 is limited to cartpole due to computational challenges of 
training with large dynamics datasets and Sec. 4.3 could be strengthened by def i ning quantitative 
comparisons in controller performance. Additionally, these effects should be quantif i ed in other 
MBRL algorithms such as MBPO (Janner et al., 2019) and POPLIN (Wang and Ba, 2019). 
7. Conclusion 
This paper identif i es, formalizes and analyzes the issue of objective mismatch in MBRL. This 
fundamental disconnect between the likelihood of the dynamics model, and the overall task reward 
emerges from incorrect assumptions at the origins of MBRL. Experimental results highlight the 
negative effects that objective mismatch has on the performance of a current state-of-the-art MBRL 
algorithm. In providing a i rst insight on the issue of objective mismatch in MBRL, we hope future 
work will deeply examine this issue to overcome it with a new generation of MBRL algorithms.

This section proposes a solution to the objective mismatch issue by re-weighting the loss of the dynamics model relative to the distance from the optimal trajectory. This approach is expected to increase accuracy for relevant state-action dynamics while reducing focus on less important areas of the state-action space.
However, this approach is challenging when the optimal trajectory isn't known in advance. The paper suggests that future work could iteratively estimate and re-weight samples during an online training process to address this problem.
Next, it provides an overview of related works and potential future work. Some relevant studies include those that focus on controllers directly linked to the reward signal, aiming to solve the model mismatch problem. Despite this approach theoretically solving the issue, it has proven difficult to scale in complex systems. The paper also discusses works that introduce heuristics into the training process or dynamics model structure to simplify control.
The experiments conducted in this paper represent an initial investigation into the challenges of objective mismatch in MBRL. The paper acknowledges certain limitations and suggests that further experiments could quantify these effects in other MBRL algorithms like MBPO and POPLIN.
In conclusion, the paper identifies and analyzes the issue of objective mismatch in MBRL, pointing out that this issue arises from incorrect assumptions made in MBRL. It is hoped that future work will address this issue more comprehensively, potentially leading to the development of new MBRL algorithms.

Certainly! This paper is essentially trying to solve a problem in model-based reinforcement learning (MBRL), a type of artificial intelligence approach.
In MBRL, an AI learns how to make decisions by creating a model of the world and then using that model to predict what will happen when it takes certain actions. This helps the AI to choose the best action to reach its goal, whether that's winning a game, controlling a robot, or anything else.
However, there's a problem known as 'objective mismatch'. This means the AI's goal (maximizing the reward it gets) doesn't match up perfectly with how the model is trained (maximizing the likelihood of predicting the correct next state).
The researchers propose a way to address this mismatch by adjusting the importance of different parts of the model. They suggest making the parts of the model that are directly along the best path more important, and the other parts less important. However, this approach can be challenging if we don't know the best path in advance.
They also discuss other research that has tried to solve this problem, either by directly tying the reward to the model's predictions or by adding rules and heuristics to make it easier for the model to learn the correct behavior.
The paper calls for more research in this area, to further understand this problem and develop better solutions. They hope this will lead to more effective MBRL algorithms in the future.

This appendix discusses the effect of the dataset distribution when learning a model for reinforcement learning. In particular, it's focusing on how the efficiency of learning can be suppressed when data not relevant to the task is included in the training set for the dynamics model.
The authors used the CartPole environment, a classic benchmark in reinforcement learning, as an example. They found that when they included additional irrelevant transitions (transitions that do not contribute to solving the task) in the training set, the dynamics model spent more effort learning these transitions. This led to a decrease in the model's log-likelihood and slowed down the learning process as more relevant transitions were added to the training set.
They also performed experiments with different numbers of "babbling roll-outs" (a term likely referring to random, exploratory actions). These roll-outs, consisting of 10 steps each, ranged from 20 to 2000, leading to datasets with 200 to 20000 transitions. The results showed a regression in the learning speed when more irrelevant data was included.
The authors highlight the importance of the exploration vs exploitation trade-off in reinforcement learning, emphasizing the need to be selective with the data used for training models. Essentially, adding too much irrelevant data can slow down learning, so careful balance must be maintained.

Could you try explaining it in a different way?
1 / 1
ChatGPT
ChatGPT
Absolutely! Let's think about it in the context of learning to play a sport, say basketball.
When learning to play basketball, you would want to practice relevant skills like dribbling, shooting, and passing. Let's call this "relevant data". Now imagine if you spent a lot of your practice time doing unrelated activities, such as learning to juggle or play chess. This would be like "irrelevant data".
The appendix suggests that including too much irrelevant data in the training process (in this case, spending too much time on juggling or chess) slows down the learning process. Why? Because you're using up precious practice time on things that don't directly improve your basketball skills.
So, the authors ran an experiment using a common test for machine learning models (the CartPole environment). They included "irrelevant data" in the training process, which was represented by random actions that don't help to balance the pole. They found that the more irrelevant data they included, the slower the model learned how to balance the pole.
In essence, they emphasize that when training a machine learning model, it's important to focus on the right kind of data. Adding too much irrelevant data to the learning process can distract the model and slow down the learning progress.

ChatGPT
ChatGPT
Yes, indeed. The findings have several practical implications, especially for those designing and training machine learning models:
Quality of data matters
: It's not just about collecting a huge amount of data. The data's relevance and quality are crucial for efficient learning.
Data Collection Strategy
: Careful consideration should be given when deciding the exploration versus exploitation trade-off in data collection strategy. Exploration refers to seeking out new, potentially useful data while exploitation refers to making the best use of current data.
Efficient use of computational resources
: By focusing on relevant data, we can reduce the computational burden, leading to more efficient use of resources, faster training times, and potentially better model performance.
Model robustness
: Models trained with a lot of irrelevant data may become overfitted to these irrelevant aspects, which can decrease their performance on actual, relevant tasks.
Selective Learning
: These findings also hint at the potential benefits of more sophisticated learning techniques that can differentiate between useful and irrelevant data, prioritizing learning from the most relevant examples.
In summary, this study highlights the importance of thoughtful data selection and management in the machine learning process.

Objective mismatch arises when one objective is optimized in the hope that a 
second, often uncorrelated, metric will also be optimized. In the context of MBRL, we characterize 
the objective mismatch between training the forward dynamics model w.r.t. the likelihood of the 
one-step ahead prediction, and the overall goal of improving performance on a downstream control 
task.
1 / 1
ChatGPT
ChatGPT
Objective mismatch in Model-based Reinforcement Learning (MBRL) refers to a situation where the immediate objective of the algorithm (such as optimizing for accurate one-step ahead predictions in a dynamics model) doesn't necessarily align with the ultimate goal (like maximizing the overall performance in a control task).
In other words, while training the forward dynamics model, the algorithm might focus on accurately predicting the immediate next state based on the current state and action. However, this might not always result in the best long-term decision-making, which is the real objective in reinforcement learning.
This discrepancy can lead to suboptimal performance in the learning process and limit the overall effectiveness of the MBRL approach. It highlights the need for designing learning objectives that align closely with the end goal of the task.

It reminds me of this Why does modern life revolve around objectives? From how science is funded, to improving how children are educated -- and nearly everything in-between -- our society has become obsessed with a seductive illusion: that greatness results from doggedly measuring improvement in the relentless pursuit of an ambitious goal. InWhy Greatness Cannot Be Planned, Stanley and Lehman begin with a surprising scientific discovery in artificial intelligence that leads ultimately to the conclusion that the objective obsession has gone too far. They make the case that great achievement can't be bottled up into mechanical metrics; that innovation is not driven by narrowly focused heroic effort; and that we would be wiser (and the outcomes better) if instead we whole-heartedly embraced serendipitous discovery and playful creativity.Controversial at its heart, yet refreshingly provocative, this book challenges readers to consider life without a destination and discovery without a compass

ChatGPT
This book "Why Greatness Cannot Be Planned: The Myth of the Objective" by Kenneth O. Stanley and Joel Lehman indeed echoes the concept of objective mismatch we just discussed in the context of Model-based Reinforcement Learning (MBRL).
In MBRL, a specific objective, like optimizing one-step ahead predictions, is pursued relentlessly, in hopes that it will lead to an improved performance in the overall task. However, this isn't always the case.
Similarly, Stanley and Lehman argue that our society's focus on strictly defined objectives and mechanical metrics might not always yield the desired outcomes in various domains, be it scientific research, education, or innovation. They suggest that greatness often stems from serendipitous discovery and creativity rather than the narrow pursuit of pre-set objectives.
The overarching theme is that an over-emphasis on specific objectives can potentially limit our capability to explore, discover, and innovate, and it might be beneficial to allow for more flexibility and open-endedness in our pursuits. This perspective challenges the conventional wisdom around goal setting and encourages us to re-evaluate how we approach achievements and progress, in AI research and beyond.

Can you give some more related examples?
1 / 1
ChatGPT
ChatGPT
Sure, here are some examples that illustrate this idea in different domains:
Education
: Traditional education systems focus on grades and test scores as objectives. Students are taught to study with the objective of achieving high grades, which doesn't necessarily mean they're deeply understanding the material or developing critical thinking skills. On the contrary, an education system that emphasizes learning and understanding over grading may lead to better long-term academic and life outcomes.
Business
: Companies often set very specific sales or growth targets. While these goals can drive short-term performance, they can also lead to myopic decisions and may miss out on opportunities for long-term strategic development or innovation. For instance, investing in employee training or customer relationship might not have an immediate pay-off, but can significantly benefit the company in the long run.
Research & Development (R&D)
: In R&D, setting a very specific objective can limit the scope of exploration and potentially overlook unexpected discoveries or innovations. For instance, penicillin was discovered by Alexander Fleming due to an unplanned contamination in his petri dishes - a prime example of a groundbreaking discovery that couldn't have been planned or objectively targeted.
Healthcare
: If a healthcare system is solely focused on treating diseases (an objective), it may not invest adequately in preventative healthcare measures. While treating diseases is certainly important, focusing on preventative care could lead to overall healthier populations and potentially lower healthcare costs in the long term.
These examples underline the argument made by Stanley and Lehman that rigid objective-based planning might not always lead to the best outcomes, and that there's value in serendipity, exploration, and a more holistic approach.

So it makes me think of teaching to the test, managerialism, pre-mature optimization, and hastily generalizations.
1 / 1
ChatGPT
ChatGPT
Absolutely, those are excellent examples of the pitfalls of overemphasizing objectives or measurements:
Teaching to the test
: This is when education becomes focused on preparing students to pass standardized tests, often at the expense of broader learning and critical thinking skills. The objective (high test scores) doesn't necessarily align with the ultimate goal of education, which is to prepare students for life and work in the real world.
Managerialism
: This is the belief in the value of professional managers and of the concepts and methods they use. Overemphasis on quantitative measures, bureaucratic processes, and control mechanisms can stifle creativity, flexibility, and employee morale. The objective (efficient management) may not always lead to the ultimate goal of a healthy, innovative, and productive organization.
Premature optimization
: In software development, this refers to spending a lot of effort on optimizing parts of a program that aren't critical to performance. The objective (optimization) isn't necessarily aligned with the ultimate goal, which is often to create software that's maintainable, robust, and meets users' needs.
Hasty generalization
: This is a fallacy in which a conclusion is drawn from insufficient evidence. It's a kind of over-simplification that can lead to misunderstandings and poor decisions. The objective (quick decision-making or problem-solving) doesn't necessarily align with the ultimate goal of making wise and informed decisions.
Each of these examples illustrates how overemphasizing specific objectives can lead to unintended consequences or suboptimal outcomes. It underscores the need for a more balanced approach that respects the complexity and unpredictability of real-world situations.

Connections with Dynamic programming by Richard Bellman and Sagan's Demon-Haunted world.
1 / 1
ChatGPT
ChatGPT
Dynamic programming, pioneered by Richard Bellman, is an optimization approach used in mathematical programming for making a sequence of interrelated decisions. It breaks a larger problem into smaller subproblems and solves each only once, storing their solutions. It's especially suitable for decision problems under uncertainty.
In "The Demon-Haunted World: Science as a Candle in the Dark," Carl Sagan emphasizes the power of skeptical thinking and the scientific method. He argues that science is not just a collection of facts, but a way of interrogating the universe with a fine understanding of human fallibility.
Here are some connections between these two works and our discussion:
Dynamic programming and objectives
: In dynamic programming, the objective is to find an optimal solution by breaking down the problem. However, the method assumes that an optimal solution to the whole problem can be found by finding optimal solutions to the subproblems. This is an example of objective mismatch if the subproblem solutions don't add up to an optimal whole problem solution. This parallels our discussion on objective mismatch in reinforcement learning models, where optimizing for one objective doesn't necessarily lead to the optimal outcome for the overarching goal.
Sagan's scientific skepticism and objectives
: Sagan emphasizes that we should approach claims with skepticism and base our conclusions on solid evidence. This can be related to the concept of not accepting objectives at face value. Instead, we should critically assess whether the objectives we're trying to optimize indeed lead us to our desired outcomes. This skepticism can help avoid the pitfalls of overemphasizing objectives that may not contribute to the overall goal.
Sagan's scientific method and Dynamic programming
: Both espouse a step-by-step, systematic approach to problem-solving, emphasizing the importance of evidence (in the form of experimental data or subproblem solutions).
Both works underline the importance of being aware of our human biases and limitations, and they remind us that a narrow focus on specific objectives can sometimes blind us to the larger picture.

I also wanted to bring up sphexishness and syntactitude, that is, according to Hofstadter, the a-moral nature of grammar.
1 / 1
ChatGPT
ChatGPT
These are indeed fascinating concepts introduced by Douglas Hofstadter:
Sphexishness
: Hofstadter borrows the term from the behavior of the Sphex wasp, an insect that repeats the same sequence of actions obsessively, without any ability to adapt if anything interferes with its routine. In a broader sense, Hofstadter uses 'sphexishness' to refer to rigid, mechanistic behavior that lacks true understanding or the ability to adapt to new circumstances. This aligns with our discussion on model-based reinforcement learning, where algorithms can be "sphexish" in that they rigidly stick to learned policies without the ability to adjust based on changes in the environment.
Syntactitude
: This is a term Hofstadter uses to describe the "mindless" following of rules or syntax without any comprehension of meaning. He refers to it as the 'amoral nature of grammar.' It highlights the concept that syntax (or a set of rules) can be followed without understanding the underlying meaning or semantics. This can be compared to models trained on specific objectives, following the 'syntax' of optimization without grasping the 'semantics' or true meaning behind the broader goal.
Both these concepts emphasize the difference between mere rule-following behavior and true understanding or flexible adaptability, a topic that's very relevant in the field of artificial intelligence and machine learning.

ChatGPT
ChatGPT
Here's a summary of the topics we've discussed and their interconnections:
Model-Based Reinforcement Learning (MBRL)
: This is a technique in AI where a model of the environment is used to make decisions. It includes the concept of optimizing one objective (like the likelihood of one-step ahead prediction) in hopes of improving performance on a control task. This introduces the concept of objective mismatch.
Objective Mismatch
: It occurs when the improvement of one objective does not necessarily lead to the improvement of the primary goal, particularly in MBRL. This concept can be linked to other domains such as education and business.
"Why Greatness Cannot Be Planned: The Myth of the Objective"
: This book by Stanley and Lehman argues against the societal obsession with objectives and highlights the importance of serendipitous discovery and creativity. This idea opposes objective mismatch in MBRL and is connected to other areas like education (teaching to the test) and business (managerialism, premature optimization).
"Dynamic Programming" by Richard Bellman
: This mathematical method, used for solving complex problems by breaking them down into simpler steps, has parallels in MBRL, where the task is broken down into a series of decisions based on the model of the environment.
"The Demon-Haunted World" by Carl Sagan
: This book encourages critical thinking and skepticism, which are crucial when considering the use of objectives and the potential for objective mismatch in any field.
Teaching to the test, Managerialism, Premature Optimization, and Hasty Generalizations
: These are examples of real-life situations where objective mismatch can occur, similar to what can happen in MBRL.
Sphexishness and Syntactitude (Douglas Hofstadter's concepts)
: These concepts critique the mechanistic following of rules without true understanding or flexibility. They can be connected to the objective mismatch problem in MBRL, as models might only follow rules without understanding the broader goal.
Overall, all these topics converge on the central theme of objective mismatch and the importance of balancing rigid rule-following with broader understanding and adaptability.

A final summary.
1 / 1
ChatGPT
ChatGPT
We've had an in-depth discussion on the theme of objective mismatch, primarily through the lens of Model-Based Reinforcement Learning (MBRL). MBRL can fall into the trap of optimizing one metric, like the likelihood of a one-step ahead prediction, in the hope of enhancing overall performance on a control task. This potential disconnect is known as objective mismatch.
This concept extends beyond MBRL into other domains such as education, business, and AI planning. We've drawn parallels with ideas from the book "Why Greatness Cannot Be Planned: The Myth of the Objective", which argues against our societal obsession with objectives and encourages a more serendipitous approach to discovery and creativity.
Examples of objective mismatch were also drawn from real-life scenarios such as teaching to the test, managerialism, premature optimization, and hasty generalizations. The mathematical methodology of dynamic programming and the skeptical worldview from Carl Sagan's "The Demon-Haunted World" also relate to this theme.
Lastly, we examined Douglas Hofstadter's concepts of "Sphexishness" and "Syntactitude", which criticize the blind adherence to rules without deep understanding or flexibility, analogous to the problems in MBRL and objective mismatch.
In essence, our discussion emphasized the importance of aligning our specific objectives with our broader goals, and the need for flexibility and understanding over rigid rule-following across multiple domains.

1 / 1
ChatGPT
ChatGPT
Throughout our conversation, we've discussed various aspects of the problem of objective mismatch, but we've also touched on some potential ways to address this issue:
Balance Exploration and Exploitation
: Careful exploration and exploitation trade-offs are crucial. In the MBRL context, selective data usage for model training could be beneficial instead of utilizing all available data indiscriminately.
Fostering Flexibility and Creativity
: Embracing serendipity and creativity can lead to unexpected breakthroughs and successes. This principle, derived from the book "Why Greatness Cannot Be Planned," encourages a shift away from strict objective-driven approaches.
Aim for Deeper Understanding
: Hofstadter's concept of "Syntactitude" suggests that it's not enough to blindly follow rules (like a grammar or a model); one must understand the principles behind these rules and be ready to flexibly apply them based on the situation.
Realign Objectives
: Frequently reassess and realign smaller objectives to ensure they contribute positively to the broader goal. Avoid becoming too fixated on a single measure of success.
Learn from Mistakes
: Rather than striving for immediate perfection, allow for mistakes and learn from them. This idea relates to the concept of "premature optimization" where trying to make something perfect in its initial stages can hinder overall progress and innovation.
In general, the key advice to address objective mismatch is to promote a balance between strategic planning and spontaneous creativity, to ensure that short-term objectives do not overshadow or conflict with the ultimate goals.

In conclusion, the problem of "Objective Mismatch" reflects a pervasive issue in our modern, goal-obsessed society. From machine learning models to education and business strategies, we often become entrapped by the allure of concrete objectives, inadvertently neglecting the broader, more abstract end-goals.
However, solutions do exist. By maintaining a careful balance between exploration and exploitation, fostering an environment of creativity and serendipity, aiming for deeper understanding, realigning objectives as needed, and learning from our missteps, we can navigate this complex landscape. Ultimately, it is not about dismissing objectives altogether, but about ensuring they serve as effective tools rather than becoming misleading distractions.
This discourse on "Objective Mismatch" invites us all to reconsider our approaches towards our individual and collective goals. It serves as a reminder that sometimes, the path to greatness does not lie in stringent adherence to an objective, but in the flexibility, creativity, and wisdom to adapt to the ever-changing dynamics of our surroundings.
