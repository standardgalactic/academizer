Windows Key + E
on your keyboard.
Access Folder Options

Change the Setting

In the Folder Options dialog, switch to the "General" tab if it's not already selected.
Under the "Browse folders" section, select the option "Open each folder in its own window".
Apply and OK

what does launch folder windows in a separate process do?
ChatGPT
ChatGPT
The "Launch folder windows in a separate process" option in Windows 10 alters how the operating system handles File Explorer processes. When this option is enabled, each File Explorer window runs as a separate process. Here's what this means and its implications:
Stability and Reliability
:
Increased Stability
: If one File Explorer window crashes, it won't affect other open windows since they are running in separate processes.
Isolation of Problems
: Helps in isolating problems. If a particular folder or operation is causing issues, it won't bring down the entire File Explorer functionality.
Performance Impact
:
Resource Usage
: Running each window in a separate process can increase the overall resource usage (like memory and CPU). This might slightly affect performance, especially on systems with limited resources.
Slower Response
: On older or less powerful systems, this might result in slower response times when opening new folders or managing files.
Troubleshooting
:
Easier Troubleshooting
: When an issue occurs, it's easier to identify and close the problematic window without affecting other operations you might be doing in File Explorer.
Use Cases
:
This option is particularly useful for power users who work with multiple folders simultaneously and require a more stable and isolated environment.
It's also beneficial when dealing with unstable network locations or external drives, where one problematic connection shouldn't affect the entire File Explorer experience.
In summary, enabling "Launch folder windows in a separate process" can enhance the stability of your File Explorer experience at the cost of slightly increased resource usage. It's a trade-off between stability and efficiency, and whether you enable it should depend on your specific needs and the capability of your system.
