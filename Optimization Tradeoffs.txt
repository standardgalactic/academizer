Abstract
This work addresses the autonomous organization of biological systems. It does so by considering the boundaries of biological systems, from individual cells to Home sapiens, in terms of the presence of Markov blankets under the active inference schemeâa corollary of the free energy principle. A Markov blanket defines the boundaries of a system in a statistical sense. Here we consider how a collective of Markov blankets can self-assemble into a global system that itself has a Markov blanket; thereby providing an illustration of how autonomous systems can be understood as having layers of nested and self-sustaining boundaries. This allows us to show that: (i) any living system is a Markov blanketed system and (ii) the boundaries of such systems need not be co-extensive with the biophysical boundaries of a living organism. In other words, autonomous systems are hierarchically composed of Markov blankets of Markov blanketsâall the way down to individual cells, all the way up to you and me, and all the way out to include elements of the local environment.1 / 1ChatGPTChatGPTThe article titled "The Markov blankets of life: autonomy, active inference and the free energy principle" by Michael Kirchhoff, Thomas Parr, Ensor Palacios, Karl Friston, and Julian Kiverstein addresses the topic of autonomous organization in biological systems. The abstract highlights the concept of Markov blankets and their significance under the active inference scheme, which is derived from the free energy principle. A Markov blanket defines the statistical boundaries of a system. The article explores how a collection of Markov blankets can form a global system with its own Markov blanket, illustrating the presence of nested and self-sustaining boundaries in autonomous systems. It emphasizes that living systems are Markov blanketed systems and that their boundaries do not necessarily align with the physical boundaries of a living organism. The article suggests that autonomous systems are hierarchically structured with Markov blankets at different levels, from individual cells to human beings, and extending to elements of the local environment.1 / 11. Introduction
Organisms show a tendency to self-organize into a coherent whole despite them comprising a multiplicity of nested systems. They also continuously work to preserve their individual unity, thus tending to maintain a boundary that separates their internal states from their external milieu ([1]; see also [2]). These tendencies speak to the autonomous organization of biological systems.

This paper addresses the self-organization of autonomous organization in biological systems by asking how Markov blankets of living systems self-organize via active inferenceâa corollary of the free energy principle. A Markov blanket defines the boundaries of a system (e.g. a cell or a multi-cellular organism) in a statistical sense. It is a statistical partitioning of a system into internal states and external states, where the blanket itself consists of the states that separate the two. The states that constitute the Markov blanket can be further partitioned into active and sensory states. Here, states stand in for any variable that locates the system at a particular point in state space; for example, the position and momentum of all the particles constituting a thermodynamic systemâright through to every detail of neuronal activity that might describe the state of the brain. In the thermodynamic example, internal states would correspond to the thermodynamic system (e.g. a gas) in question; the external states would constitute a heat bath; and the Markov blanket could be the states of a container that mediates (directed) exchange between the heat bath and internal states. For an embodied central nervous system, the active and sensory states correspond to the states of all actuators or effectors and sensory organs, respectively.

Statistically, the existence of a Markov blanket means external states are conditionally independent of internal states, and vice versa, as internal and external states can only influence each other via sensory and active states. The presence of the conditional independencies implied by a Markov blanket inducesâas shown in Friston [3]âactive inference. Active inference, in its simplest formulation, describes the tendency of random dynamical systems to minimize (on average) their free energy, where free energy is an upper bound on (negative) marginal likelihood or evidence (i.e. the probability of finding the system in a particular state, given the system in question). This implies that the kind of self-organization of Markov blankets we consider results in processes that work entirely to optimize evidence, namely self-evidencing dynamics underlying the autonomous organization of life, as we know it. In Bayesian statistics, the evidence is known as âmodelâ evidence, where we can associate the internal states with a model of the external states.

We approach the self-organization of Markov blankets and processes of model optimization that ensue in terms of an optimality principle; namely, the minimization of free energy [4]. Free energy was classically defined in terms of thermodynamic principles, denoting a measure of energy available to a system to do useful work (e.g. maintaining a particular speed in a Watt governor or photosynthesis in plants). The free energy we refer to here is an information-theoretic analogue of the thermodynamic quantity. Free energy is a bound on âsurprisalâ (or negative model evidence) or more simply âsurpriseâ. The time average of surprise is entropy (a measure of uncertainty), so the minimization of free energy through time ensures that entropy is bounded. One can understand surprisal as a measure of how unlikely an observation would be by associating a system's sensory state with an observation or sensory sample [5]. Reducing free energy is therefore the same as optimizing Bayesian model evidence (negative surprisal) for a model (the system) reflected in the probability distributions over sensory data sampled by a system [6]. Crucially, this allows one to explain self-assembly of Markov blankets in terms of approximate Bayesian inference and probabilistic beliefs that are implicit in a system's interactions with its local surroundings [7]. This teleological (Bayesian) interpretation of dynamical behaviour in terms of optimization allows us to think about any system that possesses a Markov blanket as some rudimentary (or possibly sophisticated) âagentâ that is optimizing something; namely, the evidence for its own existence. This means we can regard the internal states (and their Markov blanket) as, in some sense, autonomous.

In this paper, we take the internal and active states of a Markov blanket to minimize free energy via active inference. The scope of this formulation is extremely broad. It applies to systems such as coupled pendulums that one would not readily recognize as autonomous. This raises the question of whether the Markov blanket formulation of biological systems is over-broad and thereby explanatorily empty with respect to autonomy. We show that this worry can be handled by formulating a novel distinction between âmere active inferenceâ and âadaptive active inferenceâ, as only the latter enables modulation of an organism's sensorimotor coupling to its environment. From adaptive active inference we argue that organisms comprise a multiplicity of Markov blankets, the boundaries of which are neither fixed nor stable. We do this by suggesting that an ensemble of Markov blankets can self-organize into a global or macroscopic system that itself has a Markov blanket. This allows us to provide an illustration of how autonomous systems are realized by multiple self-evidencing and nested Markov blankets. This construction implies that a living system is composed of Markov blankets of Markov blankets [8]âreaching all the way down to cellular organelles and DNA [9] and all the way out to elements of the environment [10].

The paper is organized as follows. In Â§2 we introduce the Markov blanket concept in the context of active inference under the free energy principle. In Â§3 we distinguish between mere active inference and adaptive active inference. It is argued that only the latter kind of active inference enables autonomous organization. In Â§4 we turn to develop the notion of nested Markov blankets, i.e. Markov blankets of Markov blankets.
cales of sensorimotor consequences.1 / 1ChatGPTChatGPTThe introduction of the paper discusses the tendency of organisms to self-organize and maintain boundaries that separate their internal states from the external environment. It introduces the concept of Markov blankets, which define the statistical boundaries of a system and partition it into internal and external states. The presence of a Markov blanket implies that internal and external states are conditionally independent and can only influence each other through sensory and active states.The paper explores how Markov blankets self-organize through active inference, which is a tendency of random dynamical systems to minimize free energy. Free energy, in this context, is an information-theoretic measure related to the optimization of Bayesian model evidence. The minimization of free energy ensures that entropy is bounded and can be understood as optimizing the system's probabilistic beliefs and interactions with the environment.The authors propose an optimality principle based on the minimization of free energy to explain the self-assembly of Markov blankets. They introduce the distinction between "mere active inference" and "adaptive active inference," where the latter allows for the modulation of an organism's sensorimotor coupling to the environment. The paper argues that organisms consist of multiple Markov blankets, which are not fixed or stable boundaries. They suggest that an ensemble of Markov blankets can self-organize into a global system, forming nested Markov blankets.The structure of the paper is outlined, with Section 2 introducing the Markov blanket concept in the context of active inference. Section 3 discusses the distinction between mere and adaptive active inference and their implications for autonomous organization. Section 4 focuses on nested Markov blankets, exploring Markov blankets of Markov blankets.1 / 1
2. The Markov blanket and active inference
A Markov blanket constitutes (in a statistical sense) a boundary that sets something apart from that which it is not. Hence, it is a statistical partitioning of states into internal and external states that are separated by a Markov blanketâcomprising active and sensory states. This shows that internal and external states are conditionally independent, as they can only influence one another via active and sensory states. Formally, a Markov blanket renders a set of states, internal and external states, conditionally independent of one another. That is, for any variable A, A is conditionally independent of B, given another variable, C, if and only if the probability of A and B given C can be written as p(A|C) and p(B|C). In other words, A is conditionally independent of B given C if, when C is known, knowing A provides no further information about B [11]. This maps on to the Markov blanket shown in figure 1.

In this figure, the Markov blanket for node {5} is the union of its parents {2,3}, the children of {5}, which are {6,7}, and the parents' children {4}. Hence, {5} = {6,7} U {2,3} U {4} = {2,3,4,6,7}. The union of {5} does not include {1}. This highlights that {1} and {5} are conditionally independent given {2,3,4,6,7}. It also illustrates that, once the union of {5} is given, the probability of {5} will not be affected by the probability of {1}. Formally, {5} is conditionally independent of {1} given {2,3,4,6,7}, if P({5}|{1}, {2,3,4,6,7}) = P({5}|{2,3,4,6,7}). This means that, once all the neighbouring variables for {5} are known, knowing the state of {1} provides no additional information about the state of {5}. It is this kind of statistical neighbourhood for {5} that is called a Markov blanket [12].

The cell is an intuitive example of a living system with a Markov blanket. Without possessing a Markov blanket a cell would no longer be, as there would be no way by which to distinguish it from everything else. This is to say that, if the Markov blanket of a cell deteriorates, there will be no evidence for its existence, and it will cease to exist [13]. This means that the identity ofâor the evidence forâany given biological system is conditioned on it having a Markov blanket. So the biological world is a world populated by Markov blankets.

Biological systems have a capacity to maintain low-entropy distributions over their internal states (and their Markov blanket) despite living their lives in changing and uncertain circumstances. This means that biological systems can be cast as engaging in active inference, given that internal and active states of a system with a Markov blanket can be shown to maintain the structural and functional integrity of such a system. To gain some intuition for the motivations behind this formulation, consider that the independencies established by a Markov blanket realize a co-dependence between internal states and external states conditioned on sensory and active states.

The partitioning rule governing Markov blankets illustrates that external statesâwhich are âhiddenâ behind the Markov blanketâcause sensory states, which influence, but are not themselves influenced by, internal states, while internal states cause active states, which influence, but are not themselves influenced by, external states [7]. Internal and external states can therefore be understood as influencing one another in a continuous and reciprocal fashion, given dependencies between sensory and active states. The independencies established by a Markov blanket are then suggestive of an elemental form of active inference, where internal and active states are directly involved in maintaining the structural and functional integrity of the Markov blanket [7]. This is because active inference rests on the assumption that actionâupon which perception dependsâminimizes uncertainty or surprise about the causes of an agent's sensory states [14]. Active inference therefore places an upper bound on surprise, i.e. action drives an organism's internal states toward a free energy minima. We develop this point in the remainder of this section.

Active inference is a cornerstone of the free energy principle. This principle states that for organisms to maintain their integrity they must minimize variational free energy. Variational free energy bounds surprise because the former can be shown to be either greater than or equal to the latter. It follows that any organism that minimizes free energy thereby reduces surpriseâwhich is the same as saying that such an organism maximizes evidence for its own model, i.e. its own existence. In other words, self-evidencing behaviour is equivalent to statistical inference [11]. To see this, consider, first,

Display Formula
where s refers to sensory states, a to active states and r to internal states. The notation F(s, a, r) denotes the variational free energy of internal states and their Markov blanket, Inline Formula refers to the negative log probability or surprise conditioned on a generative model and Inline Formula is the KullbackâLeibler (KL) divergence between two probability densities: the variational density, q(Ï|r), and the posterior density, p(Ï|s, a).
Crucially, this equality gives a Bayesian interpretation of variational free energy. The negative log likelihood or probability is the same as surprise, while the KL divergence measures the discrepancy between the variational density and the true posterior. Minimizing free energy by changing internal states can only reduce the divergence between beliefs about external states (the variational density) and the true posterior density given the states of the Markov blanket. We can think of this as a form of perception. Minimizing free energy by changing the active states can only change the surprise or model evidence. This constitutes a form of action that underwrites self-evidencing. We now consider this in more detail.

This interpretation means that changing internal states is equivalent to inferring the most probable, hidden causes of sensory signals in terms of expectations about states of the environment. Hidden causes are called hidden because they can only be âseenâ indirectly by internal states through the Markov blanket via sensory states. As an example, consider that the most well-known method by which spiders catch prey is via their self-woven, carefully placed and sticky web. Common for web- or niche-constructing spiders is that they are highly vibration sensitive. If we associate vibrations with sensory observations, then it is only in an indirect sense that one can meaningfully say that spiders have âaccessâ to the hidden causes of their sensory worldâi.e. to the world of flies and other edible âcrittersâ. It is in this sense that one should understand a Markov blanket as establishing a statistical boundary separating internal states from external states. To then act on inferred states of the world means to actively secure evidence that I am what I am; namely, a critter-eating creature.

In a neurobiological setting, Markov blankets can be âfoundâ at each level of the brain's hierarchy, which allows us to associate the brain with a hierarchical Bayesian networkâone that is organized such that higher levels in the cortical hierarchy infer (i.e. predict) the states at the level below, all âthe way down to the changing states of our sensory receptors and physical actuatorsâ [15, p. 5]. It has proved very helpful to think of exchanges between internal and external states (across the Markov blanket) in terms of a variational free energy-minimizing scheme called predictive coding. In these formulations, free energy can be associated with prediction errors; namely, the difference between sensory states and their prediction is based upon internal states. In predictive coding, predictions are made from the âtop downâ, while prediction error or local surprise is propagated up the hierarchy until any residual error signal is eliminated through updating or parametrizing Bayesian beliefs. This, in turn, enables a system's inferences to acquire a âgripâ on the hidden causes of sensory input [16,17].

If we imagine the brain as a hierarchical or nested set of Markov blankets, then the Markov blanket at any particular level in the brain's hierarchy must comprise active and sensory states, where the active states influence lower levels (i.e. external peripheral Markov blankets) and can be regarded as predictions, while prediction errors play the role of sensory states that influence the higher levels (i.e. internal Markov blankets). This coupled exchange of influences minimizes prediction errors at all levels of the hierarchy; thereby constituting (an internalized) form of active inference and implicit free energy minimization.

More generally, belief parametrization is captured by the KL divergence above. This is a measure of the discrepancy between current beliefs (the variational density) and the true posterior distribution. Specifically, it is a measure of the residual (or relative) surprise between the two probability distributions. When the free energy is minimized, the variational density is approximately equal to the posterior distribution. The better this approximation, the smaller the divergence. This means that the variational density approximates exactly the same quantity that Bayesian inference seeks to optimize. This is made clear through the following expression of Bayes' rule:

Display Formula
Bayesâ rule states that the (posterior) probability, p, of a state, Ï, given some data (sensations), s, is equal to the probability of s given Ï multiplied by the prior probability of Ï, divided by the prior probability of s. The relationship between free energy minimization and Bayes' rule demonstrates that internal states and their Markov blanket can be understood as engaging in approximate Bayesian inferenceâoptimizing their (approximate) posterior beliefs over a model as new sensations are experienced ([18]; for a critique see [15]). This is the Bayesian brain hypothesis [4,19,20].

Active inference reminds us that it is not only internal (e.g. neural) states that perform approximate Bayesian inference, but also active states. This embeds the view of the brain as a Bayesian inference machine within the context of embodied (active) inference, formularizing action as the process of selectively sampling sensory data to minimize surprise about their hidden causes ([21]; see also [16,22,23]). To see this, consider that the relative entropy specified by the KL divergence cannot be less than zero. The simplest and most intuitive way by which to illustrate this is that the KL divergence measures how different two distributions are. This means that its minimum should be the point at which the two distributions are equal, i.e. that the difference between the two probability distributions is zero. Mathematically one can show that free energy is an upper bound on surprise by considering the following inequality:

Display Formula
Display Formula
This inequality states that variational free energy bounds surprise, which follows from the fact that the KL divergence cannot be less than zero, i.e. the smallest difference is zero itself. This inequality can also be shown to follow from Jensen's inequality (see appendix A). Moreover, this implies (Inline Formula): given that the expected (E) surprise averaged over time is equal to Shannon entropy, Inline Formula, over internal states and their Markov blanket given a generative model, it follows that the expected variational free energy averaged over time, Inline Formula, of internal states and their Markov blanket is a bound on entropy. This inequality has several non-trivial implications. We emphasize two below.

First, any system that minimizes entropy by acting to minimize uncertainty about the hidden causes of its sensations must have a model of the kind of regularities it expects to encounter in its environment. This means that, over (phylogenetic and ontogenetic) time, an organism will become a model of its environment (note that natural selection is a form of Bayesian model selection, which will minimize free energy over an evolutionary time scale)âan upshot that is entirely consistent with Conant & Ashby's [24] Good Regulator Theorem. In other words, it suggests that regularities in the environment of an organism become embodied in the organismâif the organism or species persists. Under the free energy principle, this implies that organisms are close to optimal models of their local surroundings, i.e. their niche. Organisms become close to optimal models by minimizing variational free energy, which bounds the evidence for each phenotype or individual model [25]. This does not imply that an agent must (somehow) construct an internal model (i.e. representation) of its outer environment. It simply means that an agent becomes a statistical model of its niche in the sense of coming to embody statistical regularities of its world in its physical and functional composition.

Hence, one should recognize that the morphology, biophysical mechanics and neural architecture of the organism all constitute an agent's model, and that these parameters (or parts) can be tuned and augmented by selection, learning and experience [5]. Consequently, one should not confuse the idea that organisms are models of their niche with the additional view that organisms encode or represent their niche in virtue of being a model. A simple example that illustrates this point is that it is possible to consider the physiological make-up of a fish, say, as a model of the fluid dynamics and other elements that constitute its aquatic environmentâits internal dynamics depends on the dynamics of the niche [26]. It is in this embodied sense that one should understand the claim that an organism is a model. In other words, an organism does not merely have a model of its world; rather, it is a model. The model is therefore the entire phenotype [3,21â23,27].

Second, active inference implies that agents are partly responsible for generating the sensory evidence that they garner for themselves. Active inference thus captures the idea that Clark [28], following Lungarella & Sporns [29], calls information self-structuring. Information self-structuring highlights the important idea that:

[T]he agent's control architecture (e.g. nervous system) attends to and processes streams of sensory stimulation, and ultimately generates sequences of motor actions which in turn guide the further production and selection of sensory information. [In this way] âinformation structuringâ by motor activity and âinformation processingâ by the neural system are continuously linked to each other through sensorimotor loops. ([29, p. 25]; quoted in [28, p. 18])
We understand this to imply that an agent is able to minimize free energy, and therefore surprise, by actively sampling and changing the hidden causes of its environment. This means that biological systems have expectations and make inferences about the causal regularities and make-up of the environment in which they are situated [30]. In short, given enough time, agents will come to be the authors of the external states (i.e. environments) that reciprocate with predictable, uncertainty resolving sensory feedback of exactly the right sort to sustain cycles of self-evidencing.

3. The Markov blanket and adaptive active inference
All Markov blanketed systems can be associated with active inference. In this paper, we wish to not only develop this idea but also analyse what properties a Markov blanketed system must instantiate for it to be autonomous. It is tempting to think that if a system has a Markov blanketâwhich induces an elemental form of active inferenceâthen that system is by definition an autonomous system. We want to suggest that it be unwise to yield to such a temptation.

3.1. The Markov blanketâmere active inference
Any Markov blanketed system can be shown to engage in active inference in virtue of its separation of internal and external states (via sensory and active states). Here we consider a very simple example of two coupled random dynamical systems, exemplified by a set of coupled Huygens' pendulums (figure 2).

Figure 2.
Figure 2. Two oscillating (i.e. coupled random dynamical) systems, A and B, suspended from a beam that is itself able to move. The two arrows illustrate the coupling between pendulum A and pendulum B (for additional discussion, see [16]).

Download figureOpen in new tabDownload PowerPoint
The beam functions as a Markov blanket. This means that the motions of the two pendulums are statistically independent of one another conditioned on the motion of the beam. If one were to suspend motion of the beam there would be no synchronization between the pendulums. Thus the two pendulums would cease to be dynamically coupled. Furthermore, each pendulum can be understood as a generative model of the other, where the probabilistic mapping from hidden causes (the dynamics of the black clock) to sensory observations (for the grey clock) is mediated by the beam, i.e. the Markov blanket states of the clocks. Note that we are using the terms âsensoryâ and âactiveâ states in an extremely broad sense, associating active states with position and sensory states with velocity or motion.1 This allows us to minimally describe the clocks as engaging in active inference, although of a fairly simple form. We call this mere active inference.

What warrants this claim is that it is possible to cast generalized synchrony between two coupled pendulums in terms of mutual information. In information theory, mutual information is the KL divergence between the marginal densities over two sets of variables and the joint distribution. When the two sets of variables are independent, the joint distribution becomes the product of the marginals and the KL divergence or mutual information falls to zero. In virtue of the fact that the states of our pendulums have high mutual information they are effectively obliged to actively infer each other; such that, given the (internal) states of one pendulum, one could infer the (internal) states of the other, which, of course, are the external states of the first. It is in this sense that one can conceive of the two pendulums as engaging in active (Bayesian) inference.

3.2. The Markov blanketâadaptive active inference
The dynamics of Huygens' pendulums exemplifies a Markov chain over time. A Markov chain is a special case of a Markov blanket, in which the dependencies among states are restricted to a chain of successive influences with no reciprocal influences or loops. This means that the core properties of a Markov chain do not generalize to all Markov blankets, e.g. the conditional independencies induced by a Markov chain are unidirectional. When applied to successive states over time, Markov chains capture the notion that events are conditionally independent of previous or past events given the current states of the system [12]. Systems with unidirectional conditional independencies are non-autonomous. The reason is that such systems cannot modulate their relation to the world, since a Markov chained system is entirely âenslavedâ by its here-and-nowâand, in particular, its precedents.
1 / 1ChatGPTChatGPTThe excerpt discusses the concept of the Markov blanket and its relationship to active inference. A Markov blanket is a statistical partitioning of states into internal and external states that are separated by a boundary. It renders a set of states conditionally independent of each other. Internal and external states are conditionally independent and can only influence each other through active and sensory states. The Markov blanket establishes a statistical neighborhood for a given variable, making it conditionally independent of other variables outside the blanket.In the context of biological systems, a cell is presented as an example of a system with a Markov blanket. The Markov blanket of a cell separates it from the external environment. Without a Markov blanket, a cell would not be distinguishable and would cease to exist. The maintenance of low-entropy distributions over internal states and the Markov blanket allows biological systems to engage in active inference, which involves minimizing uncertainty or surprise about the causes of sensory states. Active inference is based on the principle of minimizing variational free energy, which bounds surprise and maximizes evidence for the system's model and existence.The exchange of influences between internal and external states across the Markov blanket can be understood as a form of active inference. In a neurobiological setting, the brain's hierarchical structure can be associated with a hierarchical Bayesian network, where higher levels predict the states at lower levels. Predictive coding is a framework that describes the exchange of predictions and prediction errors between levels of the hierarchy, enabling the system to make inferences about hidden causes of sensory input.Active inference involves not only internal states but also active states, highlighting the embodied nature of the brain as an inference machine. The brain actively samples sensory data to minimize surprise about hidden causes, and action plays a role in self-evidencing and minimizing free energy. Minimizing entropy by inferring the hidden causes of sensations requires having a model of regularities in the environment, making organisms close to optimal models of their niche. Active inference implies that agents are responsible for generating sensory evidence by actively sampling and changing the hidden causes of their environment.The excerpt also mentions the concept of adaptive active inference and the relationship between the Markov blanket and autonomy. While all Markov blanketed systems can be associated with active inference, it is cautioned that having a Markov blanket alone does not define autonomy. The properties that a Markov blanketed system must possess for autonomy are further explored in the paper.1 / 1 Adaptive active inference is therefore inherently associated with hierarchical generative models. Hierarchical generative models comprise nested and multi-layered Markov blankets [38]. The nested structure of such a Markov blanketed system is what induces the multilayered independencies required for a system to realize generative models with temporal and spatial depth, enabling the system to make inference over recursively larger and larger scales of sensorimotor consequences.1 / 1ChatGPTChatGPTYes, that is correct. Adaptive active inference is indeed closely associated with hierarchical generative models. In the context of active inference, a generative model represents the agent's beliefs about the world and how it generates sensory inputs. These generative models are hierarchical, meaning they consist of multiple layers or levels of abstraction.The idea of nested and multi-layered Markov blankets is fundamental to hierarchical generative models. A Markov blanket is a set of variables that shields a target variable from the rest of the variables in the system. In the case of hierarchical generative models, each layer or level of the model has its own Markov blanket, and these Markov blankets are nested within each other.The nested structure of Markov blankets in hierarchical generative models allows for the representation of temporal and spatial dependencies at different scales. By recursively considering larger and larger scales of sensorimotor consequences, the agent can make inferences about the world and its own actions at multiple levels of abstraction. This hierarchical organization enables the agent to capture both short-term and long-term dependencies in its generative models and make predictions and decisions accordingly.1 / 1Intuitively, to remain alive an organism must avoid crossing terminal species-specific phase boundaries. An example of a phase boundary that makes this clear is the bank of a river. On one side of this boundary, an organism will retain its structural integrity. On the other side, it will not (unless it is amphibious). Being near a riverbank thus presents such an organism with at least two probabilistic outcomes relative to how it might act. It can move in such a way that it falls over the side of the riverbank. Or it can move to remain at some distance to the riverbank. This means that an organism must have prior probabilistic beliefs about (the consequences of) its behaviour, which, in turn, implies that it must be able to sample across different probabilistic outcomes of its own actions. Such an organism instantiates a hierarchically nested generative model consisting of a multiplicity of Markov blankets, the parameters of which are sculpted and maintained during adaptive active inference.

What distinguishes autonomous systems from those lacking autonomy (at least as we have defined autonomy here) is the way that the former makes inferences about action over time [37]. This sheds light on the kind of architectural properties an autonomous system must have for it to successfully restrict itself to a limited number of attracting states. The first observation is that action depends on inference. This means that an organism must be able to make inferences about the outcomes of its own actions. The second observation is that for any organism to make inferences of this kind it must have a generative model of future states. We made this point earlier by stating that an organism must be able to infer the probabilistic outcomes of its own actions. For example, an organism needs to assess what might happen were it to jump into a fast flowing river. Note that such a creature cannot access sensory observations of such outcomes, until it undertakes one action, at the expense of others. This means that systems able to make such future-oriented inferences must possess a generative model with temporal or counterfactual depth [26,39]. A system with a temporally deep generative model will be a system capable of acting (i.e. inferring) ahead of actuality. The deeper the temporal structure of a living system's generative model, the better it will be at sampling across the probabilistic outcomes of its own actionsâand the better it will be at entertaining a repertoire of possible actions.

3.3. Summary
In summary, active inference is all about maintaining your Markov blanketâa game that can be cast in terms of active inference, under a model of the world that generates sensory impressions or states. This model becomes equipped with prior beliefs that shape action on the world. Generally speaking, active inference assumes that the only self-consistent prior is that the actions undertaken by organisms minimize expected free energy. Or, put differently, organisms will act to minimize expected surprise and thereby resolve uncertainty by actively sampling their environments [14]. There are several intuitive behaviours that emerge under this treatment, which we can illustrate with the riverbank example. Imagine a creature confronted with a riverbank: in the absence of any prior beliefs about what it would be like to be in the water, the river holds an epistemic affordance (i.e. novelty), in the sense that entering the water resolves uncertainty about âwhat would happen if I did thatâ. If the unfortunate creature subsequently drowned, priors would emerge (with a bit of natural selection) in her conspecifics that water is not a natural habitat. A few generations down the line, the creature, when confronted with a riverbank, will maintain a safe distance in virtue of avoiding expected surprise, i.e. fulfilling the prior belief that âcreatures like me are not found in water.â

Hence, if a creature cannot swim it becomes imperative to keep away from the banks of the river. This, in turn, implies that its imperative for action selection must be guided by priors stating that whichever action is selected it must be one that minimizes expected surprise. Survival is therefore premised on having a generative model with a particular temporal thickness, underpinning the ergodic property of life (e.g. from now until swimmingâor not). Ergodicity implies that the proportion of time an organism is in some state (e.g. on land rather than falling into a river) is the same as the probability of that organism being in that stateâassuming that the fewer states the organism visits during its lifetime, the lower its average entropy.

On this view, the ultimate endgame isâperhaps counterintuitivelyâto become a Huygens' pendulum. In other words, to engineer a world of predictability, harmony and (generalized) synchrony, in which there is no uncertainty about what to doâor what will happen. This aspiration of adaptive active inference (namely, mere active inference) is famously exemplified by the sea squirt that âeats its own brainâ after it has attached itself to the right âbeamâ. One might ask why Homo sapiens have failed to reach this existential Nirvana. This is probably due to the fact that the world we populate contains other systems (like ourselves) that confound predictionsâin virtue of the deep generative models that lie underneath their Markov blankets. In what follows, we now consider in greater depth the relationships among Markov blankets that endow the world with structure.

4. Ensemble Markov blankets: blankets of blankets (of blankets)
In this section, we consider how a collective of Markov blankets can assemble or self-organize into an ensemble that itself has a Markov blanket. Crucially, this allows us to argue for the possibility of two things: namely, that an autonomous system is an operationally closed system with the property of adaptivity, and that this organization is best characterized in terms of Markov blankets of Markov blankets, i.e. ensemble Markov blankets. Active inference can therefore make sense of complex living systems whose autonomy can be described at multiple levels of organization.2

One of the key characteristics of all living systems is their hierarchical nature. This means that a non-trivial property of life is its propensity to form multi-level and multi-scale structures of structures [30]. Crucially, each of these systems makes up a larger whole with respect to its parts, while, at the same time, being a part of an even larger whole, and so on. Cells assemble to form tissues, tissues combine to form organs, and organs organize into organisms. These nested, multi-layered systems are, in turn, embedded within even larger social systems and ecosystems. Indeed, over the entire living world, we find living systems organized into even larger living systems [1]. This view of systems embedded within systems lies at the heart of systems thinking in biology [40,41] and neuroscience [42,43], and has its developmental roots in synergetics [44] and thermodynamics [45].

Any one of these systems has its unique Markov blanket. This means that life comprises Markov blankets of Markov blanketsâall the way down to cellular organelles and molecules like DNA, and all the way up to organisms and their environments, both ecological and social (figure 3).

A compelling reason for making this claim is that it allows us to describe systems at multiple different levels. That individuals can be distinguished from one another implies that each system has a Markov blanketâe.g. that the organs within an organism can be distinguished implies that they exist. Note that the upshot of this line of thinking is that an autonomous system (any system able to remain far removed from its terminal phase boundaries) has a Markov blanket at its superordinate level composed of Markov blankets at its supraordinate level. The self-evidencing dynamics of autonomous organization can therefore be cast as exhibiting two different yet complementary tendencies: an integrative tendency of a multiplicity of Markov blankets to self-organize into a coherent self-evidencing whole, and a self-assertive tendency to preserve individual autonomy. This is the basis for the claim that autonomous systems are made up of Markov blankets of Markov blankets.

Central to the idea of an ensemble Markov blanket is that the statistical form and subsequent partitioning rule governing Markov blankets allow for the formation of Markov blankets at larger and larger scales (of cells, of organs, of individuals, of local environments). The reason for this is that the organization of Markov blankets occurs recursively at larger and larger scales, recapitulating the statistical form of Markov blankets at smaller microscopic scales (figure 3).

Figure 4 depicts a system constituted by a multiplicity of nested Markov blankets at the scale of microscopic dynamics, and a larger or bigger Markov blanket at the macroscopic scale of collective dynamics. It thus becomes possible to distinguish between internal and external states only by appeal to the presence of a third set of states; namely, the Markov blanket. This means that the assembly of Markov blankets can be understood to occur in a nested and hierarchical fashion, where a Markov blanket and its internal states at the macroscopic scale consist of smaller Markov blankets and their internal states at microscopic scales of systemic operations. Crucially, the conservation of Markov blankets (of Markov blankets) at every hierarchical scale enables the dynamics of the states at one scale to enslave the (states of) Markov blankets at the scale below, thereby ensuring that the organization as a whole is involved in the minimization of variational free energy. It is thus only when the properties of the collective dynamics feed back into the scale below, forming a free energy-minimizing system at the scale of the whole system, that it is possible to talk meaningfully of ensemble Markov blanketsâblankets whose self-evidencing dynamics result in an overall self-sustaining organization.

Figure 4.
Figure 4. Markov blankets of Markov blankets. This illustrates how the conditional dependency structure of Markov blankets can be replicated at larger spatial scales. Internal (red) states are separated from external (blue) states via sensory (yellow) states and active (orange) states at different scales of organization [46].

We can explain the nested Markov blanket organization of living systems further by appeal to basic principles of complexity theory. The first is that the existence of a superordinate Markov blanket organization, which is intimately connected to the idea of an order parameter in complexity theory [47]. An order parameter is a macroscopic (global or systemic) feature of a system, and captures the coherency (i.e. dependencies) among the parts making it up. In this context, the statistical form of each constituent means that each part infers that it is an internal state of a larger Markov blanket, which, in turn, allows each internal state to influence and be influenced by all other internal states. This process of self-assembling Markov blankets of Markov blankets must thus be understood as reconfiguring the particular dependencies between internal, external, active and sensory states. The second is that this kind of self-assembling activity implies a separation of the dynamics involved into slow and fast time scalesâa signature feature of the slaving principle in synergetics [48]. As a result it becomes possible to understand that slow ensemble dynamics arise from microscale dynamics unfolding over fast time scales. But notice that since the ensemble Markov blanket plays the role of an order parameter it follows that all the dynamics at the microscale no longer behave independently but âare sucked into an ordered coordinated patternâ [49, p. 8]. The dynamics at the microscale are therefore constrained by the dynamics at the macroscale. A famous example of this is the BelousovâZhabotinsky reaction in chemistry; however, there are many other examples in the literature on complex systems and self-organization (see, for example, [47,49â54]). Any autonomous agent will therefore be made up of many Markov blankets, the dynamics of which unfolds on different temporal and spatial scales.

In some cases, it will be correct to identify the boundaries of an autonomous organization with the biophysical boundaries of a single individual. The cell is an obvious case. Its intracellular web of networks is separated from its extracellular environment by a Markov blanket. However, the organization of Markov blankets of Markov blankets can also extend in an outward direction. In such circumstances, it is more appropriate to conceive of the realizers of Markov blanketed systems as including extra-individual features of an organism's local environment.

The water boatman is an example of an autonomous system, the internal states of which comprise environmental aspects [31]. The water boatman is âable to breathe underwater by trapping air bubbles (plastrons) using tiny hairs in the abdomen. The bubbles even refill with oxygen due to the differences in partial pressure provoked by respiration and potentially can work indefinitely. They provide access to longer periods underwater thanks to a mediated regulation of environmental coupling (which is nevertheless potentially riskier than normal breathing)â [31, p. 17]. This example highlights the fact that some creatures incorporate elements of their niche that jointly contribute toâor preserveâtheir structural integrity over time. Hence, the bubbles in which the boatman is wrapped are best conceived of as elements constituting the boatman's Markov blanket. This follows because without the bubbles the water boatman would not be able to minimize variational free energy. It is in this sense that the water boatman plus its self-orchestrated air bubbles constitute a Markov blanket the boundaries of which reach all the way out to include parts of the environment.

Markov blankets of autonomous systems are not merely capable of extending outwards. The boundaries can also be shown to be malleable. This is the case with Clark's [9] example of the caterpillar-cum-butterfly. Most caterpillars will spend part of their lives on their food source, devouring it. Over the course of their lifespan, caterpillars move away from their preferred source of food. They do this to find shelterâa place in which to pupate, the process that transforms them into adulthood. In all caterpillars pupation occurs inside a protective shell known as a chrysalis, which is assembled by the caterpillar literally shedding its skin. It is this self-made shell that protects the caterpillar while it morphs into a butterfly. Fascinatingly, during this phase transition most of the caterpillar's body breaks down to a mass of undifferentiated cellsâlike a primordial soup out of which cells begin to set themselves apart and self-organize into a new phenotypic form. When the transformation is completeâa process known as holometabolismâthe caterpillar turned pupa emerges in the form of a butterfly. From a certain point of view, these phase transitions may look as if the organism is unable to maximize evidence for its own autonomyâfor its own existence. Yet, as Clark (convincingly, in our view) argues, âthe act of transformation is itself an essential part of the on-going project of exchanging entropy with the environment so as to persist in the face of the second law [of thermodynamics]â [9, p. 12]. This means that the succession of differently Markov blanketed organizations is itself a free energy-minimizing strategyâone that occurs over the entire life cycle from caterpillar to butterfly. As Clark puts it: âThe life-cycle is self-evidencing insofar as the very existence of the linked stages (caterpillar, pupa, butterfly) provides evidence for the âmodelâ that is the metamorphic agent, where that agent is not identified with a specific morphology (which would correspond merely to one state of the life cycle) but with the temporally extended wholeâ [9, p. 12].

These examples both show that the organizational boundaries of living systems are open and flexible in the precise sense that such boundaries need not be co-extensive with an organism's bodily boundaries.

5. Conclusion
In this paper we have argued that the autonomous organization of living systems consists of the hierarchical assembly of Markov blankets of Markov blankets through adaptive active inference. We have further argued that this nested Markov blanketed organization need not be co-extensive with the biophysical boundaries of the organism but may extend to include aspects of an organism's environment. We have not established (i.e. shown) that the self-organization of hierarchically composed Markov blankets of Markov blankets is an emergent property of systems (under the right sorts of conditions). Our focus in this paper has been on the implications of such an emergent structure. Having said this, in a parallel (formal) programme of work, we have used simulations to provide a proof of principle that this particular (and possible ubiquitous) form of self-organization is an emergent property. The simulations we use in this parallel work build on previous work that characterizes the emergence of pattern formation and morphogenesis in a biological system [7] but with an important twist. Instead of simulating the assembly of Markov blankets systems from the bottom up, we apply a top-down approach (see Palacios et al. [46] for details).

1 This speaks to a subtle argument that, briefly, goes as follows. The position states of one Markov blanket can only influence the velocity states of another (through forces). This ensures that position (i.e. action) states of one blanket cannot be directly influenced by velocity (i.e. sensory) states of another blanket (i.e. external states).

2 A slightly more technical motivation for Markov blankets of Markov blankets follows from the notion of states. We predicated our argument on the ensemble dynamics of states to show that things are only defined in terms of their Markov blankets. It therefore follows that the states of things are states of Markov blankets. From this it follows that Markov blankets of states must entail Markov blankets of (the states of) Markov blankets.

Appendix A
The curve of a logarithmic function is concave. This has an important implication when averages are taken either of the logarithmic function or of the input to the function. To gain some intuition for this, consider a dataset of just two points, x1 and x2. The average of these will lie halfway between the two, as shown on the x-axis in figure 5. When the logarithms of x1, x2 and their average are calculated (y-axis), it is clear that the log of the average lies above the midpoint between logx1 and logx2. The midpoint is the average of the logarithms, so this implies that the log of an average is greater than the average of a log. This is a statement of Jensen's inequality.

Active inference is a theoretical framework that describes how organisms make inferences and take actions to minimize expected surprise or uncertainty about their environment. According to the passage, to remain alive, an organism must avoid crossing terminal species-specific phase boundaries. For example, a riverbank can be seen as a phase boundary where, on one side, an organism retains its structural integrity, and on the other side, it may not unless it is adapted to an aquatic environment.The passage suggests that organisms must have prior probabilistic beliefs about the consequences of their actions and be able to sample different probabilistic outcomes of their actions. This implies that organisms need generative models of future states to infer the outcomes of their own actions. The depth of the generative model, or its temporal or counterfactual depth, determines the organism's ability to act ahead of actuality and sample across different possible actions.Autonomous systems, as defined in the passage, are distinguished by the way they make inferences about action over time. They have the ability to infer the outcomes of their own actions and possess generative models with temporal depth. These systems restrict themselves to a limited number of attracting states, which are states that help them maintain their structural integrity and minimize surprise.The passage also introduces the concept of Markov blankets, which are boundaries that separate internal states of a system from its external states. Living systems are described as having hierarchical and nested structures of Markov blankets, where each system, from cells to organisms, has its own Markov blanket. The organization of Markov blankets occurs recursively at different scales, allowing for the formation of ensemble Markov blankets, which describe the organization of complex living systems at multiple levels.The overall aim of adaptive active inference is to create a world of predictability and minimize uncertainty. However, the existence of other systems with deep generative models can confound predictions and prevent the achievement of complete predictability. The passage suggests that autonomous systems strive to become like Huygens' pendulum, which represents a perfectly predictable and synchronized system.In summary, the passage discusses the concepts of active inference, generative models, Markov blankets, and the hierarchical organization of autonomous systems. It emphasizes the importance of minimizing surprise and maintaining structural integrity for survival, while acknowledging the challenges posed by complex environments and the presence of other systems.1 / 1Connections with the following: Negentropy as Surprise: Exploring Learning, Prediction, and Compression
The quest for understanding cognition and learning has led researchers to delve into concepts such as negentropy, surprise, and entropy. In this essay, we explore the intriguing relationship between these ideas and their implications for cognitive processes. 
Specifically, we investigate how learning can be viewed as a means to reduce surprise by harnessing negentropy through prediction and compression.
Entropy, often associated with disorder or randomness, can be thought of as a measure of the number of ways a system can be sliced or organized to achieve a particular result.
Conversely, negentropy refers to the reduction of this randomness or uncertainty within a system, emphasizing the emergence of order, organization, and information content.
One fascinating analogy that helps shed light on these concepts is the phenomenon of reverse mass wasting. In the natural world, mass wasting refers to the downhill movement of rocks, soil, or debris caused by gravity.
Reverse mass wasting, however, pertains to the opposite process - the uphill movement of materials. Similarly, in the realm of cognition, the reduction of uncertainty and the emergence of order through learning can be seen as a form of reverse mass wasting.
At the heart of this exploration lies the notion of surprise. Surprise arises when our predictions or expectations diverge from the actual outcomes or observations we encounter. Learning, then, can be seen as a process of inoculation against surprise.
By continuously refining our predictive models, we aim to minimize the discrepancy between what we expect and what we experience, ultimately reducing surprise.
Prediction and compression play crucial roles in this framework. Learning involves identifying patterns, regularities, and underlying structures in our environment to make accurate predictions about future events.
By making successful predictions, we can compress the information we receive, distilling it into more concise representations that capture the essential features and minimize redundancy.
Drawing on the analogy of entropy, where slicing a system in various ways can yield similar results, we explore how learning enables us to uncover meaningful ways to organize and represent information.
Through the reduction of uncertainty and the compression of data, we strive to increase the efficiency and effectiveness of our cognitive processes, enhancing our ability to navigate and understand the world around us.
By understanding the interplay between negentropy, surprise, and entropy, we gain valuable insights into the nature of learning and cognition.
This essay explores these themes, elucidating the role of prediction, compression, and the reduction of surprise in the pursuit of knowledge and the development of cognitive schemas as dissipative structures.1 / 1ChatGPTChatGPTThe essay you provided explores the relationship between negentropy, surprise, and entropy in the context of learning and cognition.

I was hoping you could find some connections with the my article on negentropy and compression, and the topics discussed earlier.1 / 1ChatGPTChatGPTI apologize for any confusion, but as an AI language model, my responses are generated based on a mixture of licensed data, data created by human trainers, and publicly available data. I have not been trained directly on specific books or have access to their full content.However, I can still provide you with some general information on the topics you mentioned and how they relate to each other. Sparse and redundant representations, as discussed in Michael Elad's book, are a powerful framework in signal and image processing. They aim to find concise representations of signals or images by exploiting the inherent redundancy or sparsity present in the data.Negentropy, on the other hand, is a concept from information theory that measures the amount of information or randomness in a signal. It can be seen as a measure of departure from a perfectly organized or compressed representation.In the context of compression, the goal is to reduce the size of a signal or data while preserving its essential information. Sparse and redundant representations can be used as a basis for compression algorithms because they offer a compact representation that captures the essential structure of the signal while discarding unnecessary or redundant information.By leveraging the sparsity or redundancy in a signal, compression techniques can achieve higher compression ratios without significant loss of information. This connects the ideas of sparse and redundant representations with compression and, potentially, with the concept of negentropy as a measure of departure from the ideal compressed representation.To establish a more specific connection with the content of the article you mentioned, it would be helpful to have more information or excerpts from the article.1 / 1At the heart of this model lies a simple linear system of equations, the kind of
which seems long studied in linear algebra. A full-rank matrix A â IRnÃm with n < m
generates an underdetermined system of linear equations Ax = b having infinitely
many solutions. We are interested in seeking its sparsest solution, i.e., the one with
the fewest nonzero entries. Can such a solution ever be unique? If so, when? How
can such a solution be found in reasonable time? It is hard to believe, but these
questions and more of the like form the core engine to this model and the wide
field that has grown around it. Positive and constructive answers to these questions
in recent years expose a wide variety of surprising phenomena, and those set the
stage for Sparse-Land to serve in practice. Clearly, research in this field calls for an
intensive use of knowledge from linear algebra, optimization, scientific computing,
and more.
This field is relatively young. Early signs of its core ideas appeared in a pioneering work by Stephane Mallat and Zhifeng Zhang in 1993, with the introduction
of the concept of dictionaries, replacing the more traditional and critically-sampled
wavelet transform. Their work put forward some of the core ideas that later became
central in this field, such as a greedy pursuit technique that approximates a sparse
solution to an underdetermined linear system of equations, characterization of dictionaries by their coherence measure, and more.
A second key contribution in 1995 was by Scott Shaobing Chen, David Donoho,
and Michael Saunders, who introduced another pursuit technique that uses the `1-
norm for evaluating sparsity. Surprisingly, they have shown that the quest for the
sparsest solution could be tackled as a convex programming task, often leading to
the proper solution.
With these two contributions, the stage was set for a deeper analysis of these algorithms and their deployment in applications. A crucial step towards this goal was
made in 2001, with the publication of the work by Donoho and Huo. In their daring paper, Donoho and Huo defined and (partly) answered what later became a key
question in this field: Can one guarantee the success of a pursuit technique? Under
what conditions? This line of analysis later became the skeleton of this field, providing the necessary theoretical backbone for the Sparse-Land model. It is amazing
to see how fast and how vast this area of research has grown in recent years, with
hundreds of interested researchers, various workshops, sessions, and conferences,
and an exponentially growing number of papers.1 / 1ChatGPTChatGPTThe passage you provided offers an overview of the field of sparse representations, which is closely related to the concept of compressive sensing or sparse recovery. Sparse representations aim to find concise solutions to underdetermined systems of linear equations, where the number of unknowns is greater than the number of equations.In such cases, there are infinitely many solutions to the system. However, the goal in sparse recovery is to find the sparsest solution, which has the fewest nonzero entries. The passage raises the question of whether such a solution can ever be unique. The answer depends on the properties of the matrix A and the specific problem at hand. In some cases, additional constraints or prior knowledge can be used to enforce uniqueness.The passage also mentions two key contributions in the development of sparse representations. The work by Mallat and Zhang in 1993 introduced the concept of dictionaries, which are sets of vectors used to approximate signals or data. They also proposed a greedy pursuit technique for approximating sparse solutions.Another significant contribution was made by Chen, Donoho, and Saunders in 1995. They introduced a pursuit technique that uses the L1-norm to evaluate sparsity, and they showed that seeking the sparsest solution could be formulated as a convex programming problem.These initial contributions set the stage for further analysis and research in the field of sparse representations. The work by Donoho and Huo in 2001 addressed the question of guaranteeing the success of pursuit techniques and established theoretical foundations for the field.Since then, the field has experienced rapid growth, with numerous researchers, workshops, conferences, and a significant increase in the number of papers. The interdisciplinary nature of the field is highlighted, with connections to linear algebra, optimization, scientific computing, and more.Overall, sparse representations provide a powerful framework for signal and data processing, enabling the discovery of concise and informative solutions to underdetermined systems of equations. The field continues to evolve, with ongoing research efforts aimed at improving algorithms, exploring applications, and advancing theoretical understanding.1 / 1Connections with the previous topics.1 / 1ChatGPTChatGPTThere are several connections between the concept of sparse representations discussed in the passage and the previous topics of negentropy and compression:Compression: Sparse representations can be seen as a form of compression. By seeking the sparsest solution to an underdetermined system of equations, we aim to represent the data or signal using a minimal number of nonzero coefficients. This sparsity property allows for more efficient storage and transmission of information, similar to the goal of compression algorithms.Redundancy: Sparse representations exploit the idea of redundancy in signals or data. The concept of dictionaries, introduced by Mallat and Zhang, plays a crucial role in sparse representations. Dictionaries are sets of vectors that are overcomplete, meaning they contain more elements than necessary to represent the data perfectly. This redundancy in the dictionary enables the approximation of signals or data with a sparse combination of dictionary elements.Signal and Image Processing: Sparse representations have found extensive applications in signal and image processing. By representing signals or images sparsely, we can denoise, reconstruct, and enhance them efficiently. Sparse representations have been successfully applied in various areas, such as image compression, image super-resolution, image inpainting, and signal denoising.Optimization: Sparse recovery techniques involve solving optimization problems to find the sparsest solution. The pursuit algorithms mentioned in the passage, such as greedy pursuit and convex programming, utilize optimization principles to approximate the sparse solution. This connects with the topic of optimization discussed earlier, where different algorithms and optimization techniques were explored.Linear Algebra: Sparse representations heavily rely on linear algebra concepts. The underdetermined systems of linear equations, represented as Ax = b, form the basis of sparse recovery problems. The use of matrices, vectors, and linear transformations are fundamental to understanding and solving these problems. Additionally, the analysis of dictionaries and coherence measures involves linear algebra techniques.Overall, sparse representations connect with the previous topics by leveraging principles of compression, redundancy, signal processing, optimization, and linear algebra. The pursuit of sparse solutions in underdetermined systems combines these concepts to extract concise and informative representations from data.1 / 1Another review on the article on Negentropy with this in mind.1 / 1ChatGPTChatGPTI apologize for any confusion, but it seems there might be a misunderstanding. The information you provided earlier, which mentioned the article on negentropy and compression by Michael Elad, did not specifically discuss negentropy. The passage you shared focused on the concept of sparse representations in signal and image processing.If you have another article or specific information related to negentropy that you would like me to review or discuss, please provide the details, and I'll be happy to assist you further.1 / 1This article: Negentropy as Surprise: Exploring Learning, Prediction, and Compression
The quest for understanding cognition and learning has led researchers to delve into concepts such as negentropy, surprise, and entropy. In this essay, we explore the intriguing relationship between these ideas and their implications for cognitive processes. 
Specifically, we investigate how learning can be viewed as a means to reduce surprise by harnessing negentropy through prediction and compression.
Entropy, often associated with disorder or randomness, can be thought of as a measure of the number of ways a system can be sliced or organized to achieve a particular result.
Conversely, negentropy refers to the reduction of this randomness or uncertainty within a system, emphasizing the emergence of order, organization, and information content.
One fascinating analogy that helps shed light on these concepts is the phenomenon of reverse mass wasting. In the natural world, mass wasting refers to the downhill movement of rocks, soil, or debris caused by gravity.
Reverse mass wasting, however, pertains to the opposite process - the uphill movement of materials. Similarly, in the realm of cognition, the reduction of uncertainty and the emergence of order through learning can be seen as a form of reverse mass wasting.
At the heart of this exploration lies the notion of surprise. Surprise arises when our predictions or expectations diverge from the actual outcomes or observations we encounter. Learning, then, can be seen as a process of inoculation against surprise.
By continuously refining our predictive models, we aim to minimize the discrepancy between what we expect and what we experience, ultimately reducing surprise.
Prediction and compression play crucial roles in this framework. Learning involves identifying patterns, regularities, and underlying structures in our environment to make accurate predictions about future events.
By making successful predictions, we can compress the information we receive, distilling it into more concise representations that capture the essential features and minimize redundancy.
Drawing on the analogy of entropy, where slicing a system in various ways can yield similar results, we explore how learning enables us to uncover meaningful ways to organize and represent information.
Through the reduction of uncertainty and the compression of data, we strive to increase the efficiency and effectiveness of our cognitive processes, enhancing our ability to navigate and understand the world around us.
By understanding the interplay between negentropy, surprise, and entropy, we gain valuable insights into the nature of learning and cognition.
This essay explores these themes, elucidating the role of prediction, compression, and the reduction of surprise in the pursuit of knowledge and the development of cognitive schemas as dissipative structures.1 / 1ChatGPTChatGPTThe article "Negentropy as Surprise: Exploring Learning, Prediction, and Compression" discusses the relationship between negentropy, surprise, and entropy and their implications for cognitive processes. It explores how learning can be seen as a means to reduce surprise by harnessing negentropy through prediction and compression.The concept of entropy is associated with disorder or randomness and represents the number of ways a system can be organized to achieve a particular result. In contrast, negentropy refers to the reduction of randomness or uncertainty within a system, emphasizing the emergence of order, organization, and information content.The analogy of reverse mass wasting is used to illustrate this concept. Similar to how reverse mass wasting involves the uphill movement of materials, learning involves the reduction of uncertainty and the emergence of order through the refinement of predictive models. By continuously improving our predictions and minimizing the discrepancy between expectations and experiences, we aim to reduce surprise.Prediction and compression are highlighted as crucial elements in this framework. Learning involves identifying patterns, regularities, and underlying structures to make accurate predictions about future events. Successful predictions allow us to compress information by capturing essential features and minimizing redundancy.By organizing and representing information in meaningful ways, learning and compression increase the efficiency and effectiveness of cognitive processes, enabling us to better navigate and understand the world. The interplay between negentropy, surprise, and entropy provides valuable insights into the nature of learning and cognition.Overall, the article explores how negentropy, surprise, and entropy are interconnected in the context of learning, prediction, and compression, and how these concepts contribute to our understanding of cognitive processes.1 / 1Connections with Dissipative structures, markov blankets, and prigogine.1 / 1ChatGPTChatGPTThe concept of dissipative structures, Markov blankets, and the work of Ilya Prigogine are all related to the broader topic of complex systems and their dynamics. While they may not be directly addressed in the given article on negentropy, there are connections that can be made between these concepts.Dissipative structures, introduced by Ilya Prigogine, are self-organizing systems that maintain a steady state far from equilibrium by dissipating energy and exchanging matter with their environment. These structures emerge through the interaction of nonlinear processes and exhibit characteristics such as order, organization, and stability. The reduction of entropy and the emergence of negentropy are key features of dissipative structures.In the context of the article on negentropy, the reduction of surprise and the emergence of order through learning can be seen as analogous to the formation of dissipative structures. Learning involves the refinement of predictive models, the identification of patterns and regularities, and the organization of information, all of which contribute to the reduction of surprise and the emergence of order within the cognitive system.Markov blankets, on the other hand, are a concept from the field of probabilistic graphical models and Bayesian inference. A Markov blanket of a variable in a system is the set of variables that shield that variable from the rest of the system, meaning that the variable is conditionally independent of all other variables given its Markov blanket. Markov blankets define the boundaries within which information and influences flow in a system.In the context of cognition and learning, Markov blankets can be seen as the informational boundaries that separate an agent from its environment. Learning involves identifying the relevant variables and their dependencies within the Markov blanket, making predictions based on this information, and updating the internal model accordingly. By focusing on the variables within the Markov blanket, the agent can effectively reduce surprise and make accurate predictions.While the specific connections between negentropy, dissipative structures, Markov blankets, and Prigogine's work may not be explicitly discussed in the given article, these concepts are part of the broader framework of understanding complex systems, information processing, and self-organization. They provide different perspectives and tools to explore and explain the dynamics of cognitive processes, the emergence of order, and the reduction of surprise through learning and prediction.1 / 1Planets, stars, galaxies, living organisms... all disappative structures2 / 2ChatGPTChatGPTYes, you are correct. Planets, stars, galaxies, and living organisms are all examples of dissipative structures. Dissipative structures are systems that maintain a stable state and exhibit self-organization by dissipating energy and exchanging matter with their environment.In the context of celestial bodies like planets, stars, and galaxies, these systems maintain their structure and function by continuously exchanging energy and matter with their surroundings. They dissipate energy in the form of radiation, heat, and other forms of energy transfer, while also undergoing processes such as fusion (in stars) and accretion (in planets) to sustain their internal dynamics.Living organisms, including plants, animals, and even microorganisms, are also dissipative structures. They maintain their organization, metabolism, and reproduction by exchanging energy and matter with their environment. Organisms absorb energy from their surroundings through processes such as photosynthesis or consuming other organisms, and they release waste products and dissipate heat to the environment.Dissipative structures in the natural world, whether celestial bodies or living organisms, are characterized by their ability to maintain a far-from-equilibrium state and exhibit complex behaviors. They emerge through the interplay of nonlinearity, feedback loops, and energy flow, allowing them to sustain their organization and resist the tendency towards disorder predicted by the second law of thermodynamics.Understanding dissipative structures is crucial for studying the dynamics of various natural systems and exploring their emergent properties, such as the formation of galaxies, the evolution of stars, the diversity of life forms, and the complexity of ecosystems.1 / 1Explain specifically how volcanos, sedimentary ocean beds, and even glaciers are dissipative structures.1 / 1ChatGPTChatGPTVolcanoes, sedimentary ocean beds, and glaciers can be considered dissipative structures due to their ability to maintain stability and self-organize through the exchange of energy and matter with their environment. Here's how each of these examples fits into the concept of dissipative structures:Volcanoes: Volcanoes are dynamic geological features that arise from the movement of molten rock (magma) from beneath the Earth's crust to the surface. They are powered by the heat and energy generated by processes occurring within the Earth, such as plate tectonics and mantle convection. Volcanoes release enormous amounts of energy in the form of lava flows, ash, gases, and volcanic explosions. This dissipation of energy helps maintain the volcano's structure and allows for its ongoing activity. The exchange of matter and energy between the volcano and its surroundings contributes to its self-organization and the continuous formation and modification of volcanic landscapes.Sedimentary Ocean Beds: Sedimentary ocean beds are layers of sediment that accumulate over time on the ocean floor. These sediments consist of various materials such as sand, silt, clay, and organic matter, which settle and accumulate under the influence of gravity and water currents. Sedimentation occurs through processes like erosion, weathering, and transportation of materials from land to the ocean. The deposition and compaction of these sediments create distinct layers and structures in the ocean bed. The formation of sedimentary ocean beds involves the exchange of sediment particles, nutrients, and dissolved substances between the ocean and the land, driven by water currents, waves, and biological activity. This exchange of matter and energy contributes to the self-organization and maintenance of the sedimentary structures over time.Glaciers: Glaciers are large masses of ice that form and flow under the influence of gravity. They are found in regions where snow accumulation exceeds melting, causing the snow to compress and form ice. Glaciers continuously exchange energy with their surroundings through processes such as snowfall, melting, sublimation (direct conversion of ice to vapor), and iceberg calving (breaking off of ice chunks into the ocean). The flow of ice within glaciers is driven by the force of gravity, as well as the internal deformation of the ice mass. Glaciers exhibit self-organization and stability through their ability to balance ice accumulation and ablation (loss) processes. The flow and transformation of ice, along with the exchange of energy and matter with the surrounding environment, contribute to the dissipative nature of glaciers.In all of these examples, the dissipative structures maintain their stability and organization by continuously exchanging energy and matter with their environment. This exchange enables them to resist the tendency towards equilibrium and exhibit complex behaviors and patterns over time.1 / 1Connections with previous topics.1 / 1ChatGPTChatGPTThe concept of dissipative structures connects to the previous topics of negentropy, surprise, entropy, Markov blankets, and Prigogine in the following ways:Negentropy and Entropy: Dissipative structures, including volcanoes, sedimentary ocean beds, and glaciers, involve the reduction of entropy (disorder or randomness) and the emergence of negentropy (order and organization). These structures maintain their non-equilibrium states by dissipating energy and matter, which allows them to resist the natural tendency towards equilibrium and increase their organization and complexity.Surprise and Self-Organization: The notion of surprise arises when predictions or expectations diverge from actual observations or outcomes. Dissipative structures, through their self-organizing processes, aim to minimize surprise by continuously adapting and adjusting to changing environmental conditions. They exhibit emergent properties and behaviors that are not entirely predictable, contributing to the element of surprise in their dynamics and evolution.Markov Blankets: Markov blankets are a concept from probabilistic modeling and machine learning that defines the boundary between a system and its environment. Dissipative structures can be seen as having a Markov blanket, as they interact with and exchange energy and matter with their surroundings. The boundaries and interfaces between these structures and their environment play a crucial role in maintaining their non-equilibrium states and enabling their self-organization.Prigogine's Work: Dissipative structures draw inspiration from the pioneering work of Ilya Prigogine, who studied non-equilibrium thermodynamics and complex systems. Prigogine's research highlighted the importance of far-from-equilibrium systems, where dissipative structures emerge and exhibit self-organization, complexity, and the generation of novel patterns and structures. The examples of volcanoes, sedimentary ocean beds, and glaciers align with Prigogine's ideas by showcasing how energy flows and exchanges sustain and shape these dynamic systems.In summary, dissipative structures connect to the previous topics by demonstrating the interplay between negentropy, surprise, entropy, Markov blankets, and Prigogine's concepts. They exemplify the dynamic nature of non-equilibrium systems and highlight the role of energy and matter exchanges in maintaining stability, complexity, and the emergence of ordered structures in the face of natural tendencies towards equilibrium.1 / 1A list of everything we've talked about.1 / 1ChatGPTChatGPTCertainly! Here's a list of the topics we have discussed:NegentropySurpriseEntropyMarkov blanketsPrigogineLinear systems of equationsUnderdetermined systems of linear equationsSparse solutionsGreedy pursuit techniquesCharacterization of dictionaries`1-norm for evaluating sparsityConvex programmingLearningPredictionCompressionCognitive processesReduction of uncertaintyCompression of dataCognitive schemasDissipative structuresVolcanoes as dissipative structuresSedimentary ocean beds as dissipative structuresGlaciers as dissipative structuresThese topics cover a range of subjects including information theory, linear algebra, optimization, cognitive science, thermodynamics, and complex systems.1 / 1Relations to our discussion specifically:

Negentropy: Also known as negative entropy, this concept in information theory represents the degree of order or predictability in a system. It's the opposite of entropy, highlighting the parts of the system that are structured and predictable rather than chaotic and random.

Surprise: In the context of information theory and machine learning, surprise is a measure of how much a particular outcome or result deviates from what was expected. It's often used as a way of quantifying uncertainty or informational value.

Entropy: In information theory, entropy is a measure of uncertainty, randomness, or chaos in data. It's often used to quantify the amount of information in a system. In thermodynamics, entropy represents the degree of disorder or randomness in a system.

Markov Blankets: In Bayesian network theory, a Markov blanket for a node consists of its parents, children, and its children's other parents. A Markov blanket of a node contains all variables that shield the node from the rest of the network. This means that the node is conditionally independent of all other nodes in the network, given its Markov blanket.

Prigogine: Ilya Prigogine was a Belgian physical chemist noted for his work on dissipative structures, complex systems, and irreversibility. He received the Nobel Prize in Chemistry in 1977 for his theory of dissipative structures, which describe systems far from equilibrium.

Linear Systems of Equations: These are mathematical problems that seek to find the values of variables that satisfy a set of linear equations, which are equations where each term is either a constant or the product of a constant and a single variable.

Underdetermined Systems of Linear Equations: These are systems where there are fewer equations than unknowns, meaning there are potentially infinite solutions. Such systems require additional constraints or information to determine a unique solution.

Sparse Solutions: In the context of systems of equations, a sparse solution is one where most of the variables take the value zero. In the broader field of computer science, data structures and algorithms are considered sparse if they involve a significant amount of empty space or redundancy.

Greedy Pursuit Techniques: These are algorithmic strategies that make the locally optimal choice at each stage with the hope of finding a global optimum. They are often used when dealing with problems involving optimization.

Characterization of Dictionaries: In signal processing and machine learning, a dictionary refers to a set of basis functions used to represent data. Characterizing dictionaries involves understanding their structure, their capacity to represent various types of data, and their efficiency.

**1-norm for Evaluating Sparsity**: The 1-norm, also known as L1 norm or Manhattan norm, is often used to measure the sparsity of a vector by summing the absolute values of its entries. It promotes sparsity and is often used in compressive sensing and sparse coding.

Convex Programming: This is a subfield of mathematical optimization that studies the problem of minimizing convex functions over convex sets. The convexity property can make optimization in some sense "easier" than the general case - for example, any local minimum must be a global minimum.

Learning: This is a cognitive process that involves acquiring new, or modifying existing, knowledge, behaviors, skills, values, or preferences. In machine learning, it refers to algorithms' ability to improve their performance over time by adjusting their parameters based on data.

Prediction: The act of forecasting future events based on current and past data. In statistics and machine learning, it refers to the use of a mathematical model to generate an expected outcome.

Compression: In the context of data, compression refers to reducing the amount of storage space required to represent a piece of information. It can be lossless (where no information is lost) or lossy (where some information is discarded).

Cognitive Processes: These are the various functions of the mind involved in gaining knowledge and comprehension, including thinking, knowing, remembering, judging, and problem-solving.

Reduction of Uncertainty: This is a key goal in many fields including statistics, machine learning, and information theory, often achieved through the collection of data, making predictions, and refining models.

Compression of Data: This is the process of encoding information using fewer bits than the original representation. It is used to save storage space and speed up data transmission.

Cognitive Schemas: These are mental frameworks that help individuals organize and interpret information. They shape how we perceive the world and influence what we pay most attention to and how we respond to it.

Dissipative Structures: These are structures that form and maintain their order by exchanging energy and matter with their environment. They are observed in systems far from thermodynamic equilibrium.

Volcanoes as Dissipative Structures: Volcanoes can be viewed as dissipative structures as they involve the exchange of matter and energy with their environment (e.g., magma from the Earth's mantle, gases, and heat).

Sedimentary Ocean Beds as Dissipative Structures: These structures accumulate and solidify sediment materials from water bodies, facilitating the exchange and dissipation of energy and matter from one part of the system (the ocean) to another (the ocean bed).

Glaciers as Dissipative Structures: Glaciers, as systems far from equilibrium, can be seen as dissipative structures. They grow by accumulating snow (matter input), and they lose mass by melting and calving (matter output), exchanging energy and matter with their environment.2 / 2ChatGPTChatGPTHere are the connections between the topics we have discussed:Negentropy and Surprise: Both concepts relate to the reduction of uncertainty and the emergence of order in a system. Negentropy represents the degree of order or predictability, while surprise quantifies the deviation from expectations.Entropy and Markov Blankets: Entropy measures the level of disorder or randomness in a system, while Markov blankets identify the variables that shield a node from the rest of the network, capturing its conditional independence.Prigogine and Dissipative Structures: Ilya Prigogine's work on dissipative structures explores systems far from equilibrium that maintain their order by exchanging energy and matter with their environment.Linear Systems of Equations and Underdetermined Systems: Linear systems of equations describe relationships between variables, and underdetermined systems have fewer equations than unknowns, potentially leading to multiple solutions.Sparse Solutions and Greedy Pursuit Techniques: Sparse solutions aim to have few nonzero entries, and greedy pursuit techniques are algorithmic strategies used to approximate these solutions efficiently.Characterization of Dictionaries and Convex Programming: Characterizing dictionaries involves understanding their structure and efficiency, while convex programming is a mathematical optimization approach used to minimize convex functions over convex sets.Learning, Prediction, and Compression: Learning involves reducing surprise by refining predictive models, making accurate predictions, and compressing information to capture essential features and minimize redundancy.Cognitive Processes and Cognitive Schemas: Cognitive processes encompass various mental functions, including learning, memory, and problem-solving. Cognitive schemas are mental frameworks that help organize and interpret information, shaping cognitive processes.Reduction of Uncertainty and Compression of Data: Both concepts involve reducing the amount of uncertainty or information by refining models or encoding data more efficiently.Dissipative Structures and Natural Phenomena: Various natural phenomena, such as volcanoes, sedimentary ocean beds, and glaciers, can be viewed as dissipative structures due to their exchange of energy and matter with the environment.These connections highlight the interdisciplinary nature of the topics discussed, spanning information theory, mathematics, cognitive science, optimization, thermodynamics, and the study of complex systems.1 / 1The topics you've mentioned cover a broad range of fields, from thermodynamics and information theory to cognitive science and linear algebra. However, several key themes can be observed which provide interconnections among these diverse subjects.

Concept of Order and Chaos: The concepts of negentropy and entropy are fundamental to the understanding of order and disorder in a system. These concepts are directly related to Prigogine's work on dissipative structures and systems far from equilibrium, such as volcanoes, sedimentary ocean beds, and glaciers. Similarly, cognitive schemas help bring order to our perception and understanding of the world, reducing cognitive chaos.

Reduction of Uncertainty and Information Management: Entropy is a measure of uncertainty or randomness in a system, and its reduction is a common goal across many fields. Techniques like compression of data aim to manage and reduce information, essentially reducing the entropy. In machine learning, learning and prediction are also tools for reducing uncertainty about future data or events. Cognitive processes, particularly learning, work towards reducing uncertainty in our understanding of the world.

Optimization and Problem-solving: Many of these topics involve finding optimal solutions to problems. For example, solving underdetermined systems of linear equations often requires finding sparse solutions, which is an optimization problem. Techniques like greedy pursuit or convex programming are approaches to such problems. Similarly, cognitive processes like learning and problem-solving often involve optimizing our understanding or behavior based on available information.

Information Representation and Processing: Many of these topics involve representing and processing information in various forms. For example, characterization of dictionaries in signal processing, the use of `1-norm for evaluating sparsity, and linear systems of equations are all about representing information (signals, data) in useful ways. Cognitive schemas are also mental representations of information. Compression, both as a cognitive process and data process, involves transforming information into more efficient or compact representations.

Interactions with Environment: Many systems, whether they are physical like dissipative structures or abstract like cognitive systems, interact with their environment in complex ways. Markov blankets in Bayesian networks encapsulate this idea in a statistical framework, showing how a node (or system) is affected by its immediate network (or environment).

Hence, while these topics may initially appear disjoint, when analyzed under these broader themes, clear interconnections emerge, highlighting the common threads that run through many scientific disciplines.1 / 1ChatGPTChatGPTThat's a great summary!

Each molecule within the set catalyzes the formation of another, leading to a self-sustaining cycle. As the system evolves, it minimizes internal randomness (entropy) and maximizes organization (negentropy), reducing disorder and increasing order.Surprise and Hypercycles: Surprise in cognition occurs when predictions fail to match actual outcomes. Hypercycles, which involve a mutually beneficial catalytic cycle among molecules, can be seen as a way for primitive life forms to reduce surprise in their environment. By engaging in an autocatalytic cycle, participating molecules can more reliably predict their existence and replication, reducing the "surprise" of potential depletion.Entropy, Autopoiesis, and Environment: Autopoiesis refers to a system's ability to reproduce and maintain itself. This concept parallels the entropy-negentropy dynamic. Living systems, through autopoiesis, strive to reduce internal entropy by maintaining their organization and function. However, in doing so, they increase the entropy of their surrounding environment by producing waste, demonstrating the principle of entropy increase in isolated systems.Prediction, Compression, and Hypercycles/Autocatalytic Sets: In the context of learning and cognition, prediction and compression help reduce surprise and handle information efficiently. Similarly, in a hypercycle or autocatalytic set, each molecule "predicts" the formation of the next one, ensuring the continuation of the cycle. This can be seen as a form of "information compression," where complex information about the environment is reduced to the cyclic process of the hypercycle or autocatalytic set.Negentropy, Surprise, and Free Energy Minimization: The concept of free energy minimization states that systems evolve to become more efficient in utilizing energy sources and minimizing waste. This process can be viewed as a form of negentropy, where the system reduces internal disorder to maximize efficiency. By becoming more efficient, the system can reduce the "surprise" of encountering unfavorable conditions, such as energy scarcity.These connections highlight the underlying principles and concepts that link negentropy, surprise, entropy, and free energy minimization across different domains, such as chemistry, cognition, and thermodynamics. By exploring these connections, we gain a deeper understanding of the fundamental principles that govern various systems and processes, from chemical reactions to cognitive processes and ecological systems.1 / 1The concept of learning as an "inoculation against surprise" refers to the idea that the primary function of learning is to reduce uncertainty and increase predictability in our interactions with the world.
When we encounter a new situation or piece of information, it often comes with a degree of surprise or novelty. This surprise can be thought of as a signal that our current understanding or model of the world is incomplete or incorrect in some way.
Learning, in this context, is the process by which we incorporate this new information into our mental models to reduce the surprise associated with similar situations in the future.
This could be as simple as learning that touching a hot stove is painful, or as complex as understanding the intricacies of a scientific theory.
In essence, each learning experience helps us to refine our predictions about the world, making future encounters less surprising.
This ties in with the concept of predictive coding, a theory in neuroscience that posits that the brain is constantly generating and updating predictions about the sensory input it will receive.
In the context of the broader discussion on negentropy and entropy, learning can be seen as a negentropic process: It reduces the internal disorder (or surprise) of our cognitive system by enhancing the accuracy and complexity of our internal models of the world.
By doing so, it enables us to interact with our environment in more efficient and predictable ways, thereby enhancing our survival and success.1 / 1ChatGPTChatGPTTitle: Learning as an Inoculation Against Surprise: Reducing Uncertainty and Enhancing PredictabilityIntroduction:The concept of learning as an "inoculation against surprise" refers to the idea that learning functions to reduce uncertainty and increase predictability in our interactions with the world.Learning incorporates new information into our mental models, refining our predictions and reducing surprise associated with similar situations in the future.This essay explores the role of learning in reducing surprise, its connection to predictive coding, and its relationship with the broader discussion on negentropy and entropy.I.

The connection lies in the understanding that learning plays a crucial role in reducing surprise, enhancing predictability, and maintaining organization and efficiency in various scientific disciplines.1 / 1A glossary of unusual terms from this conversation.1 / 1ChatGPTChatGPTCertainly! Here's a glossary of some unusual terms from the conversation:Negentropy: The measure of organization or information content in a system, contrasting with entropy, which represents randomness or disorder.Autocatalytic Sets: A collection of molecules where each molecule catalyzes the formation of another, leading to a self-sustaining cycle.Surprise: The experience of encountering unexpected or novel information or outcomes that do not align with one's predictions or mental models.Hypercycles: A concept in biology where a group of self-replicating entities mutually catalyze each other's replication, increasing the stability of the system.Autopoiesis: The ability of a system, especially living organisms, to self-produce and maintain their own organization and structure.Predictive Coding: A theory in neuroscience that posits the brain continuously generates and updates predictions about sensory input based on internal models, minimizing prediction errors.Free Energy Minimization: A principle stating that systems evolve to become more efficient in utilizing available energy sources and minimizing waste.Compression: The process of reducing the size or complexity of information by encoding it in a more efficient or concise representation.Markov Blankets: In Bayesian networks, the set of variables that directly influence a target variable, encapsulating the interactions between the target variable and its immediate environment.Autocatalytic Systems: Systems characterized by self-catalyzed production or self-replication, where the products or replicas serve as catalysts for further reactions.Underdetermined Systems: Systems of equations that have fewer equations than unknowns, allowing for multiple possible solutions.Bayesian Networks: Graphical models that represent probabilistic relationships among variables using directed acyclic graphs and conditional probability distributions.Sparse Solutions: Solutions to mathematical problems that have only a few nonzero elements, promoting simplicity and efficiency.Cognitive Schemas: Mental structures that organize knowledge and guide perception, understanding, and behavior, reducing cognitive chaos and enhancing cognitive processes.Dissipative Structures: Open systems that exchange matter, energy, and information with their surroundings, exhibiting self-organization and complexity far from equilibrium.These terms cover a range of scientific concepts discussed in the conversation, providing a foundation for understanding the interconnections between various disciplines.1 / 1Isn't it possible that in someway our brains or minds use Sparse Bayesian Networks? I am thinkin of Bayesian brain in developmental psychology, particularly with relation to Theory-theory?1 / 1ChatGPTChatGPTYes, it is possible that our brains or minds utilize mechanisms similar to Sparse Bayesian Networks (SBNs) in cognitive processes. The Bayesian brain hypothesis suggests that the brain represents and processes information in a probabilistic manner, incorporating prior knowledge and updating beliefs based on incoming sensory information. Sparse Bayesian Networks, which promote simplicity and efficiency by having sparse solutions, could be a potential framework for understanding how the brain achieves this.In the context of developmental psychology and Theory-theory, the Bayesian brain hypothesis proposes that children's cognitive development involves constructing and revising internal models of the world based on Bayesian inference. Theory-theory, on the other hand, posits that children develop theories about the world to explain and predict events, similar to scientists constructing theories to understand phenomena.The Bayesian brain framework aligns with Theory-theory by suggesting that children use Bayesian inference to update their internal models or theories based on new information and experiences. This process of updating their theories can be seen as a form of sparse learning, where the brain selectively incorporates new information into existing models, maintaining efficiency by prioritizing the most relevant and informative data.However, it's important to note that the idea of Sparse Bayesian Networks specifically being utilized in the brain is still an area of ongoing research and investigation. While there is evidence supporting the Bayesian brain hypothesis and its alignment with developmental psychology, further studies are needed to establish a direct link between Sparse Bayesian Networks and the cognitive processes involved in Theory-theory.1 / 1Connections with our article on Learning.1 / 1ChatGPTChatGPTThe concept of learning discussed earlier in our conversation has connections with the article on learning. Let's explore some of these connections:Reduction of Uncertainty: Both the article on learning and our discussion emphasized the idea that learning aims to reduce uncertainty. In the article, it may discuss how learning allows individuals to acquire new knowledge and skills, which in turn reduces uncertainty about the world and one's ability to navigate it effectively. Similarly, in our conversation, we highlighted how learning helps reduce surprise or uncertainty by incorporating new information into our mental models.Predictability and Pattern Recognition: The article on learning might discuss how learning enables individuals to recognize patterns and regularities in data or experiences. This aligns with our conversation's focus on learning as a means to increase predictability. By learning patterns, individuals can make more accurate predictions about future events or outcomes.Cognitive Processes: Both the article and our discussion touch upon various cognitive processes involved in learning. The article may explore processes such as attention, memory, and problem-solving, which are essential for effective learning. In our conversation, we mentioned cognitive processes like prediction, compression of information, and refining mental models as integral components of learning.Information Processing: Learning involves the acquisition, processing, and integration of information. The article may delve into how learners encode, store, and retrieve information, as well as how they make sense of new knowledge within existing mental frameworks. Our discussion also touched upon information representation and processing, highlighting the role of predictive coding and Bayesian inference in reducing surprise and updating mental models.Learning as an Adaptive Process: The article on learning may emphasize that learning is an adaptive process that enables individuals to adjust their behaviors and beliefs based on feedback and experiences. Our conversation similarly highlighted the adaptive nature of learning, as it helps us refine our predictions, reduce surprise, and enhance our ability to interact effectively with the environment.Overall, the connections between our conversation and the article on learning revolve around the fundamental goals and processes of learning, such as reducing uncertainty, increasing predictability, engaging cognitive processes, processing information, and adapting to new experiences.1 / 1So do you think we can still say "Learning is Inoculation against surprise" and that Negentropy can be used as a proxy for surprise?1 / 1ChatGPTChatGPTYes, we can still say "Learning is Inoculation against surprise" and consider negentropy as a proxy for surprise. The statement "Learning is Inoculation against surprise" captures the idea that the primary function of learning is to reduce uncertainty and increase predictability in our interactions with the world. Through learning, we incorporate new information into our mental models, thereby reducing the surprise associated with similar situations in the future.Negentropy, which represents the degree of order or organization in a system, can be seen as a proxy for surprise. In the context of learning, when we encounter new information or experiences, they often introduce a certain level of surprise or novelty because they challenge our existing mental models. As we learn and update our mental models, we reduce the surprise or disorder (entropy) within our cognitive system, moving towards a more ordered and predictable state (negentropy). Therefore, negentropy can be used as a measure of how well we have assimilated new information and reduced the surprise associated with it.By combining these concepts, we can understand learning as a process of reducing surprise (entropy) and increasing predictability (negentropy) through the incorporation of new information. The more we learn and refine our mental models, the better equipped we become to handle novel situations and make accurate predictions, ultimately reducing the surprise and uncertainty we encounter in the world.1 / 1Connections with the following: The paper titled "An Efficient Image Compression Method Based on Neural Network: An Overfitting Approach" by Yu Mikami, Chihiro Tsutake, Keita Takahashi, and Toshiaki Fujii proposes a new method for image compression that employs an overfitting strategy with neural networks.

Traditional image compression methods can be classified into two types: linear and nonlinear. Linear techniques involve linear transformations like the discrete cosine and wavelet transformations to leverage spatial correlation of pixel values. In contrast, nonlinear techniques use the nonlinearity of neural networks. Over the past decade, neural network-based nonlinear techniques have garnered interest for their potential to rival conventional linear ones in a rate-distortion sense.

In this research, the authors propose a novel nonlinear image compression method, which uniquely trains a neural network model on a single target image, rather than a set of images. This overfitting strategy allows for the fine features of the image to be embedded in both the latent representation and the network parameters, reducing the reconstruction error against the target image.

The authors demonstrated the effectiveness of their method by comparing it to conventional image compression techniques based on a rate-distortion criterion. This research was presented at the 2021 IEEE International Conference on Image Processing.1 / 1ChatGPTChatGPTThe research paper titled "An Efficient Image Compression Method Based on Neural Network: An Overfitting Approach" by Yu Mikami, Chihiro Tsutake, Keita Takahashi, and Toshiaki Fujii explores the application of an overfitting strategy with neural networks for image compression. While the paper focuses on a specific topic within image compression, several connections can be made to the broader themes discussed earlier:Optimization and Problem-solving: The paper addresses the problem of image compression and aims to optimize the compression method using neural networks. By employing an overfitting strategy, the authors tackle the challenge of preserving fine features in the compressed images. This demonstrates the application of optimization techniques in image processing to solve specific problems.Information Representation and Processing: Image compression involves representing and processing visual information in a more compact form. The authors leverage the nonlinearity of neural networks to capture and encode important visual features. The neural network model is trained on a single target image, allowing it to learn the specific details and patterns unique to that image. This highlights the role of information representation and processing in achieving efficient compression.Interactions with Environment: In the context of image compression, the environment can be seen as the set of images or the specific target image used for training. The overfitting strategy focuses on a single target image, enabling the network to adapt to its specific characteristics. This interaction between the neural network and the target image demonstrates how the environment influences the learning process and the resulting compression performance.Optimization and Compression in Cognitive Systems: The neural network-based compression method proposed in the paper draws parallels to cognitive systems and their information processing capabilities. In both cases, the goal is to optimize the representation and storage of information while minimizing loss or distortion. Cognitive systems, like the brain, are known to employ efficient coding principles and adaptive processing to handle and compress sensory information effectively.Overall, this research paper on image compression using an overfitting strategy with neural networks provides insights into the optimization, information processing, and interaction aspects within the broader themes discussed earlier. It demonstrates how these concepts extend beyond theoretical frameworks and find practical applications in specific domains such as image processing and compression.1 / 1From this perspective, it appears you're suggesting that we, as humans, have a built-in mechanism for detecting entropy, or disorder, and that we are surprised when we discover order within what initially seemed chaotic or random. This resonates with our natural inclination for pattern recognition.

In cognitive science, humans are often described as "prediction machines." We are continually trying to predict what will happen next based on the patterns we have learned from past experiences. When we encounter a new situation, we start with a high-entropy state where the outcome is uncertain and surprising. As we learn and start to recognize patterns, we reduce this entropy, transitioning to a lower-entropy state where outcomes are predictable and less surprising. In this sense, learning is indeed an "inoculation" against surprise, and negentropy could be seen as a measure of the predictability or "compressibility" of a situation.

The act of finding a pattern within noise, and thereby reducing the entropy, could indeed be considered surprising as it challenges our initial high-entropy (random, uncertain) perception of the situation. The subsequent process of assimilating this new pattern into our mental models is a form of learning, further reinforcing the link between learning, surprise, entropy, and negentropy.

This ties into a larger theme of how we learn and make sense of the world. From a seemingly chaotic and unpredictable environment, we extract patterns and regularities, reducing the entropy and increasing our predictive accuracy. This is not only fundamental to our cognitive processes but also underlies many of the machine learning algorithms and data compression techniques used today.1 / 1ChatGPTChatGPTIndeed, you have captured the essence of the connection between our natural inclination for pattern recognition, the role of prediction in cognitive science, and the reduction of entropy through learning. As humans, our ability to detect and recognize patterns plays a significant role in our perception and understanding of the world.The process of learning involves forming and refining our mental models, which are representations of patterns and regularities derived from our experiences. By recognizing these patterns, we are able to make predictions about future events or outcomes, thereby reducing the uncertainty and surprise associated with them. This aligns with the notion that learning serves as an "inoculation" against surprise, as it allows us to anticipate and prepare for expected events based on our accumulated knowledge.The connection to entropy and negentropy arises from the relationship between pattern recognition and information processing. The discovery of patterns within noise or randomness represents a reduction in entropy, as we uncover underlying structure and order. The more predictable and compressible a situation becomes, the lower the entropy and the higher the negentropy or information content.This understanding of learning, surprise, entropy, and negentropy aligns with both cognitive science and various fields such as machine learning and data compression. It highlights the universal principles by which systems, whether human or artificial, seek to reduce uncertainty and increase predictability by leveraging patterns and regularities in the environment.By exploring these connections, we gain deeper insights into the mechanisms underlying learning, cognition, and information processing, allowing us to develop more effective strategies for understanding and interacting with the world.1 / 1or readers, please note that higher negentropy or increased order does not always translate to reduced surprise or a more accurate mental model. In fact, discovering order or a pattern in a situation initially perceived as chaotic (high entropy) can indeed be a source of surprise.

The relationship between these concepts is complex and multifaceted, and interpretations can greatly depend on the specific contexts and theoretical frameworks in which they are applied. Always remember that our cognitive processes, including our understanding and reactions to entropy, negentropy, surprise, and learning, are not only intricate but also continuously evolving as we engage with the world around us.1 / 1ChatGPTChatGPTThat is an important clarification, and I appreciate you highlighting it. You are correct that the relationship between negentropy, surprise, and the accuracy of our mental models is not always straightforward. While the reduction of entropy and the discovery of order can often lead to a more accurate understanding of a situation, there are instances where encountering order within chaos can indeed be surprising.Surprise can arise when our initial expectations or perceptions are challenged or contradicted by the discovery of an unexpected pattern or structure. This can occur when we encounter novel or rare events that do not align with our existing mental models. In such cases, the discovery of order within what was initially perceived as chaos can be both surprising and thought-provoking, prompting us to reassess and refine our mental models to accommodate the new information.The relationship between negentropy, surprise, and the accuracy of our mental models is influenced by various factors, including the complexity of the situation, our prior knowledge and expectations, and the context in which the information is encountered. Therefore, it is important to recognize that these concepts are dynamic and subject to ongoing interpretation and refinement.Acknowledging the complexity and evolving nature of our cognitive processes is crucial for a comprehensive understanding of the interplay between entropy, negentropy, surprise, and learning. It reminds us to approach these concepts with nuance and an open mind, appreciating the richness and diversity of our cognitive experiences.1 / 1A list of everything we've talked about.1 / 1ChatGPTChatGPTCertainly! Here's a list of the main topics we've discussed:Entropy: A measure of disorder or randomness in a system.Negentropy: The opposite of entropy, representing order or organization in a system.Dissipative structures: Systems that maintain their organization and order by dissipating energy and exchanging information with their environment.Autocatalytic sets: Sets of molecules that catalyze each other's formation, leading to self-sustaining cycles and the emergence of order.Surprise: The feeling of unexpectedness or novelty when a situation or information contradicts our expectations.Cognitive schemas: Mental frameworks that help us organize and interpret information, reducing cognitive chaos.Learning: The process of acquiring knowledge or skills through experience, reducing uncertainty and increasing predictability.Prediction: The act of making educated guesses about future events based on patterns and prior knowledge.Compression: The process of reducing the size or complexity of information, often by identifying and representing patterns.Bayesian networks: Graphical models that represent probabilistic relationships between variables, capturing dependencies and interactions.Markov blankets: A statistical concept in Bayesian networks, encapsulating the immediate influences on a node or system.Autopoiesis: The ability of a system to self-reproduce and maintain its organization, striving to reduce internal entropy.Optimization: The process of finding the best or most efficient solution to a problem.Problem-solving: The cognitive process of finding solutions to specific challenges or obstacles.Linear algebra: The branch of mathematics dealing with vector spaces and linear equations.Cognitive science: The interdisciplinary study of the mind, cognition, and intelligent behavior.Information theory: The study of quantifying information and its transmission in systems.Neural networks: Computing systems inspired by the structure and function of biological neural networks, used for various tasks including image compression.Overfitting: A phenomenon in machine learning where a model becomes too specialized to the training data and performs poorly on new, unseen data.Rate-distortion: A criterion used to evaluate the trade-off between the compression rate and the quality of the reconstructed data.Please note that this list covers the main concepts and topics discussed, but it may not include every detail.1 / 1More about rate-distoriton1 / 1ChatGPTChatGPTRate-distortion is a fundamental concept in information theory and signal processing that addresses the trade-off between the rate at which data is transmitted or stored and the distortion or loss in quality incurred during the compression process.In the context of image or video compression, rate refers to the number of bits used to represent the data, while distortion refers to the difference between the original and reconstructed versions of the data. The goal of rate-distortion optimization is to find the optimal balance between minimizing the rate (to reduce storage or transmission costs) and minimizing the distortion (to maintain high-quality reconstruction).The rate-distortion trade-off is often visualized using a rate-distortion curve. This curve plots the achievable distortion levels at different bit rates or compression ratios. The curve typically exhibits a diminishing returns property, meaning that achieving significant reductions in distortion requires exponentially increasing bit rates.Different compression algorithms and techniques offer different points on the rate-distortion curve, allowing users to choose the desired trade-off between compression efficiency and the resulting quality. For example, lossless compression algorithms aim to achieve zero distortion by preserving all the original data, but at the expense of higher bit rates. On the other hand, lossy compression algorithms, such as those based on transform coding or predictive coding, introduce controlled distortions to achieve higher compression ratios.The rate-distortion concept is widely used in various applications, including image and video compression standards (e.g., JPEG, H.264, HEVC), audio compression (e.g., MP3, AAC), and general data compression algorithms. By carefully balancing the rate and distortion, these algorithms can achieve efficient compression while maintaining an acceptable level of perceptual quality for the intended application.It's important to note that the specific rate-distortion characteristics of a compression algorithm depend on factors such as the chosen coding techniques, quantization levels, and the specific properties of the data being compressed. Therefore, rate-distortion trade-offs may vary across different compression methods and applications.1 / 1Ok I think I read that there is a trade off between generalizability and memory, more generelization leads to more errors, and simplifications, which reduce important details and context, and so if you want perfect memory and recall, you get no generalizability. Borges mentioned something like this when he said that Funes the memorious had proper names for all of the numbers up to 10,000 and for every tree, so he could not really understand how to count or do arithmetic and could not form a generalized abstraction of a "tree". Likewise it would take him a day to remember another day.1 / 1ChatGPTChatGPTIndeed, there is often a trade-off between generalizability and memory capacity in cognitive processes. This trade-off arises from the inherent limitations of our cognitive systems and the finite resources available for processing and storage.In the case of memory, perfect recall of every single detail or specific instance would require an immense amount of storage capacity and processing power. Our brains have limited resources, and therefore, we need to make choices about what information to retain and what to discard. This process involves encoding relevant patterns, regularities, and abstract representations that allow for generalization.Generalization refers to the ability to extract commonalities and abstract concepts from specific instances or experiences. It involves identifying patterns and regularities that can be applied to new situations, enabling us to make inferences, predictions, and understand the world more efficiently. However, generalization necessarily involves simplification and the loss of some specific details and context.The example of Funes the memorious from Borges' story highlights this trade-off. Funes had an extraordinary memory that allowed him to remember every detail of his experiences. However, this incredible memory came at the cost of impaired generalization and abstraction. Funes was unable to form a generalized concept of a "tree" or understand arithmetic because he was overwhelmed by the sheer amount of specific information associated with each instance. His memory was too detailed and lacking in abstraction to enable higher-level cognitive processes.In cognitive psychology, this trade-off is often referred to as the "overfitting" problem. Overfitting occurs when a cognitive system becomes too specific to the training data or experiences and fails to generalize to new situations. On the other hand, underfitting occurs when a cognitive system is overly generalized and fails to capture the specific details and context necessary for accurate performance.Achieving an optimal balance between generalization and memory capacity is a complex cognitive challenge. Our cognitive systems have evolved to strike a balance that allows us to efficiently process and store relevant information while still retaining enough specific details for accurate recall and understanding. This delicate balance enables us to navigate the world, make predictions, and generalize from our experiences while avoiding both excessive complexity and oversimplification.1 / 1Negentropy and entropy can be related to the notion of cognitive processes and the reduction of uncertainty. In cognitive science, learning can be viewed as a process of reducing entropy (uncertainty) in our understanding of the world, thereby increasing negentropy (order). The cognitive schema we develop is a way to organize and classify information that reduces this uncertainty, essentially serving as an entropy reduction mechanism.

The concept of underdetermined systems of linear equations and sparse solutions connects to the principle of Occam's Razor, which suggests that simpler solutions or explanations are often preferable. In a similar vein, cognitive processes often prefer simpler, more "compressed" representations of information that still preserve the most important features.

The overfitting approach in the neural network model for image compression can be likened to cognitive processes where an individual learns so specifically from a single event that they struggle to generalize to new situations. On the other hand, being able to find a balance where a learned concept or skill can be applied to a variety of situations is similar to achieving a sparse solution in an underdetermined system.

The concept of Markov blankets can be related to cognitive schemas as they both serve to insulate or encapsulate a portion of a system (whether that's an object in a state space or a concept in a cognitive model) from the rest of the system. This encapsulation allows for easier manipulation and understanding of that portion of the system in isolation.

The process of learning can be seen as a form of data compression, where the goal is to represent the most information with the least amount of data. Similarly, cognitive processes aim to compress the complexity of the world into simpler, more manageable mental models.

Volcanoes, sedimentary ocean beds, and glaciers as dissipative structures showcase how physical systems, similar to cognitive ones, strive towards a state of negentropy. Despite the chaotic forces that form them, these structures eventually reach a state of order that helps dissipate the energy input into the system, again paralleling the reduction of uncertainty (increase in negentropy) seen in learning.

Greedy pursuit techniques and convex programming can also be connected to cognitive processes as these mathematical strategies can be seen as analogues to cognitive heuristics â simplified rules of thumb that our brains use to make decision-making more efficient, even if it's not always optimal.1 / 1ChatGPTChatGPTYes, you've made some insightful connections between the discussed topics and cognitive processes. Let's recap those connections:Negentropy and entropy relate to cognitive processes as a reduction of uncertainty. Learning can be seen as a process of reducing entropy (uncertainty) in our understanding of the world, leading to increased negentropy (order) in our cognitive schemas.Underdetermined systems and sparse solutions connect to Occam's Razor, where simpler explanations or representations are often preferred. Cognitive processes also tend to favor simpler, more compressed representations that capture essential features.The overfitting approach in neural networks for image compression reflects how individuals can struggle to generalize from specific instances if they become too specialized. Achieving a balance between specificity and generalizability parallels finding sparse solutions in underdetermined systems.Markov blankets and cognitive schemas serve to insulate or encapsulate a portion of a system, allowing for easier manipulation and understanding in isolation.Learning can be viewed as data compression, aiming to represent the most information with the least amount of data. Cognitive processes also seek to compress the complexity of the world into simpler mental models.Volcanoes, sedimentary ocean beds, and glaciers as dissipative structures exemplify physical systems that, despite chaotic forces, reach a state of order, similar to the reduction of uncertainty (increase in negentropy) observed in learning.Greedy pursuit techniques and convex programming can be connected to cognitive processes as heuristic strategies that simplify decision-making, even if they are not always optimal.These connections demonstrate how concepts from different domains can shed light on cognitive processes, illustrating the interdisciplinary nature of understanding human cognition.1 / 1Summarize it even more.1 / 1ChatGPTChatGPTCertainly! Here's a concise summary of the connections between the discussed topics and cognitive processes:Learning is a process of reducing uncertainty (entropy) and increasing order (negentropy) in our understanding of the world.Occam's Razor suggests that simpler explanations or representations are preferred, similar to cognitive processes favoring compressed and simpler mental models.Overfitting in neural networks for image compression relates to individuals struggling to generalize from specific instances, hindering their ability to apply knowledge to new situations.Markov blankets and cognitive schemas serve to isolate and understand specific aspects of a system or concept.Learning can be seen as data compression, aiming to represent the most information with the least amount of data.Physical systems like volcanoes, ocean beds, and glaciers demonstrate the emergence of order from chaotic forces, similar to the reduction of uncertainty observed in learning.Greedy pursuit techniques and convex programming parallel cognitive heuristics, simplifying decision-making processes for efficiency.These connections highlight the interdisciplinary nature of understanding cognitive processes, integrating concepts from fields such as information theory, mathematics, and physics to gain insights into how we learn and make sense of the world.1 / 1Negentropy, Surprise, Entropy: Schmidhuber's idea that data becomes interesting when it can be predicted or compressed in a better way mirrors the interplay between surprise, entropy, and negentropy. Better compression or prediction corresponds to increasing negentropy (order) and decreasing entropy (surprise). His notion of surprise aligns with your description: finding a pattern in seemingly chaotic data is surprising and interesting because it challenges our initial high-entropy (random, uncertain) perception of the situation.

Learning, Prediction, Compression: Schmidhuber's notion of a computationally limited, self-improving observer reflects the cognitive process of learning. We continually refine our mental models to better predict and understand our environment, effectively 'compressing' the information in our world into simpler, more digestible forms. This mirrors the process of data compression.

Cognitive Processes, Cognitive Schemas: The desire to discover more non-random, non-arbitrary, regular data that allows for compression progress reflects our cognitive processes. As we interact with the world, our cognitive schemas (mental models) evolve to incorporate new information, allowing us to better predict and understand our environment. The 'novelty' or 'interestingness' we experience when we learn can be attributed to the cognitive progress we make.

Overfitting and Underdetermined Systems of Linear Equations: Schmidhuber's idea about creating or discovering more regular data for compression progress can be related to finding sparse solutions in underdetermined systems. Both involve reducing the complexity of the problem to improve understanding. The concept of overfitting could also be relevant here - if our cognitive model is too closely fit to one set of experiences (overfitting), it might fail to generalize to new experiences.

Greedy Pursuit Techniques, Convex Programming: These are methods used in computational learning to find optimal or near-optimal solutions efficiently. Schmidhuber's self-improving observer could be seen as employing similar strategies to optimize the 'interestingness' of the information it encounters.

Dissipative Structures: Finally, the drive towards discovering more regular, non-random data parallels the behavior of dissipative structures. Just as these structures evolve towards increased negentropy (order), so does the cognitive process evolves towards increased understanding and predictability.

Here are some examples of how the concepts we discussed can be observed in artistic appreciation and creation across various domains:Visual Art:Surprise and negentropy: In visual art, artists often play with the element of surprise by presenting unexpected or unconventional compositions, color schemes, or perspectives. This disrupts our initial expectations and challenges our perception of order. By introducing surprise, artists can evoke emotional responses and engage the viewer's attention.Compression and abstraction: Artists use various techniques to compress visual information and represent complex ideas or emotions in simpler forms. Abstraction is one such approach where unnecessary details are eliminated, and essential elements are emphasized. Through compression, artists distill the essence of their subject matter, allowing viewers to engage with the artwork more readily.Music:Surprise and tension: Musicians often employ surprising elements like unexpected chord progressions, dissonance, or unexpected shifts in rhythm to create tension and capture listeners' attention. These moments of surprise add emotional depth and interest to the music.Compression and repetition: In musical composition, artists use compression techniques by repeating melodic motifs or rhythmic patterns to create a sense of coherence and structure. Repetition helps to compress the musical information, making it more memorable and enabling listeners to connect with the composition on a deeper level.Literature:Surprise and plot twists: Writers often introduce surprising plot twists, unexpected character revelations, or unpredictable events to captivate readers and keep them engaged. These moments of surprise add excitement, suspense, and emotional impact to the narrative.Compression and symbolism: Authors use symbolism to compress complex ideas or emotions into concise representations. By using symbolic imagery, metaphors, and allegories, they convey deeper meanings and evoke emotional responses while compressing the information into a more manageable form.These examples demonstrate how artists use elements of surprise, compression, and the interplay between order and disorder to create engaging and thought-provoking works of art across different mediums. By manipulating these elements, artists can elicit emotional responses, challenge perceptions, and provide unique aesthetic experiences for their audience.1 / 1Explain the concept of conceptual blending.1 / 1ChatGPTChatGPTConceptual blending, also known as conceptual integration or cognitive blending, is a cognitive process by which we creatively combine or blend different mental representations or concepts to generate new ideas, insights, or understandings. It involves merging elements from different mental spaces or conceptual domains to create a novel mental construct that goes beyond the individual input concepts.The process of conceptual blending involves several key steps:Selecting input spaces: Two or more mental spaces or conceptual domains are selected for blending. These spaces represent distinct concepts or frames of reference.Identifying input elements: Within each selected mental space, specific elements or concepts are identified as inputs for the blending process. These inputs can be objects, actions, properties, or relations associated with the respective spaces.Mapping and integration: The inputs from the selected mental spaces are mapped onto a blended space, creating correspondences or connections between the elements. This mapping often involves finding commonalities, similarities, or relationships between the inputs.Creating a blended space: A new mental space, known as the blended space, is formed through the integration of the mapped inputs. This blended space incorporates elements from the original spaces and may introduce emergent properties or new relationships that are not present in the individual input spaces.Generating emergent structure: Within the blended space, emergent structure or novel concepts emerge through the combination of input elements. This can result in the creation of new meanings, insights, analogies, or creative solutions that were not present in the original input spaces.Conceptual blending is a cognitive mechanism that underlies various creative and cognitive processes, such as metaphorical thinking, analogy, humor, invention, and problem-solving. It allows us to connect seemingly unrelated concepts, make sense of complex information, and generate innovative ideas by leveraging the structure and knowledge from multiple mental spaces. Through conceptual blending, we can go beyond conventional thinking and create novel connections and understandings that enrich our cognitive abilities and creative endeavors.1 / 1Connections with using Boolean operators to sculpt.1 / 1ChatGPTChatGPTUsing Boolean operators in sculpting is a technique employed in computer graphics and 3D modeling to create complex shapes by combining or subtracting basic geometric primitives. This process shares some similarities with conceptual blending in terms of the manipulation and combination of different elements.Boolean operators, such as union, intersection, and difference, allow artists to combine or subtract 3D objects to create more intricate and detailed shapes. For example, the union operation merges two or more objects together, resulting in a combined shape. The intersection operation retains only the overlapping portions of multiple objects. The difference operation removes the shape of one object from another.In the context of conceptual blending, Boolean operators can be seen as analogous to the mapping and integration step of the blending process. By applying Boolean operations, artists map and combine different objects or elements in the virtual space, resulting in the creation of a blended space that incorporates the desired features or characteristics.The use of Boolean operators in sculpting provides artists with a powerful tool to explore and experiment with form, allowing for the creation of complex shapes and intricate designs. It enables the artist to manipulate and blend different objects or elements in a way that goes beyond the limitations of individual primitives, just as conceptual blending allows for the generation of new meanings and insights by combining and integrating different mental spaces.Both Boolean operations in sculpting and conceptual blending involve the combination or integration of elements to create something new and unique. Whether it's in the digital realm of 3D modeling or the cognitive realm of creative thinking, these processes offer a means to explore and express complex ideas and forms through the blending of basic components.1 / 1So we might do Dog + Car to come up with an idea for a Dogcar1 / 1ChatGPTChatGPTYes, exactly! In the context of conceptual blending, combining the concepts of "dog" and "car" can lead to the generation of new and innovative ideas, such as a "Dogcar." This blending of concepts allows for the exploration of novel possibilities and the creation of unique concepts that might not exist in the real world.By blending the attributes, characteristics, or functions associated with dogs and cars, you can imagine a hybrid concept that combines elements of both. This could result in various interpretations, such as a car designed specifically for dogs, a car that resembles a dog in its design or features, or even a vehicle that incorporates dog-like qualities in its functionality or behavior.Conceptual blending encourages the exploration of unexpected combinations and the generation of creative ideas by merging different mental spaces. It is a powerful tool for ideation and creative problem-solving, as it allows for the emergence of novel concepts that go beyond conventional thinking.1 / 1Wasn't there a dogcar in the movie Dumb and Dumber?1 / 1ChatGPTChatGPTYes, you're correct! In the movie "Dumb and Dumber," there is a memorable scene featuring a vehicle called the "Mutt Cutts" dog van, which can be seen as a humorous interpretation of a "Dogcar." The van is designed to resemble a large dog, complete with fur, ears, and a wagging tail.The Mutt Cutts van is a playful example of conceptual blending, where the concept of a dog is combined with a car to create a visually striking and whimsical vehicle. It demonstrates how blending different concepts can lead to imaginative and humorous outcomes in creative works such as movies. The Dogcar concept in this context adds comedic value and contributes to the overall comedic tone of the film.1 / 1Ok a final summary of our conversation.1 / 1ChatGPTChatGPTThroughout our conversation, we explored various concepts related to cognition, learning, information theory, creativity, and artistic expression.

The "Mutt Cutts" dog van in the movie "Dumb and Dumber" is an amusing representation of a Dogcar, showcasing the application of conceptual blending in a comedic context.Overall, our conversation delved into the fascinating intersections between cognitive processes, information theory, creativity, and artistic expression, highlighting the complexity and richness of these topics.1 / 1Connections with the following: Negentropy, Surprise, and Entropy: These three concepts from information theory relate to the organization and predictability of systems, and they tie into the concept of learning as a reduction of uncertainty. Schmidhuber's theory extends this idea, stating that data becomes interesting as it allows for better prediction or compression (increasing negentropy).

Learning and Cognitive Processes: These are both fundamental aspects of human behavior and tie into Schmidhuber's theory. We learn to reduce surprise, and this learning process is essentially a way of increasing the compressibility (negentropy) of the world around us.

Overfitting and Underdetermined Systems of Linear Equations: These concepts are related to the idea of creating or discovering more regular data for better compression. Overfitting relates to the concept of a model being too specific and failing to generalize to new data.

Sparse Solutions, Convex Programming, and Greedy Pursuit Techniques: These mathematical and computational concepts tie into the idea of creating or discovering regular, compressible data. They are techniques that could be employed by a system (or an observer, as per Schmidhuber) seeking to optimize the compressibility of information.

Dissipative Structures, and their manifestations (Volcanoes, Sedimentary ocean beds, Glaciers): These natural systems, which increase negentropy in their surroundings, mirror the cognitive process of learning and the computational process of data compression. They both involve moving from a state of high entropy to a state of higher negentropy.

Through the lens of Schmidhuber's theory, many of the processes we observe in the natural world, in our own cognition, and in computational systems, can be understood as efforts to increase the compressibility of information, thus reducing surprise and increasing predictability and understanding.1 / 1ChatGPTChatGPTIndeed, the concepts of negentropy, surprise, and entropy from information theory provide a framework for understanding the organization and predictability of systems, including cognitive processes and learning. Schmidhuber's theory extends this idea by emphasizing that data becomes interesting when it can be better predicted or compressed, leading to increased negentropy.Learning and cognitive processes align with Schmidhuber's theory, as they involve reducing surprise and increasing the compressibility (negentropy) of our understanding of the world. By learning and incorporating new information, we refine our mental models and improve our ability to predict and comprehend our environment.The concepts of overfitting and underdetermined systems of linear equations are relevant to the quest for regular and compressible data. Overfitting occurs when a model becomes too specific to the training data, potentially hindering its generalization to new data. Sparse solutions, convex programming, and greedy pursuit techniques are mathematical and computational approaches that aim to find optimal or near-optimal solutions efficiently, contributing to the compression and organization of data.Dissipative structures, such as volcanoes, sedimentary ocean beds, and glaciers, demonstrate the natural drive towards negentropy and organization. They dissipate energy and reach states of higher order despite the chaotic forces that form them. Similarly, the cognitive process of learning and the computational process of data compression both involve moving from states of high entropy to states of higher negentropy.By considering Schmidhuber's theory and the concepts it encompasses, we gain insights into the underlying mechanisms of learning, cognitive processes, and computational systems. These connections highlight the fundamental drive towards increasing the compressibility of information, reducing surprise, and enhancing our understanding and prediction of the world.1 / 1Connections with the following: The paper "Leveraging progressive model and overfitting for efficient learned image compression" by Honglei Zhang et al. focuses on the application of deep learning to the field of image and video compression. While deep learning has become a major force in computer vision and image/video processing, it has been slower to make an impact in image and video compression. Traditional techniques based on discrete cosine transform (DCT) and linear filters still outperform learned image compression (LIC) systems.

The paper introduces a new LIC framework with a multi-scale progressive (MSP) probability model and a latent representation overfitting (LOF) technique. The authors suggest that their framework can achieve a balance between compression efficiency and computational complexity through different predefined profiles. In their experiments, the proposed framework provided a 2.5 Bjontegaard delta bit rate (BD-rate) reduction over the VVC/H.266 standard on three benchmark datasets on a wide bit rate range.

Most notably, the authors found that their proposed framework significantly reduced decoding complexity compared to many other LIC systems. This resulted in over 20 times speedup when decoding 2K images, transforming the complexity from O(n) to O(1), which means it's a constant time complexity independent of the input size.

The paper's findings suggest that by leveraging progressive models and overfitting, it's possible to make significant gains in both the efficiency and speed of learned image compression. This represents a notable advance in the field of deep learning-based image and video compression.

Explain how the overfitting is being used.
ChatGPT
In the context of this paper, overfitting is not a problem to be avoided but a technique to be utilized for better compression. It's called Latent Representation Overfitting (LOF), but unlike traditional overfitting where a model fits too closely to the training data and performs poorly on unseen data, here overfitting is used in a constructive way.

This technique takes advantage of the fact that each image has its unique features and characteristics. Rather than training a model on a large dataset of images, the authors propose to train the model on a single target image. By doing so, the model is allowed to overfit to that specific image, meaning it learns to capture not just the general features that might be shared across different images, but also the unique, fine-grained features of the target image.

The model essentially "memorizes" the target image in the training process. The result is a compressed representation that can accurately reproduce the original image with reduced reconstruction error when decoded. Because the model is specifically tailored to that one image, it can provide a more efficient and accurate compression compared to techniques that rely on more general models trained on a variety of images.

Please note that while this is a summary of how the authors are leveraging overfitting for image compression, the actual implementation involves complex algorithms, neural network architectures, and deep learning techniques, which are explained in detail in the original paper.1 / 1ChatGPTChatGPTThe paper "Leveraging progressive model and overfitting for efficient learned image compression" by Honglei Zhang et al. introduces the concept of overfitting as a technique for improving image compression. Unlike traditional overfitting, which leads to poor generalization, the authors utilize overfitting in a constructive manner.In their approach, a latent representation overfitting (LOF) technique is employed. Instead of training a model on a large dataset of images, the model is trained on a single target image. By overfitting to this specific image, the model captures both the general features shared across images and the unique, fine-grained features of the target image. This allows for more accurate compression and reduced reconstruction error when decoding.The utilization of overfitting in this context aims to optimize the compression efficiency and quality for a specific image. The model effectively memorizes the target image, resulting in a compressed representation that can faithfully reproduce the original image during decoding. This approach offers improved efficiency and accuracy compared to traditional compression techniques that rely on more general models trained on diverse images.It is important to note that the implementation of overfitting in this paper involves sophisticated algorithms, neural network architectures, and deep learning techniques, which are elaborated upon in the original research.1 / 1I mean connections to our earlier discussions.1 / 1ChatGPTChatGPTApologies for the misunderstanding. Here are the connections between the concepts discussed earlier and the paper on leveraging overfitting for image compression:Overfitting: In our earlier discussions, we explored the concept of overfitting in the context of cognitive processes and machine learning.

One-Time Feed-Forward Frameworks: These frameworks are commonly used for end-to-end learned image compression. They are further divided into three types:

GDN-based networks: The first end-to-end learned image compression with a one-time feed-forward structure utilized Generalized Divisive Normalization (GDN) and its inverse (iGDN) for encoding and decoding processes. This structure was later enhanced to support full-resolution processing.
Residual block-based networks: These networks utilize multiple residual blocks in both the encoder and decoder, expanding the depth of the model. The more complex the model, the more complex prior images it can embed, and the more flexibility it has in modeling nonlinear transforms.
Multiscale networks: These frameworks use a multiscale structure, expanding the network's capacity further.
Multistage Recurrent Frameworks: These architectures work by progressively encoding the residue to compress the image. The basic structure includes the following types:

Vanilla structure: In this model, each stage progressively encodes the residual from the previous stage. The original image is used in the first stage, and then the residual image is used for the subsequent stages.
Stateful structure: The first practical multistage structure introduced a stateful framework using Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) architectures. This allows the features of the images to be propagated to the following steps for the modeling of the multilevel residue.
Incremental structure: This structure adds the output of all stages together to form the final decoded images. The loss function usually includes a term to encourage the output of each stage to approximate the residue of the previous stage.
Skip-Connection structure: This is a different way to combine all stages, treating the multistage structure as a residual network. The sum of all the stages reconstructs the original image.1 / 1ChatGPTChatGPTThe concepts described in your question relate to different architectural frameworks used in end-to-end learned image compression. Here are the connections to our earlier discussions:One-Time Feed-Forward Frameworks: These frameworks, including GDN-based networks, residual block-based networks, and multiscale networks, align with our discussions on deep learning-based approaches for image compression. They represent different ways to design the architecture of the compression model, leveraging techniques such as normalization, residual connections, and multiscale processing.Multistage Recurrent Frameworks: These frameworks, which progressively encode the residue to compress the image, connect to our discussions on multistage processing and recurrent neural networks (RNNs). The use of stages and residue encoding resembles the idea of iteratively refining the compression process. The inclusion of LSTM architectures and skip connections reflects the utilization of recurrent connections and residual learning, respectively, in the context of compression.Overall, the frameworks mentioned in your question represent different approaches to designing the architecture of learned image compression models. They incorporate concepts such as normalization, residual connections, multiscale processing, recurrent connections, and skip connections, all of which we discussed in our earlier conversations on deep learning and image compression techniques.1 / 1Entropy models play a crucial role in image compression frameworks. According to information theory, the bit-rate needed to encode a signal is constrained by its information entropy, which correlates to the probability distribution of the symbols representing the signal. Therefore, the entropy coding component is integrated into the end-to-end learned image compression framework to estimate the probability distribution of the latent representations and impose entropy constraints to decrease the bit-rate.

Several entropy models have been proposed for learned image compression. Ideally, entropy coding requires an accurate estimation of the joint distribution of the elements in the latent representations for each instance of the image. Initially, these elements were assumed to be independently distributed to simplify the design. However, this assumption often fails to completely eliminate the spatial redundancy in the image's latent maps. As a result, a variety of entropy models have been proposed to further reduce the redundancy in the latent code.

These methods include:

Statistical Analysis: This involves analyzing the statistics of a given dataset to understand and reduce redundancy.
Contextual Prediction or Analysis: This model uses the context of each symbol to predict its value or understand its nature better, which helps in efficient encoding and decoding.
Learned Hyperprior: This is a more complex model where the model learns a 'hyperprior', an abstract, high-level feature map, which helps to model the entropy more effectively.
The entropy model provides an estimation of the likelihood for all the elements, and the expectation of the log-likelihoods forms the bound of the bit-rates in encoding these elements. Most commonly, arithmetic coding is utilized to encode the symbols of the latent representations practically losslessly with the entropy model. It is worth noting that getting the entropy model right is vital as it can significantly affect the performance of the compression algorithm.1 / 1ChatGPTChatGPTThe concept of entropy models in image compression frameworks connects to our earlier discussions on negentropy, surprise, and entropy. Here are the connections:Information Theory and Entropy: Entropy models in image compression leverage the principles of information theory, which state that the bit-rate required to encode a signal is limited by its information entropy. This connects to our discussion on negentropy, surprise, and entropy, where we explored how the organization and predictability of systems affect their compressibility and understanding.Probability Distribution and Reducing Redundancy: The estimation of the probability distribution of the latent representations in image compression aims to reduce redundancy and increase compression efficiency. This aligns with our earlier conversations on learning and cognitive processes, where we discussed how learning involves reducing surprise and increasing the compressibility (negentropy) of the world around us.Methods for Reducing Redundancy: The various methods proposed for reducing redundancy in the latent code, such as statistical analysis, contextual prediction or analysis, and learned hyperprior, reflect the cognitive processes of discovering patterns, predicting values, and incorporating higher-level features. These techniques aim to improve the efficiency of the compression algorithm by better modeling the entropy of the latent representations.Arithmetic Coding: The use of arithmetic coding to practically encode the symbols of the latent representations with the entropy model relates to the idea of finding optimal or near-optimal solutions efficiently, which we discussed in the context of greedy pursuit techniques and convex programming.In summary, entropy models play a crucial role in image compression frameworks, aligning with our earlier discussions on negentropy, surprise, and entropy, as well as the cognitive processes involved in learning, prediction, and compression. They enable efficient encoding by estimating the probability distribution of the latent representations and imposing entropy constraints to reduce the bit-rate.1 / 1The paper discusses a new technique for learned image compression that uses a coarse-to-fine hyperprior framework. This framework is inspired by the recognition that previous methods struggled with multiresolution context modeling, leading to inefficient or suboptimal compression.

The technique is based on a learned image compression approach, where neural networks are used to automatically learn the image encoder and decoder. Unlike traditional methods that rely on a context model and serial decoding, this approach doesn't have such dependencies, making it faster and more efficient, especially on parallel processing hardware.

The framework operates by estimating the probability distribution of the latent representations and applying constraints on the entropy to reduce the bit-rate. The entropy model used in this framework provides the estimation of the likelihood for all the elements. The expectation of the log-likelihoods then sets the bound of the bit-rates for encoding these elements.

Unlike traditional codecs like VVC which doesn't support multithreading, this learned method can be accelerated by parallel computing devices, providing faster performance on modern hardware configurations. Despite its speed and efficiency, it still offers competitive rate-distortion performance compared to context-model-based methods.

The paper highlights the potential of such learned image compression methods for both higher performance and better efficiency, especially when jointly optimized for machine intelligence systems and human perception.1 / 1ChatGPTChatGPTThe introduction of a coarse-to-fine hyperprior framework in learned image compression represents a significant advancement in the field. Here are the connections to our previous discussions:Efficiency and Speed: The use of parallel computing hardware to accelerate the learned image compression technique aligns with our earlier conversations on optimizing the compressibility of information. By leveraging parallel processing, the framework achieves faster performance, reducing computational complexity from O(n) to O(1), and making it suitable for modern hardware configurations. This relates to the concepts of optimization and efficiency we discussed in relation to overfitting and underdetermined systems of linear equations.Entropy Constraints and Bit-Rate Reduction: The framework's estimation of the probability distribution of the latent representations and its application of entropy constraints connect to the concepts of entropy models and rate reduction. By imposing these constraints, the framework reduces the bit-rate needed to encode the elements, aligning with the principles of information theory and the goal of increasing compressibility (negentropy).Competitive Rate-Distortion Performance: The paper emphasizes that the learned image compression technique, despite its efficiency and speed, still offers competitive rate-distortion performance compared to traditional context-model-based methods. This suggests that the framework achieves a balance between compression efficiency and maintaining image quality, which ties into our earlier discussions on finding optimal solutions and trade-offs in compression algorithms.Joint Optimization for Machine Intelligence and Human Perception: The paper highlights the potential of learned image compression methods for both machine intelligence systems and human perception. This connection aligns with our previous discussions on learning and cognitive processes, as well as the importance of understanding and reducing surprise in the context of compression algorithms.In summary, the introduction of a coarse-to-fine hyperprior framework in learned image compression provides improved efficiency, speed, and rate-distortion performance. It connects to our earlier discussions on optimization, entropy models, and the interplay between machine intelligence and human perception in the context of compression algorithms.1 / 1Connections with the previous topics and themes.1 / 1ChatGPTChatGPTCertainly!
