Sceptron
The following article is from The Great Soviet Encyclopedia (1979). It might be outdated or ideologically biased.
Sceptron 
an optoelectronic device that analyzes complex electrical signals in the frequency range from 100 hertz to 100 kilohertz on the basis of the signals��� spectral and time characteristics. The term ���sceptron��� is derived from ���spectral comparative pattern recognizer.���


Figure 1. Block diagram of a sceptron: (1) light source, (2) resonant array of quartz or glass optical fibers that are of different lengths (< several centimeters) and different diameters (< 100 micrometers) and are attached at one end to a common base, (3) reference mask consisting of a glass plate with a transparent or dark pattern, (4) matrix of photocells, (5) analyzing and classifying device, (6) exciter of array of optical fibers (an electrodynamic or piezoelectric transducer that converts electrical signals into mechanical vibrations)

The operation of a sceptron is based on the mechanical resonance properties of optical fibers (seeFIBER OPTICS and LIGHT GUIDE). Amplified electrical signals from a microphone or optoelectronic sensing device arrive at the sceptron input (Figure 1). The signals are fed to an electromechanical exciter and cause it and certain groups of fibers to vibrate at resonant frequencies. Light rays passing through the vibrating and stationary fibers reach a reference mask and pass through it to a matrix of photocells. On the basis of the current distribution in the photocell circuits, an analyzing device determines whether the signal being analyzed is identical to the recorded reference pattern. If the signal is recognizable, it is classified by the analyzing device.

Sceptrons appeared in the early 1960���s and are used in, for example, cryptography, medicine, and communication systems. In particular, sceptrons are used in the recognition of graphic characters and speech signals, in the analysis of information from hydroacoustic installations, in the diagnosis of heart and lung diseases on the basis of characteristic acoustic noise, and in the study of the ���language��� of dolphins.

The sceptron, as described in the article from The Great Soviet Encyclopedia (1979), is an optoelectronic device that analyzes complex electrical signals based on their spectral and time characteristics. It uses the mechanical resonance properties of optical fibers to process these signals.
Here's a brief breakdown of how a sceptron works:
Input Signals
: Amplified electrical signals, which can be from various sources like a microphone or other sensing devices, are fed into the sceptron.
Vibration
: These signals are directed to an electromechanical exciter. This causes specific groups of optical fibers to vibrate at their resonant frequencies.
Light Transmission
: Light rays pass through both the vibrating and stationary fibers. These rays then reach a reference mask, which can either allow or block the light based on its pattern.
Detection
: After passing through the reference mask, the light rays hit a matrix of photocells. Based on how the light distributes and causes currents in these photocells, an analyzing device can determine whether the incoming signal matches a known reference pattern.
Classification
: If the signal matches a recognized pattern, the analyzing device classifies it accordingly.
Sceptrons were introduced in the early 1960s and found applications in various fields, including cryptography, medicine, and communication systems. For example, they can be used to recognize graphic characters, analyze speech signals, diagnose certain medical conditions based on acoustic noise, and even study dolphin communication.
Given the advances in technology since the 1970s, particularly in the domains of digital signal processing and machine learning, the use and popularity of such devices might have diminished. Modern methods for signal processing and pattern recognition often utilize digital techniques and algorithms. However, understanding historical technologies like the sceptron provides insight into the development and evolution of modern systems.

April 1963���

Phones that dial a spoken number, typewriters that print out whatever you say to them, underwater ears that identify a hostile submarine ��� these are just a few of the uses foreseen for a new signal-recognizing ���brain.���

In a recent demonstration of its talents, an engineer talked into a microphone connected to a tabletop version of the device.

The instrument had been set up to respond to the word ���five.��� Whenever he uttered this word, the brain instantly flashed a telltale light. It ignored every other word he said.

As easily, the device can be adapted to recognize any word whatever ��� or any signal, audible or visible, that can be translated into electrical pulses.

A composite ���brain���, made up of a number of units, could recognize many spoken commands and respond in appropriately different ways to each one.

Called the Sceptron (for Spectral comparative pattern recognizer), the device is being readied for both civilian and military uses by the Sperry Gyroscope Company, which considers its novel principle an advance as fundamental and versatile as the transistor.

Invented by Robert Hawkins, Sceptron combines vibrating optical fibers that analyze sounds or other signals, and a photographic memory cell to recognize them.

Within a Sceptron is a tuft of 700 or more transparent quartz fibers, of varying length, supported at one end like bristles in a shaving brush. An incoming signal jiggles the fibers��� mounting, by means of a driver unit such as a loudspeaker coil or a piezoelectric transducer. Some fibers vibrate, others don���t, depending on their individual responses to the various frequencies blended in a signal.

Meanwhile, light from a lamp bulb travels lengthwise through the fibers ��� and emerges from their quivering or motionless tips.

All that needed to be added to put Sceptron in business is a ���memory��� mask, which transmits the emerging light only when the fibers are vibrating in a particular pattern ��� and, beyond the mask, a light-detecting photocell.

Variations in mask-making technique give a mask that recognizes a certain word, whoever speaks it; or a certain person���s voice, whatever he says.

In the demonstration model, Sceptron���s quartz-fiber array takes up a cubic inch of space, but Sperry has already made a miniaturized version as small as 1/300 of a cubic inch. Thus, it says, it���s approaching the point where a composite ���brain��� as complex as the human brain could be put in a desk size console.

Image one: Table-top Sceptron hookup, listening to a talk by its demonstrator, lights up indicator (right of center) whenever he says ���five��� and ignores every other word. Assembling enough Sceptron units to obey many verbal commands might yield voice-operated phone dials and cash registers, and typewriters that take dictation by directly transcribing spoken words.

Image two: At the heart of Sceptron is a tuft of quartz fibers, like the one held in the forceps. Fibers vary in length, and different frequencies, blended in an incoming signal, make different ones vibrate.

Image three: Photo-plate mask, being inserted, is ���memory��� that recognizes a certain word. Interchangeable masks, each with a different pattern, make Sceptron responsive to various cues
ChatGPT
The information presented provides a fascinating glimpse into early attempts at voice recognition technology in the 1960s. The Sceptron, as described, seems to be a rudimentary precursor to modern voice recognition systems. Its approach to recognizing auditory patterns using vibrating optical fibers is ingenious for its time.
Signal Recognition
: The primary function of the Sceptron is to recognize specific signals (in this case, the word "five") and respond accordingly. While it sounds basic compared to today's standards, this was a significant step towards voice recognition in an era when such technology was in its infancy.
Quartz Fibers
: The utilization of quartz fibers of varying lengths, which respond to different frequencies, is a unique approach. As the fibers vibrate in response to specific frequencies, they allow light to pass through them in a distinctive pattern.
Memory Mask
: The "memory" mask serves as a filter, allowing light through only when fibers vibrate in a specific pattern. This ensures that only the desired word or signal is recognized.
Applications
: The potential applications for the Sceptron were vast, ranging from voice-operated phone dials and cash registers to typewriters that could transcribe spoken words directly.
Size
: The miniaturization of the technology (from a cubic inch to 1/300 of a cubic inch) indicates the direction towards compact devices, a trend we see prevalent in today's electronics.
To draw a modern parallel, while the Sceptron might seem basic by today's standards, it could be likened to how the first cell phones (large, clunky, with limited functionality) compare to today's smartphones. Each technological advancement, regardless of how primitive it may seem in retrospect, plays a crucial role in the evolution of technology. The Sceptron, with its innovative use of optical fibers for sound recognition, undoubtedly paved the way for the advanced voice recognition systems we have today.
It was an optoelectronic device where the audio signal was put through a fiber optic film through some photographic films which acted as noise filters kind of like a Fourier analysis it kind of "recognized" the sound of the word "five"
ChatGPT
Indeed, the Sceptron's design and functionality can be summarized as an early, optoelectronic approach to audio signal recognition:
Optoelectronic Device
: This means that the Sceptron used both light (optical) and electronic processes to function.
Audio Input
: When an audio signal, such as someone saying the word "five", entered the device, it would cause specific fibers to vibrate at certain frequencies, much like how a specific sound wave would have its unique frequency components.
Fiber Optic Film
: The optical fibers, made of quartz and varying in length, would resonate or vibrate differently depending on the frequencies present in the incoming audio signal. This is reminiscent of how a Fourier analysis decomposes a signal into its constituent frequencies.
Photographic Masks
: These served as the recognition filters. As light passed through the vibrating fibers, only specific patterns of light (corresponding to the recognized word or sound) would be allowed to pass through the mask and be detected by the photocell on the other side. The mask essentially "encoded" the pattern of the recognized word and acted as a comparator. If the light pattern matched the mask due to the recognized sound, the device would produce an output.
Output
: In the example given, the output was a light indicator that would light up whenever the word "five" was spoken into the device.
This approach, while innovative for its time, is obviously rudimentary compared to today's digital signal processing techniques and sophisticated algorithms. Still, the Sceptron provides a fascinating glimpse into early efforts at audio signal recognition using a combination of optics and electronics.
Explain the device again
ChatGPT
Certainly!
The Sceptron is an early optoelectronic device designed for audio signal recognition. Here's how it worked:
Input
: An audio signal, like someone speaking a word, is introduced into the device.
Optical Fibers
: The device contains a group of transparent quartz fibers of varying lengths. When the audio signal enters, it causes some of these fibers to vibrate at specific frequencies corresponding to the sound's frequency components. The different lengths of the fibers mean that they each resonate or vibrate at different frequencies.
Light Source
: A light is shone through these fibers. The vibrating fibers will modulate this light based on their vibrations.
Photographic Memory Masks
: After passing through the fibers, the light encounters a mask. This mask has a specific pattern that corresponds to the light pattern created by a recognized word (like "five"). If the vibrating fibers produce a light pattern that matches the mask's pattern, the light will pass through the mask.
Photocell Detection
: Beyond the mask is a photocell. If the light pattern from the fibers matches the mask and passes through, the photocell detects this light.
Output
: When the device recognizes the audio signal based on the light detected by the photocell, it produces an output. In the example you provided, it lit up an indicator whenever the word "five" was detected.
In essence, the Sceptron used the vibration of optical fibers, modulated light patterns, and specialized masks to recognize specific audio signals.

The text you've provided appears to discuss the properties and behavior of a device that employs optical fibers and a light source to transmit and process signals. This is indeed related to the Sceptron device you mentioned earlier, but it dives deeper into the technical aspects and nuances of the device.
Here's a summary:
Light Sources
: The document mentions the potential for using very small light sources such as zirconium arc lamps and high-pressure mercury arc lamps. The response of the device can be linear or follow a square law, depending on the type of source and the resulting output.
Optical Fiber Variations
: Variations in the slant of the fibers impact the device's response. The use of a small light source is preferred to minimize the effect of these variations.
Dynamic Range
: The dynamic range of the device is discussed, which refers to the ratio of the maximum to minimum input for which the output is meaningful. Factors like fiber slant, diffraction, and the size of the light source influence the dynamic range.
Diffraction
: Diffraction, which is a phenomenon related to the wave nature of light, plays a significant role. When dimensions are close to the wavelength of light, diffraction effects become pronounced. For instance, to achieve a dynamic range of 40 db with a fiber that's .002 inches thick, a fiber displacement of 20 microinches (one wavelength of green light) must be detected.
Models
: The document presents various models of the device. Model number 1, for instance, involves a single mask and a fiber with two knife edges illuminated by a collimated light source. The intensity pattern due to this setup is computed using Fresnel integrals for each light wavelength.
Transfer Function
: The transfer function, which relates light output to fiber displacement, is discussed in depth. Factors like fiber motion, light leakage, and fiber amplitude are considered in its computation.
In essence, this text delves into the technical aspects of a device similar to the Sceptron, focusing on the interplay of light sources, optical fibers, and signal processing techniques.
The dynamic range can be determined from this curve. The

useful outputs.

ChatGPT
The provided text dives into a technical discussion of how the dynamic range of an optical system is affected by its components and design. Here's a breakdown of the key points:
Dynamic Range Definition
: Dynamic range, in this context, refers to the ratio of the maximum to minimum input signal levels where the array (or system) provides meaningful outputs. For instance, a maximum fiber displacement of one fiber thickness is considered useful since any larger displacements would result in clipping. The minimum useful displacement cited is about .07 x 10^-3 inches, leading to a dynamic range of approximately 29 decibels (dB).
Factors Affecting Dynamic Range
:
The dynamic range changes based on the distance between the mask and the fiber. As mask clearance decreases by half, the dynamic range increases by 3 dB.
The dynamic range also depends on fiber thickness. Doubling the fiber thickness increases the dynamic range by 6 dB.
Different Models and Their Impact on Dynamic Range
:
Model 1
: Features a double mask setup which, when combined with diffraction effects, results in a dynamic range loss of 12 dB, yielding a dynamic range of 17 dB.
Model 2
: Introduces the idea of a slanted fiber. A 5-degree slant doubles the slot width, which increases the dynamic range by 6 dB, leading to a total of 23 dB.
Model 3
: Concerns arise about large slants because light rays could reflect off the fibers through adjacent slots.
Model 4
: Introduces a new design where light rays make an angle with the fibers, and mask slots are wider than the fiber's shadow. It delves into Fresnel and Fraunhofer diffraction patterns, suggesting that the design could maintain a broad dynamic range due to the larger slits accommodating diffraction effects more effectively.
Interactions of Light with Fibers
:
When light hits the edge of the fiber, it results in a Fresnel diffraction pattern. The minimum detectable fiber displacement at this point is about 70 microinches.
Slit considerations: The system has slits of varying sizes. The discussion examines how light interacts with and passes through these slits and how this affects the overall system performance. For instance, a slit's size can determine how much of the main diffraction pattern it can accommodate.
Reflectivity of the fiber is mentioned at the end, suggesting it's a factor to consider as it could introduce additional interference or diffraction effects.
In summary, this technical passage focuses on understanding how different design choices, particularly the dimensions and placements of masks and fibers, impact the dynamic range of an optical system. The dynamic range is crucial as it indicates the range of signal levels the system can handle without distortion or loss of information.
