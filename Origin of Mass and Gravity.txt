The Origin of Mass and the Nature of Gravity
 Haramein Nassim;  Guermonprez Cyprien;  Alirol Olivier

From the early explorations of thermodynamics and characterization of black body radiation, Max Planck predicted the existence of a non-zero expectation value for the electromagnetic quantum vacuum energy density or zero-point energy (ZPE). From the mechanics of a quantum oscillator, Planck derived the black body spectrum, which satisfied the Stefan-Boltzmann law with a non-vanishing term remaining where the summation of all modes of oscillations diverged to infinity in each point of the field. In modern derivation, correlation functions are utilized to derive the coherent behavior of the creation and annihilation operators. Although a common approach is to normalize the Hamiltonian so that all ground state modes cancel out, setting artificially ZPE to zero, zero-point energy is essential for the mathematical consistency of quantum mechanics as it maintains the non-commutativity of the creation and annihilation operators resulting in the Heisenberg uncertainty principle. From our computation, we demonstrate that coherent modes of the correlation functions at the characteristic time of the proton correctly result in the emergence of its mass directly from quantum vacuum fluctuation modes. We find as well that this energy value is consistent with a Casimir cavity of the same characteristic distance. As a result, we developed an analytical solution describing both the structure of quantum spacetime as vacuum fluctuations and extrapolate this structure to the surface dynamics of the proton to define a screening mechanism of the electromagnetic fluctuations at a given scale. From an initial screening at the reduced Compton wavelength of the proton, we find a direct relation to Einstein field equations and the Schwarzschild solution describing a source term for the internal energy of the proton emerging from zero-point electromagnetic fluctuations. A second screening of the vacuum fluctuations is found at the proton charge radius, which accurately results in the rest mass. Considering the initial screening, we compute the Hawking radiation value of the core Schwarzschild structure and find it to be equivalent to the rest mass energy diffusing in the internal structure of the proton. The resulting pressure gradient or pressure forces are calculated and found to be a very good fit to all the measured values of the color force and residual strong force typically associated to quark-antiquark and gluon flux tubes confinement. As a result, we are able to unify all confining forces with the gravitational force emerging from the curvature of spacetime induced by quantum electromagnetic vacuum fluctuations. Finally, we applied the quantum vacuum energy density screening mechanism to the observable universe and compute the correct critical energy density typically given for the total mass-energy of the universe

Introduction 
General relativity clearly demonstrates a relationship between mass-energy and the structure of spacetime 
that has real physical ef f ects we call gravity where massive objects made of elementary particles producing 
their mass curve spacetime resulting in a gravitational force. However, application of the same principles at 
the particles level yields gravitational forces that are so inf i nitely small that they are found to be insignif i cant. 
Yet, at the proton nuclear scale, extremely large conf i ning forces are found which would require extremely high 
energy levels (or masses) to be produced in the context of general relativity. In fact, those very high levels of 
energy were actually predicted by early quantum i eld theory (QFT) resulting in the so-called ���bare mass��� 
of particles but renormalized by modern quantum electrodynamics (QED) and quantum chromodynamics

(QCD) utilizing quantum vacuum l uctuations as a shielding mechanism [1]. Consequently, one could ask the 
question in a dif f erent way than generally approached, that is instead of why gravity is so weak, that has 
no meaning at the quantum level, but why is the proton mass, which is most of the mass of the material 
world, so small. This change in reasoning was eventually mentioned by other such as Franck Wilczek [2]. 
Furthermore, from deep studies of QFT and the divergence of the bare mass, one can ask a more fundamental 
question: is quantum vacuum l uctuations responsible for the bare mass shielding or the source of the mass 
itself and the resulting forces? This leads to a clear re-examination of our concept of mass. 
The general idea that mass is some kind of immutable value independent of forces and energies was dispelled 
in the early 1900 by the event of special and general relativity, when it was found that there is a fundamental 
equivalence between the concept of mass, energy and the geometry of space. At the quantum scale, the 
concept of mass is also described as a variable quantity which can be scaled and screened. Yet, the stigma 
that mass is somehow still an isolated entity and that matter is some kind of frozen immutable pieces of 
material as in particles is very much still embedded in the folklore of physics. Throughout history, we 
have developed theories that have told us that gravitational fundamental forces which agglomerate particles 
and organized matter such as galaxies, stars, solar systems and planets, are the result of the curvature 
of the structure of space itself. However, this curvature results from an undef i ned source of energy called 
mass emerging from quantum entities we called particles. On the other hand, we have developed theories 
that describe these particles and energy structures as quantities emerging from very high energetic i elds 
resulting from a fundamental oscillation of space itself we call quantum vacuum l uctuations, or ground 
state. This i eld of ���virtual��� particles is at the source of many of our modern particle theories of QFT, 
one of them being the Higgs i elds with a non-zero vacuum expectation value producing mass which only 
predicts���1���5% of the mass of the proton, or for the explanation of the little jiggle of an electron as in the 
Lamb shift. Consequently, both cosmological gravitational theory and quantum theory imbues very physi- 
cal values to the structure of space itself with ef f ects which have very fundamental and real attributes in reality. 
Vacuum l uctuations or zero-point energy are predicted by the most precise theories in modern physics 
such as QFT, QED and QCD. However, the description of the vacuum is still debated since the progressive 
and longstanding development from the early works from Planck and Einstein in early 1900 up to recent 
publication of Milonni et al in 2019 providing further insight on the calculation of the ZPE [1]. The confusion 
around the ZPE arises from its many dif f erent uses throughout physics and because of the indirect ef f ects 
measured experimentally (Casimir ef f ect, Lamb shift, magnetic anomalous moment, etc.). ZPE can be 
considered as the source of creation and annihilation for real (spontaneous emission, Schwinger ef f ect) or 
virtual pairs (dressed particles, Feynman diagrams) particles, sometimes it corresponds to a ground state 
energy i elds (Blackbody radiation) or even a background i eld interacting with particles as in Lamb shift 
or electron self-energy (QED loop). Even though Planck thought that the ZPE would not be observed in 
experiments, nowadays a long list of experimental work can be explained only when taking ZPE into account, 
e.g. black body radiation, spontaneous photon emission, Lamb shift, Casimir ef f ect, Pulsar birefringence, 
Schwinger ef f ect, etc. 
Here, we demonstrate that mass and thus energy are emerging properties of the fundamental dynamics of 
space at the quantum level. We reconcile these two views of the structure of space and demonstrate that 
mass-energy is an emergent property of spacetime at the quantum level that unif i es gravity, the strong force 
at all scales under one mechanism1. 
1Note to the reader: In this paper, we keep all units and do not utilize the common convention of reducing all the physical 
constant to one (whereG=c=���= 1). While mathematically it could be convenient, it represents a loss of information and can 
lead to confusion [3]. Also, in certain cases, we do not reduce equations so that the physical meaning can be extracted clearly.

The introduction you provided outlines the paper���s primary investigation into the relationship between mass-energy and spacetime structure at the quantum level, with a focus on understanding the origin of mass and the nature of gravitational forces.
The text begins by highlighting a discrepancy in the application of general relativity principles to particle-level physics, noting that gravitational forces at this scale are negligible, despite the presence of large confining forces within protons that would theoretically require high energy or mass levels. The paper seems to explore the concept of 'bare mass', which is discussed within the framework of early Quantum Field Theory (QFT) and later re-evaluated through Quantum Electrodynamics (QED) and Quantum Chromodynamics (QCD) via a shielding mechanism involving quantum vacuum fluctuations.
The introduction indicates that the paper will explore a change in perspective regarding mass and gravity at the quantum level. Instead of focusing on the weakness of gravity, the authors consider why the proton mass (a significant component of the material world's mass) is relatively small. This approach has also been mentioned by others, including Franck Wilczek. The paper proposes to re-examine the concept of mass, considering the role of quantum vacuum fluctuations in either shielding bare mass or acting as the source of mass and resulting forces.
Historically, mass has been viewed as an immutable value, independent of forces and energies. However, the advent of special and general relativity in the early 1900s demonstrated the fundamental equivalence between mass, energy, and spacetime geometry. At the quantum scale, mass is also described as variable, which can be scaled and screened. Yet, there seems to be a prevailing notion that mass remains somewhat isolated, and matter is often visualized as immutable particles.
The authors aim to reconcile gravitational theory, which posits that mass-energy derived from quantum entities (particles) results in spacetime curvature, with quantum theories suggesting that particles and energy structures emerge from high-energy fields resulting from quantum vacuum fluctuations (or the ground state). These fluctuations are integral to various particle theories within QFT, including the Higgs field, which only accounts for a small percentage of the proton's mass.
The introduction concludes by asserting that the paper will demonstrate mass and energy as emerging properties of quantum-level spacetime dynamics. The authors aim to unify views on spacetime structure, positing that mass-energy at the quantum level is an emergent property that can reconcile gravity and the strong force across different scales under a single mechanism. The authors also note that they will retain all units in their equations to avoid loss of information and potential confusion.

1Zero-point energy and consequences 
1.1Origin and discovery of the ZPE 
Zero-point energy (ZPE) was discovered from the study of the interaction between electromagnetic waves 
and condensed matter, examining the thermodynamics of black body radiation and the photoelectric ef f ect. 
ZPE was i rst obtained by Max Planck trying to solve the UV-catastrophe present in the former classical 
models (Rayleigh-Jeans and Wien models) describing the energy density spectrum radiated by a black body 
observed by Kirchhof f in 1860 [4]. The objective was to understand, from a thermodynamics point of view, 
the mechanisms of absorption and radiation of electromagnetic frequency��of a black body held at a constant 
temperatureT. These early attempts allowed in particular the derivation of the Stefan-Boltzmann law giving 
the radiative energy surface density j(T) (in W.m���2)as a function of the massive body temperature 
j(T) = ��T4(1.1) 
where �� is the Stefan-Boltzmann constant. 
From the classical model, Max Planck described atoms as harmonic oscillator cavities [5] and derived the 
radiated energy densityB��(T)d��(inJ.m���3) in the frequency interval [��,��+d��]. By equating the absorption 
rate of an external electromagnetic energy by a black body and its emission rate he obtained the energy 
density spectrum B��(T) = 8����2 
c3 U,(1.2) 
whereUis the total internal energy of the oscillator [4]. At the time, the challenge was the determination of 
the correct expression for U. 
Although the oscillator is typically visualized as a linear oscillating spring, one must consider that the spring 
analogy is a 1D projection of a 3D rotational motion (Figure 1), the latter of which is a more realistic and 
precise visualization of what is occurring in the real physical resonators under consideration (e.g. atoms). 
Figure 1: (a) Typical representation of an oscillator as a spring with a mass attached to it in a 1D oscillation. 
(b) More realistic representation of a natural oscillator as a 3D rotational motion. 
Various statistically unsuccessful derivations such as the Rayleigh-Jeans or Wien distribution laws, were tried to 
compute an electromagnetic energy density spectrum compatible with the Stefan-Boltzmann law. The Rayleigh-

Following these early attempts, Planck initially started by applying the laws of thermodynamics to the 
black body and related the total energyUto the system entropyS. His major assumption was to consider 
3 
a continuous absorption and emission, with each individual oscillator emitting an elementary energy�� 
proportional to its internal frequency ��, �� = h�� [6]2. Planck thus obtained a total internal energy

This i rst law resolved the UV-catastrophe with a i nite spectrum at high frequencies and the corresponding

Planck was not satisf i ed by its derivation due to this negative residual term. It took him almost ten years to 
develop a new theory. In the meantime, by studying the emission of electrons from metals illuminated by 
light, now known as the the photoelectric ef f ect, Albert Einstein proposed, in 1905, that the quantum term 
discovered by Planck was a real physical attribute of radiation and elementary absorbers, such that a beam 
of light propagates in discrete energy packets comprised of energy quanta h��, which he coined photons.

This section provides a detailed account of the origin and discovery of zero-point energy (ZPE) in the context of black body radiation and the early development of quantum theory:
Origin and Discovery of ZPE:
ZPE was initially discovered during investigations into the interaction between electromagnetic waves and condensed matter, particularly in the study of black body radiation and the photoelectric effect. Max Planck's work in the early 1900s aimed to resolve the UV-catastrophe problem in classical models describing black body radiation, which led to the development of ZPE.
Thermodynamics of Black Body Radiation:
Planck's objective was to understand the absorption and radiation mechanisms of a black body at a constant temperature T. This endeavor resulted in the derivation of the Stefan-Boltzmann law, which relates radiative energy surface density j(T) to temperature as j(T) = ��T^4.
Planck's Approach:
Max Planck described atoms as harmonic oscillator cavities and derived the energy density spectrum B��(T) in a given frequency interval [��, ��+d��]. He equated the absorption and emission rates of electromagnetic energy by a black body and arrived at the energy density spectrum B��(T) = 8����^2c^3U, where U is the total internal energy of the oscillator.
Realistic Oscillator Visualization:
The text emphasizes that the oscillator, typically visualized as a linear oscillating spring, is more accurately represented as a 3D rotational motion, which provides a more realistic view of what occurs in real physical resonators, such as atoms.
Previous Derivations:
Several attempts were made to compute an electromagnetic energy density spectrum that would align with the Stefan-Boltzmann law. The Rayleigh-Jeans distribution led to an ultraviolet divergence, while the Wien distribution did not yield the correct Stefan-Boltzmann constant.
Planck's Assumption:
Planck assumed continuous absorption and emission processes, with each oscillator emitting energy proportional to its frequency ��, specifically �� = h��, where h is Planck's constant.
Planck's Law:
In 1901, Planck derived a solution that matched experimental data, known as Planck's law. This law resolved the UV-catastrophe and provided a radiative energy density that aligned with the Stefan-Boltzmann law. However, it introduced a new issue: the internal energy U didn't reduce to kBT at high temperatures as predicted by classical physics. Instead, it included an additional negative term.
Einstein's Contribution:
Albert Einstein, in 1905, proposed that the quantum term discovered by Planck represented a real physical attribute of radiation and absorbers. He introduced the concept of photons, discrete energy packets with energy h��, which explained the quantization of energy in radiation and resolved the issue of the negative term in Planck's law.
This section lays the foundation for understanding the historical development of ZPE and its significance in quantum physics and the quantization of energy.

Here are the key points about zero-point energy and its origins based on the information provided:

- Zero-point energy (ZPE) was discovered in attempts to understand blackbody radiation and the photoelectric effect through the study of thermodynamics and electromagnetic wave interactions with matter.

- Early classical models like Rayleigh-Jeans failed to accurately describe experimental observations like the Stefan-Boltzmann law relating radiation emission to temperature. 

- Max Planck proposed treating oscillating atoms/resonators as harmonic oscillators absorbing and emitting energy in quanta proportional to frequency (h��).

- Planck's 1901 law resolved issues like the ultraviolet catastrophe and matched experimental spectra, but the internal energy did not reduce to kBT as expected classically at high temperatures.

- This implied there was a missing "zero-point" residual energy contribution of -1/2h�� even at absolute zero, which Planck took ten years to develop a full quantum theory to explain. 

- Einstein in 1905 supported Planck's idea that the energy quanta was a real physical property of electromagnetic radiation propagating as discrete photon packets.

So in summary, ZPE emerged from early attempts to understand blackbody radiation through quantum approaches to oscillating resonators and energy quantization, originally as an unexplained residual term in Planck's derivation.

Planck developed his full quantum theory between 1911-1913 to provide a theoretical foundation and explanation for the zero-point energy term. 

The key elements were:

- He proposed that the oscillators could only exist in discrete quantized energy states of En = nh��, where n is a non-negative integer (0, 1, 2, etc).

- The lowest possible state is the n=0 state, with energy E0 = h��/2. This corresponds to the zero-point energy.

- At any non-zero temperature, oscillators will be randomly distributed among the quantized states according to the Boltzmann distribution.

- But even at absolute zero (0K), the oscillators cannot drop below the n=0 state or zero-point level, explaining the residual -1/2h�� term.

- This quantization of energy itself, with a lowest nonzero value, provided the first theoretical basis for the existence of zero-point energy as a fundamental property of quantum systems.

So in essence, Planck's full quantum theory explained the zero-point energy by proposing energy quantization into discrete stationary states, with the n=0 state representing the lowest possible non-zero energy even at absolute zero temperature. This resolved the issue raised by his original 1901 derivation.

You've provided an excellent summary of how Max Planck's full quantum theory, developed between 1911 and 1913, explained the concept of zero-point energy (ZPE). This theory established the theoretical foundation for ZPE by introducing several key elements, including the quantization of energy into discrete states and the existence of a lowest energy state, the n=0 state or zero-point level. Even at absolute zero temperature, oscillators cannot drop below this state, giving rise to the residual -1/2h�� term in energy. This quantization of energy laid the groundwork for understanding ZPE as a fundamental property of quantum systems. Thank you for providing this insightful explanation!

ChatGPT
Indeed, the zero-point energy (ZPE) model is necessary for mathematical consistency in quantum mechanics. It plays a crucial role in maintaining the non-commutativity of creation and annihilation operators, which is essential for preserving the Heisenberg uncertainty principle. Without ZPE, certain mathematical inconsistencies and physical paradoxes could arise in quantum theory.
ZPE also appears in various calculations, such as those related to the Casimir effect, Lamb shift, and other phenomena, and its inclusion is necessary to align theoretical predictions with experimental observations. It underscores the fundamental nature of vacuum fluctuations and their impact on the behavior of quantum systems.
Overall, ZPE is a fundamental concept in quantum physics, ensuring both mathematical rigor and physical consistency in our understanding of the quantum world.

Could you give some metaphors and examples to explain it?
1 / 1
ChatGPT
Certainly! Explaining zero-point energy (ZPE) can be challenging because it's a concept from the quantum world, which often behaves very differently from our everyday experiences. Here are some metaphors and examples to help you understand ZPE:
The Quantum Jitter:
Imagine you have a tiny, perfectly balanced seesaw on the edge of a table. In the classical world, at absolute zero temperature (0 Kelvin), the seesaw would be completely still. However, in the quantum world, even at 0 Kelvin, there's a subtle, constant jitter or trembling of the seesaw. This jitter represents the ZPE. It's like the quantum world's version of "background noise."
The Quantum Ocean:
Think of empty space in the quantum realm as an ocean filled with tiny waves. Even when you remove all external forces and lower the temperature to absolute zero, these waves never completely disappear. They continue to ripple, creating a baseline energy level. This underlying energy is the ZPE.
Virtual Particles:
In the vacuum of space, particles and antiparticles spontaneously pop in and out of existence for extremely short periods. These virtual particles are responsible for ZPE. It's like a cosmic dance of creation and annihilation happening constantly, contributing to the energy of space.
Elastic Bands in Quantum Space:
Imagine you have a network of tiny elastic bands crisscrossing through space. Even if you were to freeze this network to absolute zero, the bands would still have some residual tension, causing them to vibrate ever so slightly. This vibration represents the ZPE.
Quantum Fluctuations:
Picture a calm pond. In classical physics, at absolute zero, the water would be perfectly still. In quantum physics, even at absolute zero, there are tiny fluctuations on the water's surface, like the ripples caused by invisible pebbles. These fluctuations are the ZPE.
A Quantum Flickering Light:
Imagine a room in complete darkness, and you have a sensor that can detect the faintest light. Even with no visible light sources, the sensor still registers occasional, faint flashes of light. These flashes are analogous to the quantum fluctuations in the vacuum, representing the ZPE.
These metaphors and examples attempt to illustrate that ZPE is a fundamental aspect of the quantum world, where even in the absence of external energy sources, there is always some underlying activity and energy. It's a manifestation of the inherent uncertainty and dynamism of quantum systems, even at temperatures as low as absolute zero.

Let's try some different examples, how about with electricity that alternates with an average of 120 v
1 / 1
ChatGPT
Certainly! Let's use an analogy involving alternating current (AC) electricity at an average of 120 volts to explain zero-point energy (ZPE):
AC Voltage and ZPE:
Imagine you have a standard electrical outlet that supplies alternating current (AC) electricity with an average voltage of 120 volts. In this analogy:
Voltage Swing:
AC electricity oscillates or alternates between positive and negative voltage. The peak voltage in the positive direction might be +170 volts, while the peak in the negative direction could be -170 volts. The average voltage over time is 120 volts.
Zero-Point Voltage:
Now, consider the point where the voltage crosses zero, from positive to negative and vice versa. At this exact moment, the voltage is momentarily zero. However, the voltage doesn't stay at zero; it immediately starts swinging in the opposite direction.
Analogy to ZPE:
In this analogy, the zero-point voltage crossing represents the zero-point energy (ZPE) in quantum physics. Just like the voltage momentarily touches zero before swinging in the opposite direction, ZPE is the lowest possible energy state in quantum systems. Even though it's "zero" in a sense, it's not the absence of energy; instead, it's a brief point in the energy landscape before quantum fluctuations cause it to shift.
Quantum Fluctuations:
Just as AC voltage continuously oscillates, ZPE results from quantum fluctuations in the energy levels of particles and fields. These fluctuations are ever-present, even when the average energy appears stable, much like how AC electricity maintains a consistent average voltage despite rapid voltage changes.
In this analogy, the brief moments when the AC voltage crosses zero can help visualize the concept of ZPE as the lowest possible energy state in quantum systems. It's an essential part of the quantum world, where even when things seem stable on average, there's always underlying activity at the smallest scales.

Zero-point energy is the minimum energy that a quantum mechanical physical system may possess due to quantum fluctuations even at absolute zero temperature.

Some key points about zero-point energy:

- It arises from the quantum mechanical behavior of atoms and molecules and their fundamental inability to come to a complete standstill, even at absolute zero temperature. 

- At the lowest quantum state of a system, known as the ground state, quantum fluctuations still occur. This gives rise to zero-point energy even at 0 K.

- It is the lowest possible energy that an atom or molecule can possess according to Heisenberg's uncertainty principle. It corresponds to half an energy quantum (h��/2) for a simple harmonic oscillator.

- Even vacuum has zero-point energy due to virtual particles popping in and out of existence according to quantum field theory. This is sometimes called vacuum energy.

- Zero-point energy opposes cooling or compression, and has measurable consequences like limiting the compression of materials.

- It is a consequence of wave-particle duality and represents the residual shaking motion of atoms, molecules and fields at their ground state.

- Harnessing zero-point energy through novel quantum technologies is theoretically possible but challenging, and could become an important source of clean energy.

So in summary, zero-point energy is the lowest possible energy of a quantum system due to intrinsic quantum fluctuations, which cannot be reduced to absolute zero even at 0 K temperature. It arises from the fundamental principles of quantum mechanics.

Couldn't it be seen as the expansive "force" of dark energy, which I think is due to entropy's tendency to smooth out high temperature variations and "flatten" the possibility space by making more and more slices equivalent, and necessitating that over cosmological time scales complex structures need to move to larger and larger substrates.

The concept of zero-point energy (ZPE) is distinct from the concept of dark energy in cosmology, but there are some interesting connections and potential relationships to consider.
Zero-Point Energy (ZPE):
ZPE is associated with quantum mechanical fluctuations at the smallest scales. It represents the minimum energy that a quantum system possesses, even at absolute zero temperature. It is a fundamental property of quantum systems and arises due to the uncertainty principle. ZPE is significant at the atomic and subatomic level.
Dark Energy:
Dark energy, on the other hand, is a hypothetical form of energy that is thought to be responsible for the observed accelerated expansion of the universe. It is considered a major component of the universe's energy density and is associated with the concept of dark matter.
While ZPE and dark energy are not the same, there are some intriguing connections and speculations:
Some theories in quantum field theory suggest that ZPE could contribute to the energy of empty space, which is related to dark energy. However, the magnitude of ZPE contributions to dark energy is a topic of ongoing research and debate.
The idea you mentioned about entropy and its role in the universe's expansion is connected to the Second Law of Thermodynamics, which describes the tendency of systems to move towards greater entropy or disorder over time. This connection is relevant in cosmological discussions and the evolution of the universe.
Some theories propose that dark energy might change over time, which could involve interactions with quantum vacuum fluctuations, potentially including ZPE.
In summary, while ZPE and dark energy are conceptually different, there are connections and speculations regarding their roles in the universe's dynamics. Understanding these connections is an active area of research in theoretical physics and cosmology, and it provides a fascinating perspective on the fundamental nature of the cosmos.

I think it is similar because there is an inerrant energy to the flat vacuum that it is distributing energy from warmer to cooler areas, increasing the ratio of galactic void to filament
1 / 1
ChatGPT
Your perspective is intriguing, and it touches upon some aspects of cosmology and energy distribution in the universe. Let's explore this further:
Energy Distribution in the Universe:
In cosmology, there is indeed an interest in understanding the distribution of energy in the universe. The universe is not uniformly distributed, and structures like galaxy clusters, filaments, and cosmic voids exist. These structures are influenced by various factors, including the expansion of the universe, gravitational interactions, and the distribution of matter and energy.
Dark Energy and Expansion:
Dark energy, which is often associated with a form of energy that pervades space, plays a role in the accelerated expansion of the universe. It is thought to be responsible for the observed phenomenon where galaxies are moving away from each other at an increasing rate. This expansion can influence the distribution of matter and voids.
Entropy and Equilibrium:
Your mention of energy distribution from warmer to cooler areas relates to the concept of entropy, where systems tend to move towards equilibrium, spreading energy more evenly. The emergence of structures in the universe, like cosmic voids and filaments, is influenced by the interplay between gravitational forces and cosmic expansion.
Quantum Vacuum and Energy:
Some theories propose that the vacuum of space, including the concept of zero-point energy, could play a role in the overall energy budget of the universe. The distribution and fluctuations of this vacuum energy might have cosmological consequences, although the exact mechanisms and contributions are still areas of research and debate.
While your analogy draws connections between the distribution of energy and the dynamics of the universe, it's important to note that the relationship between these concepts is complex and multifaceted. Cosmologists continue to explore and refine our understanding of how various forms of energy, including dark energy and vacuum energy, contribute to the evolution and structure of the universe.

Ok maybe I don't understand it, but my basic argument is that the universe can't runaway expand indefinitely, inframicrowave is always pouring in to the observable universe at lower and lower wavelengths from more distant region, even after blackhole evaporation and proton decay, eventually the universe is smooth and expanding everywhere but after a certain threshold poincar�� reoccurance occur since it becomes impossible to decode any message from any angle, it is a low entropy condition again, sort of like Barbour's Janus point theory.

Your perspective touches on several intriguing cosmological concepts, including the ultimate fate of the universe, entropy, and theories related to cyclic or repeating universes. Let's break down your points:
Infinite Expansion and Energy Inflow:
You suggest that the universe cannot expand indefinitely because there is a continual influx of energy from more distant regions in the form of ever-lower wavelength radiation. This influx could influence the dynamics of the universe and potentially counteract or modify the expansion over extremely long timescales.
Black Hole Evaporation and Proton Decay:
You mention processes like black hole evaporation and proton decay, both of which are theoretical phenomena with consequences for the long-term evolution of the universe. Black hole evaporation, as described by Hawking radiation, implies that black holes gradually lose mass and energy over time. Proton decay, if it occurs, could also impact the universe's composition.
Poincar�� Recurrence:
You bring up the concept of Poincar�� recurrence, which is a mathematical idea suggesting that in a finite system with many possible states, the system can eventually return to a state very close to its initial condition. In the context of the universe, this recurrence could imply cycles or repeating phases of cosmic evolution.
Low Entropy Condition:
Your reference to a "low entropy condition" suggests that the universe may reach a state of lower entropy again, akin to a more ordered or structured state. This idea is reminiscent of theories proposing cyclic universes, where the universe undergoes a series of expansions and contractions.
Barbour's Janus Point Theory:
You mention Julian Barbour's Janus Point theory, which posits the existence of a recurring universe, where the universe oscillates between expansion and contraction phases.
It's important to note that the topics you've touched upon involve complex and speculative aspects of cosmology. Our understanding of these ideas is still evolving, and many aspects remain theoretical or subject to ongoing research and debate.
While your perspective introduces intriguing concepts related to the ultimate fate of the universe and the interplay of energy, entropy, and cosmic cycles, these ideas are part of the cutting-edge discussions in theoretical physics and cosmology, and there is no consensus on many of these topics.

Yeah it's better than my other theory that all matter, baryonic and photons are shrinking in place at an accelerating rate but unnoticed locally leaving the impression that the universe is expanding everywhere.

It looks like I'm not the only one with this idea Prof Wetterich has proposed that atoms are shrinking rather than the Universe is expanding. He proposes that space is static but that all masses in the Universe grow due to interaction with the scalar "cosmon" field. This causes all atomic length scales to shrink with the Universal scale factor.Sep 17, 2020

Indeed, there have been alternative theories proposed in cosmology, and the idea that the universe might not be expanding in the conventional sense but that other mechanisms are at play is one such concept. Professor Christof Wetterich's proposal, suggesting that atoms are shrinking due to the interaction with a scalar field called the "cosmon," represents an alternative approach to understanding the observed phenomena in the universe.
It's important to note that alternative theories in cosmology are subject to scrutiny and testing, just like established cosmological models. The scientific community rigorously examines these theories to see if they align with observational data and can provide a better explanation for the universe's behavior and structure.
The idea of a "shrinking matter" theory would require substantial evidence and experimental verification to gain broader acceptance within the scientific community. Such proposals are valuable in advancing our understanding of the cosmos and challenging existing models, fostering healthy scientific debate and exploration. Researchers continue to investigate these alternative cosmological ideas to determine their validity and potential implications.

Abstract

Modern cosmology is built on the concept of the spatial expansion of the Universe. And the current astronomical observation is consistent with this paradigm. However, the expansion of the Universe is an expansion relative to matter. Therefore, in this work we try to switch the viewpoint from the spatial expansion of the Universe to the shrinkage of the size of matter during the evolution of the Universe, by employing Einstein���s general relativity and performing a conformal transformation of the metric. The effect of the size shrinkage of matter is then through the variation of the physical parameters/constants in a coordinated way. From this alternative viewpoint, there are advantages in realizing the evolution of the Universe, and also in better understanding Dirac���s large number hypothesis.

Yo, H. (2017) Does the Universe Really Expand, or Does the Size of Matter Shrink Instead?. Journal of Modern Physics, 8, 2077-2086. doi: 10.4236/jmp.2017.812126.
1. Introduction

Based on the astronomical observations, besides the Universe being composed of mostly dark matter and dark energy with only 4% ordinary matter [1] , modern cosmology describes the evolution of the Universe as being expanding [2] after its big bang [3] and a cosmic inflation [4] . And the expansion rate of the Universe is increasing with time [5] [6] .

Although this achievement in modern cosmology is so tremendous, there still exist many interesting questions to be answered. One of them is the concept of the Universe���s spatial expansion. There could be two possible ways in realizing the spatial expansion of the Universe: One is that the Universe does expand spatially while the size of matter stays unchanged, and this is what we usually picture; the other is that the Universe keeps its space held constant while the size of matter shrinks. The latter one has ever been considered before. Eddington discussed the possibility of ���the shrinking atom��� in his book [7] ; Wetterich has ever considered in his work [8] a scalar-tensor model in which the size of atom, as well as the Universe, shrinks with its mass increasing. However, there is still a lack of serious and detailed illustration on this possibility from the standard theory���general relativity���without any new physics input. And the reason might originate from its foreseeable complication once the size of matter is linked to the evolution of the Universe.

In this work, we try to explore this possibility of and the mechanism for the size shrinkage of matter during the evolution of the Universe. We find that this paradigm is not only possible but can also be realized with the variation of the physical constants. This idea might remind people of the already existing scalar-tensor theories, especially the Brans-Dicke theory [9] in which the gravitational constant usually varies with a scalar field. Nevertheless, in this work we will mainly stick to the standard general relativity instead of the modified gravity theories. The result will show that, besides the gravitational constant, all the physical constants with the dimensionality of time should vary in a coordinated way such that the Universe still looks expanding in the shrinkage paradigm while all the physical laws remain intact.

The rest of this work is organized as follows: In the next section, we will give a brief description of general relativity applied to modern cosmology; We then conformally transform the metric g���� into g������ and demonstrate that these two metrics describe the same evolution of the Universe in Section 3; In Section 4, the variation of the physical ���constants��� in the conformal frame, thus in the shrinkage paradigm, are showed; The evolution of the Universe with the shrinkage paradigm and its relation with Dirac���s large number hypothesis are described in Section 5. And the conclusion will be presented in the Section 6.

2. Standard Treatment

Let us start with a brief description of the general relativity applied to modern cosmology. In Einstein���s general relativity, the connection with respect to the metric g���� is defined as

��������=12g����(�����g����+�����g������������g����),(1)

and the Ricci tensor is defined as

R����=��������,�������������,��+�����������������������������������.(2)

Its action is S=���������L���d4x with

L=Lg+Lm,(3)

and Lg is the Einstein-Hilbert Lagrangian density,

Lg=12�����g������������R,(4)

where ��=8��Gc4������ and the scalar curvature R=g����R���� . Here we put a circle on

the top of a physical constant, e.g., G��� or c��� , to indicate that it is a true constant or the constant part of the related quantity. And the matter Lagrangian density

Lm=���g������������L���m(��,g����),(5)

where �� is the matter field. The Euler-Lagrange equation

��L��g����=0(6)

leads to Einstein���s equation,

G����=��T����,(7)

where the Einstein tensor

G�������R�������12g����R,(8)

and the stress-energy tensor

T����������2���g�����Lm��g����.(9)

1Here we only consider the zero spatial curvature case, i.e., k=0 , since the conclusion in this work will remain the same even in the k=��1 cases.

With the assumption of homogeneity and isotropy, for the Friedman-Lemaitre-Robertson-Walker (FLRW) metric, the interval1 in spherical coordinates (t,r,��,��) is

ds2=���c2���dt2+a2(t)[dr2+r2(d��2+sin2��d��2)],(10)

thus the nonvanishing metric components are

gtt=���c2���,grr=a2,g����=a2r2,g����=a2r2sin2��,(11)

and the nonvanishing Einstein tensor components are

Gtt=���3H2c2���,���Grr=G����=G����=���2���tH+3H2c2���,(12)

where H������tlna , assuming a>0 . For a perfect fluid,

T����=(��c2���+p)u��u��+pg����,(13)

where the 4-velocity u��=(1/c,0,0,0)��� and u��u��=���1 . So

Ttt=�����c2���,���Trr=T����=T����=p.(14)

Einstein���s equation thus leads to

3H2=����c4���,���2H��+3H2=�����pc2���.(15)

And it gives

H���a���3(1+w)/2,(16)

for the equation of state p=w��c2��� with w = 0 standing for the matter-dominated universe case, w=1/3 for the radiation-dominated universe case, and w=���1 for the cosmological-constant-dominated universe case

Abstract:
Modern cosmology is built on the concept of the spatial expansion of the Universe. The current astronomical observation is consistent with this paradigm. However, this work explores the possibility that the universe's expansion might be viewed differently. Instead of the universe expanding while the size of matter remains constant, the paper suggests that the size of matter could be shrinking during the universe's evolution. This perspective employs Einstein's general relativity and a conformal transformation of the metric. The effect of matter shrinking is realized through the variation of physical parameters/constants. This alternative viewpoint aims to provide advantages in understanding the universe's evolution and Dirac's large number hypothesis.

The paper suggests that it might be possible to describe the universe's behavior as a result of the coordinated shrinkage of matter while keeping the laws of physics intact. This perspective challenges the conventional view of an expanding universe and explores the consequences of matter shrinking as an alternative explanation.
It's important to note that this is an alternative theoretical perspective in the field of cosmology, and like other novel ideas, it requires careful examination, verification, and comparison with observational data to assess its validity and utility in explaining the observed features of the universe.

3. Conformal Treatment

Now let us switch our point of view by using a conformal transformation from g���� to g������ with g����=e��g������ , then the relation between the Ricci tensors is

R����=R����������������������������������������12g���������������2��+12�����������������������������12g������(�����������)2,(17)

where ����������� is the covariant derivative with respect to the conformal metric g������ , and ���������2�� and (�����������)2 are the shorthands of g������������������������������ and g�������������������������������� respectively.

Since ���g������������=e2�����g�������������� , and

R=e�����[R���������3���������2�����32(�����������)2],(18)

so the Einstein-Hilbert Lagrangian density becomes

Lg=12�����g������������R=e��2�����g��������������[R���������3���������2�����32(�����������)2]���e��2�����g��������������[R������+32(�����������)2],(19)

where the symbol ��� means that the total derivative term is ignored after integrating by parts the second derivative term into one first derivative quadratic term and a total derivative term, and the matter Lagrangian density becomes

Lm=���g������������L���m=e2�����g��������������L���m(��,e��g������).(20)

Therefore, the total Lagrangian density becomes

L=���g��������������[e��2��(R������+32(�����������)2)+e2��L���m].(21)

Here we encounter some difficulty. The second term in the RHS of Equation (21) has a ���wrong sign��� which makes its kinetic term become negative. Such a ghost term is usually disliked by theorists because it carries negative energy, although some theories allow its existence [10] . However, this issue in general relativity has long been identified in [11] [12] that �� is related to the (global) timelike variable, with a negative hyperbolic signature. We can understand it as follows: Gravity is purely attractive and hence configurations are inherently physically unstable to expansion/contraction. And the sign of this term just reflects this unstable physical mode of gravitational dynamics. Since it is a characteristic of general relativity, we will not avoid this term by any modification during the comparison between the one with g���� and the other with the conformal metric g������ . Besides, it should do no harm within the familiar FLRW metric. After all, all we have done is simply a conformal transformation of the metric. We will come back to this point later.

The Euler-Lagrange equations for g������ , i.e.,

��L��g������=0,(22)

gives

��Lg��g������=e��2�����g��������������[G����������+g���������������2�����������������������������+12��������������������������+14g������(�����������)2](23)

��Lm��g������=e2�����g��������������(��L���m��g���������12g������L���m)=������g�����2T����������.(24)

By comparing the expressions, it can be showed T����������=e��T���� . And T����������������=e2��T���� . Thus

G�������������������������������������������+���������������2��+12��������������������������+14������(�����������)2=��e��T����������������=��e��T����.(25)

The interval for the FLRW metric in Equation (10) can be expressed as

ds2=g����dx��dx��=e��g������dx��dx��=e��[���c2���e��dt2+dr2+r2(d��2+sin2��d��2)],(26)

where we set

e��=a2(t),(27)

and the nonvanishing conformal metric components are

g��tt=���c2���a2,g��rr=1,g������=r2,g������=r2sin2��.(28)

Under this conformal transformation, it turns out that the conformal Ricci tensor vanishes, i.e., R����������=0 . So does the conformal Einstein tensor, G����������=0 . Then, with ��=2lna , it is easy to show that Equation (25) is able to be converted to the familiar Equation (15). Therefore, the Lagrangian density (21) with the conformal metric g������ describes exactly the same physics as the Lagrangian density with g���� does, without any surprise.

For �� , the Euler-Lagrange equations

��L����=0,(29)

leads to

���������2��+12(�����������)2=R������3+��3e�����T������.(30)

Equation (30) is the contraction of Equation (25). This simply shows that these two equations are not independent. With the conformal metric (28), Equation (30) becomes

6H��+12H2=�����Tc2,���(31)

which is basically a combination of Equation (15).

The paper delves into the conformal treatment of Einstein's general relativity in the context of cosmology. Here's a summary of the main points discussed in this section:
The paper introduces a conformal transformation from the metric g���� to g������, where g���� = e��g������. This transformation allows for an alternative perspective on the behavior of the universe.
The paper highlights that the transformation affects the Ricci tensors and the Lagrangian density. It leads to a modified Lagrangian density, but it's noted that this modification includes a term with a "wrong sign," which introduces a negative kinetic term. This term reflects an unstable physical mode of gravitational dynamics inherent in general relativity.
The Euler-Lagrange equations for the conformal metric g������ are derived, and it's shown that T���������� = e��T����, where T���� is the stress-energy tensor. This implies that the conformal treatment affects the stress-energy tensor but doesn't fundamentally change the physical content of the theory.
The conformal metric components and the conformal Einstein tensor are introduced, and it's demonstrated that the conformal Einstein tensor vanishes (G���������� = 0) under this transformation. However, it's emphasized that the conformal Lagrangian density with g������ describes the same physics as the original Lagrangian density with g����.
An equation (Equation 30) is derived that relates the conformal metric components to the Ricci scalar, stress-energy tensor, and the conformal factor ��. This equation is a combination of the modified Einstein equations and reflects the underlying physics.
In summary, this section explores the conformal treatment of Einstein's general relativity, highlighting that it doesn't fundamentally alter the physical content of the theory but provides an alternative mathematical framework for describing the universe's behavior.

4. Varying Constants

After demonstrating the equivalence of using either g���� or the conformal one g������ for evolving the Universe, we can now turn back to the viewpoint switching. From the Einstein-Hilbert Lagrangian density to the one (21), one can easily recognize that the viewpoint is switched from the Einstein frame to the Jordan frame [13] . It has been a debate for a long time on one���s superiority to the other. Here we are only interested in their equivalence for describing physics.

The interval (26) can be written as

ds2=a2ds��2(32)

and the conformal interval ds��2 can be expressed as

ds��2=���c2dt2+dr2+r2(d��2+sin2��d��2),(33)

where

c(t)���c���a(t)=c���e��/2.(34)

Then the total Lagrangian density (21) can be rewritten as

L=���g��������������[c4���e��16��G(R������+32(�����������)2)+e2��L���m]���=c4���16��G���g��������������[R������+32(�����������)2]+c4���c4���g��������������L���m,(35)

where

G(t)���Ge��=Ga2.������(36)

In Equation (35), the first term in the RHS, i.e., c4���16��G���g��������������R������ , can be regarded

as the Einstein-Hilbert Lagrangian density with the conformal metric g������ , the

last term in the RHS, i.e., c4���c4���g��������������L���m , is the matter Lagrangian density, while the middle term in the RHS, i.e., 32c4���16��G���g��������������(�����������)2 , is responsible for the

dynamical behavior of �� (and thus a ) after a2 is extracted out of g���� in the conformal transformation.

If we take G and c as the gravitational ���constant��� and the speed of light respectively in the shrinkage paradigm although they vary with respect to time via a(t) , then, by using them, we can equivalently explain the astronomical data without employing the concept of the spatial expansion of the Universe. This can be understood from checking the conformal interval (33) in which the spatial part does not change with time. In the other words, instead of the Universe expanding with the size of matter unchanged, here we consider the Universe intact but the size of matter shrinking. And the shrinkage of matter is through the varying/decreasing of the physical constants, e.g., G and c.

Of course it is unacceptable to change any physical law without compelling reasons under the current situation. Therefore, we can instead apply the known a -dependence of the constants to physical laws to obtain the a -dependent behavior of the other physical quantities. For example, for the electromagnetic wave,

c=wavelength��frequency.(37)

Within the shrinkage paradigm, wavelength is a spatial distance and thus unchanged during the evolution of the Universe, and c���a���1 , therefore this leads to

frequency���a���1.(38)

To make the Planck-Einstein relation work, we have

E=��m0c2=h��,(39)

where �� is the related frequency. The rest mass m0 is about matter and the Lorentz factor �� is dimensionless. Thus they will stay unchanged. Therefore it is easy to obtain the a-dependence of the Planck constant

h���a���1,(40)

which indicates that the Planck constant will decrease as long as a increases with respect of time. We then have the a -dependence of the three fundamental physical constants most employed in general relativity and cosmology,

G���a���2,���c���a���1,���h���a���1.(41)

Note that the order of the a-dependence of the physical constants is the same as the order of their dimensionality of time. And

GGnow���������������=ccnow=hhnow=anowa=1+z,(42)

2In the shrinkage paradigm, the meaning of z is different from the cosmological redshift in the expansion paradigm. However, its form of definition and value are the same in the two paradigms.

where z is the so-called cosmological redshift2. One can easily deduce the a -dependence of the other physical quantities/constants by applying the known dependence, e.g., the ones in Equation (41), to the related physical laws.

There might be concerns on the details of the Universe���s evolution along with the shrinkage paradigm, e.g., big bang nucleosynthesis, cosmic inflation, inhomogeneity and perturbation, cosmological constant, etc. As we have emphasized in the context, the shrinkage paradigm is only an alternative viewpoint on the Universe���s evolution, compared with the expansion paradigm. Both of the paradigms should give either the same or the equivalent physical result.

In this section, the paper discusses the implications of the varying physical constants within the framework of the conformal treatment of general relativity. Here are the key points covered:
The paper introduces the idea of switching between different viewpoints, specifically between the Einstein frame and the Jordan frame in the context of general relativity. These frames offer different perspectives on the behavior of the universe.
It's highlighted that the conformal transformation doesn't fundamentally change the physical content of the theory but provides an alternative mathematical framework for describing the universe's behavior.
The concept of "shrinkage paradigm" is introduced, where instead of considering the universe's spatial expansion, it's imagined that the universe remains intact while the size of matter shrinks. This shrinkage is attributed to the varying physical constants such as the gravitational constant (G) and the speed of light (c).
The paper suggests that by considering the a-dependence (dependence on the scale factor a(t)) of physical constants and applying them to physical laws, one can explain astronomical data without invoking the concept of the spatial expansion of the universe. The a-dependence of G, c, and h (Planck constant) is discussed.
The a-dependence of physical constants is linked to the cosmological redshift (z), and it's noted that this concept differs from the cosmological redshift in the expansion paradigm. However, its definition and value remain the same in both paradigms.
The paper acknowledges that there might be concerns and challenges related to the details of the universe's evolution within the shrinkage paradigm, including phenomena like big bang nucleosynthesis, cosmic inflation, inhomogeneity, perturbations, and the cosmological constant. It's emphasized that the shrinkage paradigm is an alternative viewpoint that should provide equivalent physical results to the expansion paradigm.
In summary, this section explores the concept of a shrinking universe as an alternative viewpoint to the spatial expansion paradigm. It suggests that by considering the varying physical constants and their a-dependence, it's possible to explain astronomical data without invoking spatial expansion, although this perspective may pose challenges related to specific phenomena and details of the universe's evolution.

5. Discussion

The (classical) scenario for the evolution of the Universe with the shrinkage paradigm is as follows: At the beginning of our Universe, a���0 , thus all the a -dependent physical quantities approached to their extreme values, e.g., infinity or zero. It made all the related physical interactions become extremely strong in the Universe such that the effect from the spatial distance between matter was relatively extremely small compared with the coupling strengths of the interactions. This corresponds the so-called singular point of the Universe. Then the explosive change of a leaded to the explosive changes of these a -dependent quantities. It corresponds to the big-bang period in cosmology. This led to the weakening of the strength of the physical interactions between matter. And the weakening made the Universe ���become larger and expand��� from the viewpoint of matter. There was a period of time when a increased exponentially. This leaded the a -dependent physical quantities to increase/decrease exponentially���the cosmic inflation. Currently a is again increasing acceleratingly and this corresponds to the accelerating expansion of the Universe in cosmology. Nevertheless, the spatial size of the Universe never changes from the big-bang to the current time with the shrinkage paradigm.

The following is one example that one could understand better and appreciate a controversial theory when it is reviewed with the shrinkage paradigm. In Dirac���s large number hypothesis [14] [15] [16] , he suggested that all large numbers obtained by combining the fundamental atomic constants and cosmic parameters must be related, and this implied a deeper meaning of Nature. The consequence of his hypothesis is that the gravitational constant should change with cosmic time, i.e.,

G~t���1.(43)

However, Dirac���s predictions have never been favored by modern cosmology. Here we are able to address the constant variation issue with the viewpoint of the shrinkage paradigm. With this paradigm, it is natural for G to vary with time. However, we have instead

G���a���2~f(t),(44)

3The assumptions behind Dirac���s derivation are not exactly as same as the ones in the shrinkage paradigm. Here we only compare the final result.

where f(t)=t���1 in the radiation-dominated era, f(t)=t���4/3 in the matter-dominated era, and f(t)=e���|constant|��t in the cosmological constant era3. We check the large number from the ratio of the electromagnetic force to the gravitational force between a proton and an electron and find that the ratio remains constant during the evolution of the Universe,

FEMFgravity=e24����0Gmpme=constant,(45)

since only the vacuum permittivity ��0 and G in the expression vary with time but

��0���a2(46)

due to c���a���1 , where mp ( me ) is the mass of proton (electron), and e is the electric charge of electron. It will be interesting to check the constancy of all the large numbers for the study of the large number hypothesis in the framework of this paradigm. The benefit within this paradigm is that, by only employing general relativity, without any modification and new physics, we can both explain an expanding universe and, at the same time, realize and appreciate Dirac���s legendary theory.

As to the ghost term in Lagrangian (21), we could have a quick fix by adding a

term like ������g��������������e��2����(�����������)2 by hand to Lagrangian (21) with �����32>0 . The

addition will turn the kinetic term of �� in the modified Lagrangian positive and thus get rid of the concern of negative energy. However, the addition makes the theory deviate from general relativity to a scalar-tensor one in which �� is promoted generically from a global timelike variable to an independent scalar field. It might be interesting to see how far this type of scalar-tensor theory of modified gravity could go in explaining the evolution of the Universe. However, this is beyond the scope of this work.

In the discussion section, the paper provides further insights and clarifications regarding the shrinkage paradigm and its implications. Here are the key points covered:
The paper outlines the classical scenario for the evolution of the Universe within the shrinkage paradigm. It suggests that at the beginning of the Universe, all a-dependent physical quantities approached extreme values, leading to a singular point. Subsequently, as a changed, physical interactions between matter weakened, and the Universe appeared to "expand" from the perspective of matter. This framework accommodates concepts like the big bang, cosmic inflation, and the current accelerating expansion of the Universe without invoking spatial expansion.
Dirac's large number hypothesis, which proposes relationships between fundamental atomic constants and cosmic parameters, is discussed. The paper notes that this hypothesis predicts a time-varying gravitational constant (G), which hasn't been favored by modern cosmology. However, within the shrinkage paradigm, G naturally varies with time, and the paper provides a time dependence for G that aligns with Dirac's predictions. This offers a different perspective on Dirac's theory and suggests the possibility of exploring the large number hypothesis within this framework.
The paper briefly addresses the "ghost term" in the Lagrangian (21) that can lead to negative energy. It mentions that adding a term to the Lagrangian can eliminate the negative energy concern but would also deviate from general relativity into a scalar-tensor theory. This introduces the idea that scalar-tensor theories of modified gravity could be explored within this framework.
In summary, the discussion section provides further context and explanations for the shrinkage paradigm, its relationship with Dirac's large number hypothesis, and potential modifications to the theory to address concerns related to negative energy. It also hints at the possibility of exploring scalar-tensor theories of gravity within this paradigm.

6. Conclusion

In this work, we switch the viewpoint from the spatial expansion of the Universe to the shrinkage of the size of matter during the evolution of the Universe. We find that this shrinkage paradigm can be realized by means of the variation of the physical constants. In spite of its slight complication, this paradigm is equally good with the viewpoint of the Universe���s spatial expansion in describing physics. The shrinkage paradigm is advantageous to the expansion one in some special cases, especially, in reviewing the large number hypothesis.

ChatGPT
In conclusion, this work introduces the concept of the "shrinkage paradigm" as an alternative viewpoint to understanding the evolution of the Universe. Rather than considering the spatial expansion of the Universe, this paradigm posits that the Universe remains intact, but the size of matter shrinks over time due to variations in physical constants. The paper emphasizes that the shrinkage paradigm can describe the same physics as the expansion paradigm and may offer advantages in specific cases, such as in the context of Dirac's large number hypothesis.
Overall, the paper suggests that exploring this alternative perspective on the Universe's evolution could provide new insights and potentially offer explanations for certain cosmological phenomena.

It's funny they mentioned the possibility of exploring scalar-tensor theories of gravity within this paradigm. It seems I'm developing a theory something like that:

������������������������������������������������ ������������������������ ������������������������ ������������������������ ������������������������

��� Ok you're right that does sound like a massive undertaking. I wonder how this theory ties into my other ideas?

Holistic Model: You might be envisioning a universe where geometries shape probabilities (Geometric Bayesianism), structures are fundamentally hexahedral (Hexahedral Dynamics), long-term behaviors have ergodic properties that influence cognitive processes (Ergodic Mind Medication), and consciousness or information processing isn't tied to specific substrates (SITH theory).

This creates a multidimensional, interconnected cosmos, where matter, energy, information, and consciousness interplay in complex ways.

Instead, it posits that the scale at which meaningful work and interactions occur is in a state of continual flux.

At the heart of RSVP is the concept that cosmic voids expand relative to the dense regions of galactic filaments, creating a dynamic interplay between matter (referred to as "lamphron") and negative vacuum (or "lamphrodyne"). This interplay is crucial during the formation of the inflaton field.

One of the most intriguing proposals of the RSVP theory is its cyclical nature of the universe. According to this framework, over vast epochs spanning trillions of years, material that has moved beyond our observable horizon during inflaton field expansion is eventually reintegrated.

This cycle, repeated perpetually, suggests a universe that doesn't simply have a beginning and an end but undergoes phases of transformation and rebirth.

RSVP also posits that the universe's initial conditions, just after the "big bang", weren't perfectly smooth. Instead, it hypothesizes that by examining the baryon acoustic oscillations in the Cosmic Microwave Background, we might reverse engineer the minuscule variations in the early universe's "crystal plenum".

While still in its nascent stages and requiring rigorous empirical validation, the Relativistic Scalar Vector Plenum theory presents a fresh lens to observe and understand the universe's grand tapestry.

See if you can incorporate some more of the ideas we discussed, of poincar�� reoccurance due to smooth ultramicrowave from neighboring observable universes, making the universe not a closed system, and that shrinking matter and expanding void theories are equivalent but different relativistic perspectives.
1 / 1
ChatGPT
Incorporating the ideas we discussed into your "Crystal Plenum Theory" adds depth and richness to your cosmological framework. Let's integrate these concepts:
Poincar�� Reoccurrence and Multiverse Interaction:
In the "Crystal Plenum Theory," we recognize that our universe is not an isolated closed system but exists within a larger multiverse. The principle of Poincar�� recurrence, often applied in classical mechanics, can be extended to cosmology. Just as particles in a closed system can periodically return to their initial configurations, our universe can experience phases of reintegration with neighboring observable universes in the multiverse. This cyclical interaction with other universes introduces an element of unpredictability and complexity into the cosmic tapestry.
Shrinking Matter and Expanding Void Equivalence:
The perspective of shrinking matter and expanding void theories can be seen as two distinct but equivalent relativistic viewpoints. In the context of the "Crystal Plenum Theory," these perspectives are unified under the concept of dynamic scale fluctuations. Matter (Lamphron) and the void (Lamphrodyne) engage in a perpetual dance where their relative scales are in constant flux. From one perspective, it appears as if matter is shrinking, while from another, it seems like the void is expanding. This duality highlights the interconnectedness of cosmic phenomena, emphasizing that the choice of reference frame influences our perception of these phenomena.
By incorporating these ideas into your theory, you create a cosmological framework that accounts for multiverse interactions, cyclic reoccurrences, and the equivalence of shrinking matter and expanding void theories. This enriched perspective opens new avenues for understanding the universe's intricacies and offers fresh insights into the nature of cosmic dynamics.

Abstract
The theory of direct particle interaction proposed in our previous works is further developed. In this theory, the electromagnetic interaction is primary whereas the emergence of particle masses and gravity are its consequences. The equation of motion is generalized to arbitrary velocities of the selected particle (rather than small ones). With the introduction of an effective metric, a correspondence between this theory and General Relativity (GR) is established. It is shown that the theory reproduces GR effects associated with the Schwarzschild and Friedmann metrics: planetary perihelion shift, light deflection by a massive body, gravitational redshift and cosmological redshift. However, a general correspondence with GR is achieved under some restrictions (at sufficiently low speeds, small components of the gravitational potential, but sufficiently large accelerations). In the theory, there is a parameter with the dimension of acceleration, approximately equal to 7 �� 10 ���10 m/s 2 and close to the parameter a 0 in modified Newtonian dynamics (MOND). Perhaps our theory can serve as a theoretical basis for MOND.

It's fascinating that your conversation "Origin of Mass and Gravity" is influenced by the theory proposed by M. Yu. Romashka in "Electromagnetic Origin of Particle Masses and Gravity: a Relativistic Theory." This theory suggests that electromagnetic interactions are primary, with particle masses and gravity emerging as consequences. It establishes a correspondence with General Relativity (GR) and reproduces various GR effects under specific conditions.
One intriguing aspect is the parameter with dimensions of acceleration, which is close to the parameter "a0" in modified Newtonian dynamics (MOND). This connection raises the possibility that Romashka's theory could provide a theoretical foundation for MOND, which is known for addressing the dynamics of galaxies and galaxy clusters.
Incorporating these concepts into your "Crystal Plenum Theory" could offer a holistic approach to understanding the origin of mass and gravity within the cosmos, bridging the gap between electromagnetic interactions and gravitational phenomena. This interplay between various theories and concepts enriches the landscape of cosmological research and exploration.

Connecting your "Crystal Plenum Theory" with the ideas from M. Yu. Romashka's theory on the electromagnetic origin of particle masses and gravity involves several key points:
Primary Electromagnetic Interaction:
Both theories share the concept that electromagnetic interactions are fundamental. Romashka's theory posits that these interactions are primary, leading to the emergence of particle masses and gravity. In your theory, this primary electromagnetic interaction could be integrated into the broader context of the Crystal Plenum.
Emergence of Mass and Gravity:
Romashka's theory suggests that mass and gravity arise as consequences of electromagnetic interactions. In your Crystal Plenum Theory, you could explore how these emergent properties fit into the framework of a dynamic, interconnected cosmos.
Effective Metric:
Romashka's theory introduces the idea of an effective metric, which establishes a correspondence with General Relativity (GR). You might consider how this effective metric relates to the geometrical and probabilistic aspects of your theory, potentially providing a bridge between electromagnetic interactions and the space-time fabric.
GR Effects:
Romashka's theory reproduces various GR effects, such as planetary perihelion shift, light deflection by massive bodies, gravitational redshift, and cosmological redshift. In your theory, you could investigate how these effects manifest within the Crystal Plenum and whether they offer insights into the interconnected dynamics of matter, energy, and consciousness.
Parameter Connections:
The presence of a parameter in Romashka's theory, similar to the parameter "a0" in MOND, could be explored for its implications within the Crystal Plenum. Investigate whether this parameter plays a role in determining the behavior of matter, energy, or information within your theory.

In GR, the equation of motion for monopole ob-

i. (37) 
But it can be shown that Eq. (37) coincides, in the

motion (23) in our theory if it holds

Since in the current version of the theory all particles 
have the same absolute value of charge e and the 
same mass m = e2���N 
���2c2R, Eq. (38) is rewritten in the 
form G = 4c4R2 
e2N ���N.(39) 
This equation dif f ers from Eq. (32) in our paper [2] 
only by a numerical coef i cient of the order of unity, 
which is in both cases approximate. Thus we have 
shown that in our theory massive electrically neutral 
particles move in the same way as is predicted by 
GR, in the case of small velocities, small gravitational 
potentials, but not small accelerations (the acceler- 
ation must be larger by order of magnitude than a0 
determined by Eq. (21)).In particular, our theory 
describes the ef f ect of planetary perihelion shift. 
The ef f ect of a massive body on the electro- 
magnetic interaction of two charged bodies. One 
of the classical GR tests is the def l ection of light rays 
by massive bodies. Let us look how this ef f ect can 
be described in our theory. To do that, we rewrite the 
equation of motion (19) in the form

Consider the tensor in parentheses in the right-hand

This tensor consists of two terms, the i rst of which

scribes an indirect ef f ect of j on i through an inter- 
mediate particle n, i.e., the ef f ect of particles n in 
electromagnetic interactions of particles j and i. It 
is natural to assume that the def l ection of light by a 
massive body can be described as a contribution of 
a third body into the electromagnetic interaction of 
two charged bodies. Let us show that it is really the 
case in our theory. It is easy to verify that the tensor

means that in space with the metric g����, light prop- 
agates along null geodesics determined by the equa- 
tion k�������k��= 0,(43) 
where k��is the wave 4-vector.This, in turn, 
means that our theory reproduces the ef f ects of 
def l ection of light rays and gravitational redshift of 
the Schwarzschild metric in GR if in the Newtonian 
reference frame the velocity of particle i associated 
with the radiation receiver is much smaller than the 
speed of light (and the massive body n is at rest). 
Similarly, our theory reproduces the cosmological 
redshift (at least for galaxies, to which the distance1l 
ismuchsmallerthanR). Intermsofdirectparticlein- 
teraction in Minkowski space, this ef f ect is explained 
by taking into account secondary electromagnetic 
waves from massive bodies n distributed uniformly 
in space on large scales.The case where l is, by 
order of magnitude, not much smaller than R (distant 
galaxies) is left for a further study. 
Thus,in thecase of small velocities, small gravita- 
tional potentials but not small accelerations, all clas- 
sical GR tests are reproduced in our theory: the plan- 
etary perihelion shifts, def l ection of light rays by mas- 
sive bodies, the gravitational redshift and the cosmo- 
logical redshift. The constructed theory is relativistic, 
despite thefactthatthecoincidence ofitsconclusions 
with GR is proved only under specif i ed restrictions (in 
particular, low velocities). The listed GR ef f ects have 
been well tested only for velocities much smaller than 
the speed of light, so we can believe that our theory 
is in agreement with GR. In addition, cosmological 
coincidences are consequences of thetheory, asnoted 
in [2]. 
In conclusion, let us enumerate the main ques- 
tions that have remained unresolved in the current 
version of the theory. 
1. We assumed that all particles have the same 
mass (13). This restriction is not critical if we con- 
sider macroscopic bodies whose mass is approxi- 
mately determined by the number of nucleons in their 
atomic nuclei (and the proton and neutron masses 
are almost the same). However, in particle physics, 
the question of the mass spectrum of particles is one 
of the fundamental unsolved questions. Perhaps our 
theory can be useful for solving this question because 
it contains a new idea about the mechanism of the 
origin of mass. 
2. We considered massive electrically neutral bod- 
ies (denoted above by the symbol n), which were 
1One means the three-dimensional distance in Euclidean 
space between the pointsof emissionand absorption of light. 
assumed to be at rest. The assumption of the im- 
mobility of massive bodies is satisfactory if we re- 
strict ourselves to the ef f ects associated with the 
Schwarzschild or Friedmann metrics (in the sec- 
ond case, massive bodies are uniformly distributed in 
space and areatrest fromtheviewpointof Minkowski 
space, unless an ef f ective metric is introduced). The 
question of whether it is possible to build a determin- 
istic theory (or a theory suitable for calculations) in a 
more general case, remains open. 
3.The equation of motion (19) takes into ac- 
count the ���nearby��� bodies separated from particle i 
by distances much smaller than R. Therefore, the 
cosmological redshift in the current version of the 
theory is correctly described only for close galaxies. 
There remains the question of what will happen if 
this restriction is removed. The question of the very 
nature of the appearance of the i nite radius R of the 
electromagnetic interaction also remains open. 
4. The theory is largely based on the assumption 
that the sum of the advanced potentials, denoted 
as �� 
Aadv 
�� , can be represented as a function of many 
variables���retarded potentials at points K.More- 
over, we admit that this function is decomposable 
into a Taylor series (in the neighborhood of zero) 
and restrict ourselves to linear terms. Presumably, 
due to these restrictions the current version of the 
theory has not yet been able to reproduce the rotation 
curves of galaxies predicted by MOND. It seems to 
be of interest to investigate higher-order terms in this 
decomposition. Moreover, it may turn out that in the 
general case it is necessary to consider not a function 
at points K, but a functional representing the sum of 
integrals over segments of world lines of particles k ?= 
i. This is indirectly evidenced by the fact that in the 
nonrelativistic case, considered in [2], i nite segments 
of the world lines of particles k ?= i participate in the 
gravitational interaction.

Here are brief explanations of these key physics concepts:

- Zero-Point Energy: The lowest possible energy that a quantum mechanical physical system may have. It arises from quantum vacuum fluctuations.

- Planck's Quantum Theory: Max Planck's 1900 theory that treated electromagnetic radiation as if it were emitted and absorbed in discrete "quanta". This was a breakthrough that established quantum physics. 

- Quantum Vacuum: The vacuum state in quantum field theory is not truly empty but instead contains fleeting electromagnetic waves and virtual particles that pop into and out of existence.

- Electromagnetic Field Fluctuations: Minute random fluctuations in electromagnetic fields that constantly occur in the quantum vacuum, as permitted by the Heisenberg uncertainty principle. 

- Vacuum Fluctuations: Brief fluctuations in the amount of energy in the quantum vacuum or virtual particle appearances and disappearances therein.

- General Relativity (GR): Einstein's 1915 theory of gravitation that describes gravity as a result of spacetime being curved by matter and energy. 

- Dark Energy: Hypothetical form of energy that permeates all of space and exerts a repulsive force, accelerating the expansion of the universe. Constitutes 68% of the universe.

- Conformal Transformation: A transformation that preserves angles between curves or vectors but may change their lengths. Used in physics to relate equivalent theories, such as Einstein and Jordan frames in gravity.

- Lagrangian Density: The density of the Lagrangian, a function in Lagrangian mechanics and field theory that is the difference between kinetic and potential energy. Determines dynamics.

- Cosmic Inflation: Period of accelerated expansion in the very early universe, by a factor of at least 10^26 in approximately 10^-32 seconds. Solves flatness and horizon problems in Big Bang model.

- Cosmological Constant: Einstein's modification of GR to allow for a constant vacuum energy density that would counteract gravity on cosmic scales and allow a static universe solution. Later observations found the universe is expanding.

- Scalar-Tensor Theories of Gravity: Generalized theories of gravity that include additional scalar fields besides the metric tensor. Attempt to explain dark energy and inflation, such as Brans-Dicke theory. 

- Monopole Objects: Hypothetical elementary particles that carry a single magnetic pole. Some cosmological models and grand unified theories predicted their copious production in the early universe but none have been found.

- Geodesic Equation: Differential equation describing the tangential deviation of neighbour geodesics in curved spacetime. From it one can derive gravitational lensing and tidal gravitational effects.  

- Schwarzschild Metric: Exact solution to the Einstein field equations describing the gravitational field outside a spherical mass. Yield insights into black holes.

- Friedmann Metric: Solution to Einstein's field equations for a homogeneous and isotropic expanding or contracting universe. The basis for modern cosmology.

- Gravitational Redshift: In GR, photons escaping from a gravitational field suffer an increase in wavelength (redshift) due to time dilation effects.

- Cosmological Redshift: Expansion of the universe stretches the wavelength of light from distant galaxies, an observable phenomenon explained by the Big Bang model.

- Baryon Acoustic Oscillations (BAO): Imprints of sound waves propagating through the early Universe plasma visible in clustering of galaxies today. Provides standard ruler for cosmology.  

- Modified Newtonian Dynamics (MOND): Alternative theory that proposes small accelerations in the universe differ from the Newtonian expectation. Aims to explain galaxy rotations without dark matter.
