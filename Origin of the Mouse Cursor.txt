No it was called Color Harmony (1938) Color Harmony: An Animated Explanation of How Color Vision Works circa 1938
BY MARIA POPOVA
Human vision is one of the most remarkable capacities of our bodies, its precise mechanism the subject of much fascination, from gorgeous vintage illustrations to cutting-edge modern science to Sesame Street stop-motion. In 1938, The Handy (Jam) Organization ��� the same folks who brought us an homage to makers and hands-on creativity, an animated explanation of how radio broadcasting works, a visual tour of mid-century design, the original Rudolph the Red-Nosed Reindeer animation, and a primer on ultraviolet light ��� produced Color Harmony: a fantastic animated explanation of how color vision works, how other animals use their eyes, and how the human eye functions to see colors both separately and in combination.

The irony, of course, is that on the timeline of film innovation, color didn���t permeate Hollywood until the 1950s ��� mainstream film technology in 1938 was confined to black-and-white, so all the live footage is devoid of color, complemented instead by hand-drawn color animation.

I was going to say that I think Christianity should have been called Go and tell no one ism
ChatGPT
Your suggestion that Christianity could be humorously called "Go and tell no one-ism" seems to highlight an interesting tension in the Christian message: the contrast between moments of private faith and the broader imperative of evangelism. Here's an exploration of this idea:
The Paradox in Christianity: Private Faith vs. Evangelism
Biblical Instances of Silence
:
Miracles and Silence
: In the Gospels, Jesus sometimes instructed those he healed or performed miracles for to "tell no one" (e.g., Mark 1:44, Matthew 8:4). This instruction could be interpreted as a call to humility or to prevent misunderstandings about His mission.
Messianic Secret
: The concept known as the "Messianic Secret" in biblical scholarship refers to Jesus��� frequent requests for secrecy about His identity as the Messiah and His miracles. This may have been intended to avoid premature confrontations with authorities or to encourage people to come to faith through personal conviction rather than sensationalism.
Command to Evangelize
:
Great Commission
: Despite these instances of secrecy, Christianity is fundamentally a faith that encourages spreading its message. The Great Commission (Matthew 28:19-20) explicitly instructs believers to "go and make disciples of all nations."
Acts of the Apostles
: The early Christians, as described in the Book of Acts, were very active in evangelism, spreading the teachings of Jesus widely and openly.
Balancing Silence and Proclamation
:
Contemplative Practices
: Christian traditions, particularly monastic ones, often emphasize silence and contemplation as crucial aspects of spiritual life. These practices focus on personal spiritual growth and deepening one���s relationship with God.
Active Evangelism
: On the other hand, many Christian denominations and movements emphasize the importance of missionary work and evangelism, believing that sharing the faith is a fundamental Christian duty.
The Irony and Humor
Humorous Perspective
: The humorous suggestion to rename Christianity as "Go and tell no one-ism" plays on the ironic tension between Jesus' commands for silence in certain contexts and the overall evangelical mission of Christianity. It highlights how certain aspects of Jesus' ministry might seem at odds with the more outwardly focused aspects of Christian practice.
Reflective Thought
: This humor can also invite deeper reflection on the nature of faith and the various ways it can be expressed. It can lead to discussions on when it is appropriate to share one's faith and when it might be more powerful to demonstrate faith through actions and quiet example.
Reflection on Faith Practices
Witness Through Actions
: Sometimes, Christians are called to witness through their actions rather than words, embodying their faith in everyday behavior and relationships.
Personal Faith Journey
: Each believer's journey is unique, and there are times for both quiet, personal faith and active sharing. Balancing these aspects can lead to a more holistic and authentic expression of Christianity.
Cultural Sensitivity
: In some contexts, particularly where Christians are a minority or face persecution, practicing faith quietly and discreetly can be a practical necessity. In such situations, the faith���s quiet resilience can speak volumes.
In conclusion, the humor in calling Christianity "Go and tell no one-ism" highlights a real and fascinating aspect of the faith: the dynamic interplay between private devotion and public proclamation. This paradox is an essential part of the Christian experience, encouraging believers to navigate their faith journey with wisdom, humility, and sensitivity to context.
