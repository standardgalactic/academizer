SUMMARY 
Understanding of the evolved biological function of sleep has advanced considerably in the past decade. 
However, no equivalent understanding of dreams has emerged. Contemporary neuroscientif i c theories often 
view dreams as epiphenomena, and many of the proposals for their biological function are contradicted by 
the phenomenology of dreams themselves. Now, the recent advent of deep neural networks (DNNs) has 
i nally provided the novel conceptual framework within which to understand the evolved function of dreams. 
Notably, all DNNs face the issue of overf i tting as they learn, which is when performance on one dataset in- 
creases but the networkâs performance fails to generalize (often measured by the divergence of performance 
on training versus testing datasets). This ubiquitous problem in DNNs is often solved by modelers via âânoise 
injectionsââ in the form of noisy or corrupted inputs. The goal of this paper is to argue that the brain faces a 
similar challenge of overf i tting and that nightly dreams evolved to combat the brainâs overf i tting during its 
daily learning. That is, dreams are a biological mechanism for increasing generalizability via the creation of 
corrupted sensory inputs from stochastic activity across the hierarchy of neural structures. Sleep loss, spe- 
cif i cally dream loss, leads to an overf i tted brain that can still memorizeand learn butfails togeneralizeappro- 
priately. Herein this ââoverf i tted brain hypothesisââ is explicitly developed and then compared and contrasted 
with existing contemporary neuroscientif i c theories of dreams. Existing evidence for the hypothesis is sur- 
veyed within both neuroscience and deep learning, and a set of testable predictions is put forward that 
can be pursued both in vivo and in silico.

THE BIGGER PICTUREDreaming remains a mystery to neuroscience. While various hypotheses of why 
brains evolved nightly dreaming have been put forward, many of these are contradicted by the sparse, hallu- 
cinatory, and narrative nature of dreams, a nature that seems to lack any particular function. Recently, 
research on artif i cial neural networks has shown that during learning, such networks face a ubiquitous prob- 
lem: that of overf i tting to a particular dataset, which leads to failures in generalization and therefore perfor- 
mance on novel datasets. Notably, the techniques that researchers employ to rescue overf i tted artif i cial neu- 
ral networks generally involve sampling from an out-of-distribution or randomized dataset. The overf i tted 
brain hypothesis is that the brains of organisms similarly face the challenge of i tting too well to their daily 
distribution of stimuli, causing overf i tting and poor generalization. By hallucinating out-of-distribution sen-

The central argument is that dreams serve as a mechanism to combat the brain's tendency towards overfitting during daily learning, akin to the problem faced by deep neural networks (DNNs).In the context of DNNs, overfitting occurs when a network performs well on training data but fails to generalize to new, unseen data. This issue is commonly addressed by introducing noise or corrupted inputs during the training process. Hoel proposes that the human brain faces a similar challenge of overfitting based on daily sensory inputs. Dreams, he suggests, act as a biological counterpart to the noise injections used in DNNs, providing "corrupted" sensory inputs through stochastic neural activity. This process aids in maintaining the generalizability of our cognitive and perceptual abilities.The paper also discusses the broader implications of this hypothesis, contrasting it with existing neuroscientific theories of dreams. It surveys evidence from both neuroscience and deep learning, and proposes testable predictions that can be pursued both in living organisms (in vivo) and computational models (in silico).Furthermore, Hoel touches on the increase in vivid and frequent dreaming reported during the COVID-19 pandemic, suggesting that understanding the function of dreams is still a significant challenge in neuroscience. This "overfitted brain hypothesis" provides a compelling framework for exploring the purpose of dreaming, emphasizing its potential role in preventing overfitting in the brain and thus enhancing cognitive flexibility and generalization.Youorganisms from moving during periods that they are not adapted 
to, such as ensuring that diurnal animals are inactive during 
night,8,9are still taken seriously. 
It is notable that approximately 50% to 70% of the time sub- 
jects report having a dream upon a sudden waking during sleep, 
with more dreams being reported later on in the night.10,11Re- 
ports fromthose whokeep regular dream journals, orwhospend 
time each morning recollecting dreams, indicate that preserving 
a memory of dreams increases signif i cantly with practice.12All 
this hints that individuals may regularly underestimate how 
much time they actually spending dreaming during sleep. 
The phenomenology of dreams is different from that of waking 
experience.13However, few contemporary theories appropri- 
ately account for the phenomenology of dreams, particularly 
their sparse, hallucinatory, and narrative contents. What is the 
purpose of this strange state? The fact that sleep overall has 
some relationship to learning was known even by the Roman 
orator Quintilian.14Yet, as is discussed in detail in the next sec- 
tion,contemporaryneuroscientif i ctheorieswhichrelate 
dreaming to memory storage, memory replay, or emotional pro- 
cessing, still view dreams themselves as epiphenomena. 
This lack of viable theories about why animals dream stands in 
contrast with how much is known about sleep physiology and its 
stages.15As originally discovered by lesion studies and later 
supported by genetic knockout studies, the sleep state is 
brought about by a far-reaching set of subcortical neuromodula- 
tory systems, with no one system being necessary, indicating 
redundancy in how the waking state is sustained.16In general, 
this multifaceted arousal system is excitatory during wake in 
that it has the greatest i ring, and becomes more quiescent to 
bring about sleep, although this is not true for all such systems, 
especially those that establish rapid eye movement (REM). 
A classic signature of sleep are slow waves, which are waves 
of activity that traverse the cortex, which can be identif i ed when 
the dominate frequency of electroencephalogram (EEG) is less 
than 1 Hz. In this state, the cortex become bistable, oscillating 
between periods of intense i ring and periods often referred to 
asââdownstatesââwhereinneuronsaresilent.Ingeneral,itshould 
be noted that there is a spectrum wherein sometimes a brain re- 
gion is experiencing slow wave sleep and this is not synchro- 
nized withother regions.17Thisisdespitethefactthatsleepitself 
is traditionally broken down into non-REM (NREM) sleep and 
REM sleep, with REM sleep being more associated with 
dreaming than NREM sleep. Yet there is evidence that dreaming 
occurs regularly throughout the night, across different sleep 
stages,18although it is rarest in the ââdeepestââ stage of NREM, 
stage 3, wherein surface EEG ref l ects low-frequency cortical 
slow waves. Recent neuroimaging and sudden-waking experi- 
ments have demonstrated that all sleep stages can have 
dreams, which are the result of localized wake-like i ring.19On 
average, high-frequency EEG signals in posterior areas of the 
brain were most correlated with reports on waking. Despite the 
ubiquity of dreams, it is still the case that REM is most strongly 
associated with dreaming, more than 80% to 90% of the time 
in some awakening studies, although it should be noted again 
that sleep involves a spectrum wherein it is diff i cult to i nd any 
stage at any time of the night that does not contain any dreams 
at all.20Although early on in the night dreams can present them- 
selves as more ââthought-likeââ and simple, later on in the night, 
particularly during REM, dreams can become incredibly com- 
plex with a fully developed narrative structure.21Therefore, while 
the story of dreaming occurring solely during REM has been 
complicated, it is true they are still associated. 
As far as is currently known, dreaming of is a brain-wide state 
where the brain is experiencing a single narrative or event, which 
is supported by the activation of the default-mode network dur- 
ing dreaming.22Consider, for instance, the evidence from sud- 
den-waking experiments that higher frequency activity in the 
frontal lobe predicted emotional affect within the subjectâs 
dream.23Or consider the evidence that during lucid dreaming, 
activity is similar to waking movements in the sensorimotor 
cortex.24 
Despite the nuances and redundancies of the cortical systems 
in play, it still makes sense to view the change from dreamless 
sleep to dreaming as occurring via a brain-wide neuromodula- 
tory system that regulates level of consciousness, such as by 
the increase in i ring of acetylcholine-containing neurons during 
REM. Neuromodulatory systems also create the conditions of 
muscle atonia during dreaming, without which dreams can be 
acted out by the body during sleep, a dangerous parasomnia 
called REM sleep behavior disorder.25 
What is the overall evolved purpose or function of sleep? The 
evidenceofdistinctphysiologicalstatesbroughtaboutbyneuro- 
modulation suggests answering this requires identifying multiple 
functions, particularly for dreamless sleep versus dreaming. 
Across the Tree of Life, sleep as a whole is highly conserved; 
most mammals spend somewhere between 4 and 20 h 
sleeping.26There is even evidence that Caenorhabditis elegans 
sleeps.27In the past 2 decades there has been signif i cant prog- 
ress when it comes to understanding the evolved function of sleep as a whole, although this has not been true for dreams 
themselves.ChatGPTChatGPTContinuing from the earlier summary, the paper delves deeper into various aspects of dreaming and sleep, highlighting the complexity of this phenomenon and its relationship to various brain functions.Prevalence and Underestimation of Dreaming: The paper notes that 50% to 70% of people report dreaming when suddenly awakened, with the frequency of dreams increasing later in the night. It suggests that people might underestimate the amount of time they spend dreaming, especially considering that memory of dreams can be improved with practice.Phenomenology of Dreams: Dreams differ markedly from waking experiences, characterized by their sparse, hallucinatory, and narrative nature. Contemporary neuroscientific theories that relate dreaming to memory storage, replay, or emotional processing often view dreams as mere epiphenomena, not fully accounting for their unique characteristics.Sleep Physiology and Stages: The paper discusses the physiological mechanisms of sleep, including the role of subcortical neuromodulatory systems. It describes how the transition between wakefulness and sleep involves changes in these systems, and how different sleep stages, including REM and non-REM sleep, are associated with dreaming.Dreaming Across Sleep Stages: While REM sleep is most strongly associated with dreaming, dreams can occur in all sleep stages. The nature of dreams can vary throughout the night, from simple, thought-like experiences to complex narratives, especially during REM sleep.Brain Activity During Dreaming: Dreaming is described as a brain-wide state, often involving the activation of the default-mode network. Evidence from various studies is cited, showing how different brain regions are activated during dreaming and how this relates to dream content.Sleep Disorders and Neuromodulatory Systems: The paper discusses the role of neuromodulatory systems in regulating consciousness and muscle atonia during dreaming. Conditions like REM sleep behavior disorder, where dreams are acted out, underscore the importance of these systems.Evolved Purpose of Sleep and Dreams: While the understanding of sleep's evolved function has advanced, the specific purpose of dreaming remains less clear. The paper highlights the need to consider multiple functions for different sleep states and underscores the high conservation of sleep across different species.In summary, Erik Hoel's paper presents a comprehensive exploration of dreaming and sleep, emphasizing the need for a deeper understanding of the unique phenomenology of dreams and their potential biological functions. It highlights the gaps in current neuroscientific theories and suggests that understanding dreams may require considering their role in cognitive processes like generalization, as proposed in the "overfitted brain hypothesis."YouFirst, a novel discovery has led to a clear purpose for at least 
one aspect of sleep. This was the discovery of the brainâs glym- 
phatic system, showing that sleep involves the brain-wide l ush- 
ing of metabolites with cerebral spinal l uid.28This led to the the- 
ory that sleep, especially during slow wave activity, had the goal 
of waste clearance and this is at least partly behind sleepâs 
restorative aspect. Glymphatic activity in the form of this l ushing 
is low in waking but high during both sleep and while under 
certain types of anesthesia. In sleep and also under anesthesia, 
the greatest amount of l ushing occurs during slow wave sleep 
when low-frequency delta power dominates the EEG,29indi- 
cating that it may be anticorrelated with dreaming, although 
this has not been explicitly established. Dreams may still occur 
during these l ushing events; indeed, it is unknown if the function 
of dreams might even change depending on sleep stages or 
background neurophysiological conditions. 
Another important theory of the purpose of sleep is the Synap- 
tic Homeostasis Hypothesis (SHY).30According to SHY, daily 
learning leads to net synaptic potentiation across the brain, 
which, if left unchecked, would lead to a saturation of synaptic 
weight and a cessation of learning.31SHY hypothesizes that 
slow waves trigger a brain-wide down-scaling of synaptic 
weights. This indiscriminate down-scaling ensures that the rela- 
tive weights of synapses are kept proportional while removing 
the risk of saturation. SHY has served as a model neuroscientif i c 
theory in that it has generated a number of new empirical fndings.32At the same time, it has also triggered fecund debate 
and investigation.33Traditionally, SHY is more associated with 
slow wave sleep than with the high frequencies that indicate 
dreaming. It has also not been explored how SHY faces the 
problem that a global down-scaling of synapses could easily 
fail to keep the pattern of synaptic weights the same, since neu- 
rons are nonlinear mechanisms. Even a net down-scaling of an 
artif i cial neural network with rectif i ed linear unit (ReLU) activation 
functions would likely affect its function if the scaling dropped 
any weights below zero; in the case of sigmoid activation func- 
tions, it would signif i cantly impact function, and in an un- 
known way. 
The overall evidence indicates that sleep can be broken into 
two parts: during dreamless sleep metabolic clearance and 
cellular it is likely that repair occurs, and some form of unknown 
contribution to improvements in performance and learning on 
tasks occurs during dreaming.34Ultimately, this purpose of the 
dreaming phase or aspect of sleep lacks hypotheses as explicit 
and clear as those for slow wave sleep.35 
In order to offer forward a distinct theory of the purpose of 
dreams, this paper outlines the idea that the brains of animals 
are constantly in danger of overf i tting, which is the lack of gener- 
alizability that occurs in a deep neural network when its learning 
is based too much on one particular dataset, and that dreams 
help mitigate this ubiquitous issue. This is the overf i tted brian hy- 
pothesis (OBH). The goal of this paper is to formally i ll-out the 
OBH by investigating the evidence that the brain i ts to a dataset 
composed of the statistically similar daily experiences of the or- 
ganism, while nightly dreams improve the generality and robust- 
ness of an animalâs representations, cognition, and perceptual 
systems, by generating data far outside the organismâs daily 
ââtraining setââ in a warped or corrupted way.36This idea is sup- 
portedbytheideathatstochasticity(suchascorruptedorsparse 
inputs) is critical in machine learning.37As will be discussed, the 
OBH i ts with known biological understanding and data, 
matchesbetterwithdreamphenomenologythanmostother the- 
ories, draws various antecedents and similar approaches under 
one specif i c roof, and additionally has roots in common prac- 
tices in deep learning. It makes unique predictions that can be 
tested both via computational modeling and also in vivo.ChatGPTChatGPTThe paper further expands on the biological functions of sleep and dreaming, introducing key theories that provide insight into these complex processes:Brain's Glymphatic System: A novel discovery highlighted is the brainâs glymphatic system, which is active during sleep. This system facilitates the flushing of metabolic waste with cerebral spinal fluid. This flushing is more pronounced during slow wave sleep, characterized by low-frequency delta waves in EEG recordings. The relationship between this flushing process and dreaming is not fully established, but it's suggested that this process may have a different function depending on the sleep stage.Synaptic Homeostasis Hypothesis (SHY): SHY proposes that daily learning leads to net synaptic potentiation across the brain. Without regulation, this would lead to synaptic saturation and a halt in learning. SHY hypothesizes that slow wave sleep triggers a global down-scaling of synaptic weights, maintaining the relative weights while preventing saturation. While SHY is primarily associated with slow wave sleep and not directly linked to dreaming, the paper discusses its relevance and potential limitations, particularly in how global down-scaling might affect the nonlinear nature of neural mechanisms.Functions of Different Sleep Phases: The paper suggests that sleep can be divided into two parts: dreamless sleep, which is likely associated with metabolic clearance and cellular repair, and dreaming, which contributes to improvements in performance and learning. However, the specific purpose of dreaming is less clear compared to the functions attributed to slow wave sleep.The Overfitted Brain Hypothesis (OBH): The paper presents the OBH, suggesting that animal brains, like deep neural networks, are at risk of overfitting based on daily experiences. Dreams, according to this hypothesis, mitigate this issue by introducing data that is far outside the organism's daily "training set," thus improving the generality and robustness of an animal's cognitive and perceptual systems. This hypothesis aligns with known biological data and dream phenomenology, offering a unified explanation for various aspects of dreaming. It also draws parallels with practices in deep learning, where stochasticity (such as corrupted or sparse inputs) is crucial.In summary, the paper argues that dreams play a critical role in preventing overfitting in the brain, akin to noise injections in machine learning, thus enhancing cognitive and perceptual flexibility. This hypothesis aligns with empirical data and offers testable predictions for both computational modeling and in vivo studies.YouCONTEMPORARY THEORIES OF DREAMS 
A hypothesis for the evolved purpose of sleep must outline a 
clear and distinct function from other aspects of sleep. It must 
also explain how dreams present themselves, that is, the phe- 
nomenology of dream experience. Specif i cally, it must explain 
why dream phenomenology is different from wake phenomenol- 
ogy. Consider three phenomenological properties unique to 
dreams.First,thesparsenessofdreamsinthattheyaregenerally 
less vivid than waking life in that they contain less sensory and 
conceptual information (i.e., less detail). This lack of detail in 
dreams is universal, and examples include the blurring of text 
causing an impossibility of reading, using phones, or calcula- 
tions.38Second, the hallucinatory quality of dreams in that they 
are generally unusual in some way (i.e., not the simple repetition 
of daily events or specif i c memories). This includes the fact that 
in dreams, events and concepts often exist outside of normally 
strict categories (a person becomes another person, a house a 
spaceship, and so on). Third, the narrative property of dreams, 
in that dreams in adult humans are generally sequences of 
events ordered such that they form a narrative, albeit a fabulist 
one.Aswewillsee,theOBHpositsitisnotinspiteoftheseprop- 
erties that dreams serve their evolved purpose, but because 
of them. 
Thissectionexploresexistenttheoriesofdreams,thesupport- 
ing evidence (or lack thereof) and how they fail to integrate well 
with, or explain, dream phenomenology. 
Dreams are for emotional regulation 
The idea that dreams are important for emotional health is a 
descendant of Freudian theories of psycholanalysis.39While 
Freudâs theories of dreams as expressions of taboo frustration 
are discredited, there is still a historical association between 
dreams as expressions of, or important for, emotional pro- 
cessing. 
The specif i c proposals for how dreams impact emotional 
regulation involve hypotheses like that dreams are somehow 
for fear extinction.40Such hypotheses reason that dreams might 
act somewhat like cognitive behavioral therapy treatment for 
phobias, wherein they provide a safe space for âârehearsalsââ to- 
ward fearful things in order to make them less frightful.41Yet 
there is no evidence that the fears of nightmares are the kind 
of irrational fears faced by those with phobias, nor that fears to- 
ward nightmarish events in general shouldbe attenuated, asfear 
is evolutionarily quite useful. 
Another kind of theory is that dreams act much like an 
ââemotional thermostatââ in order to regulate emotions.42,43 
Fromdreamjournalsthereissomeevidencethatmoreemotional 
dreams predict better recovery from disorders like depression,44 
although sample size for this sort of research is prohibitively 
small throughout oneirology. From neuroimaging there is evi- 
dence that emotional processing centers like the amygdala 
show greater activity during REM even than during wake,45 
although the role of the amygdala ranges widely from emotions 
to rewards to motivations.46There is some evidence that 
changes in REM sleep indicate mood disorders.47However, 
this is not unique to only REM sleep, as NREM sleep is also 
changed or reduced in mood disorders,48and many cognitive 
disorders show sleep problems in general.49Sleep deprivation 
does appear to lead to emotional issues such as a lack of 
emotional inhibition and also irritability.50But such failures of 
appropriate function holds true across many cognitive pro- 
cesses following sleep deprivation, including executive function, 
which would affect emotional regulation.51 
Overall,thehypothesisthatdreamsareforresolvingemotional 
conf l icts specif i cally does not have overwhelming empirical evi- 
dence.Itisalsonotsupportedbythephenomenologyofdreams, 
which, at least in general, are not emphatically emotional. 
Indeed, emotionally neutral dreams are common. Overall there 
appears to be a slight bias to dreams to have negative affect,52 
although this may simply be that dreams that have high 
emotional valence are memorable (and it is worth noting that in 
studying dream reports joy/elation was the next most common 
to anxiety/fear). Given the evidence it seems likely that whatever 
the evolved purpose of dreams is, its function can affect emo- 
tions, but there is no strong evidence that dreaming has evolved 
specif i cally for emotional regulation.ChatGPTChatGPTThe paper discusses contemporary theories about the purpose of dreams, particularly focusing on their phenomenological aspects. It evaluates these theories in light of the three unique properties of dreams: their sparseness, hallucinatory quality, and narrative structure.Dreams and Emotional Regulation: One theory proposes that dreams are important for emotional health, an idea with roots in Freudian psychology. While Freud's specific theories are discredited, the notion that dreams play a role in emotional processing persists. Some hypotheses suggest that dreams might act like cognitive behavioral therapy for phobias, providing a safe space for confronting fears. However, there is little evidence to support the idea that the fears in nightmares are akin to irrational phobias or that such fears should be attenuated.Dreams as an 'Emotional Thermostat': Another theory posits that dreams regulate emotions, acting like an emotional thermostat. Some studies indicate that more emotional dreams may predict better recovery from disorders like depression. Neuroimaging shows greater activity in emotional processing centers like the amygdala during REM sleep. However, the amygdala's role is diverse, and changes in REM sleep are not unique to mood disorders, as NREM sleep is also affected. Furthermore, sleep deprivation leads to emotional issues, but this effect is not exclusive to dreams or REM sleep.Evidence and Phenomenology: The emotional regulation hypothesis does not have overwhelming empirical support and is not fully aligned with the phenomenology of dreams. Dreams are often emotionally neutral, and while there is a slight bias towards negative affect in dreams, this might be due to more emotionally charged dreams being more memorable. The paper suggests that while the evolved purpose of dreams might affect emotions, there is no strong evidence that they have specifically evolved for emotional regulation.In summary, the paper critically examines contemporary theories of dreams, particularly those related to emotional regulation, and finds them lacking in empirical evidence and alignment with the unique characteristics of dreams. The paper emphasizes the need for a theory that can better explain the distinct phenomenology of dreams.YouDreams are for memory consolidation 
Perhaps the leading contemporary theory is that dreams some- 
how involve memory consolidation and storage,53often via a 
proposed form of memory replay.54The dominant metaphor 
for this theory of consolidation is that of the computer: memories 
need to be ââstoredââ somewhere in the brain, like storing a com- 
puter i le on a hard drive, and therefore there must be a storage 
process. This viewpoint is held by much of traditional cognitive 
neuroscience, wherein the goal of the brain is to ââstoreââ mem- 
ories as veridically as possible,55although there is growing 
recognition that veridical ââcomputer-likeââ storage is not desir- 
able for complex learning and that forgetting is just as impor- 
tant.56According to the memory consolidation hypothesis, 
memory storage occurs during dreams, or alternatively dreams, 
by accessing previously stored memories, strengthen them, or 
that somehow dreams are a byproduct of integrating new mem- 
ories with older ones. 
There is a signif i cant line of research that draws from this the- 
ory,includingmanyneuroimagingstudies,andafullreviewofthe 
literature would be beyond the scope of this paper.57However, 
there is also debate. Specif i cally the consolidation hypothesis 
is both very broad and rarely meant to specify just dreams rather 
than sleep in general.58For example, there is evidence that 
learning a new task leads to a greater activation during both 
REM59and slow wave sleep60in the task-relevant cortical areas, 
which indicates there is no preferential consolidation during 
dreaming. This is true even when comparing a wake/sleep con- 
dition versus a control condition without sleep but over the same 
time, which has found that blood-oxygen-level-dependent 
(BOLD) activity increased in associated brain regions with the 
task.61But these sorts of neuroimaging studies are not very 
specif i c, since increased activation in relevant areas does not 
actually mean storage, nor replay, nor integration with existing 
memories. Indeed, theycould beinterpreted just aseasily for ev- 
idence of the OBH (see ââEvidence from neuroscienceââ). 
Asignif i cant lineofdirectevidencefortheconsolidationtheory 
comes in the form of ââreplayââ of memories during sleep, a spe- 
cif i c hypothesis with a clear thesis and standards of evidence. 
Replay was originally discovered in the hippocampus of 
rats,62,63although the original analysis was again for slow 
wave sleep,notcorrelating thisprocessto dreamingspecif i cally. 
Indeed, the same statistically increased i ring in correlated neu- 
rons that counts as ââreplayââ occurs during quiet wakefulness, 
indicating it has nothing specif i c to do with dreams.64In general, 
if two neurons potentiate at the same time and from the same 
cause, they are more likely to be correlated in the sense of 
increased i ring in the future, regardless of whether they are re- 
playing anything specif i c, a view supported by the i nding that 
ââreplayââ events are much faster in terms of their i ring.65 
There are a number of signif i cant issues with the specif i c hy- 
potheses that dreams are replaying memories.54First, off l ine 
replay of episodic memories may not actually assist memoriza- 
tion; since ground truth is absent off l ine, such replays might 
actually introduce errors. Indeed, neuroscience has shown that 
re-accessing memories generally changes them, rather than en- 
forces them.66,67Due to the issues in assuming that specif i c 
memories are actually replayed, a number of authors have pro- 
posed more complex theories of consolidation, such as that 
the idea there exists two complementary learning systems and 
replay connects these two systems together.68Furthermore, 
the hypothesis must grapple with the fact that well-controlled 
neuroimaging experiments show little evidence for exact 
sequence replication and strong evidence for mostly never- 
before-seen i ring patterns.69In light of this sort of evidence, 
some have argued that sleep promotes gist extraction from spe- 
cif i c memories,70,71although these sorts of hypotheses have not 
specif i cally been about dreaming. 
Overall, replay is unlikely to be the purpose of dreams, since, 
as previously discussed, based on the most detailed studies 
on dream reports after awakenings, dreams are not connected 
or, at most, only vaguely connected with the dayâs events.72 
Overall, it appears that less than 1% to 2% of dream reports 
have anything to do with episodic memories.73Except in cases 
of posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD), dreams do not repeat 
specif i c memories, and those that do are considered patholog- 
ical; for instance, closely after Hurricane Andrew, the only hurri- 
cane-related dreams, even from a sample of the population from 
the hardest hit area, were from those already diagnosed with 
PTSD.74Close studies of dream journals have in general found 
that replays of specif i c memories or a dayâs events are generally 
either rare or nonexistent, although they do in general involve ac- 
tions and people the dreamer is familiar with.75One study exam- 
ining dreams after the terrorist attacks of 9/11 found that âânot a 
single one of the 880 dreams (440 of them after 9/11) involved 
planes hitting tall buildings or similar scenarios, even though all 
the participants had seen these events many times on television 
(and it was clearly an emotionally important experience). No 
scenes were pictured that were even close to the actual 
attacks.ââ76,77 
Indeed,thereissignif i cantevidencethatepisodicmemoryand 
dreams are dissociated.78While there is behavioral evidence 
that repetitive daily tasks, like having subjects play Tetris for sig- 
nif i cant periods of time, can lead to Tetris-inspired dreams, such 
inculcated images or sequences do not represent replay in that 
they are not veridical repeats of previous games, being more 
hallucinatory and sparse in content and only being loosely 
related to the played game, such as dreaming of playing some 
altered version of a maze game after being exposed to it during 
the day.79Moreover, dreams triggered by such repetitive games 
appear even in patients completely lacking all memory, those 
with clinically diagnosed amnesia.80It can take several days 
for repetitive tasks to show up in dreams, a form of ââdream 
lag,ââ and almost always these tasks appear in partial forms 
that are, again, only loosely similar.81Overall, the behavioral ev- 
idence suggests that dreams are not replays of memories or 
waking events. 
ThereisastronglineofevidencefromTetris-studiestosudden 
wake-ups to dream-lag effects showing that partial or loosely 
similar dreams can be triggered mostreliably byrecently learned 
tasks, and yet such inculcated dreams generally take the form of 
never-before-seenexperiencesorsequenceswiththetraditional 
dream-like properties of sparseness and hallucination, matching 
no specif i c memory but rather a seeming exploration of the 
state-space of the task itself. 
It is worth noting that in most cases the sparse, hallucinatory, 
and narrative properties of dreams are unaccounted for by the 
consolidation hypothesis. Most dreams do not involve specif i c 
memories at all, making the integration of new memories a questionablepurposefordreaming. Indeed,itisopenlyadmitted 
that the consolidation hypothesis still views dreams themselves 
as epiphenomena.54As we will see, much of the supporting re- 
sults for the integration, replay, or storage of memories actually 
i ts better with the OBH (ââEvidence from neuroscienceââ).ChatGPTChatGPTThe paper continues to analyze contemporary theories about the purpose of dreams, focusing on the idea that dreams are involved in memory consolidation.Memory Consolidation Theory: This leading theory suggests that dreams are involved in memory consolidation and storage, perhaps through a form of memory replay. It draws an analogy with computer storage, positing that the brain stores memories during dreams, strengthens them, or integrates new memories with older ones.Replay of Memories: A significant line of evidence for this theory comes from the concept of 'replay' of memories during sleep, originally observed in the hippocampus of rats during slow wave sleep. However, this process is not specific to dreams and occurs during quiet wakefulness as well. The theory faces challenges, as neuroscience suggests that re-accessing memories often alters them, rather than simply reinforcing them.Evidence and Issues: While neuroimaging studies show increased activation in task-relevant cortical areas after learning a new task, this does not necessarily indicate memory storage or replay. The consolidation theory, especially regarding the specific replay of memories during dreams, has significant issues. Detailed studies on dream reports show that dreams are not closely connected with the day's events or episodic memories. For example, in studies of dreams following significant events like 9/11, dream content did not directly replicate these experiences.Tetris Studies and Dream Properties: Studies involving repetitive tasks like playing Tetris have shown that such activities can lead to inspired dreams, but these dreams do not represent veridical replays of the activities. Dreams often exhibit properties of sparseness, hallucinatory content, and narrative structure, which are not accounted for by the consolidation hypothesis.Consolidation Hypothesis and Dream Phenomenology: The consolidation hypothesis struggles to account for the sparse, hallucinatory, and narrative properties of dreams. Most dreams do not involve specific memories, challenging the idea of memory integration as a primary purpose of dreaming. The hypothesis still largely views dreams as epiphenomena.In summary, while the memory consolidation theory is one of the leading contemporary theories about the purpose of dreams, it faces significant challenges in explaining the specific characteristics and phenomenology of dreams. The paper suggests that the evidence supporting this theory might be better aligned with the Overfitted Brain Hypothesis, which posits that dreams help prevent overfitting in the brain's learning processes.YouDreams are for selective forgetting 
Notably, Francis Crick and Graeme Mitchinson proposed an 
alternative purpose for dreams in 1983, which they called 
ââreverse learning.ââ82,83In this hypothesis, the point of dreaming 
is somehow to remove ââundesirableââ connections and help the 
brain ââunlearn.ââ Yet this hypothesis has been largely ignored in 
contemporary dreaming research. Instead, the alternative hy- 
pothesis,thatdreamsinvolvereplayorconsolidation ofmemory, 
became favored by the community84due to the excitement 
around early replay results.62Contemporary neuroscientif i c 
research often views there as being both a consolidation phase 
as well as a forgetting phase for memories, although this is again 
predominately associated with slow wave sleep, rather than 
dreaming specif i cally.85Within deep learning it is known that 
averaging together models and renormalizing can assist in 
learning86which could broadly be thought to resemble some 
sort of selective forgetting in real neural networks. More specif- 
ically, it has been proposed that Boltzmann machines may actu- 
ally implement something very similar to the Crick and Mitchin- 
son notion of reverse learning wherein synaptic down-scaling 
could eliminate the discrepancy between environmental inputs 
and a systemâs internal model of the environment,87which is 
an earlier version of the sorts of predictive processing theories 
discussed in the section ââDreams benef i t predictive processing 
by ref i ning generative models.ââ Indeed, it has been argued that 
down-scaling of synapses might themselves prevent overf i t- 
ting,88,89thus providing a possible link between SHY, the OBH, 
and the original reverse learning hypothesis. 
Recently there has been explicit computational modeling in 
spiking neural networks showing that ââreverse learningââ in the 
form of reverse learning rules can indeed prove helpful. Specif- 
ically, the authors showed that an anti-learning rule during a 
ââsleep phaseââ of the network, in the form of anti-Hebbian 
learning, could break up attractor states that were detrimental 
to learning.90It is worth noting that breaking up detrimental at- 
tractor states could lead to similar outcomes as the OBH. How- 
ever, in general any sort of ââreverse learningââ is not necessary 
from the perspective of the OBH. This is because ââreverse 
learningââ approaches differ signif i cantly by focusing on how 
specif i c memories are destroyed (via anti-learning mechanisms 
like a hypothetical ââreverse Spike-timing-dependent plasticityââ) 
ratherthanhowcorrupted inputs ortop-downnoise can improve 
generalization like in the OBH. 
Dreams are preparations for real-world problems 
The close correlation between creativity and dreams, as well as 
the similarity of dreams to simulations or virtual realities, has led 
to hypotheses that dreaming can be used to solve relevant real- 
world problems for the animal. For example, perhaps dreams 
allow for creative experimentation where the dreamer keeps 
the best ideas put forth,91although this is problematic given 
the generally amnesiac nature of dreams and their lack of real- 
world relevance. A more direct hypothesis is that dreams act 
as rehearsals for stereotypical behaviors for animals in a form 
of ââgenetic programming.ââ92In more contemporary studies, 
this has been referred to as the hypothesis that dreams act as 
proto-conscious states to prepare for activities during waking 
behavior.93 
Similar examples of this hypothesis include an interpretation 
based off of robots that used simulations to i gure out self- 
models94or that an animal might ââdream up strategies for suc- 
cessââ at night, like for how to best climb obstacles, like rocks, 
thatitfaced during theday.95Evidence forthis sortof hypothesis 
isthatthereisaformofneuralââpre-playââwhereinthesequences 
ofactivitypredict futurebehavior oftheanimal andindicateplan- 
ning or pre-processing,96,97although this effect may simply be 
because animals are forced to use a limited set of preconf i gured 
i ring sequences to represent the world.98,99In a similar manner 
to the replay results, it is also likely that most of the time pre-play 
is not the actual specif i c future sequences of activity, and that 
most sequences are never instantiated during wake. Perhaps 
the simplest and most direct hypothesis is that dreams allow 
for avoidance practice of dangerous situations, such as running 
from a predator, that would be impossible to practice in real life 
without immense risk.100However, this is contradicted by the 
fact that only a small percentage of dreams contain this sort of 
behavior (even when def i ning threats incredibly broadly), and in 
those that do realistic plans of actions in these scenarios are 
rarelyactuallyimplemented.101,102Yetdespitetheunrealisticna- 
ture of dreams, it may be that exploring unlikely or weak associ- 
ations has psychological benef i ts.103 
Another hypothesis is the idea that dreams are actually for 
ref i ningtheabilitytocreatesimulationsthemselves.ThisââInSimââ 
hypothesis, which specif i cally is a hypothesis about the dreams 
of young children, posits that dreams are chances to create sim- 
ulations and then test their predictions against the real world 
upon waking.104,105However, this only applies to young children 
(with the assumption that the few studies are correct that chil- 
drenâs dreams are more ââboringââ than adult dreams), since, as 
theauthorsthemselvespointout,adult dreamswouldbeconsis- 
tently invalidated by daily events. Indeed, the phenomenology of 
dreams as sparse and hallucinatory and fabulist make it unlikely 
that strategies or abilities or preparations that originate in 
dreams work at all in the real world. 
However, these types of theories are likely right to view 
dreams as simulations. Yet according to the OBH the purpose 
of these simulations is not to ref i ne a particular ability or strategy 
or plan of action, which is what simulations normally are for. 
Instead, the purpose is to provide ââout-of-distributionââ simula- 
tions specif i cally to prevent overf i tting and improve generaliza- 
tion, wherein overf i tting is essentially an unavoidable issue 
brought about by daily learning and therefore a constant threat 
to the brainâs performance on various tasks.ChatGPTChatGPTThe paper further explores other contemporary theories regarding the purpose of dreams and critically evaluates them in light of the Overfitted Brain Hypothesis (OBH).Dreams for Selective Forgetting (Reverse Learning): Francis Crick and Graeme Mitchinson's hypothesis of 'reverse learning' suggests that dreams help the brain 'unlearn' undesirable connections. This hypothesis aligns with the idea of synaptic down-scaling to prevent overfitting. Recent computational modeling in spiking neural networks supports the usefulness of reverse learning. However, the OBH differs by focusing on how corrupted inputs or top-down noise improve generalization rather than the specific destruction of memories.Dreams as Preparation for Real-World Problems: This theory posits that dreams are rehearsals for real-world challenges or creative problem-solving. It includes hypotheses like genetic programming, proto-conscious states for waking behavior preparation, and the InSim hypothesis for children. These theories suggest that dreams are simulations to refine abilities, strategies, or plans. However, the unreal nature of dreams often contradicts the practical application of these strategies in real life.OBH and Dreams as Simulations: The paper acknowledges that dreams might indeed be simulations, but according to the OBH, their purpose is not to refine specific abilities or plans. Instead, dreams provide 'out-of-distribution' simulations to prevent overfitting and enhance generalization. This is seen as a constant necessity due to the brain's daily learning processes.In conclusion, the paper argues that while various theories propose different functions for dreams - from memory consolidation to reverse learning to preparation for real-world challenges - none completely align with the unique phenomenology of dreams. The OBH offers a more comprehensive explanation, positing that dreams help prevent cognitive overfitting by introducing varied, unusual, and out-of-distribution experiences, thereby enhancing the brain's generalizability and flexibility in processing information.YouDreams benef i t predictive processing by ref i ning 
generative models 
Predictive processing isthe view thatthe brain continuously tries 
to predict its own future states in relation to extrinsic sensory 
input.106,107In a predictive processing framework, predictions 
traverse in a top-down fashion, while sensory input occurs in a 
bottom-up fashion. Predictions are then compared with inputs, 
with the goal of minimizing prediction errors, which corresponds to improving the brainâs predictions about its own future states. 
Prediction error can be minimized by changes in action and 
behavior, a process called ââactive inference.ââ108 
Predictive processing has become a popular lens through 
which to view cognitive science,109and has origins in work on 
Helmholtz machines, statistical inference, and the ââwake-sleep 
algorithm.ââ110Note the proposal of the wake-sleep algorithm 
for unsupervised learning goes back 25 years,111which are 
effectively a precursor to the contemporary notion of an au- 
toencoder. 
Despite its origins in the i eld of machine learning, the predic- 
tiveprocessingapproachiscontroversial dueto itsclaimsof uni- 
versality: it is unclear that the cortex actually functions primarily 
to generate predictions about its own future state.112Further- 
more, there are fundamental criticisms about whether mini- 
mizing prediction error via actions is actually a theoretically 
coherent goal for a universal principle. For instance, why would 
an organism not go sit in a ââdark roomââ in order to minimize its 
prediction errors, since it would always know what to expect?113 
Multiple views of dreams in the light of predictive processing 
has been put forward114arguing for specif i c neurophysiological 
correlates and mechanisms. In general, in suchtheories the phe- 
nomenology of dreams is accounted for bythe breakdown of the 
perception-action loop during dreaming: essentially the brainâs 
activity is dominated by its ââpriorsââ rather than bottom-up input. 
Some predictive processing proponents have put forward views 
that the role of dreams isnot actually to test inferences about ac- 
tions, but to improve a hypothesized generative model (in this 
context a model used by brain to make predictions), specif i cally 
by reducing this generative modelâs complexity by pruning 
redundant synapses.115According to this hypothesis, the pro- 
posed evolved purposeof dreaming duringREM sleepisto mini- 
mize the free energy of the brain. Free energy is essentially the 
complexityofthebrainâsmodelminustheaccuracyofthebrainâs 
predictions about its own states, and therefore reducing model 
complexity is important for minimizing free energy. Specif i cally, 
the hypothesis put forward in Hobson and Friston115is that syn- 
aptic pruning (of the kind proposed in SHY during slow wave 
sleep)31can help minimize model complexity (and therefore 
help minimize the free energy) since overall parameters of a 
model are reduced when synapses are pruned. However, SHY 
actually specif i es that there is a net reduction of synaptic weight 
specif i cally so that waking activity is generally unaffected by this 
change, and additionally it is also specif i cally associated with 
NREM and slow wave sleep rather than REM and dreaming. It 
is worth noting that down-scaling in general and its effects on 
model complexity and minimization of error, even the possibility 
of this occurring during REM, had been previously pro- 
posed,88,89asdiscussed in thesectionââDreams arefor selective 
forgetting.ââ 
In Hobson and colleagues,116a further related hypothesis 
without reference to synaptic pruning or down-scaling was intro- 
duced based on the idea that, according to the free energy prin- 
ciple, the brain is continuously trying to better predict its own 
future states. Therefore when the brain lacks bottom-up sensory 
input (i.e., during dreaming) the brain is still compelled to mini- 
mize free energy, meaning that the model complexity must 
implicitly be reduced since any prediction errors can stem only 
from internal consistency of the model rather than inconsis- 
tencies with the outside world. According to this view ââ . we 
propose that REM sleep is an occasion for reiterating and opti- 
mizing a generative model of the embodied self with reference 
to waking experience.ââ116However, in general, predictive pro- 
cessingandparticularlyactiveinferenceapproachesto 
dreaming face a problem: in the vast majority of dreams agency 
is actually minimized, not maximized (a view supported by the 
decreasedcontributionofprefrontalareasduring 
dreaming).117,118That is, dreams are not ââcausal playgroundsââ 
wherein the outcomes of actions are continuously tested against 
the perceptions they generate. This may be the case of lucid 
dreaming, but lucid dreaming accounts for a small minority of 
dreams.119 
Outside of relying on the assumption that the goal of the brain 
is always to minimize free energy and that actions are conse- 
quential in dreams in the same way they are in wake, another 
particular concern about the hypothesis is that dreams, given 
their phenomenology as fabulist and hallucinatory, do not 
seemverygoodcandidatesforminimizingthesurpriseofpredic- 
tions created by a gestalt generative model (let alone a model of 
the ââembodied selfââ). For instance, if dreams were about 
creating optimal prior beliefs or improving a modelâs self-consis- 
tency by minimizing input-less prediction errors (as in Hobson 
and colleagues116), the consequence would be that dreams 
should become less surprising throughout development as 
input-less prediction error is minimized. This process should 
lead to the generative model becoming more internally consis- 
tent, more parsimonious, tame, and therefore more like the 
waking world, both over development and over a given nightâs 
sleep. Yet this is precisely the opposite of what empirical data 
show, wherein dreams of children are self-reported as static 
and uninteresting and become more interesting and surprising 
across development.120Indeed, there is no evidence that 
dreams become optimized for a lack of surprise or for internal 
consistency over time. While the world may become more pre- 
dictable over a lifetime, dreams do not. This same sort of criti- 
cism can be applied to the suggestion that the purpose of sleep 
is actually to implement the wake-sleep algorithm itself.121In 
addition, this idea faces a number of other problems, such as 
thefactthewake-sleepalgorithmisonlyforaspecif i cformofun- 
supervised learning that trains a generative model and the brain 
obviously does much more than that. Furthermore, implement- 
ing the wake-sleep algorithm requires several assumptions 
that are not biologically realistic, like training solely feedforward 
or feedback connections at different times. 
However, it should be stressed that the background advan- 
tage posited by this approach to dreaming is its effect on model 
complexity,whichissimilartothefocusoftheOBH,sincereduc- 
tions in model complexity in machine learning are generally 
associated with a reduction in overf i tting. It is also worth noting 
thatthefreeenergyprincipleapproachtodreamingishighlyspe- 
cif i cinhowthisisaccomplishedbytheminimizationoferrorsina 
generative modelâs predictions of itself without inputs, rather 
than via how corrupted or stochastic inputs assist generalization 
as in the OBH. This provides evidence that the concerns of the 
OBH, although not the OBH itself, can be motivated by diverse 
takes on brain function (further discussed in ââDreams are for se- 
lective forgettingââ and the Discussion). Indeed, the OBH could 
possibly be thought of as a generalization of the issue model complexity plays in predictive processing to all of learning and 
performance instead of a just for a specif i c self-model, and 
without relying on an assumed drive to minimization prediction 
errors as the mechanism of action (and therefore the OBH 
does not share the consequences of this drive like dreams 
becoming unsurprising over time). However, the OBH can be 
motivated entirely independently by common practices in deep 
learning, their resemblance to dream phenomenology, and the 
similar challenges the brain faces during its daily learning to 
those of training a neural network.ChatGPTChatGPTThe paper discusses the role of dreams in predictive processing and the refinement of generative models, examining how these theories align with the Overfitted Brain Hypothesis (OBH).Predictive Processing Framework: Predictive processing posits that the brain continuously tries to predict its future states in relation to sensory input, aiming to minimize prediction errors. This approach has gained traction in cognitive science, drawing from concepts like Helmholtz machines and the wake-sleep algorithm in machine learning.Criticism and Controversy: Predictive processing is controversial due to its claims of universality and the theoretical coherence of minimizing prediction error as a universal principle. Critics question why an organism would not simply reduce stimulus to minimize prediction errors (e.g., sitting in a dark room).Dreams and Predictive Processing: Some theories suggest that during dreams, the brain operates predominantly on its priors, without bottom-up input. A hypothesis is that dreaming during REM sleep aims to minimize the brain's free energy, possibly through synaptic pruning to reduce model complexity. However, this is more commonly associated with NREM and slow wave sleep rather than REM and dreaming.Challenges to the Predictive Processing Approach: The predictive processing approach to dreaming, including the free energy principle, faces challenges. Dreams often lack agency, contradicting the idea that they are causal playgrounds for testing outcomes of actions. Additionally, the hallucinatory and fabulist nature of dreams seems at odds with the goal of minimizing prediction errors and refining a model of the 'embodied self'.Contrast with OBH: The OBH aligns with the idea that reductions in model complexity can reduce overfitting. However, the OBH is distinct in that it focuses on how corrupted or stochastic inputs assist generalization, rather than minimizing errors in a generative modelâs predictions. The OBH can be viewed as a broader application of these principles to the brain's learning processes, independent of the specific mechanisms proposed by predictive processing theories.In summary, while predictive processing theories provide interesting perspectives on the function of dreams, they face challenges in explaining the unique phenomenology of dreams. The OBH offers a more comprehensive explanation, suggesting that dreams help in preventing cognitive overfitting by introducing varied and unusual experiences, thereby enhancing the brain's ability to generalize and process information flexibly.YouTHE OVERFITTED BRAIN HYPOTHESIS 
As technology advances, science often appropriates new tech- 
nologies for metaphors that help understand complex sys- 
tems.122This has been particularly true of neuroscience. In the 
pastdecadeithasbecomeapparentthattherearemanylessons 
for neuroscience to be taken from brain-inspired deep neural 
nets (DNNs), which offer a different framework for thinking about 
learningthanstandardcomputerarchitectures.DNNsarefarand 
away the only successful analog to human intelligence on com- 
plex tasks, and they tend to develop brain-like connectivity and 
representational properties, like grid-cells, shape-tuning, and vi- 
sual illusions.123One of the most signif i cant differences between 
DNNsandthebrainisthatupdatingofsynapticweights inaccor- 
dance with the backpropagation of errors has traditionally been 
looked on as biologically unrealistic. Yet new research reveals 
that the brain may implement core features of backpropagation, 
with viable candidates like neural gradient representation by ac- 
tivity differences.124 
Therefore, there is good reason for neuroscience to look to 
deep learning for inspiration, since both are systems that 
perform complex tasks via the updating of weights within an 
astronomically large parameter space. It is clear that the chal- 
lengesthebrainandDNNsfaceduringlearningandperformance 
on complex tasks overlap signif i cantly. Notably, one of the most 
ubiquitouschallenges DNNsface isatrade-off betweengeneral- 
ization and memorization, wherein as they learn to i t one partic- 
ular dataset, they can become less generalizable to others. This 
overf i tting is identif i able when performance on the training set 
begins to differentiate from performance on the testing set. An 
omnipresent problem within the deep learning community, solu- 
tions to overf i tting in DNNs most often comes in the form of a 
noise injection, such as making input datasets corrupted and 
therefore less self-similar.125Perhaps the most common explicit 
technique to prevent overf i tting is dropout, which is mathemati- 
cally the injection of noise and the corruption of input during 
learning.126Notably the more self-similar or biased your sam- 
pling of training data is, the more overf i tting will be an issue. 
The brain faces these challenges as it learns, since what anor- 
ganism experiences every day can be highly self-similar and 
biased in its sampling of the environment. The OBH states that 
dreams offer a biologically realistic âânoise injection.ââ Specif- 
ically, there is good evidence that dreams are based on the sto- 
chastic percolation of signals through the hierarchical structure 
of the cortex, activating the default-mode network.127Note 
that there is growing evidence that most of these signals origi- 
nate in a top-down manner,128meaning that the ââcorrupted in- 
putsââ will bear statistical similarities to the models and represen- 
tations of the brain. In other words, they are derived from a 
stochastic exploration of the hierarchical structure of the brain. 
This leads to the kind of structured hallucinations that are com- 
mon during dreams. 
The hallucinogenic, category-breaking, and fabulist quality of 
dreams means they are extremely different from the ââtraining 
setââ of the animal (i.e., their daily experiences). The diurnal cycle 
of i tting to tasks during the day, and avoiding overf i tting at night 
via a semi-random walk of experiences, may be viewed as a kind 
of ââsimulated annealingââ129in the brain. That is, it is the very 
strangeness of dreams in their divergence from waking experi- 
ence that gives them their biological function. 
To sum up: the OBH conceptualizes dreams as a form of pur- 
posefully corrupted input, likely derived from noise injected into 
the hierarchical structure of the brain, causing feedback to 
generate warped or ââcorruptedââ sensory input. The overall 
evolved purpose of this stochastic activity is to prevent overf i t- 
ting. This overf i tting may be within a particular module or task 
such a specif i c brain region or network, and may also involve 
generalization to out-of-distribution (unseen) novel stimuli. As 
will be discussed, the OBH i ts well with the disparate known 
data about dreams, such as their physiological origin in the 
form of noise that creates ââcorrupted featuresââ via neuromodu- 
latory inf l uences, their role in learning, and their importance for 
problem solving and creativity. However, most importantly, it 
does not consider dreams as epiphenomena generated by 
some background process, and it also accounts for, and is moti- 
vated by, the actual phenomenology of dreams themselves. The 
sparseness of dreams comes from the ââdropoutââ of bottom-up 
inputs since they are driven solely by feedback activity, their 
hallucinatory nature comes from the higher-up stochastic origin 
which means they are purposeful corrupted or warped away 
from the daily ââtraining setââ the organism normally experiences, 
and their narrative nature from the top-down genesis of dreams 
sincethebrainunderstands reality inthe formofevents andstor- 
ies. That is, according to the OBH, the distinct phenomenology 
of dreams exists to maximize their effectiveness at improving 
generalization and combating mere memorization of an organ- 
isms day. The evidence for the OBH, as well as more details 
about its distinguishing claims, are overviewed in the following 
section.ChatGPTChatGPTThe Overfitted Brain Hypothesis (OBH) is presented as a novel explanation for the purpose of dreams, drawing parallels between the challenges faced by deep neural networks (DNNs) and the human brain in learning and generalization.Inspiration from Deep Learning: The OBH draws inspiration from the field of deep learning, where DNNs face the challenge of balancing generalization with memorization. In DNNs, overfitting occurs when a model performs well on training data but poorly on unseen data. This is addressed through techniques like noise injection, which introduces variability into the learning process, preventing the model from becoming too narrowly tailored to the training set.Brain's Learning Challenges: Similar to DNNs, the human brain encounters the challenge of overfitting. Daily experiences can be highly self-similar and biased, leading to overfitting in cognitive processes. The OBH suggests that dreams serve as a biological mechanism for noise injection, helping the brain to avoid overfitting.Mechanism of Dreams in OBH: Dreams are conceptualized as stochastic activities that create 'corrupted' or altered sensory inputs, derived from the hierarchical structure of the brain. This stochasticity leads to the unique characteristics of dreams - their hallucinogenic, category-breaking, and fabulist qualities.Biological Function of Dreams: The OBH posits that the strangeness of dreams, their divergence from daily experiences, is key to their biological function. Dreams act as a form of 'simulated annealing', providing a balance between fitting tasks during the day and avoiding overfitting at night.Phenomenology of Dreams and OBH: The OBH accounts for the phenomenology of dreams - their sparseness, hallucinatory nature, and narrative structure. Dreams are sparse due to the dropout of bottom-up inputs, hallucinatory due to their stochastic, top-down origin, and narrative in nature because the brain interprets reality through events and stories.Evidence and Implications of OBH: The OBH aligns with known data about dreams, including their physiological origins, role in learning, and importance for problem-solving and creativity. Importantly, it does not view dreams as epiphenomena but as integral to the brain's learning and generalization processes.In summary, the OBH offers an innovative perspective on the purpose of dreams, suggesting that they function to prevent cognitive overfitting by introducing varied and unusual experiences. This hypothesis provides a comprehensive explanation for the distinct phenomenology of dreams and aligns with current understanding of neural processes and learning mechanisms.YouEvidence from neuroscience 
What is the evidence for the OBH from traditional methods of 
neuroscience? It is worth focusing not on all the studies avail- 
able, but those that distinguish the OBH from the theory that 
dreams are correlated (in some unspecif i ed way) with learning. 
In human behavioral experiments, there is good supporting 
evidence for the OBH specif i cally. First, the most effective 
means of triggering dreams that contain partial similarities to 
real-lifeeventsisthroughrepetitiveovertrainingonatask.Exam- 
plesofthisincludeextensiveplayingofgameslikeTetris80orski- 
simulators,130which led to dreams involving the learned task, 
although not specif i c repetitions or replays of memories. Put 
another way: the surest way to trigger dreams about a real-world 
event is to perform a task repetitively during the day, preferably 
one that is novel. Under the OBH, the explanation for this effect, 
as well asthe specif i cs of the benef i ts of dreaming, is clearly out- 
lined. Overtraining on a novel task creates the condition of the brain being overf i tted to the task, which then triggers nightly 
dreams attempting to generalize performance on the task. Evi- 
dence of dreaming about tasks specif i cally improving daily per- 
formance on those tasks can be found for things like mirror 
tracing131and reading with inverted goggles on.132Even driving 
cars seems correlated to dreams about driving.75It is likely 
therefore there is a homeostatic component to the OBH wherein 
different modules, processes, or systems within the brain 
become overf i tted from usage, which are then most likely to 
trigger dreams involving those modules. If so, neurons involved 
in recent learning would be most affected by overf i tting. In this 
way the OBH can account for many of the statistical ââreplayââ re- 
sultssincethoseneuronsthatsawsynapticchangesinresponse 
learning are most affected by the regularization of dreaming, and 
since exact sequence replication is rare and most ââreplayââ is 
actually never-before-seen i ring patterns.69 
Another line of evidence for the OBH is that in humans there is 
evidence of task-dependency when it comes to whether sleep 
improves learning. For adult humans, perceptual tasks showed 
little to no learning increase from sleep wherein cognitive tasks 
showed signif i cant gains from learning.133Since it is likely that 
adult humans already have well-f i tted perceptual models, we 
should expect complex cognitive tasks to trigger more gain 
from an increase in generalizability. While dream reports are 
actually less common in young children, particularly below the 
age of 7, from what can be gleaned, childrenâs dreams are 
much more static and perceptual, focusing on individual scenes 
rather than full narratives or events, indicating that perceptual 
systems are likely still being reorganized during dreams.120 
Meanwhile newborns exhibit ââactive sleep,ââ their version of 
REM,for50%oftheir16to18hofdailysleep,perhapsindicating 
that early perceptual models are in constant danger of over- 
i tting. 
The OBH is also supported by evidence that sleep does not 
simply improve memory directly, but affects some aspects of 
memory more than others. For instance, in a word association 
test, direct associations, the equivalent of pure memorization, 
did not benef i t that much from a nightâs sleep, while word asso- 
ciations were better able to resist interfering associations.134 
This indicates again that memorization is least affected by sleep, 
but generalized performance is most affected. This holds true 
even in infants, wherein sleep iscorrelated withincreased gener- 
alization and abstraction abilities.135,136 
In addition, there is evidence from behavioral studies that 
overtraining on a texture-discrimination task leads to decreased 
performance on it,and thatsleepspecif i cally, aboveand beyond 
the passage of time, rescues this performance.137This i ts with 
anecdotal reports of plateauing in terms of performance on a 
task, like a video game, only to sleep and have increased perfor- 
mance the next day. 
There is also the long-standing traditional association be- 
tween dreams and creativity, a rich literature. Anecdotal re- 
ports about dreams and creativity are supported by careful 
studies of how sleep improves abstraction and reasoning on 
tasks.138,139This i ts directly with the OBH, since an increase 
in generalization would directly lead to more insights in com- 
plex problems, or better performance on cognitive tasks that 
require creativity. Indeed, it explains the link between crea- 
tivity and dreaming better than the hypotheses that dreaming 
is for the integration of new with old memories, the replay of 
memories, or their storage. 
Finally, it might be argued that it is a problem for the OBH that 
dreams are generally amnesiac, with explicit memory a rarity 
during dreams. Would it not be strange then that the content of 
dreams have any effect on the abilities of a neural network? 
Here, an important distinction should be made between access- 
ing explicit declarative memories and the general fact that 
learning involves changes to synapses. For instance, the amne- 
siac effect during sleep may due to prefrontal inhibition. Just as 
prefrontal cortex inhibition means that dreams are not recogniz- 
able as dreams when they are occurring, it may be that the same 
inhibition makes it diff i cult to recall in the sense of cognitive ac- 
cess.21Anecdotal evidence from those with dream journals sug- 
gests that paying attention to dreams makes them easier to 
remember, lending credence to this hypothesis.12In addition, 
sudden-waking experiments show that dream content is com- 
mon and recallable. Likely the effects of not being able to either 
form or access episodic memories of all dreams at the end of the 
night are due to the neuromodulatory milieu during sleep. 
Supporting theOBHisevidence indicating thatdreamslead to 
synaptic changes in the connectivity of the brain, albeit likely this 
is not as strongly as waking experience, with episodic memory 
storage signif i cantly reduced. What is the evidence that synap- 
ses change during sleep? Proponents of SHY have argued that 
there is evidence that synapses change during sleep in the 
form of synaptic homeostasis, regularization which occurs every 
night in the form of universal down-scaling of synaptic 
strength.32However, this has been challenged by the observa- 
tion of potentiation during sleep.140In general it appears that 
whether there is net potentiation or depression during waking 
dependsonthetask,141indicatingthatlearninginvolvessynaptic 
plasticity in both directions in both wake and sleep.142If during 
dreams synapses are indeed still plastic, then dreams can leave 
a synaptic trace that can affect performance. However, it should 
be noted that as of yet there is no strong empirical evidence that 
the content of dreams can lead to synaptic changes and learning 
as the content of waking experience does, and this is difficult to explore experimentally.ChatGPTChatGPTThe evidence supporting the Overfitted Brain Hypothesis (OBH) from traditional neuroscience methods is multifaceted, highlighting several key findings:Triggering Dreams with Repetitive Tasks: Studies show that repetitive overtraining on tasks like playing Tetris or ski simulators leads to dreams involving the learned task, but not specific replays of memories. This supports the OBH, suggesting that overtraining creates a condition of overfitting, which then triggers dreams attempting to generalize performance on the task.Task-Dependent Learning Improvements: Research indicates that sleep improves learning more for complex cognitive tasks than for perceptual tasks in adults. This aligns with the OBH, which posits that cognitive tasks, being less well-fitted than perceptual models in adults, would benefit more from increased generalizability through dreaming.Children's Dreams and Development: Dreams in young children are more static and perceptual, focusing on individual scenes rather than narratives. This might indicate that their perceptual systems are being reorganized during dreams. Newborns' high proportion of active sleep could suggest a need for constant reorganization to avoid overfitting in early perceptual models.Sleep and Memory Generalization: Behavioral studies show that sleep does not simply improve memory directly but affects aspects of memory differently. For instance, sleep helps resist interfering associations in word association tests, indicating a generalization of performance rather than mere memorization.Overtraining and Sleep's Rescue of Performance: Overtraining on a task can lead to decreased performance, which is rescued by sleep. This fits the idea of performance plateauing due to overfitting and subsequent improvement through dreaming.Dreams and Creativity: The long-standing association between dreams and creativity is supported by studies showing that sleep improves abstraction and reasoning. This is consistent with the OBH, as an increase in generalization would enhance insights and creativity.Amnesiac Nature of Dreams: While dreams are often not explicitly remembered, the distinction between accessing declarative memories and changes to synapses is important. Sleep may inhibit prefrontal cortex activity, affecting dream recall, but this does not negate the synaptic changes that occur during dreams.Synaptic Changes During Sleep: Evidence suggests that synapses change during sleep, supporting the concept of synaptic homeostasis. The exact nature of these changes (potentiation or depression) may depend on the task and indicate that learning involves synaptic plasticity in both directions during wake and sleep.In conclusion, the evidence from neuroscience supports the OBH by illustrating how dreams, triggered by overfitting through repetitive tasks or novel experiences, serve to generalize and improve cognitive performance. Dreams appear to contribute to synaptic plasticity, enhancing generalizability and creativity, which aligns with the concept of dreams as a biological mechanism for noise injection to combat overfitting.Youexplore experimentally. 
Evidence from deep learning 
Oneof themostsignif i cant, andubiquitous, challenges anydeep 
neural network faces is the ability to generalize beyond the data- 
set it has been trained on, that is, to avoid simply memorizing the 
dataset. There has been signif i cant effort in the past decade by 
the deep learning community to develop methods and tech- 
niques to avoid overf i tting on particular datasets and, at the 
broadest level, to allow for extrapolation to never-before-seen 
datasets. This section overviews three commonly used such 
techniques within deep learning (and research into artif i cial neu- 
ral networks generally). Notably, each of these three techniques 
embodies some phenomenological property of dreams and also 
i ts with what is known about the neurophysiology of dreaming. 
The i rst technique is the data augmentation method of 
dropout, perhaps the most widely used technique for preventing 
overf i ttingindeeplearning.143Dropoutoccursduringthetraining 
of a network, when inputs are made sparse by randomly ââdrop- 
ping outââ some of them, a form of regularization during learning 
which is mathematically similar to a noise injection.126It is

Review 
important to note that dreams resemble dropout in their spare- 
ness, as they do not contain as much perceptual information, 
or details in general, as waking experiences. For example, 
phones are generally unusable in dreams because there is not 
enough phenomenological detail to support such small icons 
and text. This likely increases the salience of relevant features 
while minimizing irrelevant features, assisting in generalization 
by making representations more robust and invariant, since 
one reason dropout is successful is that it acts like an averaging 
effect over different models the data could be drawn from. 
Dreams are a lesser or weakened state of conscious experience 
because of this dropping out of bottom-up stimuli, lacking much 
ofthedetail of wakingconsciousexperiences. This,according to 
the OBH, actually assists, rather than hinders, their function. 
The second technique that supports the OBH is the method of 
domain randomization used in training DNNs. In domain 
randomization, the inputs during learning are âârandomizedââ in 
the sense of being warped or corrupted in particular ways. This 
can drastically assist with learning and generalization. Paradox- 
ically, simulating hallucinatory inputs rather than learning off of 
real inputs helps deep neural networks learn real-world tasks.144 
Domainrandomizationhashavebeenusedincutting-edgetech- 
niques in deep learning, such as being necessary for having a 
DNN solve a Rubikâs Cube using a robot hand.145Domain 
randomization resembles the hallucinatory quality of dreams in 
that dreams depart signif i cantly from normal experiences, as if 
they have been randomly drawn from a varied set of different 
domains. 
The third common practice in deep learning that has ties to 
dreaming is the use of some generative model to expand the 
training set of the neural network, which can assist in learning 
various tasks. Generative models lie behind the success of 
generative adversarial networks (GANs) and other techniques 
that allow for cutting-edge performance on complex tasks us- 
ing sets of feedforward networks that anticipate the otherâs 
output.146It is worth noting that GANs and others often pro- 
ducenotoriouslydream-likefabulistoutputs.147Indeed, 
recently an external generative model that created ââdream- 
likeââ input helped train a DNN to produce the code behind a 
given mathematical mapping.148It has been shown that input 
created from a generative model can indeed assist with 
learning, such as preventing catastrophic forgetting.149It 
should be noted that in most these cases the generative 
model exists outside the network itself, which is not biologi- 
cally realistic in the case of the brain, although there are 
some exceptions.150What of those cases where the network 
itself acts the generative model? This is much closer to the 
case of the dreaming brain. In networks that are not purely 
feedforward or have external models that can be manipulated 
by experimenters, the stimulation of higher layers (generally 
through the injection of noise) can lead to patterns of activity 
in the lower layers that recapitulate the statistical properties of 
inputs, as if the network were being stimulated from the bot- 
tom-up from imaginary sources (this is similar to the wake- 
sleep algorithm discussed in ââDreams benef i t predictive pro- 
cessing by ref i ning generative modelsââ). This is likely the 
case in the brain, wherein stochastic activity high in the hier- 
archy of brain regions creates hallucinatory patterns of inputs 
via feedback connections. 
Indeed, it is likely the case that dreams are indeed a result of 
noise in the brainâs hierarchical structure that traverses its feed- 
back connectivity, which i ts with the evidence that dreams are 
ââtop-down.ââ151This further i ts with evidence that dreaming 
drawn from the brainâs model of the world becomes more narra- 
tive and complex over time, particularly during adolescence.152 
By adulthood, dreams take on the narrative structure of human 
cognition wherein stories and metaphors and events make up 
the core function of thought.153Since narratives are the way by 
which human brains understand the world,154stochastic stimu- 
lation of the hierarchical structure of the brain produces narra- 
tives, which act as hallucinatory and sparse bottom-up input 
for learning, thus combating overf i tting and improving general- 
ization. In this way they are a direct expansion of the normal 
ââtraining setââ of an animal, since narratives and events are 
how conscious perception itself proceeds and understands the 
world.155 
The OBH claims that dreams resemble a combination of these 
three techniques: a sparse, corrupted, or randomized set of sen- 
sory inputs, which are likely created by feedback exploiting the 
hierarchical nature of the brain as a generative model, and the 
purpose of these experiences is to expand and regularize the 
limitedandbiasedââtrainingsetââoftheorganismtopreventover- 
i tting. Of course, the precise implementation of these tech- 
niques (such as their combined nature) must be different for 
the brain than in deep learning research. This is because the 
brain faces many challenges that artif i cial neural networks do 
not.Anyorganismthatimplemented dropoutordomainrandom- 
ization during its daily learning would face serious survival is- 
sues. Therefore, in order to increase generality and avoid overf i t- 
ting and pure memorization of waking sensory input a dedicated 
off l ine period is needed. Sleep, possibly having originally 
evolved for other housekeeping reasons, is the perfect time. 
Overall, the overlap between the phenomenology of dreams 
and common methods in the i eld of deep learning for mitigating 
overf i tting, avoiding pure memorization, and assisting general- 
ization lend credence to the idea that the evolved function of 
dreaming is for precisely these purposes.ChatGPTChatGPTThe Overfitted Brain Hypothesis (OBH) finds significant support from the field of deep learning, particularly in the techniques used to prevent overfitting in deep neural networks (DNNs). These techniques in DNNs parallel the phenomenological properties of dreams and align with known neurophysiological aspects of dreaming.Dropout as Data Augmentation: Dropout, a common technique in deep learning, involves randomly omitting some inputs during training. This regularization method is similar to the sparseness of dreams, where not all perceptual information or details present in waking experiences are included. This sparseness in dreams may increase the salience of relevant features and assist in generalization.Domain Randomization: In domain randomization, inputs during learning are altered or corrupted, which enhances the ability of DNNs to generalize and learn real-world tasks. This mirrors the hallucinatory quality of dreams, where experiences diverge significantly from normal waking experiences.Generative Models Expanding Training Set: Generative models, like those used in Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs), expand the training set of a neural network, which can prevent catastrophic forgetting and aid learning. In the brain, this is analogous to dreams being generated by higher-level neural activity that creates patterns in lower layers, resembling the statistical properties of inputs.Dreams as Top-Down Feedback: Dreams are likely a result of noise in the brainâs hierarchical structure that traverses its feedback connectivity, fitting with the evidence that dreams are generated in a 'top-down' manner. This aligns with the method in DNNs where stimulation of higher layers can create input-like patterns in lower layers.Narrative Structure of Dreams: The narrative structure of dreams in adults resembles the way human cognition understands the world through stories and events. In DNNs, this can be paralleled with the generation of complex, narrative-like outputs from higher-level noise stimulation.Purpose of Dreams in OBH: According to the OBH, dreams combine these deep learning techniques by providing sparse, corrupted, or randomized sensory inputs created by feedback exploiting the brainâs hierarchical nature. The purpose is to expand the organism's limited and biased 'training set' and prevent overfitting.Implementation Differences Between Brain and DNNs: While the brain and DNNs share similarities in addressing overfitting, their implementations differ due to the unique challenges each faces. The brain uses sleep as an offline period to implement these techniques, which would be impractical or harmful during waking hours for an organism.In conclusion, the parallels between methods used in deep learning to mitigate overfitting and the properties of dreams lend support to the OBH. It suggests that the evolved function of dreaming is to prevent overfitting in the brain, enhancing generalization and avoiding pure memorization of daily experiences.YouPREDICTIONS 
The OBH puts together several lines of investigation under one 
roof by being explicit about asking how generalization during 
learning can benef i t from dreams. This involves understanding 
how dreams can help overcome an organismâs reliance on 
memorizing just a dayâs events, which is often highly statistically 
biased.Thetheorymakesanumberofspecif i cpredictionswhich 
can be pursued both experimentally as well as theoretically.

Experimental validation 
Experimental investigation of the OBH within neuroscience can 
consist of several components. Under the OBH, much of the 
benefit of dreaming is in the realm of generalizability not memorization per se, and this can be differentiated with well-designed 
behavioral tests. Forexample,itmaybethatdirectmeasurement 
of overf i tting is possible in humans. This may include the training 
of subjects on overly repetitious tasks in order to ensure the con- 
dition of overf i tting. It may also include using similar techniques

Review 
as those within deep learning to test for generalization of per- 
formance. 
In animal models there have not been explicit attempts to 
separate out the difference between pure memorization and 
generalization, and the effect of sleep deprivation on each. Ac- 
cording to the OBH, memorization should be less affected by 
sleep deprivation than generalization. Therefore, using mouse 
models of things like context fear generalization156could be 
examined under conditions of sleep deprivation or, if possible, 
dream deprivation. Beyond behavioral predictions and subse- 
quent studies, there is also the possibility of attempting to track 
synaptic plasticity in response to dreams. This may include 
things like tracking changes in dendritic spine morphology dur- 
ing REM, such have been used to track spine morphology 
changes during sleep to investigate SHY.157 
Notably, the sort of cognitive l exibility and generalization the 
OBH claims is the purpose of dreams is highly important for 
workers and those in the armed forces who sometimes operate 
under sleep deprivation during critical periods, which can lead to 
increased accident rates,158and has a signif i cant monetary 
annual impact.159If it is true that sleep-deprived brains are over- 
i tted, they will be prone to make errors in stereotypical ways. 
Thus it may be easier to know what types of mistakes will be 
made by individuals operating in sleep-deprived states and in 
response build more robust fail-safes. 
Furthermore, the OBH predicts there may be the possibility of 
dream substitutions: dream-like stimuli that are artif i cially gener- 
ated to have the properties of dreams, and therefore have a 
similar ameliorative effect on overf i tting. Such dream substitu- 
tions, delivered via virtual reality (VR) or even video, might pro- 
videasimpleyeteffectivemeansfordelayingsomeofsleepdep- 
rivationâs cognitive defects. For example, it may be that a pilot 
whohas beenf l yingfor alongperiod oftimeisbeginning toover- 
i t to their task, and a quick but intense exposure to an entirely 
different sort of visual stimulus (like a dream-like nature scene 
in VR) could stave off some of the effects of sleep deprivation. 
The impact of substitutions can be examined both behaviorally 
but also at the neurophysiological level of REM rebound.160 
Theoretical validation 
The OBH has consequences not just for neuroscience, but also 
for the i eld of deep learning. This is particularly true of biologi- 
cally realistic models, like large-scale thalamocortical spiking- 
neuron models, which have previously been used to investigate 
the development of cortical connectivity and its effect on slow 
waves.161It is likely that biologically realistic spiking neurons 
that are still trainable in the manner of DNNs162can be used to 
explore the benef i ts of dreams directly. In such a cortical model, 
neuromodulation can be used to be intersperse training with pe- 
riods that mimic sleep stages, cycling i rst through the real input 
of its training set, and then hallucinatory corrupted input gener- 
ated from its top-down connections. This should prevent or 
delay overf i tting. 
What sort of stochastic biases allow for dreams to warp input 
data in a way that is most eff i cient for avoiding overf i tting? If the 
OBH is correct, then the sparse and hallucinatory nature of 
dreams suggests that we should expect warping of input distri- 
butions thatsuccessfully combats overf i tting hasthesequalities. 
Such distributions should be sparse in that they have less entries 
than normal inputs, and hallucinatory in that they should be clus- 
tered in a different way compared to the standard ââdailyââ input. 
This can be directly tested in state-of-the-art DNNs as well as 
more biologically realistic artif i cial neural networks. That is, there 
may be a point of criticality where inputs have been altered to be 
as dream-like as possible and this is the most effective means of 
preventing overf i tting in biologically realistic artif i cial neural net- 
works, which can be tested by exploring how differently corrup- 
ted inputs assist in generalization. In addition, since learning is 
diurnal in the brain, it may mean that adjusting to mimic realistic 
patterns of cyclical dream-like activity could have the most 
benef i cial effect in machine learning generally. A i nal further po- 
tential hypothesis is that a reduction to the learning rate (given 
the neuromodulatory milieu of dreams that likely blocks the for- 
mation of strong memories) during dream-like input could be 
especially benef i cial for learning in DNNs.ChatGPTChatGPTThe Overfitted Brain Hypothesis (OBH) generates a range of predictions that can be explored both experimentally in neuroscience and theoretically in the field of deep learning.Experimental Validation in Neuroscience:Behavioral Tests for Generalizability: Experimental investigations can involve behavioral tests to differentiate generalizability from mere memorization. This could involve training subjects on repetitive tasks to induce overfitting and then testing for generalization.Sleep Deprivation Studies in Animal Models: Research could focus on the impact of sleep deprivation on memorization versus generalization in animal models. The OBH predicts that memorization would be less affected by sleep deprivation compared to generalization.Tracking Synaptic Plasticity in Response to Dreams: Another approach could be to track changes in synaptic plasticity during REM sleep, similar to studies investigating synaptic homeostasis.Cognitive Flexibility and Generalization in Sleep-Deprived Workers: The OBH suggests that sleep-deprived individuals might be prone to stereotypical errors due to overfitting. Understanding these patterns could help in creating robust fail-safes in critical occupations.Dream Substitutions: The possibility of dream substitutions, like dream-like stimuli provided through VR, could be explored for their effect on mitigating sleep deprivation's cognitive defects.Theoretical Validation in Deep Learning:Biologically Realistic Models: Large-scale thalamocortical spiking-neuron models could be used to investigate the benefits of dreams in preventing overfitting.Exploring Stochastic Biases in Deep Neural Networks (DNNs): The OBH suggests that inputs warped in a sparse and hallucinatory manner, similar to dreams, might be effective in combating overfitting. This can be tested in both state-of-the-art DNNs and biologically realistic neural networks.Cyclical Dream-Like Activity in DNNs: Mimicking the brain's diurnal patterns of dream-like activity in DNNs could enhance learning and generalization.Reducing Learning Rate During Dream-Like Input: A reduction in learning rate during dream-like inputs, reflecting the neuromodulatory environment of dreams, could be beneficial for learning in DNNs.In summary, the OBH provides a comprehensive framework for understanding the role of dreams in enhancing cognitive flexibility and generalization. Its predictions offer exciting avenues for research in both neuroscience and artificial intelligence, potentially leading to innovative approaches in both fields.YouDISCUSSION 
The OBH posits the evolved purpose of dreams is to assist 
generalizationbystochasticcorruptionsofnormalsensoryinput, 
which combats the highly biased nature of inputs during an ani- 
malâs daily learning that can lead to overf i tting, a ubiquitous 
probleminartif i cialneuralnetworksandmachinelearningingen- 
eral. It is supported by both empirical evidence (ââEvidence from 
neuroscienceââ) and theoretical evidence (ââEvidence from deep 
learningââ). In many cases it can explain observed results better 
than other hypotheses (comparative hypotheses are discussed 
in ââContemporary theories of dreamsââ). For example, it seems 
the most effective way to trigger dreams about something is to 
have subjects perform on a novel task like Tetris repeti- 
tiously,73,130likely because the visual system has become over- 
i tted to the task. In addition, the OBH i ts with the fact that 
ââreplayââ results more often contain never-before-seen patterns 
of activity than actual replays of waking sequences,69a fact 
that, as has been pointed out in the previous literature, indicates 
that dreaming may play some sort of role in generalization or gist 
extraction.79In another example, the OBH also explains the fact 
that synaptic potentiation occurs during sleep,140indicating that 
learning during dreams themselves leaves behind a synap- 
tic trace. 
The OBH does not necessarily contradict other hypotheses 
about sleep, for instance, the idea that during certain periods 
of sleep there is ongoing metabolic waste clearance.28In this 
sense then the OBH speculates that dreaming evolved as an ex- 
aptation, wherein sleep evolved for molecular housekeeping 
purposes, and only when brains had to signif i cantly learn during 
the organismâs lifetime did the goal of avoiding overf i tting and 
increasing generalization become adaptive. The OBH does not 
evencontradict some hypothesesabout dreams, insteadadding 
new dimensions. Examples of this include the hypothesis that 
dreams are a test-bed for strengthening the brainâs ability to 
generate mental imagery during wake, explaining the complexi- 
i cation of dreams from childhood to adulthood.120Another 
example of a novel hypothesis that does not stand in opposition 
to the OBH is that dreams are for defending neural real estate163 
(although this may be contradicted by non-wake activation pro- 
i les during dreaming). As a hypothesis, it shares similar back- 
ground concerns with that of the free energy approach to

dreaming,116although without assuming that dreams are for 
testing the predictions of a generative self-modelâs priors or 
that dreams should become less surprising over time as input- 
less prediction error is minimized. There also appears to be 
possible room for overlap between SHY, the OBH, and the 
reverselearninghypothesisofdreaming(seeââDreamsareforse- 
lective forgettingââ). Overall the OBH should be viewed as l exible 
and an umbrella hypothesis with many antecedents; after all, it is 
merely the formal proposal that the corrupted, warped, and sto- 
chastic nature of sensory input in dreams serves to improve per- 
formance on the brainâs daily tasks, motivated by the phenome- 
nology of dreams and common practices in deep learning.ChatGPTChatGPTThe Overfitted Brain Hypothesis (OBH) presents a compelling perspective on the evolved purpose of dreams, suggesting they aid in generalization by introducing stochastic corruptions of normal sensory input. This counters the biased nature of daily learning inputs that can lead to overfitting, a problem common in artificial neural networks and machine learning.Key Aspects of OBH:Support from Empirical and Theoretical Evidence: The OBH is backed by evidence from both neuroscience and deep learning. It aligns with and potentially explains various observed phenomena better than some existing hypotheses.Triggering Dreams through Repetition: The hypothesis aligns with findings that repetitive tasks like playing Tetris can trigger dreams related to the task, likely due to overfitting of the visual system.Dreams and 'Replay' Results: The OBH is consistent with the observation that 'replay' in dreams often involves never-before-seen patterns rather than exact replays of waking sequences, suggesting a role in generalization or gist extraction.Synaptic Potentiation and Learning Trace in Dreams: It accounts for the evidence that synaptic potentiation occurs during sleep, indicating that learning during dreams leaves a synaptic trace.Compatibility with Other Sleep Hypotheses: The OBH does not necessarily contradict other hypotheses about sleep or dreams. It can coexist with ideas like metabolic waste clearance during sleep or dreams as a mechanism for defending neural real estate.Flexibility and Umbrella Nature of OBH: The OBH is flexible and can be viewed as an umbrella hypothesis, integrating various antecedents. It's driven by the distinct phenomenology of dreams and practices in deep learning.Potential Overlap with Other Theories: There might be room for overlap between the OBH, SHY (Synaptic Homeostasis Hypothesis), and the reverse learning hypothesis of dreaming.In summary, the OBH offers a holistic and flexible framework for understanding the role of dreams. It posits that dreams function to enhance the brain's ability to generalize, avoiding the pitfalls of overfitting to daily experiences. This hypothesis is grounded in both empirical neuroscience and theoretical insights from deep learning, providing a unique lens through which to view the function of dreams in cognitive processes.YouIt is also worth noting that within the OBH dreamâs role in 
improvinggeneralizationmayincluderelatedthingslike 
combating ââcatastrophic forgetting,ââ which is a problem faced 
by DNNs that try to train on multiple tasks, and which can also 
be prevented or alleviated by methods like dropout or more 
complicated techniques like elastic weight consolidation.164 
Recent research shows that stimuli created from stimulation of 
a networkâs top-down connections (which are, according to 
the OBH, similar to dreams), can indeed help avoid catastrophic 
forgetting.165So while issues like catastrophic forgetting (the 
complete unlearning of a task while learning another) is not 
well documented in humans, it may be that individual brain mod- 
ules or networks face some lesser form of it, and dreams can be 
conceptualized as a form of regularization that may ameliorate 
several aspects of common learning failures simultaneously. 
For example, beyond the improvements in both in- and out-of- 
distribution generalization, the stochasticity and spareness 
evinced in the phenomenology of dreams can also likely improve 
things like security in response to adversarial attacks and overall 
computational eff i ciency, as stochastic stimulation has these ef- 
fects in DNNs.37Perhaps the most distinguishing aspect of the 
OBH is that it takes the phenomenology of dreams seriously, in 
that they are sparse, hallucinogenic, and narrative in the sense 
of containing fabulist and unusual events (and while the relation- 
ship between phenomenology and neural activity remains un- 
known, contemporary theories exist that attempt to map the 
relationship).166The OBH emphasizes that it is precisely 
because of the departure from waking life that dreams evolved. 
According to this hypothesis, dreams are not epiphenomena, 
either in the sense of neutral evolution but also in the sense of 
not being an expression of some other background process, 
such as patterns of activity and associated experiences merely 
brought about by some other processing integrating new mem- 
ories.54Rather, the point of dreams is the dreams themselves, 
because they provide departures away from the statistically 
biased input of an animalâs daily life, which can assist and there- 
fore increase performance. It may seem paradoxical, but a 
dreamof l ying may actuallyhelp youkeep yourbalance running. 
The evidence for this possibility comes from common methods 
in deep learning that improve generalization, suchas dropout,126 
domain randomization,144and the use of input data created by 
stochastic stimulation of generative models,148which together 
bear striking similarities to the properties of dreams. 
TheOBHmakesseveralpredictionsthatareusefulforboththe 
i eld of neuroscience and the i eld of deep learning. These 
include predictions on the neurophysiological level, as well as 
behavioral, and even within the i eld of deep learning. For 
instance, the prediction that inputs with dream-like properties 
(i.e., adhering to dream phenomenology) will assist with overf i t- 
ting in DNNs. Behaviorally, overf i tting might be induced in sub- 
jects via repetitive training on an undersampled task, and the 
benef i t of dreaming might be directly measured. There is also 
the possibility of dream substitutions, wherein artif i cial dream- 
like stimuli might help improve generalization and therefore per- 
formance in sleep-deprived individuals. 
Finally, it is worth taking the idea of dream substitutions seri- 
ously enough to consider whether i ctions, like novels or i lms, 
act as artif i cial dreams, accomplishing at least some of the 
same function. Within evolutionary psychology, the attempt to 
ground aspects of human behavior in evolutionary theory, there 
has been long-standing confusion with regard to human interest 
in i ctions, since on their surface i ctions have no utility. They are, 
after all, explicitly false information. Therefore it has been 
thought that i ctions are either demonstrations of cognitive 
i tness in order to inf l uence mate choice, or can simply be 
reduced to the equivalent of ââcheesecakeââ â gratifying to 
consume but without benef i t. Proponents of this view have 
even gone so far as to describe the arts as a ââpleasure technology.ââ Some researchers have proposed benef i ts to i ction 
consumption, like improving theory of mind169or helping to ab- 
stract social norms. The OBH suggests i ctions, and perhaps 
the arts in general, may actually have a deeper underlying cogni- 
tive utility in the form of improving generalization and preventing 
overfitting by acting as artificial dreams.ChatGPTChatGPTThe Overfitted Brain Hypothesis (OBH) extends its implications beyond dreams to encompass the concept of 'catastrophic forgetting' in deep neural networks (DNNs) and the potential role of fiction and arts in human cognition.Catastrophic Forgetting in DNNs and Dreams:Catastrophic Forgetting: This problem in DNNs refers to the complete unlearning of a task while learning another. Techniques like dropout or elastic weight consolidation help prevent this issue.Dreams and Regularization: Dreams may function as a form of regularization, preventing a similar problem in human cognition. While catastrophic forgetting is not well-documented in humans, brain modules or networks might experience a lesser form of it, which dreams could help ameliorate.Dream Phenomenology and Computational Efficiency:Stochastic Stimulation: The stochastic and sparse nature of dreams can improve computational efficiency and security against adversarial attacks in DNNs. This aligns with the OBH, which emphasizes the importance of dream phenomenology (sparse, hallucinogenic, narrative) in aiding generalization and performance.Neurophysiological and Behavioral Predictions: The OBH makes predictions at various levels, including neurophysiological changes due to dreams, behavioral impacts of dream-like stimuli, and benefits in DNNs from inputs with dream-like properties.Dream Substitutions and Artificial Dreams:Artificial Dream-Like Stimuli: The concept of dream substitutions, where artificial stimuli mimic dream properties, could improve generalization and performance in individuals, especially those who are sleep-deprived.Fiction and Arts as Artificial Dreams: The OBH raises an intriguing possibility that fiction and arts might serve a cognitive utility akin to dreams. They could potentially improve generalization and prevent overfitting in the human brain by providing experiences that diverge from daily life, acting as 'artificial dreams'.Summary and Implications:
The OBH not only provides a framework for understanding the function of dreams in preventing overfitting in human cognition but also suggests broader implications for the role of artificial experiences (like fiction and arts) in cognitive processes. It bridges concepts from deep learning and neuroscience, offering valuable insights and predictions for both fields. The hypothesis emphasizes the importance of understanding and leveraging the unique phenomenology of dreams to enhance cognitive flexibility and generalization, potentially inspiring novel approaches in AI and cognitive science.ChatGPT can make mistakes.
