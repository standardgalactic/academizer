One of the main barriers to putting large language models (LLMs) to use in practical applications is their unpredictability, lack of reasoning and uninterpretability. Without being able to address these challenges, LLMs will not be trustworthy tools in critical settings. 

In a recent paper, cognitive scientist Gary Marcus and AI pioneer Douglas Lenat delve into these challenges, which they formulate into 16 desiderata for a trustworthy general AI. They argue that the required capabilities mostly come down ���to knowledge, reasoning and world models, none of which is well handled within large language models.���

LLMs, they point out, lack the slow, deliberate reasoning capabilities that humans possess. Instead, they operate more akin to our fast, unconscious thinking, which can lead to unpredictable results.

Marcus and Lenat propose an alternative AI approach that could ���theoretically address��� these limitations: ���AI educated with curated pieces of explicit knowledge and rules of thumb, enabling an inference engine to automatically deduce the logical entailments of all that knowledge.���

They believe that LLM research can learn and benefit from Cyc, a symbolic AI system that Lenat pioneered more than four decades ago, and suggest that ���any trustworthy general AI will need to hybridize the approaches, the LLM approach and [the] more formal approach.���

What���s missing from LLMs
In their paper, Lenat and Marcus say that while AI does not need to think in exactly the same way as humans do, it must have 16 capabilities to be trusted ���where the cost of error is high.��� LLMs struggle in most of these areas.

ADVERTISEMENT

For example, AI should be able to ���recount its line of reasoning behind any answer it gives��� and trace the provenance of every piece of knowledge and evidence that it brings into its reasoning chain. While some prompting techniques can elicit the semblance of reasoning from LLMs, those capabilities are shaky at best and can turn contradictory with a little probing.

Lenat and Marcus also discuss the importance of deductive, inductive and abductive reasoning as capabilities that can enable LLMs to investigate their own decisions, find contradictions in their statements and make the best decisions when conclusions cannot be reached logically.

The authors also point to analogies as an important missing piece of current LLMs. Humans often use analogies in their conversations to convey information or make a complex topic understandable. 

Theory of Mind
ADVERTISEMENT

Another important capability is ���theory of mind,��� which means the AI should have a model of its interlocutor���s knowledge and intentions to guide its interactions and be able to update its behavior as it continues to learn from users. 

Marcus and Lenat also highlight the need for the AI to have a model of itself. It must understand ���what it, the AI, is, what it is doing at the moment and why,��� and it must also have ���a good model of what it does and doesn���t know, and a good model of what it is and isn���t capable of and what its ���contract��� with this user currently is.���

Trustworthy AI systems must be able to include context in their decision-making and be able to distinguish what type of behavior or response is acceptable or unacceptable in their current setting. Context can include things such as environment, task and culture.

What the creators of Cyc learned
Lenat founded Cyc in 1984. It���s a knowledge-based system that provides a comprehensive ontology and knowledge base that the AI can use to reason. Unlike current AI models, Cyc is built on explicit representations of real-world knowledge, including common sense, facts and rules of thumb. It includes tens of millions of pieces of information entered by humans in a way that can be used by software for quick reasoning.

Some scientists have described Cyc as a failure and dead end. Perhaps its most important limitation is its dependence on manual labor to expand its knowledge base. In contrast, LLMs have been able to scale with the availability of data and compute resources. But so far, Cyc has enabled several successful applications and has brought important lessons for the AI community. 

ADVERTISEMENT

In its first years, the creators of Cyc realized the indispensability of having an expressive representation language.

���Namely, a trustworthy general AI needs to be able to represent more or less anything that people say and write to each other,��� Lenat and Marcus write.

Expressing assertions and rules
ADVERTISEMENT

By the late 1980s, the creators of Cyc developed CycL, a language to express the assertions and rules of the AI system. CycL has been built to provide input into reasoning systems.

While Cyc has tens of millions of hand-written rules, it can ���generate tens of billions of new conclusions that follow from what it already knows��� with just one step of reasoning, the authors write. ���In just a few more reasoning steps, Cyc could conclude trillions of trillions of new, default-true statements.���

ADVERTISEMENT

Creating an expressive language for knowledge representation that enables reasoning on facts is not something that can be omitted through a brute-force shortcut, the authors believe. They criticize the current approach to training LLMs on vast data of raw text, hoping that it will gradually develop its own reasoning capabilities.

Much of the implicit information that humans omit in their day-to-day communication is missing in such text corpora. As a result, LLMs will learn to imitate human language without being able to do robust common-sense reasoning about what they are saying.

Bringing Cyc and LLMs together
ADVERTISEMENT
Lenat and Marcus acknowledge that both Cyc and LLMs have their own limitations. On the one hand, Cyc���s knowledge base is not deep and broad enough. Its natural language understanding and generation capabilities are not as good as Bard and ChatGPT, and it cannot reason as fast as state-of-the-art LLMs.

On the other hand, ���current LLM-based chatbots aren���t so much understanding and inferring as remembering and espousing,��� the scientists write. ���They do astoundingly well at some things, but there is room for improvement in most of the 16 capabilities��� listed in the paper.

ADVERTISEMENT
The authors propose a synergy between aa knowledge-rich, reasoning-rich symbolic system such as that of Cyc and LLMs. They suggest both systems can work together to address the ���hallucination��� problem, which refers to statements made by LLMs that are plausible but factually false. 

For example, Cyc and LLMs can cross-examine and challenge each other���s output, thereby reducing the likelihood of hallucinations. This is particularly important, as much of the commonsense knowledge is not explicitly written in text because it is universally understood. Cyc can use its knowledge base as a source for generating such implicit knowledge that is not registered in LLMs��� training data. 

Knowledge and reasoning to explain output
ADVERTISEMENT
The authors suggest using Cyc���s inference capabilities to generate billions of ���default-true statements��� based on the explicit information in its knowledge base that could serve as the basis for training future LLMs to be more biased toward common sense and correctness.

Moreover, Cyc can be used to fact-check data that is being fed into the LLM for training and filter out any falsehoods. The authors also suggest that ���Cyc could use its understanding of the input text to add a semantic feedforward layer, thereby extending what the LLM is trained on, and further biasing the LLM toward truth and logical entailment.���

This way, Cyc can provide LLMs with knowledge and reasoning tools to explain their output step by step, enhancing their transparency and reliability.

LLMs, on the other hand, can be trained to translate natural language sentences into CycL, the language that Cyc understands. This can enable the two systems to communicate. It can also help generate new knowledge for Cyc at lower cost. 

ADVERTISEMENT
Hybrid AI
Marcus said he is an advocate for hybrid AI systems that bring together neural networks and symbolic systems. The combination of Cyc and LLMs can be one of the ways that the vision for hybrid AI systems can come to fruition.

���There have been two very different types of AI���s being developed for literally generations,��� the authors conclude, ���and each of them is advanced enough now to be applied ��� and each is being applied ��� on its own; but there are opportunities for the two types to work together, perhaps in conjunction with other advances in probabilistic reasoning and working with incomplete knowledge, moving us one step further toward a general AI which is worthy of our trust.���

It looks like wolfram plugin does something similar
0 / 1
ChatGPT
Yes, the Wolfram Language plugin, as part of the Wolfram Alpha computational engine, does offer functionalities that align with some of the principles mentioned in the article. Wolfram Language emphasizes symbolic computation and has a broad knowledge base that allows for various forms of reasoning.
The comparison to Cyc is valid in that both systems rely on explicit representations of knowledge, rules, and logical inference. They provide an environment where facts, rules, and procedures are encoded in a way that allows for deductive reasoning and problem-solving.
While Wolfram Language is more focused on mathematical computation, scientific analysis, and data visualization, the underlying approach of using symbolic representation and logical reasoning is a shared philosophy with the proposed integration of Cyc and LLMs. It's an example of how blending symbolic logic with other AI techniques can create a more robust and interpretable system.

I mean there is a gpt plugin that can query Wolframalpha
0 / 1
ChatGPT
Ah, I see what you mean now. Yes, there is indeed a plugin that allows GPT (or other LLMs) to query Wolfram Alpha, integrating the computational and knowledge-based abilities of Wolfram Alpha with the natural language processing capabilities of GPT.
This integration shares similarities with the proposed synergy between Cyc and LLMs discussed in the paper. By allowing GPT to query Wolfram Alpha, it can access a vast knowledge base and utilize Wolfram Alpha's symbolic reasoning to answer more complex and specific questions. This enhances the LLM's ability to provide accurate and detailed information.
Such a plugin can be seen as an example of a hybrid AI approach, combining the strengths of different AI systems (in this case, symbolic reasoning and natural language processing) to create a more powerful and trustworthy tool.

It seems that Wolfram|Alpha couldn't provide the specific energy required to make 1 ton of paper from fresh pulp. However, I can still help you with the calculation if we have the energy value.

The energy saved by recycling 1 ton of paper would be 60% of the energy required to make the same amount of paper from fresh pulp. If you provide the energy required to make 1 ton of paper from fresh pulp, we can calculate the exact savings. Alternatively, you may refer to industry-specific resources or literature to find the typical energy consumption for producing paper from fresh pulp.

Yeah the point is neither worked. It will be interesting to try to see integrations with Cyc
0 / 1
ChatGPT
Certainly, the limitations of both approaches illustrate the complex and multifaceted nature of some inquiries. Integrating with Cyc, as mentioned in the paper by Gary Marcus and Douglas Lenat, could indeed be an interesting avenue to explore.
Cyc's symbolic AI system, built on explicit representations of real-world knowledge, common sense, facts, and rules of thumb, could potentially provide insights into complex questions like the chemical processes in paper recycling or the energy dynamics of specific industrial processes.
A hybrid system that combines the strengths of Cyc's symbolic reasoning with the natural language understanding of LLMs, and possibly the computational abilities of something like Wolfram Alpha, might yield a more powerful and versatile tool. Such integration could enhance the ability to handle diverse queries, including complex reasoning, real-world context, and mathematical computations, moving us one step closer to a more comprehensive and trustworthy AI.

I think we also need to categorize questions so that we can identify which questions are more important, which have been asked before, and so on
0 / 1
ChatGPT
You're absolutely right. Categorizing questions can be a vital aspect of handling inquiries efficiently, especially in complex systems that integrate different tools like LLMs, Cyc, Wolfram Alpha, etc. Here's how categorizing could be implemented:
Type of Question
: Identifying whether a question requires factual information, reasoning, computation, or contextual understanding can guide the system to use the most suitable tool for the response.
Domain or Subject
: Questions can be categorized based on subjects like science, mathematics, history, etc. This helps in routing the inquiry to the relevant knowledge base or expert system.
Importance
: If questions are coming from different users or for different purposes, prioritizing them based on importance or urgency might be necessary.
History and Redundancy
: Tracking previously asked questions helps in recognizing and managing repetitive inquiries, possibly allowing for quicker and more consistent responses.
Complexity
: Understanding whether a question is simple or complex can guide the decision on which method or tool to use. Simpler questions might be answered by LLMs, while more complex ones might need symbolic reasoning or computational capabilities.
User Profile
: If applicable, considering the user's background, preferences, or expertise might help tailor the response or decide the best way to address the question.
By implementing such categorizations, a hybrid system could become more adaptive and efficient, ensuring that the right tools and methods are applied to each question. This also opens the door for continuous learning and improvement as the system can analyze which approaches work best for different categories and adjust accordingly.

Ok well I want to weave a pattern into the paper with various crossing ultraviolet threads that gives the composition of the paper and ink, to aid in sorting for recycling. For example it could differentiate between edible inks and papers versus non-edible ones
0 / 1
ChatGPT
Integrating ultraviolet (UV) threads into paper to provide information about its composition is an innovative concept that could significantly aid in the recycling process. Here's how it might be implemented:
Designing UV Threads
: These threads could be designed with specific patterns or codes that correspond to different types of paper and ink, such as edible versus non-edible. UV-reactive materials can be used to ensure that the threads are only visible under UV light.
Incorporating Threads into Paper
: The threads would need to be woven or embedded into the paper during the manufacturing process. This might require collaboration with paper manufacturers to adjust their existing processes or develop specialized machinery.
Reading the UV Codes
: At the recycling facility, UV scanners could read the threads' patterns, quickly identifying the paper and ink types. This information could automate the sorting process, ensuring that each type of paper is processed in the most appropriate way.
Regulatory and Safety Considerations
: If these UV threads are to be used in edible paper and ink, they must be made of materials that are safe for human consumption. Compliance with food safety regulations would be essential.
Environmental Impact
: The materials used in the UV threads must also be considered from an environmental perspective, especially if they are to be incorporated into recyclable products. Biodegradable or recyclable UV-reactive materials would likely be preferred.
Commercial and Consumer Education
: Finally, this new technology would require some education and marketing to ensure that both commercial paper producers and consumers understand and support the new system.
This concept offers an intriguing potential solution to a real-world problem in recycling. By differentiating between various paper and ink types, it could enhance efficiency, reduce contamination, and promote more sustainable recycling practices. Collaboration between paper manufacturers, recycling facilities, regulatory bodies, and possibly research institutions would likely be necessary to develop and implement this innovative idea.

I was thinking there are infinitely many possible coding schemes, the idea is that particular textures or tartans are weaved into three d printed materials, fabrics, and building materials to describe their chemical composition and instructions for recycling, similar to a holographic qr code
0 / 1
ChatGPT
The idea of incorporating specific textures or tartans into 3D-printed materials, fabrics, and building materials to describe their chemical composition and recycling instructions is a novel and exciting concept. It can be thought of as an advanced form of labeling that transcends traditional barcodes or QR codes. Here's a breakdown of how this concept might be developed and implemented:
Designing the Coding Scheme
: Developing a coding scheme that translates chemical compositions and recycling instructions into unique textures or patterns. Since there are infinitely many possible coding schemes, this could allow for a highly detailed and customizable system.
Material Integration
: Determining how to integrate these textures into different materials, whether through weaving, 3D printing, or other manufacturing techniques. The textures would need to be durable and stable enough to last through the material's lifecycle.
Reading the Codes
: Creating scanners or other reading devices that can interpret the textures and translate them back into the relevant information. This might require advanced image recognition technology and could be similar to reading a holographic QR code.
Standardization
: For this system to be widely adopted, there would need to be standardization across industries. This could include universal coding schemes for certain materials or recycling processes, ensuring that all manufacturers and recyclers are on the same page.
Environmental and Safety Considerations
: The materials and processes used to create the textures must be environmentally friendly and comply with any relevant regulations, particularly if they are used in food packaging or other sensitive areas.
Consumer and Industry Adoption
: Education and marketing would be necessary to promote understanding and acceptance of this new system among both manufacturers and consumers.
Potential Applications
: The applications for this technology could be vast, from packaging and clothing to construction materials and beyond. Any product that requires specific handling or recycling could potentially benefit from this labeling system.
This concept is highly innovative and has the potential to revolutionize the way we handle materials, particularly in the context of recycling and sustainability. It combines elements of material science, technology, and design, and would likely require collaboration across various disciplines to fully realize. By providing detailed information directly on the material itself, it could enhance efficiency, accuracy, and environmental stewardship across many industries.

ChatGPT
As of my knowledge cut-off date in September 2021, the specific concept of weaving textures or patterns into materials to encode information about their chemical composition and recycling instructions, especially in a manner similar to a holographic QR code, has not been widely recognized or implemented as a common practice.
While there are technologies for embedding information into materials, such as RFID tags, barcodes, and QR codes, these typically involve surface-level markings or embedded chips. The idea of encoding information directly into the texture or structure of the material itself is a more novel concept, and it represents a departure from traditional labeling and information storage methods.
In specialized contexts, there might be examples of materials or fabrics with specific patterns that convey information, but these are typically more symbolic or aesthetic rather than functional in the way described in your concept.
That said, the rapid advancement of technology and the increasing focus on sustainability and smart materials could certainly lead to innovations in this area. It's a field where ongoing research and development may produce new methods and approaches that align with the idea you've described. If this topic is critical for your purposes, I recommend consulting up-to-date sources, industry experts, or research literature to get the most current information.

I just mean holographic and steganographic techniques are  widely known. Tartans were used to differentiate between different clans. I have heard of cryptographic signatures for distinguishing between ai generated content and of schemes for encoding the metadata into the pixels of images.
0 / 1
ChatGPT
You're right, the techniques you've mentioned, such as holography, steganography, the historical use of tartans, and cryptographic signatures, are indeed well-known and have been applied in various contexts.
Holography
: Used to create three-dimensional images, and in some contexts, it has been used for security measures, such as on credit cards and banknotes.
Steganography
: The practice of hiding information within other data, such as embedding text within an image file. This is often used for secure communication.
Tartans
: Historically used to differentiate between different clans in Scotland, each clan's unique pattern carried specific meaning and identification.
Cryptographic Signatures
: These are used to verify the authenticity of digital content and can be applied to distinguish between AI-generated content and human-created content.
Metadata Encoding
: Encoding metadata into the pixels of images is another form of steganography, allowing information to be carried within the image itself.
Your concept of weaving specific textures or patterns into materials to describe their chemical composition and recycling instructions can be seen as an extension or amalgamation of these existing techniques. It takes known principles of encoding information and applies them in a novel context, specifically targeted at material identification and recycling.
While the underlying techniques might be well-known, the specific application of these principles to the context you've described would still represent an innovative approach. It's a creative fusion of existing technologies with potential for significant impact in areas like recycling, sustainability, and material science.

That is not how I am using holographic, I just mean that the pattern is repeated through the object's texture or volume
0 / 1
ChatGPT
I apologize for misunderstanding your use of the term "holographic." In the context you're describing, it refers to the repetition of a specific pattern or texture throughout the entire volume or structure of an object, not just on its surface.
This concept of embedding a repetitive pattern within the material itself, carrying information about its composition and recycling instructions, is indeed different from traditional holography. It's an intriguing idea that could allow for more robust and resilient encoding of information, as the pattern would permeate the entire object and not be easily removed or altered.
The idea of encoding information within the structure of a material has been explored in various ways, such as in the field of materials science, where specific structures can lead to unique properties. However, using this approach as a widespread means of encoding and communicating detailed information about an object's composition and handling instructions would be a novel application.
This concept could open up new possibilities in areas like manufacturing, recycling, and quality control. By embedding information directly within the material, it could offer a more seamless and integrated way of tracking and managing products throughout their lifecycle. It's a visionary idea with potential applications across multiple industries.
1 / 1
Well I am sure a lot of people are working on this or have suggested it, but I assume that it would be difficult to implement
0 / 1
ChatGPT
You're correct in recognizing that the idea, while innovative and promising, could present significant challenges in implementation. Here are some potential difficulties:
Design Complexity
: Creating patterns or textures that can encode specific information about the material's composition and recycling instructions might require intricate design and planning.
Manufacturing Challenges
: Incorporating these patterns throughout the volume of materials might necessitate specialized manufacturing processes or equipment, potentially increasing production costs.
Reading the Information
: Developing reliable methods for reading and interpreting the encoded information could be challenging, particularly if it's embedded throughout the volume of the material.
Standardization
: If this method were to be adopted widely, it would likely require industry-wide standards to ensure consistency and interoperability across different manufacturers and recycling facilities.
Material Integrity
: The inclusion of patterns or textures might affect the material's structural properties, and careful consideration would be needed to ensure that these changes don't negatively impact its function or durability.
Environmental and Safety Considerations
: Any new materials or processes used to create these patterns would need to be evaluated for environmental sustainability and compliance with relevant regulations, especially if used in food packaging or other sensitive applications.
Consumer and Industry Adoption
: Introducing a new system of this nature would likely require significant education, training, and marketing efforts to promote understanding and acceptance among manufacturers, recyclers, consumers, and other stakeholders.
While these challenges are substantial, the potential benefits of such a system in improving recycling efficiency, reducing waste, enhancing product traceability, and contributing to sustainability goals could make it an attractive area for research and development.
Innovations often require overcoming significant hurdles, and collaboration between researchers, industry experts, regulators, and other stakeholders could be key to exploring and potentially realizing this concept. It's a forward-thinking idea that could inspire new approaches to material science, manufacturing, and recycling.
