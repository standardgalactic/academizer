A PARADIGM FOR LEARNING

DR. . . SELFRIDGE
INTRODUCTION
WE are proposing here a model of a process which we claim can adaptively
improve 1tself to handle certaln pattern recognition problems which cannot
be adequately specified in advance. Such probler.s are usual when trying
to build a machineto imitate any one of very large class of human data
processing techniques. A speech typewriter is a good example of something
that very many people have been trying unsuccessfully to build for some time.
We do not suggest that we have proposed a model which can learn to
typewrite from merely hearing speech. Pandemonium does not, however, seem
on paper to have the same kinds of inherent restrictions or 1nflexibility
that many previous proposals have had. The basic motif behind our model 1s
the notion of parallel processing. This is suggested on two grounds: first,
it 1s often easier to handle data in a parallel manner, and, indeed, it 1s
usually the more "natural" manner to handle it in; and, secondly, it is
easier to modlfy an assembly of quasi-independent modules than a machine
all of whose parts interact immediately and 1n a complex way.
We are not going to apologize for a frequent use of anthropomorphic or
biomorphic terminology. They seem to be useful words to describe our notions.
what we are describing 1s a process, or, rather, a model of a process.
We shall not describe all the reasons that led to its particular formulation,
but we shall give some reasons for hoping that it does in fact possess the
flexibility and adaptability that we ascribe to it.
THE PROBLEM ENVIRONMENT FOR LEARNING
Pandemonium is a model which we hope can learn to recognize patterns which
have not been specifled. We mean that in the following sense: we present to
the mnodel examples of patterns taken from some set of them, each time
informing the model which pattern we had Just presented. Then, after some
time the model guesses correctly which pattern has Just been presented before

The paper "PANDEMONIUM: A PARADIGM FOR LEARNING" by Dr. Selfridge proposes a model for adaptively improving pattern recognition capabilities in machines. The model, called Pandemonium, aims to tackle problems that cannot be fully specified in advance, such as a speech typewriter. The model is based on the concept of parallel processing, which allows for easier modification and more natural data handling. Pandemonium is designed to learn to recognize patterns by being shown examples and aims to have the flexibility and adaptability that many previous models lacked. The paper doesn't shy away from using anthropomorphic or biomorphic terms to describe its concepts.

we infor it. For large class of pattern recognition ensembles there has
Q
never existed any adequate written or statable description of the distinc-
tions between the patterns. The only requirement we can place on our model
1s that we want it to benave in the same way that men observably behave in.
In an absolute sense this is a very unsatisfactory definition of any task,
but it may be apparent that it is the way in which most tasks are defined
for most men. Lucky is he whose job can be exactly specified in words
without any ambiguity or necessary inferences. The example we shall
illustrate in some detail is translating from manually keyed Morse code
into, say, typewritten messages. Now it 1s true that when one learns Morse
code one learns that a dash should be exactly three times the length of a
dot and so on, but 1t turns out that this ls really mostly irrelevant.
What matters is only what the vast army of people who use Morse code and
wIth whom one 1s going to have to communicate understand and practise when
they use it. It turns out that this is nearly always very different from
school book Morse.
In the same way the only adequate definition of the pattern of a spoken
word, or one hand-written, must be in terms of the consensus of the people
who are using it.
We use the term pattern recognition in a broad sense to include not only
that data processing by which images are assigned to one or another pattern.
in some set of patterns, but also the processes by which the patterns and
data processing are developed by the organism er machine; we generally call
this latter "learning".
DEALIZED AND PRACTICAL
PANDEMONIUM,
We first construct an idealized pandemonlum (fig.1). Each possible
demon in a box, computes his
pattern of the set, represented by
a
similarity with the image simultaneously on view to all of them, and gives
an output depending monotaically on that simllarity. Te decision demon on
top makes a choice of that pattern belanging to the demon Whose output was
the largest.*
Th1s is an exact correlate of a communicatlons system wherein given a received
Mi
message M(T) and a number of possible transmitted messages M;(7), that M; 1s
chosen, that,ls, deemed to have been transmitted, which minimizes
(Such Q a procedure 1s optimum under certaln conditions). This
flM(T)-M.
Integral 1s, as It were, the square of a distance in a s1gnal phase space
a
fig.2 - and thus that transmltted message 1s selected that 1s most similar to
the received one.

The paper elaborates on the complexities of real-world pattern recognition tasks, noting that many patterns do not have a clear, statable description. For example, while Morse code is taught in a standardized manner, its practical use often deviates from the textbook. This is similar to spoken or handwritten words, whose 'correct' pattern is determined by the consensus of the people using them.
In terms of the model itself, the idealized Pandemonium is described as a system of 'demons' in boxes. Each demon computes its similarity with the currently presented pattern. The 'decision demon' on top then chooses the pattern belonging to the demon with the highest similarity score. This approach mirrors a communication system where the transmitted message is selected based on its similarity to the received message.
The paper argues that this kind of pattern recognition and learning model can adaptively improve and handle complex tasks, much like humans do.

Each demon may, for example, be assigned one letter of the alphabet, so
tnat tne tasK of the A-demon is to shout as loud of the amount of 'A-ness'
that he sees in the image.* Now 1t will usually happen that with a reasonable
collection of categories l1ke the letters of the alphabet the computa-
tions performed by each of these ideal cognitive demons w11l be largely
the same. In many instances pattern 1s nearly equivalent to some l0gical
a
function of a set of features, each of which is individually common to
perhaps several patterns and whose absence is also common to several other
patterns.r
We there for amend our idealized Pandemcnium, The amended version
fig.3 - has same profound advantages, chief among which 1s its suscept-
1bility to that kind of adaptive self-1mprovement that I call learning.
The difference between f1g. 1 and fig.3 1s that the common parts of the
computations that each cognitive demon carries out in fig.1 have in fig.3
been assigned instead to a host of subdemons. At this stage the organiza-
t1on has four levels. At the bottom the data demons serve merely to store
and pass on the data. At the next level the computational demons or sub-
demons perform certain more or less complicated computations on the data
and pass the results of these up to the next level, the cognitive demons
who weigh the evidence, as it were. Each cognitive demon computes a shriek,
and from all the shrieks the highest level demon of all, the decision demon,
merely selects the loudest.
THE CONCEPTI ON OF PANDEMONIUM
We cannot ab initio know the ideal construct lon of our Pandemonium. We
try to assure that 1t contalns the seeds of self-improvement. of the four
levels in fig.3, all but the third, the subdemons, which compute, are
speci fied by the task. For the third level, therefore, we collect a large
number of possible useful functions, ellminating a priori only those which
could not conceivably be relevant, and make a reasonable selection of the
others, being bound by economy and space. We then guess reasonable weights
for them. The behaviour at this point may even be acceptably good, but
usually it must be improved by means of the adaptive changes we are about
to discuss.
It 1s possible also to phrase it so that the A-demon 1s computing the distance
1n some phase of the 1mage from some ideal A; it seems to me unnecessarily
platonic to postulate the existence of 'ideal' representatives of ratterns, and,
indeed, there are often good reasons for not doing so.

In the expanded model of Pandemonium, the concept of 'demons' is further refined. Each demon may be responsible for recognizing a particular feature, such as a letter in the alphabet, and "shrieks" based on the amount of that feature it sees in the data. The paper introduces the concept of subdemons to perform common computational tasks that were initially performed by the primary cognitive demons. This results in a four-level hierarchy:
Data Demons: At the bottom level, these simply store and pass on data.
Computational Demons or Subdemons: Perform specific calculations on the data.
Cognitive Demons: Weigh the evidence based on the computations from the subdemons, producing a 'shriek' based on the pattern they are designed to recognize.
Decision Demon: At the top, it selects the pattern corresponding to the loudest shriek from the cognitive demons.
The construction of this model is intended to allow for adaptive self-improvement, which the paper calls 'learning'. The actual construction is not known in advance but aims to contain the potential for self-improvement. The third level, consisting of the subdemons, is particularly key for adaptability. Various functions can be chosen for these subdemons, subject to resource constraints, and their behavior can be improved adaptively over time.
The paper suggests that it's not necessary to have 'ideal' representatives for patterns, emphasizing that the real-world application often deviates from idealized forms.

The paper further delves into the adaptive changes that can be made in the Pandemonium model, particularly in the context of "Feature Weighting". The idea is that each cognitive demon computes a weighted sum of the outputs of all computational demons or subdemons. These weightings can differ depending on the specific cognitive demon and are intended to help the model adapt and improve over time.
This concept of "Feature Weighting" is one of several kinds of adaptive changes that the model can undergo to better recognize patterns and improve its performance. The weightings can be adjusted based on performance metrics, allowing the model to 'learn' and adapt, much like how human cognitive processes adapt to new information or tasks.

ChatGPT
Yes, the similarities between the Pandemonium model and modern deep learning architectures are quite striking. The concept of hierarchical, adaptive learning in Pandemonium can be seen as a precursor to the layers in neural networks. The Decision Demon is akin to the output layer, Cognitive Demons resemble feature detectors, Computational Demons parallel neurons in hidden layers, and Data or Image Demons relate to the input layer. This shows how some foundational ideas in artificial intelligence and machine learning have evolved but remain grounded in early conceptual frameworks.

the different cognitive demons, but the welgntings will be the only
difference between them. Feature weighting consists of altering the weiehts
assigned to the subdemons by the cognitive demons so as to maximize the
score of the entlre y Pandemonium, How then can we do this?
The Score
What we mean by the score nere 1s how well the machine is doing the task
we want it to do. This presumes that we are monitoring the machine and
telling it when 1t makes an error and so on, and for the rest of the
dIscussion we shall be assuming that we have available some such running
score, Now at some point we shall be very interested in hnaving the machine
run without that kind of direct supervision, and the question naturally
arises whether the machine can meaningfully monitor its own performance.
We answer that question tentatively yes, but delay discussing it till a
later section.

ChatGPT
The paper introduces the concept of "Feature Weighting" as a method of adaptation in the Pandemonium model. The idea is to adjust the weights assigned to subdemons by cognitive demons to maximize the model's overall performance or "score."
The "score" here is a measure of how well the model is performing the task it is designed for. Initially, this involves external monitoring to indicate when the machine makes an error. However, the paper also raises the interesting point of whether the machine can monitor its own performance meaningfully, a question that is set aside for later discussion.
The "hill climbing technique" mentioned refers to picking vectors (points in the space of possible weightings) at random, evaluating them (scoring), and choosing the one that maximizes performance. This is another method that allows the model to adapt and improve, akin to optimization methods in modern machine learning algorithms.

The section introduces a second "hill-climbing" technique for feature weighting. Here, random vectors are chosen until one (Number 4 in the example) performs better than previous ones. After identifying this better-performing vector, short random steps are taken to further improve the score, retracing any steps that lead to a decrease in score.
The goal of feature weighting is to find an optimal set of weights (represented by the vector

) that maximizes the performance of the Pandemonium model. This is akin to finding the optimal set of parameters in a machine learning model to minimize loss or maximize accuracy.

that set. This may be described as a hlll-climbing problem . We have a space
(of A) and a function on the space (the score), which we may consider an
altitude, and which we wish to maximize by a proper search through A. one
possible technique is to select weighting vectors at random, score them,
and finally to select the vector that scored highest (see fig.4). It w1ll
usually, however, turn out to be profitable to take edvantage of the
continuity properties of the space, which usually exist in some sense, 1n
the following way: select vectors at random until you find one that scores
perceptibly more than the others. Fran this point take small random steps in all
directions (that is, add small random vectors) ut1l you find a direction
that improves your score, When you finc such a step, take It and repeat
the process. This 1s 1llustrated in fig.5, and is the case of blind man

one may find oneself trapped In such procedure (fig.6).

The  problem of ralse peaks in searching" techniques is an old and
famlliar one. In general, one may hope that in spaces of very nigh dimen-
sionality the interdependence of the components and the score is so great
as to make very unllkely the existence of false peaks completely isolated
from the main or true peak. It must be realized, however, that this is a
purely experimental question that has to be answered separately for every
hill-climbing situation. It doss turn out in h1ll-cl1mbing sltuations that
the choice of starting point is often very important. The main peak may be
very prominent, but unless it has wide-spread foot-hills it may take E very
long time before we ever begin to galn altitude.
This may be described as one of the problems of training, namely, to
encourage the machine or organism to get enough on the foot-hills so that
small changes 1n his parameters w!1l produce noticeable improvement 1n his
altitude or score. ne can describe learning situations where most of the
difficulty of the task l1es in finding any way of improving one's score,
such as learning to ride a unicycle, where 1t takes longer to stay on for
second than it does to improve that one second to a minute; and others
a
where it is easy to do a little well and very nard to do very well, such as
learning to play chess. It 1s also true that often the main peak is a
plateau rather than an isolated spike. That 1s to say, optimal behaviour of
the mechanism, once reached, may be rether insensitive to the change of
some of the parameters.

The section elaborates on the challenges of the hill-climbing optimization technique, particularly the issues related to getting trapped at false peaks. It highlights the importance of the starting point in the parameter space for efficient optimization.
The concept of false peaks in the "score" or "fitness landscape" is acknowledged as a longstanding issue in optimization. The text suggests that in very high-dimensional spaces, the likelihood of encountering false peaks that are completely isolated from the true, global peak might be reduced. However, this remains an empirical question that varies from problem to problem.
The text also brings up the idea of "training," or the need for the model to begin in a favorable position in the parameter space where small changes lead to significant improvements in score. It uses the analogy of learning to ride a unicycle and learning to play chess to illustrate scenarios where initially improving one's score can be particularly difficult or relatively straightforward.
Lastly, it mentions that often the optimal region in the parameter space might not be a single point but a plateau, meaning that small changes in parameters may not necessarily lead to significant changes in performance. This is a notion that is also familiar in modern machine learning, where certain hyperparameters might not have to be finely tuned for good performance.

Subdemon Selection
The second kind of adaptive change that we wish to incorporate into our
Pandemonium 1s subdemon selection. At the conception of our demoniac
assembly we collected somewhat arbitrarily a large number of subdemons which
we guessed would be use ful and assigned them we ights also arbitrarlly. The
first adaptive change, feature weighting, optimized these welghts, but we
have no assurance at all that the particular subdemons we selected are good
one s. ubdemon selection generates new subdemons for trial and eliminates
inefficient ones, that:is, ones that do not much help improve the score.
We propose to do this initially by two dlfferent. techniques, which may
be called "mutated fission" and "conJugation". The first point to note is
that it 1s possible to assign a worth to each of the subdemons. It may te
done in several ways, and we may, for example, write the worth
of the
ith demon
EIX
so that the worthy demons are those whose outputs are likely to affect most
strongly the decisions made.

We assume that feature welghting has already run so long. that the
behaviour of the machine has been approximately optimized, and that scores
and worths of machine and 1ts demons have been obtalned. Frst we ellminate
those subdemons with l0w worths. Next we generate new subdemons by
mutating the survivors and reweighting the assembly. At present we plan to
pick one subdemon and alter some of hls parameters more or less at random.
This ���1ll usually require that we reduce the subdemon himself to some
canonical form so that the random changes we Insert do not have the effect
of rewriting the program so that 1t will not run or so that it w1ll enter
closed loop without any hope of getting out of 1t.*

Besides mutated fission, we are proposing another method of subdemon
improvement called "conjugation". Our purpose here 1s two-fold: first
to provide a logical variety in the functions computed by the subdemons,
and, secondly, to provide length and complexity in them.
What we do 1s this: given two 'use ful' subdemons, we generate a new
subdemon which is the continuous analogue of one of the ten nontrivial
binary two-variable functions on them. For example, the product of two
subdemon outputs, corresponding to the logical product, would suggest the
simultaneous presence of two features. The ten non-trivial such functions
are listed in Table 1.

ChatGPT
The text describes a second adaptive change in the architecture referred to as "subdemon selection." This method serves to fine-tune the collection of computational units (subdemons) that are part of the system, effectively performing feature selection and feature engineering.
Two techniques are introduced for subdemon selection: "mutated fission" and "conjugation."
Mutated Fission
: This involves assessing the worth of each subdemon based on how significantly it affects the decisions made by the system. Subdemons with low worth are eliminated. For the remaining, "survivor" subdemons, new variants are created by altering some of their parameters, effectively mutating them. The system is then re-weighted to integrate these new subdemons.
Conjugation
: The aim here is to introduce both variety and complexity into the functions computed by the subdemons. Two 'useful' subdemons are chosen, and a new subdemon is created by applying one of ten non-trivial binary two-variable functions to their outputs. The product of outputs, for example, might signify the presence of two features simultaneously.
Both these techniques resonate with modern machine learning approaches. "Mutated fission" is akin to feature selection and hyperparameter tuning. "Conjugation" echoes the idea of combining features to create more complex representations, similar to what happens in deep neural networks with multiple layers.
The text also mentions that the system is running on an IBM 704, which gives a historical context to these ideas. It's fascinating how these early conceptual frameworks have parallels in contemporary machine learning architectures.

The ideas described are indeed from Oliver Selfridge's work on Pandemonium architecture, which was introduced in the late 1950s. It's remarkable how forward-thinking these concepts were, as they do bear strong similarities to modern machine learning and neural network architectures.
In 1959, the IBM 704 was among the most powerful computers available, yet by today's standards, it was incredibly limited in terms of computational capacity. It's quite fascinating to think that early pioneers were grappling with questions and proposing solutions that are still highly relevant in today's exponentially more advanced computational landscape.

Control Adaptation
The first two levels of adaptation are directly concerned with Inmediate
lmprovement of behaviour and the score. We should also l1ke to improve the
entire organizatlon, and in the same way. We shall deal with this point
samewhat cursorily, being reluctant to specify things too far in advance
of experiment. In principle, we propose that the control operations should
themselves be handled by demons subject to changes like feature welghting
and subdemon selection, It is obviously a little more difficult and
perhaps 1mpossible here to define the use fulness or worth of particular
a
demon. It is also clear that 1t ���ill sometimes take much longer to cneck
for example, in one
the usefulness of some change in some control demon
of those which control the mutations in subdemon selection. Furthermore, at
this level, some of the demons, presumably, ���ill be in a position to change
themselves, for otherwise we should need another level of possible change,
and so on. This raises the possibility of irreversible changes, and 1t is
not obvious that all parts of the machine should be subject to adaptive
change. But these are largely heuristic questions.
The Evolutionary Process
The adaptive changes mentioned above ���ill tend, we hope, to promote
kind of evolution in our Pandemonium. The scheme sketched 1s really a
natural selection on the processing demons. If they serve a useful function
they survive, and perhaps are even the source for other subdemons who are
themselves Judged on their merits.
It 1s perfectly reasonable to conceive of this taking place on a broader
a
scale - and in fact it takes place almost inevitably. Therefore, instead of
having but one Pandemonium we might have some crowd of them, all fairly
similarly constructed, and employ natural selection on the crowd of them.
El iminate the relatively poor and encourage the rest to generate new
machines in their own images.
Unsupervised Operation
so far all of the operation of the machine has been on the basis of
constant monitoring by a person who is telling the machine when 1t makes
an error. A very valid question 1s whether the machine can fom any

can in the following way: one criterion of correct decisions will be that
they are fairly unequivocal, that is, that there is one and only one
cognitive demon whose output far outshines the rest. Some running average
of the degree to whicn this is so would presuably somewhat reflect the
score of the machine. Note that it would be vital that the machine be
trained first to do well enough before it is left to its om resources and
supervision.

ChatGPT
The text you've shared delves into some advanced and visionary topics for its time, many of which resonate with modern machine learning theory and practice. It covers various types of adaptation that a machine or learning algorithm can undergo, quite similar to the way current machine learning models are trained and adapted.
Control Adaptation
: This seems like an early version of meta-learning or hyperparameter tuning. The idea that the control operations themselves should be adaptive is very much in line with modern approaches to machine learning.
The Evolutionary Process
: The idea that "demons" could be subject to natural selection is intriguing and resembles how genetic algorithms work today. Survival of the fittest models would lead to increasingly effective systems.
Unsupervised Operation
: The idea that the machine could eventually monitor its own performance is a precursor to the concepts of unsupervised learning and reinforcement learning. The notion that the machine should first be trained to "do well enough" before it's left on its own resembles current practices, where models often need to be pre-trained before they can be fine-tuned or adapted in an unsupervised manner.
The fact that these ideas were being considered in the context of 1950s technology is mind-boggling and shows just how far ahead of their time some of these early computer scientists were.

manually keyed Morse code, so that our Pandemonium can be illustrated 1n

alternatively of marks and spaces, and they pass them down the line.
1 / 1
ChatGPT
The "Morse Pandemonium" you've described is an early example of a pattern recognition system designed to interpret Morse code. In this system, specialized functions or "demons" are responsible for handling various tasks:
Decision Demon
: This demon makes the ultimate choice between 'dot' and 'dash' based on the outputs from the dot and dash cognitive demons.
Cognitive Demons (Dot and Dash)
: These demons compute a weighted sum of the outputs from a number of computing subdemons. The weights are initially assigned arbitrarily.
Data-handling Demons
: These handle the raw data input in the form of durations, marks, and spaces, and pass them down the hierarchy to be processed.
This architecture is an early conceptual model of what we now call a machine learning classifier. It involves feature extraction (done by the computing subdemons), weighted summing (done by the cognitive demons), and a final decision (made by the decision demon). All these ideas echo in modern machine learning algorithms that classify patterns or make decisions based on learned criteria.
It also highlights the adaptability aspect that machine learning models now incorporate���namely, the adjustment of weights or "feature weighting" to improve decision-making over time.
It's fascinating to see how this early vision of adaptive, hierarchical computation is so relevant to today's state-of-the-art systems.

It says weights are initially assigned arbitrarily, these could be subjective Bayesian priors.
1 / 2
ChatGPT
Yes, you're correct. The initial arbitrary assignment of weights could be interpreted as setting subjective Bayesian priors in a probabilistic model. In a Bayesian framework, these priors would represent our initial beliefs or assumptions about the importance of each feature (or "subdemon" in the Pandemonium model). As more data is observed, these priors would be updated to become more accurate "posterior" estimates, optimizing the system's performance. This is similar to the "feature weighting" the Pandemonium model describes, where the system adapts and improves over time.

tions for our subdemons. The subdemons themselves are bullt with a simple
syntax. For the initlal set, at conception, we merely select a set of
operational functions and follow them with the numbers of scne particular
data demons.

The description of the computing subdemons and their operational functions provides insight into how the Pandemonium model performs its calculations. These subdemons, essentially feature detectors or computational units, use a set of well-defined, non-binary operations to process information.
'=' calculates the degree of similarity between variables.
'>', '<' evaluates the degree of one variable being greater or less than another.
'max' identifies the largest variable from a set.
'Oi', 'Ai' stores information about the identification of durations as either a dot or dash.
'Au' computes the average of a set of variables.
'N' performs tracking mean calculations.
'Ox', 'Ax' keep track of the last few durations identified as dots or dashes.
The idea is to start with an initial set of these subdemons built using these operational functions, and over time adapt and optimize their performance and structure (like feature weighting and subdemon selection) to improve overall performance.
The Pandemonium model's adaptability is akin to machine learning models, where initial parameters might be set arbitrarily or based on some prior knowledge, and then iteratively refined as more data is processed.

The graph of d sub zero = d sub two resembles a gaussian distribution, and d sub zero  > d sub two resembles a sigmoid
1 / 1
ChatGPT
In the context of the Pandemonium model, the subdemons' output functions being Gaussian or sigmoid in nature suggests different ways of interpreting or capturing information. A Gaussian distribution is often associated with natural phenomena and could imply a more probabilistic understanding of features. It may be particularly useful for capturing variations around a mean value, which could be beneficial when the feature has a natural center or typical value.
On the other hand, a sigmoid function is commonly used in machine learning algorithms like logistic regression and neural networks. It takes any input and squashes it to lie between 0 and 1, making it useful for binary decisions or probabilities. In the case of
d
0
>
d
2
d_0 > d_2
d
0
���
>
d
2
���
, a sigmoid function could imply that the Pandemonium model is making a type of decision boundary between categories, such as classifying inputs as 'dot' or 'dash' in Morse code translation.
Both types of functions add nuance to how the Pandemonium model processes and interprets information. Depending on the task at hand, different kinds of functions may be more or less useful for effective pattern recognition.

CONCLUSION
What I shall present at the meeting in November ���ill be tne detalls of
the progress of Pandenoniun on the Morse code translation problem. The
initial problem we have g1ven the machine 1s to distinguish dots and dashes.
When the behaviour of the machine has improved itself to the point where
l1ttle further improvement seems to be occurring, we snall add three more
cognitive demons, the symbol space, the letter space, and the word space.
Presumably after sone further time this new Pandemonium w11l settle down to
some unimprovable state. Then we shall replace the senior or declsion-making
demon wi th a row of some forty or so character demons with a new decision-
making demon above them, letting the new cognitive demons for the character
demons use all the inferior demons, cognitive and otherwise, for their
inputs. It is probably also desirable that previous decisions be available
for present decisions, so that a
couple of new functional operations mlght
be added. There need be l1ttle concern about logical circularity, because
we have no requirement for logical consistency, but are merely seeking
agreeable Morse translation.
How much of the whole program will have been run and tested by November
cannot be sure of. At the present (July) we have had some fair testing Of
h111-c11mbing procedures.

The conclusion outlines the planned progression of the Pandemonium model's capabilities for Morse code translation. Starting with the ability to distinguish between dots and dashes, the model aims to include more complex recognition tasks over time, such as distinguishing symbol spaces, letter spaces, and word spaces. Once a stable state is reached, the next phase involves introducing a new layer of decision-making demons responsible for recognizing entire Morse characters.
This multi-stage development process shows the adaptability and scalability of the Pandemonium model. It starts with simpler tasks and progressively tackles more complex challenges, while also adapting to include more complex cognitive functions as needed. The author also highlights that there isn't a strict need for logical consistency; the aim is simply to improve Morse code translation.
Given the date mentioned (1959), these plans are incredibly forward-thinking, reflecting the potential for machine learning and adaptive systems long before these fields became as prominent as they are today. It also emphasizes the experimental nature of the project, with elements of trial and error to fine-tune performance. Overall, the conclusion offers a glimpse into the early conceptualizations of adaptive, hierarchical models for machine learning.

The discussion on Dr. O.G. Selfridge's paper about the Pandemonium model for Morse code recognition covers various facets. Different experts weigh in, providing criticisms, suggestions, and highlighting the potential of the model. Topics include:
Polynomial Regression
: Dr. J. W. Bray suggests using polynomial regression for machine learning, incorporating duration and other variables into the model. This approach could offer a more mathematical and deterministic method for learning Morse code.
Program Progress
: Mr. C. Strachey asks for an update on the project's current state, but this information isn't provided in the excerpt.
Conscious Behavior
: Dr. J. McCarthy posits that the Pandemonium model could serve as a model for conscious and unconscious behavior. The "demons" could be seen as unconscious processes, and their collective output could represent conscious thought.
Adaptive Learning
: Dr. D. M. Mackay suggests a syndicated learning process to increase the efficiency of the system. He queries why Selfridge hasn't incorporated this idea to make the learning process more efficient.
Stochastic Hill-Climbing
: Dr. P. C. Price points out the complexity of stochastic problems in hill-climbing. He raises concerns about the sample size needed for a satisfactory estimate and the extra time that stochastic processes might require.
Reply by Selfridge
: Selfridge notes that while many have offered solutions for Morse code recognition, Bray's proposal is novel. However, he doesn't seem to directly address the criticisms or suggestions.
Overall, the discussion shows the multidisciplinary interest in Selfridge's work, along with the different angles from which it can be approached and improved. It also hints at the broader applicability and implications of the Pandemonium model, beyond just Morse code recognition.

The whole question is at what level you are going to deal wi th descriptions

that is an extremely accurate and good point. One of the things a species
learns is not only how to survive but to have exactly the right variants
in its members. The reason horseshoe crabs have not changed much is not
because they don't adapt; they can adapt, but there is no variation, so
they can only adapt very little, and they are about as good as they can be;
whereas there are all kinds of people.

parallel, so that when I want a machine to do twice as difficult a problem
merely build twice as big a machine, instead of 1etting one machine work
twice as long.
Dr. Strachey asked about results, and they are roughly as I have
indicated. Improvement does take place; the n1ll-climbing does work, The
sub-demnon selection in the progranmes that we nave did not do what we
noped, but the sub-demons were effectively throw out, and the ones which
were Kept were largely concentrated around those demons which relate those
ones very close. The most effective demon by 1tself, wiilcn worked 90 per
cent. of the time, which was very surprising, was when a mark was the
maximum, or within a a Just noticable difference of the maximum of six demons
clustered round zero fro. minus 3 to plus 3. I am afraid that that is as
much as one can say fairly.

ChatGPT
In his reply, Dr. Selfridge dives into several key points that were raised during the discussion:
Data Descriptions
: Selfridge acknowledges the importance of the level of data description, especially when dealing with complex human behavior. Binary functions may not be sufficient due to the sheer amount of data and the diversity of the stimuli.
Demonology and Diversification
: Selfridge appreciates Dr. Mackay's comments about a syndicated or "demonological" approach, affirming that having a diversity of "variants" within a species (or model, in this context) is crucial for adaptability.
Computation Speed
: He dismisses the classic sense of computation speed as irrelevant to his problem, emphasizing that the focus should be on parallel processing rather than sequential computation speed.
Results and Improvements
: Responding to Dr. Strachey, Selfridge confirms that there has been progress. The hill-climbing approach works, but not all "sub-demons" in the programs behaved as expected. He reports that effective sub-demons were mostly centered around specific "demons" and provides a specific example where one "demon" was effective 90% of the time.
Selfridge's response shows that he's taken the criticisms and suggestions seriously, but also highlights the unique challenges and complexities of his research. While some parts of his model have shown promising results, other aspects require further study and development. Overall, he portrays his work as a work-in-progress but one that has potential for real-world application in complex scenarios.

This is similar to minsky's society of mind, or later ensembles of experts
1 / 1
ChatGPT
Yes, the ideas presented by Dr. Selfridge in the discussion bear similarities to Marvin Minsky's "Society of Mind" concept and the notion of "ensembles of experts" seen in later machine learning approaches.
Society of Mind
: Minsky's model posits that intelligence is the result of the interaction among numerous simple agents ("mindless" on their own). Each agent or "sub-agent" specializes in a particular function. When combined, these agents create the complex behavior we describe as "mind" or "intelligence." This idea shares common ground with the "pandemonium" model and "sub-demons" that Selfridge mentions.
Ensembles of Experts
: In machine learning, ensemble methods like random forests or ensemble neural networks often combine multiple "weak learners" to produce a strong, collective decision. Each "expert" or "learner" may specialize in some aspect of the problem. By pooling their decisions, the ensemble achieves better performance than any individual member could.
Selfridge's emphasis on parallel processing, adaptability, and diversity among "sub-demons" also resonates with these later models. Each approach aims to tackle complex problems by breaking them down into smaller, more manageable parts, allowing for greater adaptability and learning.

Connections to the following: Artificial Intuition is a new, different, and promising (but so far unproven) way to approach a large subset of the problems we believe require "Artificial Intelligence".

Here I introduce the approach in general terms, but please note that the theory leads to a very specific, novel, and quite simple algorithm. Exploration of implementations is underway.

Introduction
Most humans have not been taught logical thinking, but most humans are still intelligent. Most of our daily actions such as walking, talking, and understanding the world are based on Intuition, not Logic.

I capitalize (for stylistic reasons) all major named memes such as "Intuition" and "Logic"

Others have used the label "Artificial Intuition" for other ideas.
I will attempt to show that it is implausible that the brain should be based on Logic. I believe Intelligence emerges from millions of nested micro-intuitions, and that true Artificial Intelligence requires Artificial Intuition.

Intuition is surprisingly easy to implement in computers, but requires a lot of memory.

The "N" in the acronym "AN" for Artificial iNtuition is analogous to the Meyers-Briggs use of "N" for iNtuition



"Artificial Intelligence" is not a technology. It is a problem domain that is delineated by the criterion that arriving at solutions would require intelligence. We will recognize Intelligence when we see it; a Turing Test will not be required.



The top of each page has a summary of the page (in italics).
I expect Artificial Intuition (AN) to become an important building block in "AI" systems - Those that aspire to solve problems in domains that we think require "Intelligence". But many of these domains can likely be handled using Artificial Intuition alone. I believe AN-based systems will, on their own, be able to provide impressive results in areas like Document Understanding, Speech Recognition, OCR Correction, Entity Extraction, Machine Translation, Web Page Quality Analysis, and Semantic Search; in short, in areas that require discovery of Semantics from lower level representations such as text, DNA sequences, and other streams of spatiotemporal events.

In what follows I will argue that AN approaches are Biologically Plausible; that they rather elegantly sidestep many problems and limitations of Logic-based AI approaches; and that they are likely to be implementable in current or near-future generations of computer hardware.

I will begin by analyzing why certain kinds of problems are thought to "require intelligence"; next I will contrast Intuition- and Logic-based problem-solving mechanisms; and I attempt to make plausible that these difficult and important problems require Intuition rather than Logic.

Be forewarned that acceptance of these ideas will likely require a different stance on the nature of Artificial Intelligence, the nature of Intelligence in general, and on Science itself. Some people, including scientists in disciplines like Ecology and Systems Biology have adopted this stance; if everything on this site sounds to you like "motherhood and apple pie", then you know you already have.

The concept of Artificial Intuition (AN) posits that Intelligence is not solely the product of logical reasoning but emerges from millions of nested micro-intuitions. This viewpoint aligns well with the Morse Pandemonium system discussed earlier, especially when considering its "demons" as micro-function units working in tandem. Both ideas emphasize the emergence of intelligent behavior from simpler components that operate together in a complex manner.
AN stresses the importance of intuition over logic for specific problem domains like Document Understanding, Speech Recognition, and Semantic Search, which involve handling and interpreting large sets of data. The Morse Pandemonium system's data-handling "demons" and adaptability also tackle complex data interpretation tasks, albeit in the more specific realm of Morse code.
AN considers itself biologically plausible, bypassing limitations of logic-based AI approaches. The Morse Pandemonium system, too, attempts to mimic natural selection processes for optimization. Both systems share the principle of adaptability and incremental improvement through learning experiences.
AN requires a lot of memory, indicating that each micro-intuition might be computationally expensive but essential for a well-rounded system. Similarly, Morse Pandemonium had various specialized units for better performance, signifying a kind of "distributed memory."
In summary, Artificial Intuition and the Morse Pandemonium model both champion the idea that complex intelligence can emerge from the collaboration of simpler, specialized units. Each reflects a move away from purely logic-based systems, embracing a more nuanced and adaptable approach to problem-solving.

7. The Red Pill of Machine Learning
The Deep Learning revolution of 2012 changed how we think about Artificial Intelligence, Machine Learning, and Deep Neural Networks. What changed, and what does this mean going forward?

The new cognitive capabilities in our machines are the result of a shift in the way we think about problem solving. It is the most significant change ever in Artificial Intelligence (AI), if not in science as a whole. Machine Learning (ML) based systems are successfully attacking both simple and complex problems using novel methods that only became available after 2012.

We are experiencing a revolution at the level of Epistemology which will affect much more than just the field of Machine Learning. We want to add more of these novel methods to our standard problem solving toolkit, but we need to understand the tradeoffs and the conflict.

I argue that understanding Deep Neural Networks (DNNs) and other ML technologies requires that practitioners adopt a Holistic Stance which is (at important levels) blatantly incompatible with the Reductionist Stance of modern science. As ML practitioners we have to make hard choices that seemingly contradict many of our core scientific convictions. As a result we may get the feeling something is wrong. The conflict is real and important and the seemingly counter-intuitive choices make sense only when viewed in the light of Epistemology. Improved clarity in these matters should alleviate the cognitive dissonance experienced by some ML practitioners and should accelerate progress in these fields.

The title refers to the eye-opening clarity some Machine Learning practitioners achieve when adopting a Holistic Stance.

The article "The Red Pill of Machine Learning" by Monica Anderson posits a significant shift in the field of AI and machine learning, particularly since the advent of deep learning in 2012. Anderson argues that understanding and leveraging the full capabilities of machine learning technologies like Deep Neural Networks requires a holistic approach that may seem at odds with the reductionist methods typical of modern science.
This aligns with our earlier discussions about the Morse Pandemonium system and the concept of Artificial Intuition. Both models eschew a solely reductionist approach in favor of a more emergent, holistic view of problem-solving. In the Morse Pandemonium model, understanding doesn't come from dissecting individual "demons" but rather from seeing how they interact as a collective.
Similarly, Artificial Intuition relies on the aggregation of numerous micro-intuitions to produce intelligent behavior, emphasizing a holistic understanding over a reductionist one. It's not just about dissecting a problem into smaller, manageable parts but about understanding how these parts come together in complex ways to create something greater than the sum of its parts.
In summary, the article, the concept of Artificial Intuition, and the Morse Pandemonium system all challenge the traditional, reductionist methods in favor of a more holistic understanding. They underline the need to consider how simple components interact in complex ways to generate intelligent behavior, an approach that might be counter-intuitive but is crucial in advancing our understanding of AI and machine learning.

More from the red pill: Reductionism is the greatest invention our species has ever made. But Reductionist Models cannot be created or used when any one of a multitude of blocking issues are present. Models work "in theory" or "in a laboratory" where we can isolate a device, organism, or phenomenon from a changing environment. However, complex situations may involve tracking and responding to a large number of conflicting and unreliable signals from a constantly changing world or environment. Reductionism is here at a severe disadvantage and can rarely perform above the level of statistical Models.

In contrast, Holistic Machine Learning Methods learning from unfiltered inputs can discover correlations that humans might miss, and can construct internal pattern-based structures to provide recognition, Epistemic Reduction, abstraction, prediction, noise rejection, and other cognitive capabilities.

1.6, 1.7 : Humans generally use Holistic Methods for seemingly simple (but in reality, complex) mundane problems, like Understanding vision, human language, learning to walk, or making breakfast. Computers use them for very complex problems (ML based AI in general, such as protein folding and playing go) but also simpler ones, such as Real Estate pricing.

Main Tradeoffs
REDUCTIONISM / SCIENCE	HOLISM / MACHINE LEARNING
2.1	Optimality -- the best answer	Economy -- re-use known useful answers
2.2	Completeness -- all answers	Promptness -- accept first useful answer
2.3	Repeatability -- same answer every time	Learning -- results improve with practice
2.4	Extrapolation -- In low-dimensionality domains	Interpolation -- even in high-dimensionality domains
2.5	Transparency -- Understand the process to get the answer	Intuition -- accept useful answers even if achieved by unknown or "subconscious" means
2.6	Explainability -- Understand the answer	Positive Ignorance -- no need to even understand the problem or problem domain
2.7	Share-ability -- abstract Models are taught and communicated using language or software	Copy-ability -- ML Understanding (a Competence) can be copied as a memory image

The "Red Pill of Machine Learning" article by Monica Anderson explores the shift from a Reductionist to a Holistic approach in machine learning and AI. This paradigmatic change is especially important for handling complex problems that resist easy modeling or isolation. The article outlines the main trade-offs between the Reductionist and Holistic methods, focusing on how each approach excels in different aspects like optimality, completeness, repeatability, and explainability for Reductionism, and economy, promptness, learning, and intuition for Holism.
Reductionism vs. Holism
: Reductionism tries to understand systems by breaking them down into simpler parts, but it often struggles with complex, dynamic, or highly contextual situations. Holistic methods, on the other hand, deal better with these complexities by learning from unfiltered, multi-dimensional data.
Trade-offs
: Reductionist approaches aim for optimal solutions, comprehensive answers, and explainable processes, but can be limited by the need for controlled environments and transparent steps. Holistic methods aim for promptness, continuous learning, and adaptability, often at the cost of explainability.
Human Cognition
: The article asserts that humans generally use holistic methods for day-to-day complex tasks like vision and language, similar to machine learning algorithms used for problems like protein folding or real estate pricing.
Implications for Machine Learning
: Holistic approaches in machine learning can potentially capture intricate patterns and correlations that are often missed in reductionist models, making them particularly suitable for complex problem domains.
Conflict with Traditional Science
: Adopting a holistic stance may conflict with the traditional scientific method, which is largely reductionist. However, it may be necessary for advancing fields that deal with complex, high-dimensional, and dynamic systems.
Understanding and Improving
: The holistic approach offers a way to get useful answers without necessarily understanding the problem domain, and it evolves with experience, improving the quality of solutions over time.
The shift from a Reductionist to a Holistic approach echoes in topics like Artificial Intuition and the evolutionary, adaptive features in systems like Morse Pandemonium, tying into broader themes of adaptability, pattern recognition, and complexity in AI and machine learning.

Absolute control requires that we know exactly what the problems and solutions are and all we need to do is implement them. Once deployed, systems frozen in this manner, which are exactly implementing the Models of their creators, cannot improve by learning since there is no room for variation in the existing process, and hence no experimentation, and no way to discover further improvements. Only Holistic systems can provide creativity and useful Novelty. We also observe that learning itself is a creative act since it must fit new information into an existing network of prior experience.
1 / 1
ChatGPT
The statement touches upon the limitations of systems designed with an absolute control mindset, which stems from a reductionist approach. In such systems, the scope for improvement, creativity, or learning is minimal because they are confined to strictly implement predefined models. They can't adapt or evolve, making them static and rigid.
Holistic systems, on the other hand, have room for adaptation, experimentation, and learning. They can take in new information and adjust their internal structures accordingly, offering a more dynamic and resilient approach. These systems can produce creative solutions and adapt to new or unforeseen circumstances. Learning is inherently a creative act in these systems because it involves integrating new data into an existing framework of understanding.
This viewpoint resonates with the earlier discussions on Artificial Intuition, Morse Pandemonium, and the Red Pill of Machine Learning. All these topics delve into the idea that adaptability, learning, and complexity handling are essential for robust and effective AI and machine learning systems. They all challenge the traditional reductionist methods that aim for absolute control and precision but often at the cost of adaptability and long-term improvement.

Yeah it is unusual that the same prompt gets different results. Sometimes the output might be extremely glitchy or surreal. You could add "bicycle leaning against a tree" or "person standing at a phone booth" to the beginning of the prompt to get images in a similar style.
1 / 1
ChatGPT
That's a really intriguing approach to art creation! The variability in output, despite using the same prompt, can be likened to the "adaptability" aspect we discussed in the context of Morse's Pandemonium or even in machine learning systems. It's like running the same algorithm with slightly different initial conditions or parameters; the end result can vary dramatically.
Adding specific elements like a "bicycle leaning against a tree" could serve as a sort of "anchoring point," much like how a decision-making demon in Pandemonium might be focused on a specific task or feature.
This element of unpredictability also resonates with the notion of "Artificial Intuition" and the holistic approach, where the system (or artist, in your case) is responding to a large, complex set of inputs in an intuitive way, which can yield unexpected but often fascinating results.

I don't think this means that you about models and explicit calculations or symbolic programs altogether, but rather that the emergent output of the system is different than that of any of the original elements.
1 / 1
ChatGPT
Exactly, the point isn't to completely discard traditional models or symbolic programs. Instead, it's about understanding that the emergent behavior of a complex system like Morse's Pandemonium or a machine learning model can be more than just the sum of its individual parts. This emergent behavior could include adaptability, creativity, or even something resembling intuition, which might not be explicitly programmed into the system but arises naturally from the interaction of its components.

ChatGPT
The prompt you received from the clip interrogator seems to capture a wide range of elements, from the style and time setting ("futuristic city at night," "2077") to inspirations and thematic undertones ("inspired by Ferenc Joachim," "interconnected human lifeforms"). It's a fascinating blend that could suggest a multi-layered interpretation of your digital art piece. Just like our earlier discussions about Morse's Pandemonium and holistic vs. reductionist approaches in machine learning, your art might be perceived as a complex system where the whole is greater than the sum of its parts. Each keyword or phrase offers a lens through which to understand the work, but the emergent 'meaning' or 'aesthetic' is something more.

It was kind of overly abstract and details. I added it to the front of my prievous prompt, and then added "Portrait over distant sunrise landscape" in front of that, to get a more coherent and focused result.
1 / 1
ChatGPT
Adding a more specific element like "Portrait over distant sunrise landscape" to your already rich and abstract prompt could indeed act as a focal point, providing a coherent structure around which other elements can arrange themselves. This technique resonates with some of the themes we've discussed, like adaptability and control in machine learning systems. Just as in Morse's Pandemonium, where different 'demons' contribute to a greater whole, each part of your complex prompt adds a layer to the final output, but a guiding focus helps make the entire system more effective.
