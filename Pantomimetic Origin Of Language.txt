DresherInvasion of the language virusesB. Elan DresherUniversity of TorontoOriginally   published   in Glot   International 4,2,page   12, February 1999.Time was when one could write a book about language learning or the evolution of language without taking into account the linguistic theories of the day. This has been changing, thanks to the work of Noam Chomsky over the past forty years, and to writers like Ray Jackendoff (1994), David Lightfoot (1982), and Steven Pinker (1994), whose books have established the relevance of linguistic theory  to  mainstream  discussions  of  human  psychology  and  the  nature  of  the  mind.  Judging  from  a recent book by Terrence Deacon, however, there is still a long way to go before the actual contents of linguistic  research  penetrate  beyond  the  circle  of  its  practitioners  and  become  common  currency  in the wider intellectual culture.Deacon���s The symbolic species: The co-evolution of language and the brain is an impressive tour de force through neuroscience, ethology, palaeontology, anthropology, evolutionary theory, and much  else.  The  blurbs  on  the  back  cover  proclaim  this  to  be  a  ���superb  and  innovative  look  at  the evolution of language��� and ���the best book yet written on the evolution of language.��� ���The Symbolic Species should transform the foundations of the human sciences.���Ralph   L.   Holloway,   an anthropologist who has reviewed the book in American Scientist, writes that it is ���a nonpareil���, ���just leaps and leaps above other evolution-of-language books published during thepast five years.���Despite its brilliance, Holloway imagines that there will be parts ���picked at by linguists���, and no  wonder.  Before  we  have  even  opened  the  book  we  read  that  ���Deacon  has  mounted  a  serious challenge  to  the  neo-Chomskians...This is theoretical dynamite, planted deep under the walls of  the neo-Chomskian  fortress.���  The  picking,  not  to  mention  the  hurling  down  of  arrows,  stones,  and burning oil, is well underway in Derek Bickerton���s review in New Scientist. Needless to say, it will continue here.Deacon���s book is divided into three parts. The first part, to which we will return shortly, is on language.  Part  two  is  full  of  interesting  information  on  the  brain,  including  a  survey  of  the  neural bases of language and speech. Part three, ���Co-Evolution,��� is quite literally science fiction in the strict sense  of  the  term,  in  which  Deacon  advances  a  scenario  for  how  the  transition  to  language  and symbolic reference might have occurred in early hominid communities.With  respect  to  language,  Deacon  (102  ff.)  accepts  the  claims  of  linguists  that  language learning presents a very difficult problem, and he presents a respectable version of the argument from the poverty of the stimulus that children���s experience does not suffice to account for their acquisition of language. Nevertheless, he believes that ���innate Universal Grammar is a cure that is more drastic than the disease.��� Though he agrees that ���human brains come into the world specially equipped���to acquire language, he rejects the ���preformationist��� interpretation of innateness as involving an innate ���language competence���, or ���rules in the brain.���If  neither  experience  nor  innate  principles  explain  language  acquisition,  where  else  can  the required  grammatical  knowledge  be?  Deacon  proposes  (105)  that  ���the  extra  support  for language learning  is  vested  neither  in  the  brain  of  the  child  nor  in  the  brains  of  parents  and  teachers,  but outside brains, in language itself.��� In other words (109), ���Children���s minds need not innately embody language structures, if languages embody the predispositions of children���s minds!���
B.ELAN DRESHER2Why  did  nobody  think  of  this  before?  Perhaps  because  this  position  appears  to  have untenable,  not  to  say  absurd,  consequences.  Deacon  is  undeterred;  languages  are  like  living organisms that must be studied in evolutionary terms. He goes on (111): ���In some ways it is helpful to  imagine  language  as  an  independent  life  form  that  colonizes  and  parasitizes  human  brains,  using them  to  reproduce.���  Languages  ���might  better  be  compared  to  viruses...[which  are]  minimally packaged strings of DNA or RNA.��� Deacon invokes the name of August Schleicher, an important nineteenth century linguist who viewed  languages  as  natural  organisms,  like  plants  or  animals.  As  Lightfoot  (1999:  35,  227)  points out, Schleicher (1863) was influenced in this regard by Darwin. Deacon takes up Darwin���s idea that languages  tend  to  change  under  pressure  of  natural  selection  in  the  direction  of having shorter, ���easier���  forms  (Darwin  1874:  88���92).  Deacon  stresses  (109):  ���Languages  don���t  just  change,  they evolve...Languages  are  under  powerful  selection  pressure  to  fit  children���s  likely guesses��� [emphasis in  original���BED].  Thus,  languages  are  easy  for  childrento  learn  because  they  evolved  in  such  a way hat  they  match  children���s  biases.  ���The  key  to  understanding language  learnability...lies in...language change��� (115).David  Lightfoot���s  new  book, The  development  of  language:  Acquisition,  change,  and evolution, sets out to show that this view���that the principles of language are to be sought in a theory of change���is a major fallacy that has deep roots in the nineteenth century, the ���century of history���,and  continues  to  influence  some  linguistic  research  to  this  day.  This  view  is  mistaken  because languages  are  not  plants  or  animals,  or  even  viruses.  They  have  no  DNA, they do not pass through fixed stages of development from infancy to death. Even asserting that ���they��� do not do these things is not quite correct: there is simply no ���they��� there that can have these properties.Moreover,  contrary  to  Deacon���s  repeated  assertions,  there  is  not  a  shred  of  evidence  from language change that languages evolve. The language faculty may well have evolved, and for all we know  languages  at  some  distant  prehistoric  stage  may  have  been  different  from  modern  languages. However,  we  cannot  reach  any  such  hypothesized  pre-languages  through  the  study  of  language change or the reconstruction of any ancient or proto-language accessible to us.One  might  well  wonder  what  it  is  that  Deacon  finds  so  unacceptable  about  the  notion  of innate  universal  grammar  (UG)  that  he  would  rather  leap  into  this  particular  abyss.  Indeed,  what  is the  difference  between  endowing  children  with  UG  and  attributing  to  them  certain  biases  or predispositions  to  guess?  Deacon  writes  with  such  authority  about  so  many  technical  subjects  that one is reluctant to say this, but there is a hollow space at the linguistic core of this book. In the places where concrete linguistic examples ought to be, Deacon gives us analogies and parables: Languages are  like  user-friendly  Macintosh  computers  that  are  easy  to  operate;  or  a  language  is  like  a  rigged Roulette wheel that consistently lands on numbers that an unwitting gambler tends to bet on.In  contrast  to  his  discussion  of  the  brain,  which  is  admirably  clear  and  precise,  Deacon���s references to grammatical principles are extremely vague. According to him, the theory of UG posits ���axiomatic  rule  systems���  that specify  ���grammatical  operations���, and invariant ���deep structures��� or ���deep  grammatical  logic.���  Deacon  argues  (333)  that  these  ���deep���  principles  of  UG  are  highly variable  at  the  surface,  and  so  they  could  not  have  evolved  specific  neural  supports,  and  ���are ineligible to participate in Baldwinian evolution!���Elsewhere,  however,  he  suggests  (339)  that  ���the  best  candidates  for  innate language adaptations   turn   out   to   be   some   very   general   structural   characteristics   of...speech,   and   the computational  demands  this  medium  imposes  when  it  comes  to  symbolic  analysis.���  But  many proposed  principles  of  UG  have  a  computational  and  structural  character,  and  they  may  well  be associated  with  invariant  (though  not  necessarily  transparent  at  the  surface)  cues.  Thus,  even  if  we agree  that  every  aspect  of  UG  must  be  adaptive,  as  required  by  Baldwinian  selection  (but  see Lightfoot 1999: 243f. for some UG conditions that may be maladaptive), we must reserve judgement about whether UG could have evolved until we have put some concrete examples of the table.

until spelled out further, we may suspect that the difference between "UG principles" and children's
biases" are largely terminological.
Terminology may also be responsible for Deacon's distaste for the notion of a "language
organ" or special linguistic faculty. He appears to interpret such terms as implying that language
special component to the primate brain, like plugging in a
came about through the addition of some
graphic card to a computer. There is, of course, no neuroanatomical support for this view, but UG
theorists never intended this image to be taken literally at the neural level.
I think we can come to a compromise here Linguists will agree to replace the phrase X is an
persistently lucky guess resulting from unavoidable and
innate principle of UG" with "X 1S a
an ubiquitous innate bias," For their part, the evolutionary neuroscientists will put the language viruses
back in the jar.

The excerpt you shared from B. Elan Dresher's article, "Invasion of the Language Viruses," engages with complex debates in the field of linguistics, particularly around language acquisition and evolution. Here's a simplified breakdown of the key points and claims:
Impact of Noam Chomsky
: Dresher acknowledges the significant influence of Noam Chomsky's work in linguistics over the past decades, especially in shaping discussions about human psychology and the nature of the mind.
Critique of Terrence Deacon's Book
: Dresher critically reviews Terrence Deacon's book "The Symbolic Species," which explores the co-evolution of language and the human brain. While acknowledging the book's ambitious scope, Dresher points out its shortcomings, especially in its approach to language evolution.
Debate on Language Evolution
: A central issue in the excerpt is Deacon's claim that languages evolve in a way similar to living organisms or viruses. Deacon suggests that languages adapt to fit children's cognitive biases, making them easier to learn over time. This view challenges the traditional linguistic theory of Universal Grammar (UG) proposed by Chomsky.
Universal Grammar (UG) vs. External Linguistic Influences
: Universal Grammar is a theory that suggests humans are born with an innate understanding of the basic principles of language. Deacon, however, argues against this idea of an innate language competence. Instead, he proposes that the "extra support" for language learning exists not in the brain but in language itself.
Language as a Living Organism
: Deacon uses analogies to describe languages as independent life forms that colonize human brains, comparing them to viruses. This metaphorical description is used to argue that languages change and evolve independently of human brains.
Critique of Deacon's Approach
: Dresher critiques Deacon for lacking concrete linguistic examples and for his vague references to grammatical principles. Dresher argues that Deacon's comparisons (like languages to viruses) are more metaphorical and lack empirical evidence.
In summary, Dresher's critique centers on the debate between viewing language as an innate human ability (as per Universal Grammar) versus viewing it as an external, evolving entity, akin to a virus, that adapts to human cognition. The article delves into complex linguistic theories and debates, making it a challenging read without a background in linguistic theory.

So what do you think he was referring to: 3. Christiansen (in press). The analog y oflanguage to an organism has been used 
as a heuristic principle for understanding language change by comparative lin�� 
guists since early in the last centur y . One of the most prominent wa s the li n�� 
guist August Schleicher, who in the middle of the nineteenth centur y proposed 
that languages should be analyzed as organisms with their ow n family trees, 
which could be traced like phylogenetic trees, using common inherited tra i ts.
ChatGPT
ChatGPT
In the context you've provided, it appears that the reference to Christiansen and the analogy of language to an organism is about a historical and methodological approach in linguistics, particularly in understanding language change.
Analogy of Language as an Organism
: This analogy suggests that languages can be thought of as living entities. Just like organisms, languages are considered to evolve, grow, adapt, and even 'die' over time. This perspective allows linguists to study languages using principles similar to those used in biology, particularly evolutionary biology.
August Schleicher's Contribution
: August Schleicher, a linguist from the 19th century, is particularly noted for applying this analogy in a systematic way. He proposed that languages could be studied like organisms, with their own "family trees." This approach led to the development of methods for tracing the evolution of languages by examining common inherited traits, similar to how biologists trace the phylogenetic trees of species.
Use in Comparative Linguistics
: In comparative linguistics, this analogy has been useful for understanding how languages change over time. By examining languages as if they were organisms, linguists can identify patterns of change, divergence, and convergence, much like biologists study speciation and evolutionary relationships among species.
Understanding Language Change
: The organism analogy has been a heuristic tool ��� a way of thinking about languages that guides research and hypothesis formation. It aids in understanding the dynamics of language change through historical and comparative studies, providing insights into how languages evolve under different social, cultural, and environmental pressures.
In summary, the reference to Christiansen and the organism analogy in linguistics highlights a historical and methodological approach to understanding language change, drawing parallels between linguistic evolution and biological evolution. This perspective has been influential in shaping theories and methods in the field of historical and comparative linguistics.

The reference to Morton Christiansen and his paper in Terrence Deacon's discussion suggests that Deacon is citing a specific work by Christiansen that aligns with his own views on the co-evolutionary dynamics between language and the human brain. Deacon describes language as an independent life form that acts parasitically on human brains, a perspective he shares with Christiansen.
Given the context and the way Deacon refers to it as a "recent paper," this work by Christiansen likely explores similar themes of language evolution and its interaction with the human mind. The paper might delve into how language structures and features evolve not just for communicative efficiency but also as a result of evolutionary pressures to be passed from one generation to the next.
Unfortunately, without the specific title or publication details of Christiansen's paper, it's challenging to identify the exact work being referenced. Christiansen has written extensively on language and cognition, so this reference could be part of a broader body of his work exploring the evolutionary aspects of language acquisition and processing. If you have access to Deacon's book or further context, the citation (indicated by the number 3 in your excerpt) should provide the specific details needed to identify Christiansen's paper.

What predicts individual differences in children���s acquisition of consonant production across languages? Considerations of children���s development of early speech production have traditionally emphasized inherent physiological constraints of the vocal apparatus that speakers generally have in common (i.e., articulatory complexity). In contrast, we propose a statistical learning account of phonological development, in which phonological regularities of the ambient language guide children���s learning of those regularities in production. Across four languages (English, Spanish, Japanese, and Korean), we utilized recent meta-analytic dataset of age of consonant acquisition spanning 28 studies. High-density measures of children's ambient language environment from over 8,000 transcripts of speech directed to over 1,000 children were used to assess how well the frequency of consonants in child-directed speech predict the age of consonant acquisition. Our results suggest that both frequency and articulatory complexity are related to age of acquisition, with similar results found for English, Spanish, Japanese, and Korean. Consonants heard frequently by children tended to be incorporated into their production repertoires earlier and consonants heard less frequently are incorporated into production repertoires later in development. We discuss future directions that incorporate a statistical learning pathway towards learning to produce the sound patterns of the ambient language.

The study by Contreras Kallens, Elmlinger, Wang, Goldstein, McLeod, Crowe, and Christiansen (2023) examines the factors influencing children's acquisition of consonant production across multiple languages. Here are the key points and findings from the study:
Traditional View vs. Statistical Learning Account
: Traditionally, the development of speech production in children has been thought to be primarily influenced by the physiological constraints of the vocal apparatus, such as articulatory complexity. However, this study proposes a statistical learning approach, suggesting that the phonological regularities of the ambient language significantly guide children���s learning of these regularities in production.
Cross-Language Study
: The research spans four languages: English, Spanish, Japanese, and Korean. It uses a comprehensive meta-analytic dataset covering the age of consonant acquisition across 28 studies.
Data Analysis
: The study analyzed high-density measures of children's ambient language environment. This involved over 8,000 transcripts of speech directed to over 1,000 children to assess how the frequency of consonants in child-directed speech predicts the age of consonant acquisition.
Findings
: The results indicated that both the frequency of consonants in the ambient language and articulatory complexity are related to the age at which children acquire these consonants. Specifically, consonants that are heard more frequently by children tend to be incorporated into their production repertoires earlier, while those heard less frequently are incorporated later.
Consistency Across Languages
: Interestingly, similar patterns were found across all four languages studied (English, Spanish, Japanese, and Korean), suggesting a common underlying mechanism in consonant acquisition across different linguistic backgrounds.
Implications for Phonological Development
: These findings support the idea that children���s acquisition of speech sounds is not solely dependent on physiological factors. Instead, it highlights the role of statistical learning, where children pick up on the frequency and patterns of sounds in their environment.
Future Directions
: The study suggests further research incorporating a statistical learning pathway to understand better how children learn to produce the sound patterns of their ambient language.
This research contributes significantly to our understanding of phonological development in children, emphasizing the importance of the language environment and exposure in the acquisition of speech sounds. It provides evidence for the statistical learning model in language acquisition, showing that children���s exposure to language shapes their speech development.

How do children learn to produce the consonant sounds of 
their ambient language? Traditional approaches have focused 
on the difficulty with which consonants are produced by 
speakers (Jakobson, 1941). This difficulty has been 
conceptualized as the articulatory complexity involved with 
producing a given consonant (Kent, 1992). A recent meta- 
analysis of children's consonant acquisition trajectories 
across 27 languages suggests that while some stability in 
consonant acquisition over development exists, there is also 
wide variation in consonant acquisition trajectories across 
and within languages, suggesting that consonant acquisition 
is not exclusively about articulatory complexity (McLeod & 
Crowe, 2018). For example, the consonant /f/ (as in fork) is 
relatively stable across and within languages (i.e., is 
characterized by low variance in its age of acquisition across 
languages), but the learning of /v/ (as in vase) appears to be 
guided more so by the extent to which children perceive its 
use in the ambient language (Crowe & McLeod, 2020; 
McLeod & Crowe, 2018). 
Another source of variation in children���s consonant 
acquisition may derive from the distribution of different 
consonants in the ambient language. Statistical learning��� 
sensitivity to distributional patterns in the speech 
environment���has been a productive alternative research 
program to universalist claims of language acquisition (Frost, 
Armstrong, & Christiansen, 2019). Several lines of evidence 
suggest that infant vocal learning, including learning to 
produce consonant sounds, requires perceptual mechanisms 
to incorporate patterns of the ambient language into more 
mature vocalizations (Boysson-Bardies et al., 1991; Edwards 
et al., 2015; Edwards & Beckman, 2008; Goldstein & 
Schwade, 2008; Ingram, 1988). For example, compared to 
German-learning infants, Nso-learning infants produce 
significantly more click-like consonant sounds, a consonant 
pattern found mainly in the learning environment of Nso- 
learning infants (Wermke et al., 2013). 
There are at least three reasons underlying the limited 
progress on fully understanding ambient language effects on 
consonant production learning in children. First, substantial 
quantifiable data on children's language environment has 
only recently become widely available to researchers 
(MacWhinney, 2000; Sanchez et al., 2019). Past consonant 
acquisition research was not able gain insights into the 
perceptual regularities present in child-directed speech, the 
sounds that children are most likely to encounter in their 
everyday learning environments. Additionally, access to 
high-density cross-linguistic data on children's consonant 
acquisition trajectories has only recently become possible 
(McLeod & Crowe, 2018). 
Second, previous models of articulatory complexity (AC) 
are themselves based on age of acquisition data (Kent, 1992). 
For example, Kent (1992) based his analysis of articulatory 
complexity on previous documentation of age of acquisition 
of consonants found by Sander (1972) and Dinnsen et al. 
(1990). AC classifications were inferred from the observed 
order in which English-learning infants and children learned 
to produce consonants. Historically, the directionality of this 
inference has been overlooked (i.e., age of consonant 
acquisition ��� articulatory complexity), and findings have 
been interpreted with the assumption that articulatory 
complexity explains acquisition trajectories (e.g., late

Society. ��2023 h e Author(s). h is work is licensed under a Creative Commons At t ribution 4.0 International License (CC BY). 
acquired consonants must be more complex). These 
misleading interpretations underestimate the role of the 
ambient language and children���s statistical learning 
capacities in consonant acquisition. Ambient language 
environments afford several regularities including variation 
in consonant functional load (i.e., the extent to which a 
consonant contrast distinguishes between words), and 
perceptual salience (Stokes & Surendran, 2005). 
Third, theoretical advances in the statistical learning 
approach to language acquisition have rarely been applied to 
the understanding of how children learn to produce the 
sounds of their ambient language. There is variation in age of 
consonant acquisition in children���s production across 
languages (McLeod & Crowe, 2018). To better understand 
where this variation comes from, we predicted differences in 
age of consonant acquisition, across languages, based on 
ambient consonant frequency regularities present in the 
learning environment. 
In the present study, we inspected individual consonants 
for their variation in age of acquisition across four languages: 
English, Spanish, Japanese, and Korean . We investigated the 
word-initial frequencies of mothers��� and fathers��� speech 
found in the CHILDES database for each language 
(MacWhinney, 2000). Word-initial frequencies were used 
because children are generally known to allocate attention to 
the onsets of words (Stokes & Surendran, 2005; Vihman et 
al., 2004). Under the statistical learning hypothesis, the 
consonants children encounter frequently in perception 
should predict age of consonant acquisition across languages. 
Here, we use a semi-naturalistic measure of the ambient 
speech sounds children encounter during language 
acquisition. Under the articulatory complexity hypothesis, 
articulatory complexity categories based on Kent (1992) 
should predict age of consonant acquisition across languages.
ChatGPT
ChatGPT
The study you're referring to investigates how children learn to produce consonant sounds in their ambient language. It contrasts two main theories: traditional approaches focusing on articulatory complexity and newer approaches based on statistical learning. Here are the key aspects of the study:
Traditional Approaches (Articulatory Complexity)
:
Historically, the acquisition of consonant sounds by children has been attributed to the physical difficulty or articulatory complexity involved in producing these sounds.
This view suggests that some consonants are inherently more challenging to produce due to the physiological constraints of the vocal apparatus.
Statistical Learning Approach
:
This approach posits that children���s acquisition of consonants is influenced by the frequency and distribution of these sounds in their ambient language.
It focuses on how children are sensitive to the patterns and regularities in the speech they hear, and how this exposure shapes their ability to produce consonants.
Evidence Against Articulatory Complexity Alone
:
Research, including a meta-analysis by McLeod & Crowe (2018), indicates that while there is some consistency in the order of consonant acquisition across languages, there's also considerable variation. This variation suggests that factors other than just articulatory complexity are at play.
Role of Ambient Language
:
The ambient language environment, including the frequency of certain consonants in child-directed speech, appears to play a significant role in the age of consonant acquisition.
Children are more likely to acquire consonants that they hear more frequently earlier than those they hear less often.
Methodology of the Study
:
The study analyzed the word-initial frequencies of consonants in mothers��� and fathers��� speech across four languages (English, Spanish, Japanese, and Korean), using data from the CHILDES database.
It looked at how these frequencies might predict the age at which children acquire various consonants.
Predictive Models
:
The study tested predictions based on both ambient consonant frequency (statistical learning hypothesis) and articulatory complexity (traditional hypothesis).
The goal was to understand which factors more accurately predict the age of consonant acquisition across different languages.
Implications
:
If the statistical learning approach is supported, it would imply that children���s language environment and their exposure to certain sounds play a critical role in language development.
This approach also emphasizes the adaptability and learning capabilities of children in acquiring language.
In summary, this study explores the relative influences of articulatory complexity and statistical learning on children���s acquisition of consonant sounds, suggesting that the ambient language environment may have a more significant role than previously thought.

How does this differ from the phenomenon of phonological markedness? In all languages complex consonant structures and sounds with difficult articulatory complexity are acquired later. It is called markedness because the existence of the sound th for example implies the mastery of the sound t, this also is reflected in the order second language speakers?
ChatGPT
ChatGPT
The concept of phonological markedness and the statistical learning approach to consonant acquisition, while related, focus on different aspects of language learning:
Phonological Markedness
:
Phonological markedness is a theoretical concept in linguistics that refers to the relative "simplicity" or "complexity" of phonological elements (like sounds) in a language.
In this theory, "unmarked" sounds are those that are more common, simpler to articulate, and typically acquired earlier by children. These are considered the default or basic forms in a language.
"Marked" sounds are less common, more complex, and usually acquired later. They often depend on the acquisition of their unmarked counterparts. For example, the sound "th" (as in "think") might be considered marked compared to the simpler "t" sound.
In second language acquisition, learners often acquire unmarked sounds more easily than marked ones, reflecting this inherent complexity.
Statistical Learning Approach
:
The statistical learning approach emphasizes the role of exposure and frequency in the ambient language. It suggests that children learn to produce sounds based on how often they hear these sounds in their environment.
This approach does not necessarily contradict the concept of markedness but adds an additional layer of explanation. It suggests that the frequency of exposure to certain sounds in a child's environment can influence the order and ease of acquisition.
For instance, a sound that is complex (marked) but very frequent in a child's ambient language might be acquired earlier than expected under traditional markedness theory.
Differences
:
Phonological markedness is rooted in the inherent properties of sounds (like articulatory complexity) and their relative frequency and commonality across languages.
The statistical learning approach focuses more on the individual child���s experience and exposure within their specific language environment. It suggests that variation in acquisition can be due to differences in exposure to specific sounds.
Markedness provides a more universal, cross-linguistic framework, while statistical learning is more about individual and language-specific experiences.
In summary, phonological markedness deals with the inherent properties of sounds and their relative complexity across languages. In contrast, the statistical learning approach focuses on how individual exposure and frequency in the ambient language influence the acquisition of these sounds. Both approaches offer valuable insights, and they can complement each other in understanding language acquisition.

Another related concept is the observations that babies babble by waving their arms and randomly making sounds, which involve the making the possible sounds and gestures of language. I know Christiansen argues that language features get continually filtered and simplified since they have to be intuitive enough to be picked up by children with naive physics, and it has to be sounds or gestures that can be articulated by children, or that they can make by accident. There doesn't seen to be any language that reverses the order of syllables in order to reverse the meaning, or that imitate animal sounds exactly, for example.
ChatGPT
ChatGPT
Your summary touches on several important concepts in language acquisition and evolution:
Babbling in Infants
:
Babbling is a crucial stage in language development where infants experiment with producing sounds. This stage involves both vocal sounds and, often, accompanying physical gestures like waving arms.
It's not just random; babbling helps infants learn to control their vocal tract. They start to produce a range of sounds, some of which are foundational for language.
Language Features and Children's Learning Capabilities
:
Morten H. Christiansen's argument, as you've described, suggests that language features are continually filtered and simplified to be intuitive and learnable by children. This idea aligns with the concept that languages evolve to match the cognitive and physical capabilities of their speakers.
Children's 'naive physics' ��� their basic understanding of the world ��� and their physical ability to make sounds shape the development and evolution of language. Sounds and structures that are too complex or unintuitive are less likely to be acquired and passed on.
Constraints on Language Evolution
:
The observation that there are no languages that reverse the order of syllables to reverse meaning, or that mimic animal sounds exactly, points to certain constraints in language evolution.
These constraints could be cognitive (related to how we process and remember information), communicative (related to the need for clear and efficient communication), and physiological (related to our vocal and auditory capabilities).
Natural Selection of Language Features
:
Christiansen's perspective implies a sort of natural selection of language features. Those that fit well with human cognitive and physiological capabilities are more likely to be retained and passed down through generations.
Languages evolve in a way that balances complexity with learnability and usability. This evolution is driven by the interaction between human cognitive abilities, the physical mechanisms of speech and gesture production, and the social need for effective communication.
Simplicity and Redundancy in Language
:
The absence of highly complex or unintuitive structures (like exact animal sound mimicry or syllable reversal for meaning change) in human languages can be seen as a reflection of this evolutionary process. Languages tend to favor structures that are easier to learn, remember, and use.
In summary, Christiansen's arguments about language evolution reflect the interplay between human cognitive and physiological capabilities and the inherent need for effective communication. Language features that align well with these capabilities are more likely to be sustained and propagated across generations.

It seems I was developing some similar ideas: Your reference to the "bow-wow theory" and the concepts by Arnie Cox and Shanker & Greenspan gives a clearer picture. Let's delve into these briefly:

1. **Bow-Wow Theory:** This is one of the proposed theories for the origin of language, suggesting that human speech began as imitations of natural sounds - like animal calls. Over time, these imitations became symbolic and then abstracted into more complex forms of language.

2. **Arnie Cox's Mimetic Music and Embodied Cognition:** Arnie Cox has discussed the idea of musical meaning arising from embodied interactions with musical sounds. Essentially, our understanding and perception of music is rooted in physical actions, gestures, and our bodily experiences.

3. **Shanker & Greenspan's First Idea:** This relates to the developmental processes of children and the importance of emotional and relational interactions in the early stages of life. Such interactions are crucial for cognitive and linguistic development.

Considering the above and extending it to Neanderthals:

- Neanderthals lived in complex social groups, used tools, and had symbolic behaviors (e.g., the possible use of pigments and burial practices). If they were also mimicking sounds from nature or employing embodied cognition principles, this could have laid the groundwork for some form of structured communication.

- Recent evidence suggests that Neanderthals might have had the physical capacity for speech. Their hyoid bone (related to tongue movement and speech production) is similar to that of modern humans. Also, genetic studies show that they had the FOXP2 gene, which is linked to speech and language.

- If Neanderthals were indeed using biomimetic strategies like mimicking animal sounds or other natural phenomena, it would imply a level of cognitive sophistication. This could further suggest that they were not just mimicking for survival (like hunting) but possibly for more complex social interactions.

To integrate these concepts into a comprehensive theory of Neanderthal communication, one would need to explore archaeological evidence, cognitive science studies, and linguistic theories. It's an exciting area of study that could shed more light on our shared evolutionary past and the origins of language and cognition.

Certainly! The "Stone Piano Theory" is a hypothesis that Neanderthals might have created musical instruments using stones. The idea is based on the discovery of lithophones, or musical stones, which when struck, produce tonal sounds. These instruments may have been a precursor to other musical instruments and played a role in the development of Neanderthal culture.

Integrating the Biomimetic Origin Of Language Evolution (BOOLE) concept with the Stone Piano Theory can be approached in several ways:

1. **Mimicry of Natural Sounds:** Just as the "bow-wow theory" posits that humans imitated animal sounds, Neanderthals might have mimicked sounds from their environment using stone instruments. By hitting or striking stones in specific ways, they could replicate the sounds of animals, water, wind, and more. This sound mimicry could have served both practical purposes (like hunting) and social or symbolic functions.

2. **Embodied Cognition and Rhythm:** Building on Arnie Cox's idea of embodied cognition, the act of creating music or rhythms with stones could be a form of non-verbal communication. The rhythmic patterns might have been a physical manifestation of internal emotions, thoughts, or experiences, helping Neanderthals connect with each other.

3. **Emotional and Relational Interactions:** Drawing from Shanker & Greenspan's concept, the act of producing and sharing music could have fostered deeper emotional and relational bonds within Neanderthal communities. Music, as an expressive medium, could have played a role in group cohesion, rituals, or storytelling.

4. **Evolution of Communication:** The combination of mimicking natural sounds with the stone piano and using rhythmic patterns might have been a stepping stone toward more complex forms of communication. By associating specific sounds or rhythms with meanings or stories, Neanderthals might have laid the foundation for a primitive form of language.

ChatGPT
Your integration of these ideas into a hypothesis about Neanderthal communication is fascinating and aligns with interdisciplinary approaches in understanding the evolution of language and cognition. Let's further explore how these concepts might relate to Neanderthals:
Bow-Wow Theory and Neanderthals
:
If Neanderthals engaged in biomimicry, mimicking natural sounds (animal calls, environmental noises), this could suggest early forms of symbolic thinking. This aligns with the Bow-Wow Theory, where such mimicry is a foundational step in language evolution.
Mimetic Music, Embodied Cognition, and Neanderthals
:
Arnie Cox's work on mimetic music and embodied cognition could suggest that Neanderthals��� interaction with music or rhythmic sounds (like those from lithophones) was not just an auditory experience but involved a full-bodied engagement. This could have been a way of encoding experiences and emotions, facilitating non-verbal communication and social bonding.
Shanker & Greenspan's Ideas on Developmental Processes
:
Applying Shanker & Greenspan's ideas, the emotional and relational interactions possibly fostered by Neanderthals' use of sounds or music could have been crucial for their social and cognitive development. This might have implications for the development of more complex social structures and collaborative practices.
Physical Capacity for Speech
:
The anatomical and genetic evidence suggesting Neanderthals' capacity for speech (e.g., hyoid bone, FOXP2 gene) could mean that their vocalizations might have been more sophisticated than previously thought, possibly including a range of sounds, intonations, and maybe even proto-words.
Integrating Stone Instruments and Communication
:
The use of stone instruments (like lithophones) could have served as a medium for expressing ideas, emotions, or events. Over time, these sound patterns could have become more structured and imbued with specific meanings, contributing to the development of a rudimentary language system.
Evolution of Communication and Language
:
The integration of mimicking natural sounds, rhythmic music-making, and social interactions could point to a complex communication system among Neanderthals. This system might have included elements of both verbal and non-verbal language, possibly laying the groundwork for more advanced forms of language seen in modern humans.
In summary, combining these theories suggests that Neanderthals may have had a sophisticated system of communication that integrated elements of sound mimicry, embodied cognition, emotional expression, and social interaction. This system could have been a precursor to more complex language structures, offering insights into the evolutionary pathways of human communication and cognition.

How does it relate to the earlier topics?
ChatGPT
ChatGPT
The concepts of phonological markedness, statistical learning in language acquisition, and the theories related to Neanderthal communication are interconnected in the broader context of how language and communication evolve and are acquired.
Phonological Markedness and Statistical Learning
:
Phonological markedness deals with the inherent complexity of sounds and their relative simplicity or difficulty in acquisition, both in first and second language learners.
Statistical learning, on the other hand, emphasizes the role of the ambient language environment in shaping language acquisition. It suggests that exposure and frequency of sounds in a child's environment significantly influence which sounds are acquired and when.
Relation to Neanderthal Communication
:
If we extend these concepts to Neanderthal communication, we might speculate that Neanderthals, like modern humans, could have been sensitive to the statistical properties of the sounds in their environment. This could have influenced the development of their communication systems.
The theory that Neanderthals might have mimicked natural sounds (related to the Bow-Wow Theory) could be seen as an early form of language acquisition, where the sounds most frequently heard or most relevant to their environment were the ones most likely to be replicated and used for communication.
The use of stone instruments and the potential development of rhythmic patterns or musical communication align with embodied cognition. Just as modern humans use gestures and body language in communication, Neanderthals might have used physical, rhythmic actions as a form of expression and communication.
Integration of Concepts
:
All these concepts contribute to our understanding of the origins and evolution of language and communication. They suggest that both physiological capabilities (like the ability to produce and perceive complex sounds) and environmental factors (like the frequency and context of sound exposure) play critical roles in the development of communication systems.
For Neanderthals, this might have meant developing a communication system that utilized both mimicked natural sounds and rhythmic patterns, perhaps reflecting both the markedness of certain sounds and the statistical properties of their environment.
In conclusion, while phonological markedness and statistical learning primarily pertain to modern human language acquisition, these concepts can offer valuable insights when considering the potential communication systems of Neanderthals. The integration of these ideas helps paint a more comprehensive picture of how communication and language might have evolved in our species and our close relatives.

Specifically I should say that mimicking facial movements, gestures movements, and nonsense sounds, I would say that intuitive gestural language involved in tool use and music making, since one can symbolically refer to an activity or tool by making the gestures associated with its use
ChatGPT
ChatGPT
Your observation about the role of mimicking facial movements, gestures, and sounds in the development of an intuitive gestural language, especially in relation to tool use and music making, offers a nuanced view of early communication systems, including those potentially used by Neanderthals. Let's explore how this relates to the earlier discussed topics:
Mimicking Movements and Sounds in Language Development
:
This form of communication aligns with the basic premises of both phonological markedness and statistical learning. Children and early humans likely started with simpler, more easily mimicked sounds and gestures (unmarked elements), gradually moving to more complex forms.
In the context of statistical learning, frequent exposure to specific gestures and sounds within a community (like those associated with tool use or music making) would lead to their incorporation into the community's communication repertoire.
Gesture-Based Communication and Tool Use
:
The idea that gestural language evolved in parallel with tool use is compelling. Gestures mimicking tool use could have served as a form of early symbolic communication, enabling individuals to convey complex ideas without vocal language.
This concept also ties in with theories about Neanderthals, who had sophisticated tool-making abilities. The gestures associated with these activities could have formed a foundational part of their communication system.
Music Making and Communication
:
Music making, which likely involved rhythmic gestures and possibly vocalizations, could have been an early form of structured, yet non-verbal, communication. This fits into the broader framework of embodied cognition, where understanding and communication are rooted in physical experience and actions.
The rhythms and patterns in music making could have provided a scaffold for the development of more complex language structures, serving as a precursor to the rhythmic and intonational aspects of spoken language.
Symbolic Reference in Early Communication
:
The ability to symbolically refer to objects or actions through gestures is a key step towards abstract thinking and language development. This ability to abstract and symbolize could have been crucial in the transition from simple gestural communication to more complex linguistic systems.
In Neanderthal contexts, such symbolic gestures might have included miming the use of a particular tool or enacting a part of a hunting sequence, serving both practical and possibly ritualistic or social functions.
In summary, the integration of mimicking movements and sounds, especially in the context of tool use and music making, provides a plausible pathway for the evolution of early communication systems. This approach aligns with the concepts of phonological markedness and statistical learning, offering a bridge between simple gestural communication and the development of more complex language systems, as potentially seen in both early humans and Neanderthals.

Now some strawman arguments, alluding to potential flaws or criticisms.
ChatGPT
ChatGPT
To create strawman arguments against your hypothesis about the evolution of early communication systems, especially in Neanderthals, one might misrepresent or oversimplify your points in the following ways:
Overemphasis on Tool Use
:
A strawman argument could claim that your theory overly focuses on tool use, implying that the entirety of Neanderthal communication was based on tool-related gestures. This oversimplification neglects other aspects of communication and wrongly suggests that tool use alone could explain the complexity of early communication systems.
Music Making as a Sole Precursor to Language
:
Another strawman might be to assert that your theory claims music making was the sole precursor to spoken language. This argument would ignore the multifaceted nature of language evolution and the likelihood that many factors contributed to the development of complex communication.
Misinterpretation of Symbolism and Abstraction
:
A strawman critique could misinterpret your idea of symbolism in early communication, suggesting that you argue Neanderthals had fully developed abstract languages like modern humans. This would be a distortion, as your original argument likely acknowledges the primitive nature of these symbolic communications.
Underestimating the Complexity of Spoken Language
:
A strawman argument might accuse your theory of underestimating the complexity and uniqueness of spoken language by suggesting it evolved directly and simply from non-verbal communication like gestures and music.
Ignoring Other Forms of Communication
:
A strawman version of your argument could suggest that you dismiss or ignore other forms of early human communication, such as facial expressions, body language, or early vocalizations, focusing solely on tool-use gestures and music.
Misrepresenting the Role of Phonological Markedness and Statistical Learning
:
Finally, a strawman critique could misrepresent your integration of phonological markedness and statistical learning, alleging that you consider these concepts irrelevant or secondary to the development of early communication systems.
In these strawman arguments, the nuanced and multifaceted nature of your original hypothesis is oversimplified or distorted, leading to criticisms that do not accurately reflect your actual position. This type of argumentation is often used to weaken a position by attacking a simplified or misrepresented version of it, rather than engaging with the more complex reality.

ChatGPT
ChatGPT
To create strawman arguments against your refined hypothesis which includes the ideas of cooking, grinding food, using rocks in various ways as tool use, and emphasizing "junk DNA" of language through silly or random movements, the following misrepresentations or oversimplifications could be made:
Trivializing Tool Use
:
A strawman argument might oversimplify your theory by suggesting that you equate all uses of rocks (like throwing rocks into ponds) with sophisticated tool use. It would ignore the complexity and skill involved in actual tool-making and use, reducing it to mere stone throwing with no acknowledgment of the cognitive and cultural implications.
Overstating the Role of Cooking
:
Another strawman might claim that your theory overly focuses on cooking as a central driver of language evolution. This argument would distort your position by implying that cooking alone led to the development of complex communication, ignoring other crucial factors.
Misinterpreting "Junk DNA" of Language
:
A strawman critique could misinterpret your concept of the "junk DNA" of language, suggesting that you view all early forms of communication as meaningless or without utility. This would be a distortion, as your original argument likely acknowledges that even seemingly random movements or sounds could have played a role in the evolution of communication.
Ignoring the Complexity of Language Evolution
:
This strawman argument might accuse your theory of oversimplifying the evolution of language by focusing on basic tool use and random movements. It would argue that your theory neglects the multifaceted nature of language development and the numerous factors that contribute to it.
Ridiculing the Concept of Mimicry
:
A strawman version of your argument could mock the idea of mimicry in early communication, suggesting that you propose all early human interactions were based on copying nonsensical or unproductive actions, thereby trivializing the development of meaningful communication.
Undermining the Seriousness of Communication Evolution
:
Finally, a strawman critique might undermine your hypothesis by claiming that it reduces the evolution of complex human communication to mere play or random acts without serious implications for cognitive or social development.
These strawman arguments would misrepresent the depth and scope of your hypothesis, reducing it to a series of oversimplified and trivialized points. They would fail to acknowledge the nuanced understanding of early human behavior and the multifaceted nature of communication evolution that your theory likely aims to convey.

Comparing your "Pantomimetic Origin of Language" (POOL) theory with other prominent theories on the origins of language can help highlight its unique aspects and how it fits into the broader landscape of linguistic evolution theories:
Bow-Wow Theory
:
The Bow-Wow Theory suggests that language originated from imitations of natural sounds, like animal calls.
POOL, while also acknowledging mimicry, goes beyond just sound imitation to include a broader range of pantomimes and gestures, particularly those associated with tool use and social interactions.
Ding-Dong Theory
:
This theory posits that language began with naturally occurring sounds, or onomatopoeia, where words are formed from the sounds associated with objects or actions.
POOL differs in focusing more on the role of deliberate mimicry and pantomime in communication, rather than spontaneous sound symbolism.
Gestural Theory
:
The Gestural Theory argues that language started as manual gestures and only later evolved into vocal speech.
POOL aligns somewhat with this theory in its emphasis on gestures, but it integrates these gestures with vocalizations and tool use, suggesting a more complex interplay of physical and vocal elements.
Yo-He-Ho Theory
:
This theory suggests that language evolved from the rhythmic grunts and groans people made while working together.
POOL can complement this theory by suggesting that such communal activities involved not just vocalizations but also coordinated gestures and mimicry, contributing to the development of more structured communication.
Social Grooming Theory
:
This theory posits that language evolved as a way to maintain social bonds in larger groups, similar to grooming in primates.
POOL could extend this theory by proposing that early humans used pantomime and mimicry as part of social interactions, serving to strengthen communal ties and convey information.
Tool Use Theory
:
Some theories suggest that the cognitive demands of tool-making and using complex tools played a key role in the development of language.
POOL directly aligns with this idea, highlighting how tool-related gestures and sounds could have evolved into a form of communication.

Alright, for a 2nd grader, think of the POOL theory like this: Imagine you have a big box of different Lego pieces. Some of the pieces are really important for building things, like the regular bricks. But there are also some funny-shaped pieces that don't seem to fit anywhere - these are like the "junk DNA" in our theory. In language, "junk DNA" is like making sounds or movements just for fun, even if they don't have a clear use right away.
Now, imagine sometimes you and your friends walk around in funny ways just for fun, like maybe walking like a robot or hopping like a kangaroo. These "silly walks" are not the usual way we walk, but they are fun and can make us all laugh and feel closer. In our theory, early people might have done similar things ��� they made funny sounds or movements (like "silly walks") just for fun or to feel closer to each other.

ChatGPT
ChatGPT
Certainly! Our conversation revolved around your "Pantomimetic Origin of Language" (POOL) theory, which offers a unique perspective on the evolution of human language. Here's a more serious summary:
POOL Theory Overview
:
POOL theory suggests that early human language evolved from gestures and mimics associated with everyday activities, particularly tool use. It posits that these non-verbal forms of communication gradually evolved into complex spoken language.
Comparison with Other Theories
:
We compared POOL with existing language origin theories like the Bow-Wow Theory (language from imitations of natural sounds), Ding-Dong Theory (onomatopoeia), Gestural Theory (origin in manual gestures), Yo-He-Ho Theory (rhythmic work sounds), Social Grooming Theory (language for maintaining social bonds), and Tool Use Theory (cognitive demands of tool use sparking language development). POOL aligns with some aspects of these theories but stands out in its emphasis on the combined role of gestures, tool use, and mimicry.
Junk DNA of Language
:
An intriguing aspect of your theory is the concept of "junk DNA" in language, where seemingly random or nonsensical movements and sounds (like "silly walks") are exchanged. These actions, though initially without direct utility, might have played a role in social bonding and the development of communication.
Critiques and Simplifications
:
We explored potential strawman arguments that could oversimplify or misrepresent POOL, such as trivializing tool use, overstating the role of cooking, or misunderstanding the "junk DNA" concept. To counter these, we emphasized the interdisciplinary nature and evolutionary plausibility of your theory.
Explanation for Younger Audience
:
In an attempt to explain the concept to a 2nd grader, we likened the theory to playing charades or using Lego pieces, where "junk DNA" was compared to the odd-shaped Lego pieces that seem unimportant but contribute to the bigger picture.
Overall, your POOL theory presents a comprehensive view of language evolution, integrating mimicry, gestures, tool use, and seemingly random actions into a cohesive explanation of how complex human language might have originated and developed over time.

Ok it's good enough. What are some of the more unusual aspects of the theory?

The POOL (Pantomimetic Origin of Language) theory, with its unique approach to explaining the evolution of human language, includes several unusual aspects that distinguish it from more traditional theories:
Emphasis on "Junk DNA" of Language
:
The concept of "junk DNA" in language is quite distinctive. It refers to seemingly random or nonsensical movements and sounds that don't have an immediate practical purpose but may play a role in social bonding or the gradual evolution of meaningful communication. This idea suggests that not all components of early language were directly utilitarian but could have served as a foundation for more complex systems.
Integration of "Silly Walks"
:
Incorporating the idea of "silly walks" or playful, non-practical actions into the theory is unusual. It implies that the origins of language might lie not just in survival-driven communication but also in social play and experimentation, a concept not widely emphasized in other language evolution theories.
Focus on Tool Use Mimicry
:
While some theories highlight tool use as a cognitive driver for language development, POOL uniquely suggests that the mimicry of tool use (gestures and sounds associated with handling tools) contributed to the formation of early communication, blending physical actions with communicative intent.
Broader Scope of Mimicry
:
The theory extends the concept of mimicry beyond just sound (as in the Bow-Wow theory) to include a wider range of actions and expressions. This broader scope of mimicry as a foundational element of language is a relatively novel perspective.
Evolution from Non-Utilitarian Actions
:
An unusual proposition of POOL is that language could have evolved from actions that were initially non-utilitarian. This idea contrasts with more utilitarian views of language evolution, where every aspect of early communication is seen as having a direct survival or practical benefit.
Combining Physical and Vocal Elements
:
The theory's combination of physical (gestures, tool use) and vocal elements in the evolution of language offers a more holistic view of early communication. This integration is somewhat atypical, as many theories tend to focus predominantly on either vocal or gestural origins.
In summary, the POOL theory introduces some unconventional ideas to the discussion of language origins, particularly its emphasis on non-utilitarian aspects of early communication, a broad approach to mimicry, and the integration of physical actions with emerging linguistic structures. These elements make it a unique contribution to the field of language evolution.
