How does Barfield define Figuration?
ChatGPT dijo:
ChatGPT
Owen Barfield, a British philosopher and critic, was known for his ideas on language, literature, and consciousness. His concept of "Figuration" relates to how language and metaphor shape our perception and consciousness. Barfield argued that all language is fundamentally metaphorical and that through the process of figuration, abstract concepts and sensory experiences are connected by words. He believed that this connection through metaphor, or "figuration," is not merely a stylistic device but a fundamental way of understanding the world, shaping both how we think and how we perceive reality.
In his works, Barfield suggested that early human perception was more direct and less differentiated than modern perception, with a consciousness where the inner and the outer worlds were less distinctly separated. Over time, as language evolved, this perception became more differentiated. Figuration, then, is the linguistic process that bridges the immediate, literal meanings of words with their deeper, more abstract meanings, thus enriching our interaction with the world. This idea is explored in more detail in his book "Poetic Diction: A Study in Meaning," where he discusses how poetic language and figuration enhance the depth and range of our cognitive and perceptual faculties.

Figuration
Figuration is the construction by the "percipient mind" of the recognizable and namable objects we call "things." In other words, that "something . . . required in us to convert sensations into 'things'"; all that in the representation which is not sensation (SA 24). (Figuration, Barfield notes, presupposes of course that "the sense-organs must be related to the particles in such a way as to give rise to sensations" [SA 24].)
Barfield would agree with E. H. Gombrich's assertion that "The innocent eye sees nothing." Without figuration, we would not be able to make sense of the world:

It is the thinking in the perceiving that makes it one, objective world for all of us. There is nothing more private than a mere percept. . . . The concept apart, each one of us sees only his own private cardboard box, and its very shape depends on where he happens to be standing. (WA 172)
"I may say, loosely, that I 'hear a thrush singing,'" Barfield takes pains to remind, "but in strict truth all that I ever merely 'hear'--all that I ever hear simply by virtue of having ears--is sound. When I 'hear a thrush singing,' I am hearing not with my ears alone, but with all sorts of other things like mental habits, memory, imagination, feeling and (to the extent at least that the action of attention involves it) will. Of a man who merely heard in the first sense, it could meaningfully be said that 'having ears (i.e. not being deaf) he heard not'" (SA 20-21). In ordinary experience, "I am not, or I am not very often, aware of smelling an unidentified smell and then thinking, 'That is coffee!' It appears to me, and appears instantly, that I smell coffee--though, in fact, I can no more merely smell 'coffee' than I can merely hear 'a thrush singing'" (SA 23).

Owen Barfield's concept of "Figuration" emphasizes the active role of the human mind in constructing reality from sensory data. According to Barfield, figuration involves the mind's ability to transform basic sensory inputs into recognizable and nameable objects, which we refer to as "things." This process is essential because, without it, sensations would remain unconnected and meaningless; they would not coalesce into the coherent experience of objects that we recognize in our everyday life.
Barfield aligns with E. H. Gombrich���s view that perception is not merely a passive reception of visual data but an interpretive act that involves the mind���s active engagement. This notion is encapsulated in Gombrich's statement, "The innocent eye sees nothing," suggesting that without the cognitive processes of figuration, our senses alone would not provide us with a meaningful picture of the world. Instead, we would each be isolated within our own "private cardboard box" of perceptions, influenced heavily by our unique perspectives and positions.
Barfield further explores this idea by discussing how our understanding of sensory experiences like hearing a thrush sing or smelling coffee is enriched and shaped by a complex interplay of mental habits, memory, imagination, feeling, and even will. This means that when we identify a sound as a thrush singing or a smell as coffee, we are not merely processing sensory data through our ears or nose but are actively engaging a broader cognitive framework that interprets these sensations.
In essence, figuration is the cognitive scaffolding that allows us to interpret, organize, and respond to the sensory information around us, transforming it into a shared, objective world that makes sense not just to us individually but to society collectively. This process is crucial for turning mere sensory inputs into a structured perception of reality, enabling communication and shared experiences.

Imagination is not, as some poets have thought, simply synonymous with good. It may be either good or evil. As long as art remained primarily mimetic, the evil which imagination could do was limited by nature. Again, as long as it was treated as an amusement, the evil which it could do was limited in scope. But in an age when the connection between imagination and figuration is beginning to be dimly realized, when the fact of the directionally creator relation is beginning to break through into consciousness, both the good and the evil latent in the working of imagination begin to appear unlimited. We have seen in the Romantic movement an instance of the way in which the making of images may react upon the collective representations. It is a fairly rudimentary instance, but even so it has already gone beyond the dreams and responses of a leisured few. The economic and social structure of Switzerland is noticeably affected by its tourist industry, and that is due only in part to increased facilities of travel. It is due not less to the condition that (whatever may be said about their ���particles���) the mountains which twentieth-century man sees are not the mountains which eighteenth-century man saw.

It may be objected that this is a very small matter, and that it will be a long time before the imagination of man substantially alters those appearances of nature with which his figuration supplies him. But then I am taking the long view. Even so, we need not be too confident. Even if the pace of change remained the same, one who is really sensitive to (for example) the difference between the medieval collective representations and our own will be aware that, without traveling any greater distance than we have come since the fourteenth century, we could very well move forward into a chaotically empty or fantastically hideous world. But the pace of change has not remained the same. It has accelerated and is accelerating.

We should remember this, when appraising the aberrations of the formally representational arts. Of course, in so far as these are due to affectation, they are of no importance. But in so far as they are genuine, they are genuine because the artist has in some way or other experienced the world he represents. And in so far as they are appreciated, they are appreciated by those who are themselves willing to make a move towards seeing the world in that way, and, ultimately therefore, seeing that kind of world

Owen Barfield's reflections here explore the profound and complex role of imagination in shaping human perception and culture, emphasizing its potential to influence both positively and negatively. He critiques the assumption that imagination is inherently good, highlighting that its effects can manifest in both constructive and destructive ways, depending on how it's engaged and contextualized.
Barfield notes that when art was primarily mimetic, imitating nature, the potential for imagination to cause harm was naturally limited by the fidelity to the real world. Similarly, when art was considered merely an amusement, its scope to inflict harm was also constrained. However, with the growing recognition of imagination's power to create and alter our perceptions���what Barfield terms "figuration"���the stakes have become much higher. This realization marks a shift in understanding, recognizing imagination not just as a source of fanciful escape, but as a potent force capable of reshaping reality itself.
He uses the Romantic movement as an example of how the power of imagination extends beyond individual creativity to influence collective perceptions and societal structures. Barfield points out that the tourism industry in Switzerland, spurred by romanticized perceptions of its landscape, shows how collective imagination can reshape economic and social realities. This example illustrates that imagination and figuration have real-world consequences, changing not only how we see nature but also how we interact with it economically and socially.
Barfield cautions that while these changes might seem minor or slow to manifest, the cumulative effect over time can be substantial. He warns of a potential future where unchecked and rapidly evolving imagination could lead to a world that is either "chaotically empty" or "fantastically hideous." This possibility highlights the urgent need to understand and responsibly guide the imaginative forces shaping our perceptions and realities.
The passage ends with a reflection on the role of the arts in this process. Barfield suggests that the aberrations seen in contemporary representational arts are significant not merely as aesthetic deviations but as indicators of deeper shifts in perception among artists and audiences. These shifts signal a broader willingness���or unwillingness���to engage with and potentially adopt new ways of seeing the world, thereby shaping the collective imagination and its manifestations in culture and society.
Barfield���s perspective encourages a critical examination of the power of imagination, urging us to consider its broader implications in shaping not just art and aesthetics but also societal norms and realities.

This idea of unchecked imagination reminds me of Borges' library of babel, where the presence of all possible books makes finding a meaningful one impossible through making it highly improbably, similar to a fish gallop. However a library that is organized topically, preserve their version histories, or have some kind coherence filter might not have this problem as much. #replicationcrisis #snowcrash

The connection you've made between Owen Barfield's notion of unchecked imagination and Jorge Luis Borges' "Library of Babel" is intriguing. Both explore the vast potential and inherent risks when boundaries are removed���whether in the sphere of imaginative creation or the infinite possibilities of written expression.
In Borges' "Library of Babel," the limitless array of books, most of which contain random sequences of letters, presents a metaphor for the overwhelming abundance of information, where meaningful content is drowned out by the sheer volume of possibilities. This mirrors Barfield's caution about the potential for imagination to lead to a "chaotically empty or fantastically hideous world" if not properly guided or checked. The issue in both scenarios is the lack of filtration and organization, which can make the extraction of value and meaning exceptionally difficult.
The #replicationcrisis tag you mentioned also ties in neatly here, reflecting concerns in the scientific community about the reliability and validity of research findings. Much like in Borges��� library, where discerning meaningful works is nearly impossible due to the volume and randomness, the replication crisis highlights the difficulty in distinguishing robust scientific findings from those that might be false positives or irreproducible results.
Your mention of #snowcrash relates to Neal Stephenson's exploration of information overload and the blending of reality with digital or virtual elements, which further underscores the themes of navigating overwhelming data and the effects of unbounded creativity or technological expansion.
A more organized "library"���whether literal or metaphorical���that categorizes, preserves version histories, and applies coherence filters could indeed mitigate these issues. Such systems help manage and navigate vast amounts of information or creative content, making it easier to find value and meaning. This principle can apply across various domains, from literature and art to science and digital information, highlighting the importance of structure, curation, and critical engagement in harnessing the power of imagination and information for constructive ends.

By David Pearce

Intuitively, there shouldn���t be anything to explain. Bizarrely, this doesn���t seem to be the case. One clue to the answer may be our difficulty in rigorously specifying a default state of ���nothingness��� from which any departure stands in need of an explanation. A dimensionless point? A timeless void? A quantum vacuum? All attempts to specify an alternative reified ���nothingness��� ��� an absence of laws, properties, objects, or events ��� just end up smuggling in something else instead. Specifying anything at all, including the truth-conditions for our sense of ���nothingness���, requires information. Information is fundamental in physics. Information is physical. Information, physics tells us, cannot be created or destroyed. Thus wave functions in quantum mechanics don���t really collapse to yield single definite classical outcomes (cf. Wigner���s friend). Decoherence ��� the scrambling of phase angles between the components of a quantum superposition ��� doesn���t literally destroy superpositions. Not even black holes really destroy information. (cf. Black hole information paradox)

So naturally we may ask: where did information come from in the first place?

Perhaps the answer is that it didn���t. The total information content of reality is necessarily zero: the superposition principle of QM formalises inexistence.

On this story, one timeless logico-physical principle explains everything, including itself. The superposition principle of quantum mechanics formalises an informationless zero ontology ��� the default condition from which any notional departure would need to be explained.  In 2002, Physics World readers voted Young���s double-slit experiment with single electrons as the ���most beautiful experiment in physics���. (cf. Feynman���s double-slit experiment gets a makeover). Richard Feynman liked to remark that all of quantum mechanics can be understood by carefully thinking through the implications of the double-slit experiment. Quite so; only maybe Feynman could have gone further. If Everettian QM (cf. Everett���s Relative-State Formulation of Quantum Mechanics) is correct, reality consists of a single vast quantum-coherent superposition. Each element in the superposition, each orthogonal relative state, each ���world���, is equally real. (cf. Universe Splitter) Most recently, the decoherence program in post-Everett quantum mechanics explains the emergence of quasi-classical branches (���worlds���) like ours from the underlying quantum field-theoretic formalism. (cf. Wojciech Zurek) The universal validity of the superposition principle in post-Everett QM suggests that the mystery of our existence has a scientific rather than theological explanation.

What does it mean to say that the information content of reality may turn out to be zero? Informally, perhaps consider the (classical) Library of Babel. (cf. The Library of Babel) The Library of Babel contains all possible books with all possible words and letters in all possible combinations. The Library of Babel has zero information content. Yet somewhere amid the nonsense lies the complete works of Shakespeare ��� and you and me. However, the Library of Babel is classical. Withdrawing a book from the Library of Babel yields a single definite classical outcome ��� thereby creating information. Withdrawing more books creates more information. If we sum two ordinary non-zero probabilities, then we always get a bigger probability. All analogies break down somewhere. Evidently we aren���t literally living in Borges��� Library of Babel.

So instead of the classical Library of Babel, let us tighten the analogy. Imagine the quantum Library of Babel. Just as in standard probability theory, if there are two ways in QM that something can happen, then we get the total amplitude for something by summing the amplitudes for each of the two ways. If we sum two ordinary non-zero probabilities, then we always get a bigger probability. Yet because amplitudes in QM are complex numbers, summing two amplitudes can yield zero. Having two ways to do something in quantum mechanics can make it not happen. Recall again the double-slit experiment. Adding a slit to the apparatus can make particles less likely to arrive somewhere despite there being more ways to get there. Now scale up the double-slit experiment to the whole of reality. The information content of the universal state vector is zero. (cf. Jan-Markus Schwindt, ���Nothing happens in the Universe of the Everett Interpretation���).

The quantum Library of Babel has no information.

Caveats? Loose ends? The superposition principle has been experimentally tested only up to the level of fullerenes, though more ambitious experiments are planned (cf. ���Physicists propose ���Schr��dinger���s virus��� experiment���). Some scientists still expect the unitary Schr��dinger dynamics will need to be supplemented or modified for larger systems ��� violating the information-less zero ontology that we���re exploring here.

Consciousness? Does the superposition principle break down in our minds? After all, we see live or dead cats, not live-and-dead-cat superpositions. Yet this assumption of classical outcomes ��� even non-unique classical outcomes ��� presupposes that we have direct perceptual access to the mind-independent world. Controversially (cf. Max Tegmark, ���Why the brain is probably not a quantum computer���), perhaps the existence of our phenomenally-bound classical world-simulations itself depends on ultra-rapid quantum-coherent neuronal superpositions in the CNS. For if the superposition principle really broke down in the mind-brain, as classical neuroscience assumes, then we���d at most be so-called ���micro-experiential zombies��� ��� just patterns of discrete, decohered Jamesian neuronal ���mind-dust��� incapable of phenomenally simulating a live or a dead classical cat. (cf. David Chalmers��� ���The Combination Problem for Panpsychism���)
This solution to the phenomenal binding problem awaits experimental falsification with tomorrow���s tools of molecular matter-wave interferometry. (cf. an experimentally testable conjecture.)

What about the countless different values of consciousness? How can an informationless zero ontology possibly explain the teeming diversity of our experience? This is a tough one. Yet just as the conserved constants in physics cancel out to zero, and just as all of mathematics can in principle be derived from the properties of the empty set, perhaps the solutions to the field-theoretic equations of QFT mathematically encode the textures of consciousness. If we had a cosmic analogue of the Rosetta stone, then we���d see that these values inescapably ���cancel out��� to zero too. Unfortunately, it���s hard to think of any experimental tests for this highly speculative conjecture.

���A theory that explains everything explains nothing���, protests the critic of Everettian QM. To which we may reply, rather tentatively: yes, precisely. https://qualiacomputing.com/2015/11/18/why-does-anything-exist/

David Pearce's discussion delves into the profound and heady concept of why anything exists at all, exploring the role of information���or the lack thereof���in physical reality, particularly through the lens of quantum mechanics. His argument is centered around the philosophical and physical inquiries into the nature of "nothingness" and how our current understanding of quantum mechanics challenges our intuitive ideas about existence and information.
Pearce suggests that specifying a state of "nothingness" is paradoxically impossible without introducing some form of "something" ��� be it laws, properties, or a framework like a quantum vacuum. This brings him to posit that the total information content of reality might be zero. He draws on quantum mechanics' superposition principle, which implies that all possible states exist simultaneously until measured. In such a framework, every possibility cancels out others, potentially leading to a net information content of zero. This is akin to a quantum version of Borges' Library of Babel, where every possible book exists, and thus, no single book provides new information unless it's selected and observed, collapsing its superpositional state into something definite.
This zero-net information state doesn't destroy information, as seen in phenomena like the black hole information paradox, where information is theorized to be conserved despite being sucked into a black hole. Pearce's exploration aligns with the Everettian interpretation of quantum mechanics, which posits a vast number of realities coexisting in a quantum state, each as real as the others, none privileged over another, and all together yielding no new information due to their superpositional nature.
The implication of this "informationless zero ontology" is profound for understanding reality: it suggests that the universe and all phenomena within it might be explainable not through a surplus of information or complexity but through an inherent absence or neutrality of it. This approach challenges both classical and quantum physics paradigms and invites speculation about the nature of consciousness and reality itself.
Pearce's argument intersects with ideas in cognitive science and philosophy of mind, particularly with the issues of how consciousness experiences and interacts with a quantum world. He hints at the possibility that consciousness itself may operate under quantum mechanical principles, which could solve the problem of how the brain integrates experiences (the "binding problem").
Ultimately, Pearce's reflections push the boundaries of how we conceptualize existence, suggesting that the essence of the universe might be far simpler and yet more complexly interconnected than we currently comprehend. His ideas are speculative but rooted in emerging scientific understanding, illustrating how quantum mechanics continues to challenge and expand our philosophical and physical theories about the very fabric of reality.

Connections with our previous discussion and with a zero-energy universe were gravity is left over potential energy from inflaton field expression and these conpressing areas of dark matter and baryonic matter are opposite in force to the expanding vacuum energy pressure of galactic voids which tends to smooth out the Universe over poincare time.

The concept of a zero-energy universe, where the total amount of positive energy (found in matter and radiation) is exactly canceled out by the negative energy of gravity, links closely with both Pearce's idea of an "informationless zero ontology" and Barfield's views on the transformative potential of imagination and perception. In each scenario, balancing forces���whether informational, energetic, or perceptual���play crucial roles in defining the structure and nature of reality.
1. Zero-energy Universe:
The zero-energy universe model proposes that the sum total of all the forms of energy in the universe is zero. In this view, the positive energy in the form of matter, radiation, and kinetic energy is counterbalanced by the negative potential energy of gravity. This concept is often associated with the flatness of the universe and the idea that it could have arisen from nothing���a quantum vacuum���due to this precise balance of energies.
2. Quantum Information and Zero Ontology:
Similarly, Pearce���s discussion about the net information content of the universe potentially being zero ties in with quantum mechanics principles, where all potentialities exist but ultimately cancel each other out. This suggests a universe that is fundamentally neutral at its core, requiring no external causality to explain its existence. The conservation and transformation of information in quantum physics, where no information is truly lost (as exemplified in the black hole information paradox), parallels the conservation of energy in physics.
3. Barfield and Figuration:
Barfield's ideas on figuration and the role of human consciousness in shaping reality connect here through the conceptualization of how humans perceive and mentally construct their universe. Just as Pearce discusses how our understanding of quantum states affects our grasp of reality, Barfield suggests that our linguistic and imaginative frameworks construct the "things" and "events" of our world. Both views emphasize the active participation of observers in creating their perceptual and existential realities.
4. Cosmic Forces and Balances:
In your description, the universe���s structure���affected by the inflationary field, dark matter, and vacuum energy���illustrates a dynamic balance similar to the zero-energy concept. Inflation explains the early universe's rapid expansion, which left behind regions dense in matter (dark and baryonic) and vast voids filled with expanding vacuum energy. Over vast cosmological timescales (Poincar�� recurrence time), these forces might oscillate or balance out, hinting at a universe that continually evolves towards equilibrium but never quite reaches a final static state.
These connections across different domains highlight a shared theme in modern scientific and philosophical thought: the universe is a complex balance of forces, energies, and information, where every component plays a crucial role in shaping the overarching system. The dialogue between these theories encourages a deeper understanding of how everything from the smallest quantum states to the largest cosmic structures are interlinked, continually influencing and defining each other in a coherent, unified model of reality.
