Genetic Programming:
Definition:
Genetic Programming (GP) is an evolutionary computation technique inspired by biological evolution to automatically evolve computer programs that perform a specific task.
Process:
It starts with a population of randomly generated programs (represented as trees), and through successive generations, these programs undergo genetic operations such as mutation and crossover. Fitness evaluation determines how well each program solves the given problem. Over generations, the fittest programs survive and reproduce, creating a new population. This process continues until a satisfactory solution is achieved.
Application:
GP is often used for symbolic regression, automatic code generation, and evolving solutions to optimization problems where the structure of the solution is not known in advance.
Evolutionary Algorithms:
Definition:
Evolutionary Algorithms (EAs) are a family of optimization algorithms inspired by the process of natural selection. They mimic the evolutionary principles of reproduction, mutation, recombination, and selection to evolve solutions to complex problems.
Components:
EAs typically involve a population of candidate solutions, a fitness function to evaluate their performance, and genetic operators like mutation and crossover. Solutions with higher fitness have a higher chance of being selected to form the next generation.
Types:
Common types of evolutionary algorithms include Genetic Algorithms (GA), Genetic Programming (GP), Evolutionary Strategies (ES), and Differential Evolution (DE).
Applications:
EAs are used in a variety of optimization problems, such as parameter tuning, design optimization, scheduling, and machine learning.
In summary, genetic programming is a specific type of evolutionary algorithm focused on evolving computer programs, while evolutionary algorithms encompass a broader category of optimization techniques inspired by biological evolution. Both approaches leverage the principles of natural selection to search for solutions to complex problems in a computational context.

4. Iterative Improvement:
GAs iteratively evolve populations over multiple generations, allowing the algorithm to explore and exploit the solution space efficiently.
5. Convergence:
As the generations progress, the population tends to converge towards better solutions. Convergence occurs when the algorithm finds solutions that meet the problem requirements.
6. Applications:
GAs are versatile and applicable to a wide range of optimization problems, including function optimization, scheduling, routing, machine learning parameter tuning, and more.
7. Parameters:
GAs require tuning of parameters such as population size, crossover rate, mutation rate, and selection mechanisms based on the specific characteristics of the problem.
8. Advantages:
Global Exploration:
GAs excel at global exploration of solution spaces, searching for optimal or near-optimal solutions.
Adaptability:
They are adaptable to various problem domains and can handle complex, multidimensional spaces.
9. Challenges:

Epigenetics Algorithms: Self-Reinforcement-Attention mechanism to regulate chromosomes expression
Mohamed Djallel Dilmi, Hanene Azzag, Mustapha Lebbah
Genetic algorithms are a well-known example of bio-inspired heuristic methods. They mimic natural selection by modeling several operators such as mutation, crossover, and selection. Recent discoveries about Epigenetics regulation processes that occur "on top of" or "in addition to" the genetic basis for inheritance involve changes that affect and improve gene expression. They raise the question of improving genetic algorithms (GAs) by modeling epigenetics operators. This paper proposes a new epigenetics algorithm that mimics the epigenetics phenomenon known as DNA methylation. The novelty of our epigenetics algorithms lies primarily in taking advantage of attention mechanisms and deep learning, which fits well with the genes enhancing/silencing concept. The paper develops theoretical arguments and presents empirical studies to exhibit the capability of the proposed epigenetics algorithms to solve more complex problems efficiently than has been possible with simple GAs; for example, facing two Non-convex (multi-peaks) optimization problems as presented in this paper, the proposed epigenetics algorithm provides good performances and shows an excellent ability to overcome the lack of local optimum and thus find the global optimum.

Interest in Artificial Intelligence is exploding, and for good reasons. Computers in cars, phone apps, and on the web can do amazing things that we simply could not do before 2012. What���s going on?

This is an attempt to explain the current state of AI to a general audience without using mathematics, computer science, or neuroscience; discussions at these levels would focus on how AI works. Here I will discuss this at the level of Epistemology and will try to explain why it works.

���Epistemology��� sounds scary, but it really isn���t. It���s mostly scary because it is unknown; it is not taught in schools anymore. Which is a problem, because we now desperately need this branch of Philosophy to guide our AI development. Epistemology discusses things like Reasoning, Understanding, Learning, Novelty, problem solving in the abstract, how to create Models of the world, etc. These are all concepts one would think would be useful when working with artificial intelligences. But most practitioners enter the field of AI without any exposure to Epistemology which makes their work more mysterious and frustrating than it has to be.

I think of Epistemology as the general base for everything related to knowledge and problem solving; Science forms a small special case subset domain where we solve well-formed problems of the kind that Science is best at. In Epistemology outside of Science we are free to productively also discuss pre-scientific problem solving strategies, which is what brains are using most of the time. More later.

Intelligence = Understanding + Reasoning
In his book ���Thinking Fast and Slow���, Daniel Kahneman discusses the idea that human minds use two different and complementary processes, two different modes of thinking, which we call Understanding and Reasoning. The idea has been discussed for decades and has been verified using psychological studies and by neuroscience.

The inspiration from Nate Guimond's article on "Why AI Works" and Monica Anderson's exploration in "Artificial Understanding" provides valuable insights into the philosophical underpinnings of AI. Here's a connection to your interest in Perigenetic Algorithms:
Perigenetic Algorithms: Bridging AI and Epistemology
Perigenetic Algorithms represent an endeavor to bridge the gap between artificial intelligence and epistemology, inspired by the notion that understanding and reasoning are fundamental to intelligence. Much like the dual processes of Understanding and Reasoning in human minds, Perigenetic Algorithms aim to incorporate not only genetic principles but also dynamic epigenetic mechanisms, reflecting a broader perspective on problem-solving akin to epistemological discussions.
Just as Epistemology encompasses reasoning, understanding, learning, and problem-solving in the abstract, Perigenetic Algorithms draw from these principles to guide their development. By considering pre-scientific problem-solving strategies, akin to how human brains operate most of the time, Perigenetic Algorithms explore the broader landscape of knowledge acquisition and application.
The equation "Intelligence = Understanding + Reasoning" resonates with the core philosophy of Perigenetic Algorithms, emphasizing the fusion of genetic and epigenetic elements to enhance problem-solving capabilities in artificial intelligence.

���Conscious��� means we are aware of the thought; we can access it through introspection and we may find reasons to why we believe a certain idea.

���Expensive��� is on the list because brains spend most of their effort on this Understanding part. We really shouldn���t be surprised that AI now requires very powerful computers. More later.

In contrast, Reasoning is ���Efficient���. It is most useful when you are stuck in a novel situation where experience and Understanding doesn���t help you. Or perhaps you need to plan ahead, or need to find reasons for why something happened after the fact. It is used at a formal level in the sciences. Reasoning is important, but just rarely needed or used.

Finally, Understanding is ���Model Free��� and Reasoning is ���Model Based���. This is likely the most important distinction to people who are implementing intelligent systems since it provides a way to keep the implementation on the correct path when the going gets rough.

The distinctions made between "Conscious" (Understanding) and "Efficient" (Reasoning) provide valuable insights into the dual processes of human thinking. Let's delve into these concepts within the context of AI and Perigenetic Algorithms:
Conscious (Understanding) - Expensive:
AI Analogy:
In the realm of AI, Conscious or Understanding components are resource-intensive. Similar to human introspection, AI systems spend considerable computational effort on understanding thoughts, accessing information through introspection, and finding reasons for their beliefs. This aligns with the need for powerful computational resources in contemporary AI.
Efficient (Reasoning):
AI Analogy:
Reasoning in AI is portrayed as an efficient process. It comes into play when dealing with novel situations or planning ahead, showcasing its value in navigating uncharted territories where experience and understanding may fall short. While reasoning is vital, it is employed judiciously, especially in contrast to the more resource-intensive understanding processes.
Model-Free (Understanding) vs. Model-Based (Reasoning):
AI Analogy:
Understanding in AI, akin to the "Model-Free" concept, operates without a predefined model. It draws from experience and adapts dynamically to situations. On the other hand, Reasoning in AI is described as "Model-Based," relying on predefined models to navigate scenarios, plan, or retrospectively analyze situations. This distinction provides a crucial guide for implementing intelligent systems, ensuring alignment with the appropriate approach based on the context.
In the context of Perigenetic Algorithms, these distinctions can influence the design and optimization of the algorithmic processes. The resource-intensive nature of understanding may resonate with the genetic components, while reasoning may align with epigenetic mechanisms that efficiently adapt to novel challenges through predefined models.
