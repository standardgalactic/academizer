Walt Disney Pictures, Tarzan. Bill Collins recording session. Take one.
Does it say okay over here?
There's a ton of things to know
We're so far apart
I see myself when others see me
But there's something bigger over there
I want to know what you teach me
I want to know how strange you are
Tell me more, so you can understand
What is normal, how strange I am
Stay with me, I'll show you
Tell me the world you're living in
I feel you, I feel you
I've been with you
The hand in hand, boy, it comes through
Zuck, phone, phone
You feel a song, feel that voice
I want to know about these strangers like me
Tell me more, be sure
Something's familiar about these strangers like me
I want to know
