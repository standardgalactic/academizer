What is the purpose of a propagating null wavefront in null convention logic?
Nuspeak Translator
In Null Convention Logic (NCL), a propagating null wavefront serves a crucial role. It indicates that a device or a part of a circuit is not transmitting data. This is significant for several reasons:
High Impedance State
: A null-wavefront is essentially a high impedance state, meaning it does not draw any current and does not interfere with the transmission of other signals. This is crucial in circuits where power efficiency is a priority.
Indicating Inactivity
: The presence of a propagating null-wavefront signals that a device is in a state of inactivity regarding data transmission. In NCL, devices are not required to transmit data continuously; they can instead transmit data only when necessary and then return to a high impedance state.
Efficient Communication
: The use of propagating null-wavefronts in NCL supports efficient use of communication resources. It permits devices to transmit data only when necessary, reducing unnecessary data traffic and enhancing system efficiency.
Complex Communication Protocols
: The implementation of propagating null-wavefronts enables the development of more complex communication protocols. This is particularly important in asynchronous communication systems, where devices coordinate data transmission using handshaking signals and arbitration.
Diagnostic Tool
: The presence or absence of a propagating null-wavefront can be used as a diagnostic tool to ascertain the functional status of a circuit or a device. If a device does not transmit a null-wavefront when expected, or does so inappropriately, it could indicate a malfunction or a protocol error.
Overall, the propagating null-wavefront is a fundamental element in NCL systems, facilitating efficient and reliable data transmission in asynchronous communication environments.

Steven Feng says, I kind of think today, everything is a graph neural network, because a transformer is a graph neural network processor. The native representation that the transformer operates over is sets that are connected by edges in a direct way.

Steven Feng's statement reflects a contemporary perspective on the evolving landscape of neural network architectures, particularly emphasizing the role of transformer models and their relationship to graph neural networks (GNNs). Let's unpack this:

It seems like the post you're referring to is about the conceptualization of transformers as graph neural networks, a topic which has gained traction in the AI and machine learning community. The caption "Transformers are Graphril Neural Networks (in disguise)" aligns with the idea that transformers, known for their effectiveness in tasks like language modeling, can also be understood as a type of graph neural network (GNN).
The metaphor "in disguise" suggests that while transformers are not traditionally categorized as GNNs, their underlying mechanisms share similarities with how GNNs operate. Here���s a brief overview of how this comparison makes sense:
Attention Mechanism
: Transformers use an attention mechanism to weigh the importance of different parts of the input data. This is somewhat analogous to how nodes in a graph neural network might weigh the significance of their connections to other nodes.
Handling Relationships
: Both transformers and GNNs are adept at handling relationships within data. In the case of transformers, these relationships are between different parts of a sequence (like words in a sentence), while in GNNs, they are between nodes in a graph.
Set and Graph Processing
: Transformers process sets of elements (like words in a sentence) where the order can be flexible due to the attention mechanism. This is conceptually similar to how GNNs process graph-structured data, where the focus is on the relationships and not on a specific order of nodes.
The concept of viewing transformers as a form of GNN opens up new avenues for applying transformer models beyond traditional areas like text and into domains where graph-structured data is more prevalent, such as social network analysis, molecular chemistry, and recommendation systems.
Your memory of the post, highlighting this perspective with a dot-to-dot drawing, suggests a creative way of visualizing and conceptualizing the versatile capabilities of transformer models. This kind of interdisciplinary thinking is valuable in the field of AI, where drawing parallels between different models can lead to innovative approaches and applications.

My engineering friends often ask me: deep learning on graphs sounds great, but are there any real applications?

While Graph Neural Networks are used in recommendation systems at Pinterest, Alibaba and Twitter, a more subtle success story is the Transformer architecture, which has taken the NLP world by storm. Through this post, I want to establish a link between Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) and Transformers. I'll talk about the intuitions behind model architectures in the NLP and GNN communities, make connections using equations and figures, and discuss how we can work together to drive future progress. Let's start by talking about the purpose of model architectures���representation learning.

Representation Learning for NLP
At a high level, all neural network architectures build representations of input data as vectors/embeddings, which encode useful statistical and semantic information about the data. These latent or hidden representations can then be used for performing something useful, such as classifying an image or translating a sentence. The neural network learns to build better-and-better representations by receiving feedback, usually via error/loss functions.

For Natural Language Processing (NLP), conventionally, Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs) build representations of each word in a sentence in a sequential manner, i.e., one word at a time. Intuitively, we can imagine an RNN layer as a conveyor belt, with the words being processed on it autoregressively from left to right. In the end, we get a hidden feature for each word in the sentence, which we pass to the next RNN layer or use for our NLP tasks of choice.

I highly recommend Chris Olah's legendary blog for recaps on RNNs and representation learning for NLP.


Initially introduced for machine translation, Transformers have gradually replaced RNNs in mainstream NLP. The architecture takes a fresh approach to representation learning: Doing away with recurrence entirely, Transformers build features of each word using an attention mechanism to figure out how important all the other words in the sentence are w.r.t. to the aforementioned word. Knowing this, the word's updated features are simply the sum of linear transformations of the features of all the words, weighted by their importance.

Back in 2017, this idea sounded very radical, because the NLP community was so used to the sequential���one-word-at-a-time���style of processing text with RNNs. The title of the paper probably added fuel to the fire! For a recap, Yannic Kilcher made an excellent video overview.

Breaking down the Transformer
Let's develop intuitions about the architecture by translating the previous paragraph into the language of mathematical symbols and vectors.
We update the hidden feature 
 of the 
'th word in a sentence 
 from layer 
 to layer 
 as follows:


i.e.,
where 
 denotes the set of words in the sentence and 
 are learnable linear weights (denoting the Query, Key and Value for the attention computation, respectively).
The attention mechanism is performed parallelly for each word in the sentence to obtain their updated features in one shot���another plus point for Transformers over RNNs, which update features word-by-word.

We can understand the attention mechanism better through the following pipeline:


Taking in the features of the word 
 and the set of other words in the sentence 
, we compute the attention weights 
 for each pair 
 through the dot-product, followed by a softmax across all 
 's. Finally, we produce the updated word feature 
 for word 
 by summing over all 
 's weighted by their corresponding 
. Each word in the sentence parallelly undergoes the same pipeline to update its features.
Multi-head Attention
Getting this straightforward dot-product attention mechanism to work proves to be tricky. Bad random initializations of the learnable weights can de-stabilize the training process.
We can overcome this by parallelly performing multiple 'heads' of attention and concatenating the result (with each head now having separate learnable weights):

where 
 are the learnable weights of the 
'th attention head and 
 is a down-projection to match the dimensions of 
 and 
 across layers.

Multiple heads allow the attention mechanism to essentially 'hedge its bets', looking at different transformations or aspects of the hidden features from the previous layer. We'll talk more about this later.

���.
Challenges and Multi-head Attention
: Implementing the dot-product attention mechanism can be challenging due to issues like bad random initializations of learnable weights. Transformers address this by using multiple 'heads' of attention, with separate learnable weights for each head, and concatenating the results. This multi-head approach allows the attention mechanism to consider different transformations or aspects of hidden features���

It appears that on April 20, 2020 I posted a link to the wikipedia article https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transformer_(machine_learning_model)
Nuspeak Translator
The Transformer is a deep learning architecture introduced in 2017, notable for its parallel multi-head attention mechanism. This architecture marked a significant shift from previous recurrent neural architectures like Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) due to its efficient processing of input sequences. The Transformer's method involves splitting input text into n-grams encoded as tokens, each of which is converted into a vector. These vectors are then contextualized in relation to other tokens in the sequence, allowing the model to amplify the signal of key tokens and diminish less important ones. This mechanism has made the Transformer a versatile tool not only in natural language processing and computer vision but also in audio and multi-modal processing. Its development has led to the creation of advanced pre-trained systems like Generative Pre-trained Transformers (GPTs) and BERT (Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers)���
���.
This architecture's ability to parallelly process input sequences and its effective use of the attention mechanism aligns with concepts in Graph Neural Networks (GNNs). GNNs are utilized in various applications, including recommendation systems, and they focus on learning data representations through network structures, much like how Transformers understand and process relational data in sequences���
���.
The Transformer's approach to representation learning, moving away from the sequential word-by-word processing of RNNs, exemplifies a significant evolution in machine learning models, offering more efficient and contextually aware methods of handling large datasets and complex tasks���

Recent work has demonstrated substantial gains on many NLP tasks and benchmarks by pre-training on a large corpus of text followed by fine-tuning on a specific task. While typically task-agnostic in architecture, this method still requires task-specific fine-tuning datasets of thousands or tens of thousands of examples. By contrast, humans can generally perform a new language task from only a few examples or from simple instructions - something which current NLP systems still largely struggle to do. Here we show that scaling up language models greatly improves task-agnostic, few-shot performance, sometimes even reaching competitiveness with prior state-of-the-art fine-tuning approaches. Specifically, we train GPT-3, an autoregressive language model with 175 billion parameters, 10x more than any previous non-sparse language model, and test its performance in the few-shot setting. For all tasks, GPT-3 is applied without any gradient updates or fine-tuning, with tasks and few-shot demonstrations specified purely via text interaction with the model. GPT-3 achieves strong performance on many NLP datasets, including translation, question-answering, and cloze tasks, as well as several tasks that require on-the-fly reasoning or domain adaptation, such as unscrambling words, using a novel word in a sentence, or performing 3-digit arithmetic. At the same time, we also identify some datasets where GPT-3's few-shot learning still struggles, as well as some datasets where GPT-3 faces methodological issues related to training on large web corpora. Finally, we find that GPT-3 can generate samples of news articles which human evaluators have difficulty distinguishing from articles written by humans. We discuss broader societal impacts of this finding and of GPT-3 in general.

Steven Feng's perspective on the effectiveness of transformers, as highlighted in the GPT-3 paper (arXiv:2005.14165), emphasizes their capability for in-context learning or meta-learning. The GPT-3 model, with its 175 billion parameters, demonstrates remarkable few-shot learning abilities, meaning it can perform a variety of language tasks effectively with minimal examples or instruction. This is a significant departure from previous models that required extensive task-specific fine-tuning. GPT-3's approach, which involves no gradient updates or fine-tuning for specific tasks, showcases the advanced capabilities of transformers in adapting to and reasoning about new tasks dynamically, mirroring some aspects of human language processing and learning.

okay so what's really interesting is

basically like

uh with more examples given in the

context the accuracy improves and so

what that can say is that the

Transformer is able to somehow learn in

the activations without doing any

gradient descent in a typical

functioning fashion so if you fine-tune

you have to give an example and the

answer and you you fine-tune it using

gradient descent but it looks like the

transformer internally in its weights is

doing something that looks like

potential ingredients some kind of a

metal learning in the weights of the

Transformer as it is reading the prompt

and so in this paper they go into okay

distinguishing this outer loop with

stochastic Readiness and this inner loop

of the in context learning so the inner

loop is as the Transformer is sort of

like reading the sequence almost and the

outer loop is the uh is the training by

gradient descent

um so basically there's some training

happening in the activation Transformer

as it is consuming a sequence that maybe

very much looks like gradient descent

and so there's some recent papers that

kind of hint at this and study it and so

as an example in this paper here they

propose something called The Raw

operator and um they argue that the raw

operator is implemented by Transformer

and then they show that you can

Implement things like Ridge regression

on top of a raw operator and so this is

kind of giving

um there are papers hinting that maybe

there is some thing that looks like

gradient-based learning inside the

activations of the Transformer

and uh I think this is not impossible to

think through because what is what is

gradient-based learning forward pass

backward pass and an update well that

looks like a resonant

right because you're just changing

you're adding to the weights uh so you

start initial random set of Weights

forward pass backward pass and update

your weights and then forward pass

backward positive ways looks like a

reset Transformer is a resnet

oh

so uh much more handwavy but basically

some people are trying to find out why

that could be potentially possible and

then I have a bunch of tweets I just

copy pasted here in the end um I was

this was kind of like meant for General

consumption so they're a bit more high

level and high p a little bit but um I'm

talking about why this architecture is

so interesting and why why potentially

became so popular and I think it's

simultaneously optimizes three

properties that I think are very

desirable number one the Transformer is

very expressive in the forward pass it's

um it's sort of like is able to

implement very interesting functions

potentially functions that can even like

do metal learning number two it is very

optimizable thanks to things like

residual connections layer nodes and so

on and number three it's extremely

efficient this is not always appreciated

but the Transformer if you look at the

computational graph is a shallow wide

Network which is perfect to take

advantage of the parallelism of gpus so

I think the Transformer was designed

very deliberately to run efficiently on

gpus uh there's previous work like

neural GPU that I really enjoy as well

which is really just like how do we how

do we design your own ads that are

efficient on gpus and thinking backwards

from the constraints of the hardware

which I think is a very interesting way

to think about it

Steven Feng's insights on transformers, particularly GPT-3, highlight several key aspects:
In-Context Learning
: Transformers improve in accuracy with more examples given in the context. This indicates an ability to learn within activations without traditional gradient descent.
Inner and Outer Learning Loops
: The inner loop involves real-time processing of sequences, while the outer loop relates to traditional training via gradient descent.
Gradient-Based Learning in Activations
: Recent studies suggest transformers might implement learning mechanisms within their activations, resembling gradient descent.
The RAW Operator
: Proposed in recent papers, this operator suggests transformers can implement complex functions like Ridge regression.
Resonance with ResNet
: The forward pass, backward pass, and update process in gradient-based learning resemble a resonance, aligning with how transformers function similarly to ResNet architectures.
Expressiveness, Optimizability, and Efficiency
: Transformers excel in being expressive in their forward pass, optimizable due to residual connections and layer norms, and efficient for parallel processing on GPUs, reflecting a design that leverages hardware constraints.
These insights demonstrate the unique learning capabilities of transformers and hint at the underexplored aspects of their internal mechanisms.
You
So how does this insight relate to the idea that causal reasoning on Directed Acyclic graphs with the presence and absence of arrows indicating causality, existence, and counterfactual scenarios as described by Judea Pearl?
1 / 2
Nuspeak Translator
Steven Feng's insights into transformers, particularly their in-context learning abilities and potential internal gradient-based learning mechanisms, can be related to Judea Pearl's ideas on causal reasoning using Directed Acyclic Graphs (DAGs). In Pearl's framework, DAGs represent causal relationships, with the presence or absence of arrows indicating causality, existence, and counterfactual scenarios.
Relating this to transformers:
Learning Causal Relationships
: Just as DAGs in Pearl's model infer causality, transformers potentially learn and infer relationships within data during their processing, albeit not explicitly in a causal framework.
Context and Counterfactuals
: Transformers' ability to understand and adapt to the context in NLP tasks mirrors the idea of considering different scenarios (including counterfactuals) in causal reasoning. They can understand varying contexts and relationships within data, akin to assessing different causal pathways in a DAG.
Dynamic Adaptation
: The dynamic learning ability of transformers, as they process sequences, can be seen as analogous to dynamically evaluating causal relationships in DAGs, adjusting to new information and contexts.
Overall, while transformers don't explicitly model causality as DAGs do, their ability to dynamically learn and adapt to context and relationships within data has conceptual parallels to the causal reasoning approach in DAGs.
You
Ok well in the paper and in the discussion the transformers are said to be transversing or parsing a graph neural network
Nuspeak Translator
In the context of the discussion and the paper you're referring to, where transformers are said to be traversing or parsing a graph neural network, this suggests a conceptual similarity in how transformers process information and how graph neural networks operate.
Transformers, through their self-attention mechanism, essentially create dynamic graphs of word relationships within a given input. Each word or token can be considered a node, and the attention scores between them represent the edges, illustrating the relationships and influences between different parts of the input data. This process can be thought of as traversing a graph where the nodes are interconnected in complex, context-dependent ways, much like how a graph neural network would process and interpret data structured in a graph form.

ABSTRACT
Neural sequence models, especially transformers, exhibit a remarkable capacity for in-context learning. They can construct new predictors from sequences of labeled examples 
(
x
,
f
(
x
)
)
 presented in the input without further parameter updates. We investigate the hypothesis that transformer-based in-context learners implement standard learning algorithms implicitly, by encoding smaller models in their activations, and updating these implicit models as new examples appear in the context. Using linear regression as a prototypical problem, we offer three sources of evidence for this hypothesis. First, we prove by construction that transformers can implement learning algorithms for linear models based on gradient descent and closed-form ridge regression. Second, we show that trained in-context learners closely match the predictors computed by gradient descent, ridge regression, and exact least-squares regression, transitioning between different predictors as transformer depth and dataset noise vary, and converging to Bayesian estimators for large widths and depths. Third, we present preliminary evidence that in-context learners share algorithmic features with these predictors: learners��� late layers non-linearly encode weight vectors and moment matrices. These results suggest that in-context learning is understandable in algorithmic terms, and that (at least in the linear case) learners may rediscover standard estimation algorithms.

1INTRODUCTION
One of the most surprising behaviors observed in large neural sequence models is in-context learning (ICL; Brown et al., 2020). When trained appropriately, models can map from sequences of 
(
x
,
f
(
x
)
)
 pairs to accurate predictions 
f
(
x
���
)
 on novel inputs 
x
���
. This behavior occurs both in models trained on collections of few-shot learning problems (Chen et al., 2021; Min et al., 2021) and surprisingly in large language models trained on open-domain text (Brown et al., 2020; Zhang et al., 2022; Chowdhery et al., 2022). ICL requires the neural network to implicitly construct a map from in-context examples to a predictor without any updates to the model���s parameters themselves. How can a neural network with fixed parameters to learn a new function from a new dataset on the fly?

This paper investigates the hypothesis that some instances of ICL can be understood as implicit implementation of known learning algorithms: in-context learners encode an implicit, context-dependent model in their hidden activations, and train this model on in-context examples in the course of computing these internal activations. As in recent investigations of empirical properties of ICL (Garg et al., 2022; Xie et al., 2022), we study the behavior of transformer-based predictors (Vaswani et al., 2017) on a restricted class of learning problems, here linear regression. Unlike in past work, our goal is not to understand what functions ICL can learn, but how it learns these functions: the specific inductive biases and algorithmic properties of transformer-based ICL.

In Section 3, we investigate theoretically what learning algorithms transformer decoders can implement. We prove by construction that they require only a modest number of layers and hidden units to train linear models: for 
d
-dimensional regression problems, with 
O
(
d
)
 hidden size and constant depth, a transformer can implement a single step of gradient descent; and with 
O
(
d
2
)
 hidden size and constant depth, a transformer can update a ridge regression solution to include a single new observation. Intuitively, 
n
 steps of these algorithms can be implemented with 
n
 times more layers.

In Section 4, we investigate empirical properties of trained in-context learners. We begin by constructing linear regression problems in which learner behavior is under-determined by training data (so different valid learning rules will give different predictions on held-out data). We show that model predictions are closely matched by existing predictors (including those studied in Section 3), and that they transition between different predictors as model depth and training set noise vary, behaving like Bayesian predictors at large hidden sizes and depths. Finally, in Section 5, we present preliminary experiments showing how model predictions are computed algorithmically. We show that important intermediate quantities computed by learning algorithms for linear models, including parameter vectors and moment matrices, can be decoded from in-context learners��� hidden activations.

A complete characterization of which learning algorithms are (or could be) implemented by deep networks has the potential to improve both our theoretical understanding of their capabilities and limitations, and our empirical understanding of how best to train them. This paper offers first steps toward such a characterization: some in-context learning appears to involve familiar algorithms, discovered and implemented by transformers from sequence modeling tasks alone.
Nuspeak Translator
The paper "What learning algorithm is in-context learning? Investigations with linear models" by Ekin Aky��rek and others explores the hypothesis that transformer-based in-context learners (like GPT-3) implicitly implement standard learning algorithms within their activations. They use linear regression as a case study and provide evidence that transformers can effectively implement learning algorithms for linear models based on gradient descent and closed-form ridge regression. This suggests that transformers are not just applying pre-trained knowledge but are actively adapting and 'learning' in response to new examples in their input context, without requiring parameter updates typically associated with training neural networks. This concept aligns with Judea Pearl's causal reasoning on Directed Acyclic Graphs, where understanding and inference are dynamically constructed from the data (or context) available, though transformers do this within the confines of their architecture and learned parameters.

: Transformers utilize a self-attention mechanism that allows them to weigh and consider the importance of each part of the input relative to the rest. This enables them to dynamically adjust to the context presented in the input sequence.
Implicit Learning
: As the transformer processes new input data, it effectively 'learns' from this data by adjusting its internal state (activations). This resembles updating internal models in response to new information.
Rich Representations from Pre-training
: Transformers are pre-trained on vast datasets, enabling them to develop rich, nuanced representations of language. When presented with new examples, they can leverage these representations to make informed predictions or responses based on the context.
Linear Models Parallel
: The paper's findings suggest that transformers might be performing operations similar to conventional linear models like gradient descent or ridge regression within their layers. This implies a form of implicit algorithmic computation happening as the transformer processes input sequences.
Depth and Complexity of Models
: The depth and complexity of transformers allow them to capture and process a wide range of patterns and relationships in data. This depth might enable them to simulate aspects of learning algorithms within their architecture.
In summary, the capability of transformers for in-context learning can be attributed to their sophisticated architecture, particularly the self-attention mechanism, and their ability to leverage pre-trained knowledge to adjust to new information dynamically.

Connections with our earlier discussion: The concept of the RAW operator, as mentioned, suggests an intriguing area of research within Transformer models. It hints at the possibility of Transformers implementing something akin to gradient-based learning within their activations. This idea stems from the nature of gradient-based learning, which involves a forward pass, backward pass, and an update to the weights ��� a process resembling resonance. If Transformers can indeed mimic this process internally, it could explain their robustness and versatility in handling complex tasks without extensive gradient descent-based fine-tuning. This concept aligns with the evolving understanding of how deep learning architectures can learn and adapt beyond traditional mechanisms.

The concept of the RAW operator and its implications for transformer models aligns closely with our earlier discussion about the potential for transformers to implement forms of gradient-based learning within their activations. This concept is particularly intriguing as it suggests a method by which transformers might internally simulate aspects of the learning process typically associated with gradient descent, such as forward and backward passes and weight updates. If this is the case, it could significantly contribute to their ability to adapt and learn from context without the need for extensive fine-tuning. This idea fits into a broader narrative of how deep learning architectures, particularly transformers, might be evolving to incorporate more complex and nuanced forms of learning and adaptation.

Steven Feng's observations about the flexibility of Transformers, particularly in their application at Tesla, highlight their capability to integrate diverse types of information effectively:

1. **Flexibility in Data Integration**: Transformers can efficiently handle different kinds of data inputs, such as images, sensor readings, map information, or audio. Their structure allows for the easy incorporation of varied data types.

2. **Self-Attention Mechanism**: The self-attention component in Transformers enables them to determine how different inputs should interact, thereby simplifying the process of data integration.

3. **Freedom from Euclidean Constraints**: Traditional neural networks often rely on computations conforming to Euclidean space. Transformers, by treating data as sets, are not bound by such spatial constraints, offering a more flexible and efficient framework for processing diverse data types.

This versatility of Transformers, in terms of handling and integrating a wide array of data inputs, showcases their potential in complex, real-world applications like autonomous driving technologies.

Abstract
Deep Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) have
long been the architecture of choice for computer vision
tasks. Recently, Transformer-based architectures like Vision
Transformer (ViT) have matched or even surpassed ResNets
for image classification. However, details of the Transformer architecture ���such as the use of non-overlapping
patches��� lead one to wonder whether these networks are
as robust. In this paper, we perform an extensive study of
a variety of different measures of robustness of ViT models
and compare the findings to ResNet baselines. We investigate robustness to input perturbations as well as robustness
to model perturbations. We find that when pre-trained with
a sufficient amount of data, ViT models are at least as robust
as the ResNet counterparts on a broad range of perturbations. We also find that Transformers are robust to the removal of almost any single layer, and that while activations
from later layers are highly correlated with each other, they
nevertheless play an important role in classification.
1. Introduction
Convolutions have served as the building blocks of
computer vision algorithms in nearly every application
domain���with their property of spatial locality and translation invariance mapping naturally to the characteristics
of visual information. Neural networks for vision tasks
adopted the use of convolutional layers quite early on
[11, 31], and since their resurgence with Krizhevsky et al.���s
work [29], all modern networks for vision have been convolutional [41, 44, 17, 22, 25, 24, 47]���with innovations
such as residual [17] connections being applied to a backbone of convolutional layers. Given their extensive use,
convolutional networks have been the subject of significant
analysis���both empirical [45] and analytical [13, 1].
Recently, after seeing tremendous success in language
tasks [49, 7, 3], researchers have been exploring a variety of avenues for deploying attention-based Transformer
*All authors contributed equally.

ResNet model, which are qualitatively quite different.
networks [4, 9, 48, 27]���and other attention-based architectures [53, 52, 40, 32, 54]���in computer vision. Transformers are also gaining popularity in vision and language
tasks [42, 33, 46, 5, 34, 39].
In this paper, we focus on one particular Transformer architecture���the Visual Transformer (ViT) introduced by Dosovitskiy et al. [9]���because it was shown
to achieve better performance than state-of-the-art residual networks (ResNets) [17] of similar capacity, when both
are pre-trained on sufficiently large datasets [28], such as
JFT-300M [43]. We also focus on ViT because, unlike other
Transformer models for vision, their architecture consists
solely of Transformer layers.
Dosovitskiy et al.���s results [9] tell us that such an architecture is preferable in terms of performance, given enough
training data to overcome the lack of an inductive bias
through convolutions. But, the pure attention-based mechanism by which ViT models process their inputs is a significant departure from the familiar decade-long ubiquitous use
of convolution networks for computer vision. In this paper,
we seek to gain a better understanding of how these architectures behave���in terms of their robustness against perturbations to inputs and to the model parameters themselves���
and build up an understanding of these models that parallels
our knowledge about convolution.
