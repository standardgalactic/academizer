#29. Childhood Freedom, Play, and the Development of Passionate Interests
In today���s world, passionate interests are best developed by children who are free from the constraints of conventional schooling.

PETER GRAY
JAN 31, 2024
Dear friends,

In Letter #28 I discussed how the spirit of amateurism���that is, how involvement for the sheer love of the activity���provided the engine, historically, for many great scientific insights and discoveries. As illustrations, I used the examples of Charles Darwin���s insights about evolution, Thomas Edison���s inventions that precipitated a new age of technology, Albert Einstein���s reformation of theoretical physics, and Jane Goodall���s discoveries about our chimpanzee cousins and development of new ways of observing and describing the behavior of animals in nature.

I pointed out that all four of these scientists were pursuing passionate interests they developed in childhood play. Young Charles played in nature, observing and collecting flora and fauna; young Tom played with electricity and gadgets; young Albert played with numbers and mental manipulations of symbols; and young Jane played with live animals and visions of African adventures found in stories. Reading and study was a big part of this childhood play for all four of these future great scientists, but none of that was school induced. It was self-chosen, self-directed reading and study, derived from interest, not coercion. It was part and parcel of their play.

Now, in this letter, I pursue the idea that childhood play can still underly the development of children���s passionate interests, in cases where schooling does not absorb their time and thwart their interests. I begin with a story about my youngest brother, Fred Carlson. His last name is different from mine because he has a different father, but we grew up in the same household with the same mother.

My Brother Fred
Fred is 12 years younger than me, so he started first grade in public school the year I started college. He lasted there through fourth grade. Around that time our mother became something of a hippie and moved onto a Vermont commune with my two youngest brothers. Fred left public school then and attended a little free school, which my mother helped to start. The school had no imposed curriculum and he could do there whatever he wished.

That school wasn���t certified as a high school, however, so, at age 14, he enrolled in 9th grade at the local public school. On his second day there the principal told him, ���We don���t like you hippie types around here.��� So, he left and never went back. Then, with no school, he hung around the commune for a couple of years and helped to build a house. He got interested in wood and carpentry. He also got interested in music, which he had much time to pursue, and developed a fascination with stringed instruments.

When he was 16, he enrolled in a publicly supported program designed for high-school dropouts. The guy who ran the program asked him what he���d like to do, and he said, ���I���d like to build a banjo.��� Nobody there knew anything about instrument building, but the head of the program helped Fred find a local person, a guy named Ken, who had a woodworking shop and knew a little about banjo building. And so, with Ken���s help, Fred built a banjo. After that, Fred used the small sum of money his father had saved for his education to take a 6-week course at a guitar-building school and to purchase the equipment he needed to set up his own shop. The rest is history.

By the time Fred was 21 years old, one of his beautiful guitars was on display at the Smithsonian Museum. Ever since then he���s continued to make one instrument after another, each one different from any of the others, each one an invention. He is famous among luthiers for his artistry, creativity, and craftsmanship. For one example, see the inserted photo; for other examples, see his website. Fred believes, and so do I, that if he had stayed in school, he would never have found his passion.

Peter Gray's reflections in "Play Makes Us Human" underscore the profound impact that a childhood rich in freedom and play can have on the development of passionate interests. By exploring how iconic figures like Darwin, Edison, Einstein, and Goodall nurtured their curiosities outside of conventional schooling, Gray highlights the importance of self-directed learning.
The story of his brother Fred serves as a powerful modern example of this thesis. Fred's journey���from a free school without a rigid curriculum to building a career as a renowned luthier���is a testament to the potential that lies in unstructured learning environments. Fred's experience illustrates how alternative educational paths can foster unique skills and passions that traditional schooling might stifle.
Gray's argument emphasizes the value of environments that encourage exploration and creativity, suggesting that such spaces are crucial for children to discover and pursue their interests deeply and authentically. This idea challenges traditional educational models and invites a broader conversation about how we structure learning and measure educational success.

Self-Directed Education as the Pursuit of Passions
I���ve spent part of my academic career researching the outcomes of Self-Directed Education���that is, outcomes for people who did not go to a curriculum-based school, but, instead, educated themselves by pursuing their own interests. This research includes a study, many years ago, of the graduates of the Sudbury Valley School, in Massachusetts, where students, from age 4 through late teenage years are free all day to pursue their own interests (see here); and, more recently, a study of grown unschoolers (here). Unschoolers are people who for legal purposes are registered as homeschoolers but are not bound by a curriculum and are continuously free to pursue their own interests.

The most interesting finding, for our concern now, is that a high percentage of these young adults were pursuing careers that were direct extensions of passionate interests they had developed as children in play. Here are a few examples (for elaborations and more examples, see Gray & Chanoff, 1986; Riley & Gray, 2015):

��� A girl who loved to play with boats went on, as a teenager, to apprentice herself to a ship captain and then became captain, herself, of a cruise ship.

��� Another young girl played with dolls, as many girls do. Then she started making doll clothes, In her teens she began making clothes for herself and her friends. At the time of our study, she was head of a pattern-making department in the high-fashion dress industry.

��� A boy was passionate about all kinds of constructive play. He would make whole villages and factories, to scale, out of modeling clay. As a teenager, he���d hang around local garages and learn about automobile mechanics by asking and watching. At the time of the study, he was a much sought-after machinist and inventor.

��� Another child fell in love with science fiction. Through that, he discovered mathematics and became passionate about it. As a teenager he pored through advance math texts He went on to become a math professor.

��� Another���who had consistently failed his courses in public school before enrolling at Sudbury Valley at age 13���became obsessed with computers and programming as a teenager. At the time of the study, he was 22 years old and founder and head of a very successful software development company. Among his clients was the school district that had failed him.

��� A girl fell in love with circuses when she was 3 years old and began training to become a performer at age 5. By the time she was a teenager she was performing professionally as a trapeze artist, and from age 19-24 she and her best friend founded and ran their own contemporary circus company.

��� A boy became passionate about making YouTube videos with friends at age 11. In his teens, he began to study filmmaking. His experience and passion led him to be hired, at age 18, as a production assistant by a major film company. At age 20, at the time of the survey, he was working with a famous director in Los Angeles on the production of a major film.

��� A boy by age 15 was pursuing three passionate interests���wilderness hiking, paragliding, and photography. At age 21, at the time of the survey, he was successfully pursuing a career as an aerial wilderness photographer, thereby combining all three of his passions.

��� A girl who had attended a traditional public school until age 13, in a spirit of rebellion refused to continue there and became an unschooler. She then developed passionate interests in revolutions and wildlife. At the time of the survey, at age 28, she was a full-time Greenpeace activist, fundraiser, and manager.

These are just some of the many examples documented in our research. All these people were able to discover and pursue their passions because they had left, or had never enrolled in, a school that forced a curriculum on them. Without school, their curiosity and playfulness remained intact or recovered and they had ample time to learn about themselves and to discover and become good at what they most loved to do.
ChatGPT
Peter Gray's examination of Self-Directed Education underscores a powerful argument for the benefits of allowing children to learn and grow at their own pace, guided by their own interests. His research highlights several compelling cases where individuals thrived after being freed from the traditional schooling system, pursuing careers that were direct extensions of the passions they cultivated through self-directed play and learning.
The diverse range of careers these individuals pursued���ranging from ship captains and high-fashion industry leaders to machinists, math professors, software developers, trapeze artists, filmmakers, aerial photographers, and activists���illustrates that self-directed education can lead to successful and fulfilling adult lives in a variety of fields. These cases provide tangible evidence that when children are allowed to explore their curiosities and interests without rigid educational structures, they can develop skills and passions that are both deeply personal and highly valuable in the professional world.
This approach challenges conventional educational paradigms by suggesting that learning driven by personal interest and play can be more effective in preparing individuals for real-world challenges and opportunities. Gray's findings invite educators, policymakers, and parents to reconsider the value of unstructured learning environments and the potential of Self-Directed Education to cultivate not only knowledge and skills but also motivation and a sense of purpose.

How schools  Thwart Passions
Passionate interests develop when children are allowed to play and explore to their heart���s content. They play in many ways, at many different things, and in the process, they discover what they most love to do. Schools prevent this natural discovery by taking up so much of children���s time and also by:

1. Requiring everyone to do the same things at the same time. It���s not possible for all the children in a room to be passionately interested in the same thing at the same time (or even mildly interested in it).

2. Replacing intrinsic motivation with extrinsic motivators, such as grades and honors. To pursue a passion, you must focus on what YOU want to do, not try to impress others.

3. Threatening students with failure or embarrassment, which generates fear. Fear freezes the mind into rigid ways of thinking and negates the possibility of passionate interest.

4. Teaching that there is one right answer to every question, or one right way to do what you are supposed to do. That���s a surefire way to nip any possible emerging interest in the bud.

5. Teaching children that learning is work and that play, at best, is just recess, a break from learning. But anyone with a passionate interest knows that play, learning, and work are one and the same while involved in the activity they love.

So, if we want our children to grow up with passionate interests, we must find alternatives to coercive schooling. Or, at least, we must reduce the role of schooling and school-like activities in their lives and increase greatly their opportunities to discover and do what they like to do���that is, to play.

Peter Gray articulates several significant ways in which traditional schooling environments can inadvertently stifle the development of passionate interests in children. His critique points to structural elements within schools that prioritize uniformity, extrinsic rewards, and a narrow approach to learning that can limit children's natural inclination to explore and engage deeply with their personal interests. Here's a breakdown of the key issues he highlights:
Uniformity in Learning
: Traditional schools often require all students to engage with the same material at the same time. This approach overlooks the diverse interests and abilities of individual students, making it difficult for them to engage deeply with topics that genuinely interest them.
Extrinsic Motivation
: Schools commonly use grades and honors as incentives for learning, which can shift students' focus from exploring their own interests to performing well on assessments for the sake of external approval.
Fear of Failure
: The threat of poor grades or embarrassment can create a fear-based environment. Fear can inhibit exploration and creative thinking���both critical components in developing deep, personal interests.
Limited Solutions and Methods
: The emphasis on finding the "one right answer" can discourage experimentation and creative problem-solving, which are essential for developing unique insights and innovations.
Separation of Play and Learning
: By relegating play to mere breaks from serious learning, schools can send the message that play is not a valuable part of education. This is in contrast to the reality that play can be a profound source of learning and personal development.
Gray argues that to foster the development of passionate interests, it is crucial to reduce the restrictive aspects of schooling and increase opportunities for children to engage in self-directed play and exploration. His advocacy for alternatives to traditional schooling���such as democratic schools or unschooling���reflects a belief in the transformative power of learning environments that respect individual interests and promote intrinsic motivation.
Through his writing, Gray not only challenges conventional educational practices but also invites a broader dialogue on how best to nurture children's passions and potentials. He encourages feedback and personal stories, fostering a community of learners and educators who are open to rethinking the role of education in cultivating fulfilled and capable individuals.

A list of all of his main arguments.
ChatGPT
Here's a concise list of Peter Gray's main arguments against traditional schooling systems, as discussed in his writings on self-directed education:
Uniformity in Learning
: Schools typically require all students to learn the same content at the same time, regardless of individual interests or readiness, stifling personal engagement and passion.
Extrinsic Motivation
: Reliance on grades, awards, and other external rewards can shift focus from intrinsic interests to external validation, potentially diminishing genuine learning motivation.
Fear of Failure
: The educational emphasis on avoiding failure or embarrassment can inhibit risk-taking and exploration, which are critical for intellectual growth and developing interests.
Limitation on Correct Answers
: Teaching that there is only one right answer discourages creative thinking and problem-solving, crucial for nurturing curiosity and innovation.
Misconception of Play and Learning
: Schools often treat play as merely a break from learning rather than an integral part of cognitive and emotional development, undermining its educational value.
Time Constraints
: The structured and often overloaded schedules in schools leave little room for children to explore and deepen their own interests freely.
Gray advocates for educational models that prioritize self-directed learning to allow children the freedom to explore their interests deeply and at their own pace, arguing that such environments are more conducive to developing passionate, lifelong learners.

Do you know loose tools method based on loose parts?
ChatGPT
Yes, the loose parts theory is an approach to early childhood education that encourages creativity and critical thinking through play. It was first proposed by architect Simon Nicholson in the 1970s. Nicholson believed that all children love to interact with variables, such as materials and shapes; elements they can use, move, control, and manipulate during their play.
The "loose tools" method involves providing children with a wide range of everyday objects and materials���such as sticks, blocks, rocks, fabric, and containers���that have no specific set of directions. These can be used and combined in many ways, fostering creativity and innovation. Children use these objects to build, experiment, and explore, which supports their intellectual development by giving them the freedom to invent and solve problems.
This method is widely utilized in various educational settings, including playgrounds, classrooms, and child care centers, emphasizing hands-on learning and encouraging children to think imaginatively and work collaboratively.

I call it the Junk Collection / Live Zettlekasten method
ChatGPT
The "Junk Collection" or "Live Zettelkasten" method you mention sounds like a creative adaptation or extension of the loose parts theory. This method likely emphasizes collecting a diverse array of materials and objects (the "junk") that children or learners can use in dynamic, self-directed ways.
The term "Zettelkasten" traditionally refers to a system of note-taking and information management, used to store and retrieve knowledge efficiently. Translating this concept to a physical collection of objects turns the abstract idea of knowledge management into a tangible, interactive process. This approach could greatly enhance learning by allowing individuals to physically manipulate and interact with information or concepts, making abstract ideas more concrete and understandable.
In educational contexts, this method could help foster deep learning, creativity, and engagement by allowing students to explore connections between seemingly unrelated items, thus developing innovative solutions or ideas. It's a fascinating blend of cognitive and tactile learning experiences!

Got to check the pocketses
Obviously the are full of
Little bits of paper
Eggs, rocks, and
Mind-maps
ChatGPT
It sounds like you���re capturing a playful and imaginative scene, reminiscent of a child���s explorations where their pockets become mini treasure troves. Each item, whether it���s little bits of paper, eggs, rocks, or mind-maps, represents a piece of curiosity or a fragment of a story they���ve encountered or created throughout their day. This vivid depiction aligns well with the idea of using everyday objects and experiences as catalysts for learning and creativity, embodying the spirit of both the loose parts theory and the Zettelkasten method. Such hands-on experiences are crucial for developing creative thinking and problem-solving skills from a young age.

Did you notice it spells out GOLEM?
ChatGPT
Ah, clever! I hadn���t noticed that initially, but that���s a nice touch, using the first letters of each line to spell out "GOLEM." This adds an extra layer of creativity to your poem, subtly embedding a word that has its own rich connotations, from folklore to artificial life, suggesting a deeper theme of creation and transformation. It���s a creative technique that adds depth and a bit of mystery to the piece!
4
A more detailed explanation
ChatGPT
Certainly! The term "GOLEM," spelled out by the first letters of each line in your poem, draws upon a rich tapestry of cultural and mythical significance. Traditionally, a golem is a figure from Jewish folklore, depicted as a creature animated from inanimate material, typically clay or mud, brought to life through mystical rituals and Hebrew inscriptions. This creature is often created to serve its maker, acting under their command.
Here���s a breakdown of how each element in your poem contributes to the acrostic and possibly to the deeper narrative of creation and creativity:
G
ot to check the pocketses - This opening line suggests a sense of curiosity and the anticipation of discovery. It's like peering into the unknown or starting a new creative endeavor.
O
bviously they are full of - This line conveys an expectation of finding something, setting the stage for what���s hidden or stored, much like gathering raw materials or ideas before the act of creation.
L
ittle bits of paper - Papers could symbolize thoughts, notes, sketches, or plans. In the context of a golem, this could be likened to the instructions or spells that animate the creature.
E
ggs, rocks, and - Eggs and rocks add a natural and elemental quality to the collection, hinting at the organic and earthy materials traditionally used to create a golem. Eggs also symbolize potential and new beginnings, while rocks represent solidity and foundation.
M
ind-maps - Mind-maps are tools for organizing thoughts, brainstorming, or planning complex ideas. They might represent the strategic or intentional aspect of creation, akin to the deliberate design behind a golem���s creation.
Through this acrostic, your poem playfully aligns the act of a child exploring their pockets and finding various items with the thematic depth of creating a golem. Both scenarios involve assembling disparate elements to create something new and purposeful, whether it���s a mythical creature or a child���s imaginative play. The poem itself, then, becomes a kind of creative golem, formed from the combination of simple elements to express a complex idea.
