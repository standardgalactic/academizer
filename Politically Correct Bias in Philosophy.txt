Abstract:I submit that epistemic progress in key areas of contemporary academic philosophy has 
been compromised by politically correct (âPCâ) ideology. First, guided by an evolutionary account of 
ideology, results from social and cognitive psychology and formal philosophical methods, I expose 
evidence for political bias in contemporary Western academia and sketch a formalization for the 
contents of beliefs from the PC worldview taken to be of core importance, the theory of social 
oppression and the thesis of anthropological mental egalitarianism. Then, aided by discussions from 
contemporary epistemology on epistemic values, I model the problem of epistemic appraisal using the 
frameworks of multi-objective optimization theory and multi-criteria decision analysis and apply it to 
politically correct philosophy. I conclude that philosophy guided by politically correct values is bound 
to produce constructs that are less truth-conducive and that spurious values which are ideologically 
motivated should be abandoned. Objections to my framework stemming from contextual empiricism, 
the feminine voice in ethics and political philosophy are considered. I conclude by prescribing the 
epistemic value of empirical adequacy, the contextual value of political diversity and the moral virtue 
of moral courage to reverse unwarranted trends in academic philosophy due to PC ideology.

1. Introduction 
Western philosophy is under threat. The grand intellectual tradition that for over two thousand 
years has fostered iconoclastic freethinkers of the highest caliberâfrom Socrates to Hypatia of 
Alexandria and from William of Ockham to Giordano Brunoâhas been infected by a spirit of uncritical 
conformity that is incompatible with its original pursuits. This time, the foe is not a persecutory 
institutional religion but a persecutory secular ideology. This ideology has become so ingrained in 
humanities departments all over the (so-called) First World that it has become a received view, a default 
position under which all other perspectives are evaluated. And dissenting points of view have been 
stormed, not mainly by intellectual argument the way they should, but by political rhetoric and social 
bullying. 
The crux of the matter was pinpointed by social psychologist Jonathan Haidt [1]. Haidt, speaking 
in the context of contemporary North American higher education, argued that universities as a whole 
have been pursuing two mutually incompatible teloiâtruth and social justice 1. As research aiming 
1 Naturally, to talk about âtruthâ and âsocial justiceâ in theses cases is an abstraction; save for hardcore Fregeans, seekers 
of truth do not aim for a particular object called The True but intend to reach at the end of rational investigations true 
truth-bearers (beliefs, statements, theories, etc.). Analogously, what sincere partisans of social justice desire are actual concrete 
changes in the socioeconomic sphere.

at truth is constrained by standards of objectivity, research aiming at social justice is constrained by 
standards of political correctnessâand the output of both may diverge dramatically. 
The recognition that political ideology has been harmfully interfering in the thought processes of 
professional philosophers of unquestionable intelligence and expertise is not often obvious. Robust 
empirical results in behavioral economics and cognitive and social psychology over the last four 
decades have consistently shown that human beings are less the creatures of deliberate rational inquiry 
weâd wish them to be as they are of instinctive bias, confabulation, and groupthink [2â4]. 
Although this ideology, unlike other ancient institutional enemies of philosophy, is not overtly 
homicidal 2, I claim that it is promoting the assassination of character, deterring the publication of 
quality research papers, inhibiting the participation of researchers that defend politically unwelcome 
theses in the academic arena and hindering epistemic progress on critical issues of our times such as 
the metaphysics of race and sex and the intellectual legitimacy of divergent political beliefs and values.1 / 1ChatGPTChatGPTPolitical Correctness in AcademiaAcademic institutions should ideally be free spaces for the exploration and cultivation of ideas, a refuge for intellectual discourse where debates can be conducted rationally, objectively, and respectfully. However, the prevailing trend of politically correct ideology threatens this cherished principle of intellectual freedom. In academia, the political correctness ("PC") ideology is an accepted norm that imposes a significant bias on intellectual discourses, which can have detrimental impacts on academic progress.An examination of the extant literature indicates that political correctness is not only prevalent in Western academia but is also guiding academic discourses. Political correctness manifests itself in the form of preconceived notions and biases, particularly the assumption that all social phenomena result from systems of social oppression, and the belief in anthropological mental egalitarianism, i.e., the idea that all human beings possess equal cognitive abilities.These politically correct beliefs, however pervasive, are not free from limitations. In fact, they can impede intellectual progress by stifling dissenting views and curbing rigorous scholarly debates. This is evident in how research aimed at truth-seeking diverges significantly from research guided by politically correct values.Politically Correct Philosophy and its LimitationsWhile philosophy guided by politically correct values may have its merits, such as promoting empathy, inclusivity, and a sense of social justice, it also has inherent drawbacks. One significant drawback is that politically correct philosophy tends to produce less truth-conducive constructs. This is because political correctness often prioritizes certain ideologically motivated values over empirical adequacy. The priority of ideology over truth compromises the rigor and credibility of academic work.Furthermore, this ideology has repercussions that extend beyond the realm of philosophical discourse. It not only inhibits the publishing of quality research papers that challenge its presuppositions but also deters the participation of researchers who defend politically unwelcome theses.ConclusionIn conclusion, academic philosophy should avoid the pitfall of prioritizing politically correct values over empirical adequacy. To counteract the negative impact of political correctness, academia should promote the epistemic value of empirical adequacy, the contextual value of political diversity, and the moral virtue of moral courage. This approach can facilitate an atmosphere of robust debate and encourage intellectual diversity, thus helping to ensure the continued vitality and progress of academic philosophy.It is crucial for academic philosophy to return to its roots of freethinking, intellectual rigor, and truth-seeking, reminiscent of its iconic figures such as Socrates, Hypatia of Alexandria, and William of Ockham. Only by doing so can it resist the unreasonable destructiveness of political correctness and maintain its role as a cornerstone of intellectual discourse and societal progress.[End of Article]Acknowledgments: Thanks to the Advanced Studies Research Group and Fuzzy Sets Laboratory PIT, Production Engineering Program, COPPE, UFRJ for their support and input.Conflicts of Interest: The author declares no conflict of interest.1 / 1The recognition that political ideology has been harmfully interfering in the thought processes of

the metaphysics of race and sex and the intellectual legitimacy of divergent political beliefs and values. 
The most conspicuous face of political correctness (hereafter shortened as âPCâ) is amply familiar; 
the enforcement of verbal norms intended to regulate speech which may elicit emotional responses 
of negative valence to individuals of socioeconomically disadvantaged groups. The hallmark of this 
process is the phenomenon of lexical substitution through euphemisms (such as the replacement 
of âprostituteâ for âsex workerâ); these are at the bottom strategic enactments of the moral virtue of 
politeness in the context of interpersonal verbal interaction meant to decrease hostility and increase 
cooperation among diverse parties [6]. 
Notwithstanding, I am primarily interested in the deeper, covert inf l uences of PC in human 
cognition. In particular, how PC may negatively disrupt rationality in contexts of epistemic appraisal 
of theories by professional philosophers. As I will argue in detail, one of the reasons why I hold 
PC carries this penetration over rational inquiry is due to focal, often implicit, claims in history, 
economics, sociology, anthropology and psychology that ground the very motivation for why one 
should be politically correct. For instance, peripherally this includes the claim that existing rampant 
patterns of verbal behavior (and surrounding non-verbal behavior) perceived as discriminatory 
signif i cantly cause the persisting sustenance of socioeconomic inequality among socially disadvantaged 
groups (for an overview of this complex subject, see [7]). But more crucially, we i nd the claim that 
socioeconomic potential, as it is constrained by mental ability, is about the same for every human group. 
My strategy is as follows: 
1.In Section 2, I sketch an empirical theory of ideology to guide discussions of detrimental 
ideological bias over i elds of inquiry; 
2.In Section 3, I review some of the evidence that points to the presence of widespread political bias 
of a âleft-wingâ or âprogressiveâ variety throughout Western institutions of higher education, 
including academic philosophy; 
3.In Section 4, I brief l y expose a speculative etiology of PC and attempt to formalize the content of 
several beliefs associated with PC to understand the underlying worldview; 
4.In Section 5, building upon some formal constructs I have introduced in the previous section 
and additional ones from applied science, I defend the epistemic integrity of philosophy as 
a truth-seeking enterprise and how PC concerns of social justice may undermine the epistemic 
prowess of philosophy; 
5.In Section 6, I respond to three lines of argument cogent to the idea that philosophy requires 
socially progressive political values in order to be truth-seeking; 
6.In Section 7, I i nish this work with some tentative prescriptions of how to reverse existing 
deleterious ideological effects due to political bias in academic philosophy. 
2 It must be pointed out that postmodernism, stipulated as one of the central progenitors of this ideology I criticize, has generated 
virulent thought patterns which overtly promote anti-scientific thinking that may end up with the loss of lives; for instance, 
the accusation that evidence-based medicine is âfascistâ [5] may influence the adoption of non-evidence-based medicine.1 / 1ChatGPTChatGPTThe influence of political ideology on the cognitive processes of professional philosophers is an issue of concern. Cognitive and social psychology have repeatedly demonstrated over the past four decades that humans often rely on instinctive bias, confabulation, and groupthink over deliberate rational inquiry. While political ideology may not pose a physical threat, it does promote character assassination, inhibits the publishing of quality research, limits participation of certain researchers, and hinders progress on essential topics such as race and gender metaphysics and the legitimacy of varying political beliefs.Political correctness (PC) is most noticeably displayed in the enforcement of verbal norms that aim to regulate speech to avoid negative emotional responses among socioeconomically disadvantaged groups. However, the deeper influences of PC on human cognition are of particular interest, particularly its disruption of rationality in the epistemic appraisal of theories by professional philosophers.The following sections will address the aspects and implications of this issue:In Section 2, an empirical theory of ideology will be sketched to guide discussions of harmful ideological bias over fields of inquiry.In Section 3, evidence pointing to the presence of widespread political bias of a "left-wing" or "progressive" variety throughout Western higher education institutions, including academic philosophy, will be reviewed.In Section 4, a speculative etiology of PC will be presented, and the content of several beliefs associated with PC will be formalized to understand the underlying worldview.In Section 5, using formal constructs from applied science, the epistemic integrity of philosophy as a truth-seeking enterprise will be defended and how PC concerns of social justice may undermine the epistemic prowess of philosophy will be addressed.In Section 6, three lines of argument relevant to the idea that philosophy requires socially progressive political values to be truth-seeking will be responded to.In Section 7, tentative prescriptions on how to reverse existing harmful ideological effects due to political bias in academic philosophy will be discussed.Despite the seeming harmlessness of postmodernism, identified as one of the central progenitors of the ideology criticized here, it's important to note that it has generated virulent thought patterns which promote anti-scientific thinking, potentially leading to real-world harm. For instance, branding evidence-based medicine as "fascist" could influence the adoption of non-evidence-based medicine with possible loss of lives.1 / 12. A Sketch of an Empirical Account of Ideology 
âIdeologyâ, as political scientist David McLellan puts it, âis the most elusive concept in the whole 
of the social sciencesâ [8]. Given this confession and two centuries of convoluted discussion on the 
topic, I shy away from supplying a fully-f l edged theoretical account of ideology 3 and will instead 
deploy a preliminary informal characterization that will be suff i ciently rich, inspired in a large number 
of sources. 
I isolate seven desiderata: 
Postulate 1(Cultural-Biological Parity).The cultural content of ideologiesIiare the products of processes 
of cultural evolution whose mechanisms behave suff i ciently similar to Neodarwinian biological evolution to 
enable warranted analogies involving biological systems. 
This postulate is a general theoretical endorsement of an evolutionary account of culture. More 
specif i cally, I side with the i eld of memetics, a broad research program in cultural evolution that is yet 
to achieve satisfactory scientif i c credibility as a theory of both mental and cultural content and cultural 
change and diffusion 4. 
Employing a murky theoretical concept to explain another murky theoretical concept seems to be 
asking for failure. In defense, such an evolutionary account of culture, by being consilient with several 
results from the cognitive sciences, may do justice to features traditionally ascribed to ideology by 
social theorists, such as relatively stable conceptual cohesiveness (Postulate 6) and the unconscious 
control of behavior (Postulate 3). 
Meme theorists posit âmemesâ as discrete replicating informational entities to perform 
foundational roles in the social sciences analogous to the way genes do in the biological sciences. 
In analogy to coadaptive gene complexes inside genomes, ideologies can be readily seen as a type of 
co-adaptive meme complexes (or simply âmemeplexesâ). A memeplex is a coalition of memes which are 
reproductively i tter as a packaged whole. 
Viewing ideologies as organisms of sorts promptly allow us to adopt the intentional stance [18] 
towards them and commence the attribution of goal-directed behavior. Just like we do with biological 
organisms, we can assign to memeplexes metaphorical purposes to spread their memes throughout 
human societies. 
Employing memetics to theorize about ideology is not novel; it has already been comprehensively 
explored in James Balkinâs [19] theory of cultural software. Memetics has also been employed to 
understand the cultural evolution of religion [20]. If religion is a species of the genus ideology, 
comparisons with religions can be fruitful.1 / 1ChatGPTChatGPT"Ideology," as political scientist David McLellan asserts, is a rather elusive concept within social sciences. Rather than offering a comprehensive theoretical account of ideology, a preliminary informal characterization inspired by a number of sources will be utilized, with seven postulates identified:Postulate 1 (Cultural-Biological Parity) posits that the cultural content of ideologies are products of cultural evolution processes. These processes mirror the mechanisms of Neodarwinian biological evolution closely enough to warrant analogies involving biological systems.This postulate supports a general evolutionary account of culture, more specifically aligning with the field of memetics, a research program in cultural evolution. While memetics has yet to gain full scientific credibility as a theory of both mental and cultural content, as well as cultural change and diffusion, its consilience with various findings from cognitive sciences lends it credibility.Meme theorists suggest "memes" as discrete replicating informational entities, performing foundational roles in social sciences analogous to the role of genes in biological sciences. Ideologies can be seen as co-adaptive meme complexes (or "memeplexes"), coalitions of memes which reproduce more effectively as a packaged whole.By viewing ideologies as organism-like entities, it allows us to adopt the intentional stance towards them, attributing goal-directed behavior. Just as we do with biological organisms, we can assign metaphorical purposes to memeplexes to spread their memes throughout human societies.This memetic approach to ideology is not new; it has been explored in James Balkin's theory of cultural software and applied to understand the cultural evolution of religion. As religion can be considered a type of ideology, comparisons with religions can provide insightful parallels.1 / 1Postulate2(ContentPluralism).TheculturalcontentsofanideologyIincludesociallytransmittedcognitive 
mechanisms, beliefs, and values. 
Following James Balkin [19] (Chapter 5), I take the phenomenon of ideology to be irreducible 
to a single type of component or bearer of content (such as explicit beliefs with propositional form). 
A memetic approach to human culture is not restricted to study procedural knowledge in the form 
3 In analytic philosophy, one of the most comprehensive expositions of ideology is Mario Bungeâs set-theoretical account 
of a sociopolitical ideology, which is a kind of belief system, a subtype of epistemic i eld (see [9] ( p. 91); [10] (pp. 228â237) 
and [11] (Chapter 4)) for description and discussion). Such an approach would be especially congenial to my work 
given my usage of his construct of a i eld of inquiry, the other type of epistemic i eld, which structurally is very similar to 
sociopolitical ideologies. 
4 The literature of cultural evolution is extensive and evolving very rapidly. Memetics differs from other theoretical 
accounts of cultural evolution due to an assumption that the processes of cultural evolution are isomorphic to biological 
evolution concerning details of the individuation of cultural information (discrete) and transmission (relatively high i delity). 
For an evolutionaryaccount of culture outside memetics, see [12]. Introductory defenses of memetics are found in [13,14]. 
A comprehensive critical assessment is found in [15]. For some incisive criticism of memetics, see [16,17]. 
Philosophies 2017, 2, 174 of 56 
of beliefs or their linguistic representations; more importantly, it also encompasses skills that can be 
culturally transmitted. Specif i cally for a memetic understanding of ideology, we are interested in 
a wide variety of cognitive mechanisms (such as patterns of inference chains, heuristics, narrative scripts, 
idealized cognitive models, etc.). 
Postulate 3(Unconscious Processing).The contents of an ideologyIare by default processed without major 
willful deliberation in the minds of the adherents A. 
This postulate assumes a theoretical endorsement of so-called âdual-processesâ theories of 
reasoning or cognition (for contemporary reviews, see [21,22]). This perspective posits two âlayersâ of 
cognitive processing; the faster one is phylogenetically ancient, bears processes which are effortless, 
automatic and unconscious and content that is nonlinguistic. The slower one evolved recently in our 
species, is cognitively demanding, is under our conscious control and supervision and is associated 
with discursive or linguistic thought in the âstream of consciousnessâ. 
This postulate was chief l y inspired by the notion of a vision described by political scientist Thomas 
Sowell [23]. Sowell characterizes a vision as a âpre-analyticâ cognitive actâ and âmore like a hunch or 
âgut feelingâ than an exercise in logic or factual verif i cationâ [23] (pp. 16â20). I submit that ideologies 
interfere with thought processes chief l y through our more instinctive mind. 
An important consequence of this is that ideological reasoning may not be readily presentable by 
introspection as ideological, irrespective of the intellectual abilities of the agent. To identify ideological 
inf l uence may be extremely costly, requiring extensive cognitive effort. 
Postulate 4(The Worldview Constraint).An ideologyIfurnishes the minds of its adherents with both 
pretheoretical contents (such as intuitions and platitudes) and with the conceptual resources which allow for 
deliberate theoretical elaborations, under varying degrees of specificity, over a set of issues which are deemed to be 
relevant for the adherent. 
I second Marxist sociologist GÃ¶ran Therborn [24] in his claim that âthe operation of ideology 
in human life basically involves the constitution and patterning of how human beings live their 
lives as conscious, ref l ecting initiators of acts in a structured, meaningful worldâ. Ideologies are 
comprehensive charts that readily ground, inform and guide human action under a myriad of ref l ective 
decision-making contexts. They carry the resources needed to construe answers for a variety of possible 
inquiries. In other words, ideologies are worldviews. The set of domains over which an ideology informs 
can vary extensively, from the most general and abstract (such as viewpoints in ontology or legitimate 
practices of knowledge-acquisition) to the more specif i c and concrete (such as particular notions of 
social causation or even a partial description of a particular economic theory). The more an ideology 
has nurtured a culture of internal criticism, the more one may expect it to have its tenets publicly 
expressed in theoretical form. 
Postulate 5(Biocultural Symbiosis).For an ideologyI, there exists at least one social groupS, whose set 
of collective goals G0intersect with the set of goals G of the ideology I. 
With this postulate, ideologies become worldviews which advance the interests of at least one social 
group. This account of ideology is descriptive instead of pejorative; there can be âbenignâ ideologies 
insofar as social groups can have âbenignâ goals. 
1 / 1ChatGPTChatGPTPostulate 2 (Content Pluralism) suggests that the cultural contents of an ideology include socially transmitted cognitive mechanisms, beliefs, and values. This perspective follows James Balkin's notion that ideology cannot be reduced to a single type of component or bearer of content. The memetic approach to human culture takes into account not just explicit beliefs but also culturally transmitted skills and a variety of cognitive mechanisms.Postulate 3 (Unconscious Processing) posits that the contents of an ideology are processed without major deliberate consideration in the minds of the adherents. This notion is influenced by dual-process theories of reasoning or cognition, which posit two layers of cognitive processing. The faster layer is automatic, unconscious, and nonlinguistic, while the slower layer involves conscious control, cognitive effort, and linguistic thought.Postulate 4 (The Worldview Constraint) states that an ideology provides its adherents with both pretheoretical contents and the conceptual resources necessary for deliberate theoretical elaborations. Ideologies are comprehensive frameworks that guide human action across a wide range of decision-making contexts. They offer resources to provide answers for various potential inquiries, making ideologies function as worldviews.Postulate 5 (Biocultural Symbiosis) suggests that for any ideology, there exists at least one social group whose collective goals intersect with the goals of the ideology. This postulate makes ideologies function as worldviews that advance the interests of at least one social group, and this understanding of ideology is descriptive, meaning there can be "benign" ideologies as long as social groups have "benign" goals.1 / 1Postulate 5(Biocultural Symbiosis).For an ideologyI, there exists at least one social groupS, whose set 
of collective goals G0intersect with the set of goals G of the ideology I. 
With this postulate, ideologies become worldviews which advance the interests of at least one social 
group. This account of ideology is descriptive instead of pejorative; there can be âbenignâ ideologies 
insofar as social groups can have âbenignâ goals. 
Postulate 6(Ideological Core).An ideologyIis partially constituted by a web of beliefsp1,...,pnpartitioned 
by a gradient assigning different degrees of importance, from the essential to the optional. The furthest a belief 
pfrom the âcoreâ, the less one adherent is obliged to endorsep. The content ofpis propositional and can be 
empirically extracted. 
Philosophies 2017, 2, 175 of 56 
This postulate is inspired by Imre Lakatosâ [25] account of research programs where a scientific theory 
is said to have a robust âhard coreâ, extremely resilient to refutation, surrounded by a myriad of âauxiliary 
hypothesisâ sporting greater changeability. Using an analogy with evolutionary developmental biology 
(Postulate 1), I take it that ideological cores roughly work like co-adaptive gene complexes involved with 
essential biological functions [26]; changes in core beliefs are highly pleiotropic, that is, when changed, 
they reverberate signif i cative changes over many other beliefs in the network. I also submit that 
âmutationsâ over beliefs deeper in the core of an ideology are also more likely to be deleterious; that is, 
they are more prone to produce nonviable cultural entities. 
For instance, the religious ideology of Islam has as a core belief that Muhammad was the last 
and greatest of all prophets sent by Allah. Can there be a species of Islam divorced from the belief in 
a historical Muhammad 5? I take it that the overwhelming unpopularity of such a position is evidence 
for the nonviability of Islam that suffers such a signif i cant âmemeticâ deletion. 
Postulate 7(Rational Dogmatism).The social costs of abandoning a beliefpincrease the nearerpstands at 
the core ofIand the more committed the adherent is toI. When the truth ofpis disputed, we should expect that 
adherents will predictably incur in behavior and cognition aiming at securing the alethic endorsement of p. 
In ordinary parlance, âideologyâ and âirrationalityâ are usually seen as inseparable friends and 
âdogmatismâ and ârationalityâ as polar opposites. I submit, given contemporary developments in 
moral philosophy, behavioral economics, and social psychology, that this is mistaken. 
While reluctant and consistent dogmatism over beliefs which have been overwhelmingly refuted 
by empirical evidence is a gross intellectual failure from the point of view of the standards that ought 
to regulate scientif i c practice, not so necessarily from the point of view of the norms that guide human 
social reality. In contrast to the default conceptions of rationality, researcher Dan Kahan [28] situates 
identity-protective cognition theory, which shall be deployed to explain ideological dogmatism, in the 
tradition of expressive rationality defended by philosopher Elizabeth Anderson [29]. 
The theory of identity-protective cognition [30,31] advances the following picture; our nature 
as rational social mammals drives us into acceptance inside social groupsâsocial belonging is 
a fundamental source of well-being.And, if the thesis that ideology is inescapable rings true, 
group-membership comes with a package of beliefs and values over which endorsement under varying 
degrees (Postulate 7) is expected. This conceptual and affective bundle structures our experience into 
worldviews (Postulate 4). 
When the ideological core is challenged, a myriad of phenomena may take place. For instance, 
opposing viewpoints can be unconsciously registered (Postulate 3) as threats to the individual and the 
collective integrities, eliciting emotional responses of anger and priming insults and other aggressive 
behaviors. The thresholds of conf i rmation for antagonistic hypothesis may be subjected to unrelenting 
âgoalpost-turningâ, accumulating ad hoc explanations just like a scientif i c research program facing 
an experimental anomaly.1 / 1ChatGPTChatGPTPostulate 5 (Biocultural Symbiosis) suggests that for an ideology, there exists at least one social group whose collective goals intersect with the goals of the ideology. Thus, ideologies can be considered worldviews that advance the interests of at least one social group. This understanding of ideology is descriptive and not pejorative, indicating that there can be "benign" ideologies if social groups have "benign" goals.Postulate 6 (Ideological Core) indicates that an ideology is partially constituted by a network of beliefs of varying importance, from essential to optional. The more central a belief is to the ideology, the more critical it is for an adherent to endorse it. The content of these beliefs can be empirically extracted. This postulate draws parallels to the structure of scientific theories, where core beliefs are like essential biological functions that, when changed, reverberate significant changes across many other beliefs in the network.Postulate 7 (Rational Dogmatism) states that the social costs of abandoning a belief increase the closer that belief is to the core of the ideology and the more committed the adherent is to the ideology. Thus, when the truth of a belief is disputed, adherents are likely to behave and think in ways that uphold the truth of the belief. This postulate challenges the conventional view that ideology and irrationality go hand in hand, and that dogmatism and rationality are opposites. It suggests that while consistent dogmatism over empirically refuted beliefs is a failure from a scientific perspective, it may not necessarily be so from the perspective of social norms. When the ideological core is challenged, this can trigger a range of reactions, from emotional responses to unconscious rejection of opposing viewpoints.1 / 13. Ideological Bias in Contemporary Western Academia 
The Western world, spearheaded by the United States of America and the nations of Western 
Europe, stands as the keystone of human scholarship regarding the production of knowledge and its 
global inf l uence 6. 
American universities are thus institutions centrally involved in this dynamics of power and 
knowledge. They also house many stereotypes. Among these, the outspoken commitment to social 
liberal values of diversity and inclusiveness throughout the campuses occupies a privileged position. 
5 Such a theological hypothesis is explored in [27]. 
6 For a quantitative measure of this, the Scimago Journal & Country Rank maintained by the company Scimago Lab has 
bibliometric data up to 2015 which can be accessed in http://www.scimagojr.com/countryrank.php. See also [32]. 
Philosophies 2017, 2, 176 of 56 
But in def i ance to these values, there exists one arena in which uniformity and exclusiveness appear to 
be the norm, and that is the sphere of political aff i liation. Survey data on the politics of the American 
professorship, varyingly gauged as a function of self-reported ideological labels (for instance, ordinal 
variables such as âextremely liberalâ or âslightly liberalâ) and party aff i liation (predilection for voting 
in Democratic candidates) display a noticeable tendency towards the political Left [33â36]. This pattern 
is even more skewed when we consider the clusters of the humanities and social sciences in isolation, 
thereby conf i rming another stereotype about academia in general. 
But why should that matter? NaÃ¯ve ref l ection could suggest that there exists no logical connection 
between the political aff i liation of a researcher and the epistemic quality of his rational inquiry. 
Under the account of ideology I have sketched, if pure mathematicians working with category theory 
were overwhelmingly fascists, and astrophysicists specializing in extragalactic celestial mechanics were 
overwhelmingly constitutional monarchists, it would be hard to say how the cognitive output in their 
research i elds could be compromised by their political beliefs because the associated sociopolitical 
ideologies have nothing relevant to say and prescribe concerning the contents of metamathematics 
and astronomy. 
But in academic reality, practical connections between politics and academic compromise 
abound anytime the referents of ideological cores are the very objects being studied. The empirical 
evidence suggests that political homogeneity simpliciter is epistemically detrimental to i elds of 
inquiry that engage with politically controversial subjects. The pervasive phenomenon of motivated 
conf i rmation bias [37], the often automatic cognitive tendency to perceive novel evidence as being 
supportive of previously accepted or believed hypotheses, gets hypertrophied in the presence of 
rising ideological polarization inside a group [38], the phenomenon in which pre-existing dominant 
ideological commitments are strengthened and exaggerated. This synergy may create an âecho 
chamberâ, ahomogeneousbatchofcontentthatonlygetsrehearsedandcirculatedinsideitsboundaries 
(see [39] for a discussion of a computational model of an âecho chamberâ). This process, once kicked 
off in academic settings, may viciously imperil the very (so-called) âself-correctingâ institutional 
mechanisms of science, such as the peer-review process (see [40] for a comprehensive analysis of this 
dynamics in the context of contemporary social psychology). 
The most troublesome and detailed empirical data comes from American researchers in social 
and moral psychology studying political diversity and the effects of political bias in their own 
overwhelmingly âliberalâ or âleft-wingâ i elds. Concerning the consequences of this ideological 
hegemony in psychology, researchers have found evidence for discrimination in publishing, hiring, 
symposium invitation and grant application by scientists of a conservative persuasion [41]. Research 
has also challenged certain political stereotypes. For instance, there is evidence that intolerance 
against ideological out-groups, ordinarily perceived to be a prototypical feature of conservative 
âright-wingersâ, is just as present in liberal âleft-wingersâ [42]. Specif i c ways in which established 
empirical results in psychology could have been distorted by âleft-wingâ ideological bias were also 
delineated. For instance, the institution of double standards under which the truth of an empirical 
hypothesis supportive to a conservative worldview is required to satisfy impervious standards of 
conf i rmation as the truth of hypothesis of undetermined alethic status which is congenial to a liberal 
worldview is presumed [43].1 / 1ChatGPTChatGPTThis section discusses the perceived ideological bias in contemporary Western academia, particularly in American universities, which are often viewed as bastions of knowledge and power. Despite their commitment to liberal values of diversity and inclusiveness, these institutions are also seen as politically homogeneous, leaning towards the political left, especially in the fields of humanities and social sciences.The author questions whether this political affiliation of researchers impacts the epistemic quality of their research. It is suggested that in fields like pure mathematics or astrophysics, where research isn't directly linked to socio-political ideologies, the researchers' political affiliations wouldn't necessarily influence the output of their work. However, in fields engaging with politically controversial subjects, the empirical evidence suggests that political homogeneity can be detrimental. This is due to the phenomenon of motivated confirmation bias and rising ideological polarization within a group, leading to what's often referred to as an "echo chamber." This could potentially endanger the self-correcting mechanisms of science, such as the peer-review process.Findings from American researchers in social and moral psychology provide detailed empirical data supporting these claims. It is suggested that there's evidence for discrimination in publishing, hiring, symposium invitation, and grant application against conservative-leaning scientists in overwhelmingly liberal fields. Interestingly, the research also challenges some political stereotypes, such as the notion that intolerance against ideological out-groups is a feature of conservative "right-wingers". Evidence suggests that such intolerance is equally prevalent among liberal "left-wingers".The author also discusses the establishment of double standards, where empirical hypotheses supportive of a conservative worldview face more stringent standards of confirmation than hypotheses congenial to a liberal worldview, thus implying a potential distortion of empirical results due to this ideological bias.1 / 13.1. Political-Ideological Bias in Contemporary Western Philosophy 
What is the status of ideological bias in anglophone philosophy? Similar in-depth empirical 
investigations of particular effects of political-ideological bias in the i eld of philosophy are necessary 
but lacking. However, for the time being, I hold that the inductive inference that contemporary 
philosophy is suffering from similar epistemically detrimental âleft-wingâ bias is projectable. More still; 
I predict that the situation is even worse. 
Philosophies 2017, 2, 177 of 56 
This extrapolation from existing data is warranted for many reasons. First, existing survey 
data mentioned in the previous section on the political aff i liations of philosophers display 
intense homogeneity. 
Second, from a historical point of view, since the social sciences have been the last to emerge from 
philosophy, I hold that they can be reasonably expected to have a signif i cant shared academic culture, 
from the general values guiding scholarship to particular research methodologies. The mere fact that 
the humanities and social sciences often share the same superordinate department in universities may 
promote this condition. As an additional factor, the paradigm of critical theory which Iâll claim has 
had a foundational role in the sociopolitical ideology behind PC, blurs the institutional distinctions 
between philosophy and social science by design. 
Third, some existing investigations exposing particular political biases in the scholarship of 
neighboring academic disciplines in the humanities reproduce the pattern found in psychology. For 
instance, in the context of American law, a statistical analysis made by political scientist Adam Chilton 
and legal scholar Eric Posner exposed that researchers who vote Democrat write more ideologically 
charged articles than researchers who vote Republican [44]. 
Fourth, the theoretical backbone of prevailing political ideologies has historically been articulated, 
innovated and advanced to a large part by philosophers working in normative ethics and political 
philosophy, from sketched generic frameworks to upfront detailed sociopolitical systems. In the 
actual world, there is no classical liberalism without John Locke, communism without Karl Marx or 
anarcho-primitivism without Henry David Thoreau. As philosophy became a professional career, 
a thinker with ideological impact is likely to be aff i liated with a particular university. Therefore, 
we should expect academic philosophy, comprised of a network involving teachers, students, 
classrooms, conference rooms, and journals, to be a prolif i c spawning ground of political ideologies. 
Fifth, there is some evidence that suggests that philosophers, particularly those dealing with 
normative disciplines, are in general less well-equipped than scientists to identify bias. For instance, 
philosopher Alan HÃ¡jek [45] has argued that in contrast to other professional academics, members 
of his profession are in general less conscious of their tacitly employed heuristics. In conventional 
philosophical methodology, the over-reliance on intuition as a source of content for philosophical 
argument is particularly problematic. The analogical claim that when intuitions are at hand, the 
philosophical expertise of professional philosophers grants a carry-over effect to philosophical 
cognition that is similar to the one appreciated by professional scientists has been challenged in 
light of recent results in the research program of experimental philosophy [46]. More dramatically in 
the subf i eld of moral philosophy, one of the very intellectual arenas that just scream for political 
controversy, the expertise of professional philosophers as sources of better intuitions has been 
questioned [47]. Under an experimental setting, while reasoning about moral dilemmas, professional 
moral philosophers have displayed signif i cantly more susceptibility to framing effects (bias related to 
irrelevant differences in the presentation of a problem) than professional non-philosophers [48]. 
Finally, throughout the very tradition of analytic philosophy, self-congratulatorily exposed as 
a bastion of uncompromising rationality, semantic exactness and logical rigor, where we should prima 
facie expect the least ideological bias (so much for faulty intuitions), there exists anecdotal evidence 
of key philosophers reasoning on political causes in ways that would be deemed irrational under 
standards of objectivity [49]. To sum it up, contemporary cognitive psychology is consistent with the 
fact that one can sport a very cunning and logical mind when dealing with certain matters while being 
the subject of incapacitating âblind spots" in other areas. 
1 / 1ChatGPTChatGPTThis section discusses the potential for political-ideological bias in the field of contemporary Western philosophy, with the author suggesting that this field may suffer from a "left-wing" bias similar to the bias identified in social sciences, but potentially more severe.The author presents several reasons for this assertion:Survey data on the political affiliations of philosophers displays intense homogeneity, indicating a strong tendency towards one particular ideology.Given the historical emergence of social sciences from philosophy, the two fields share a significant academic culture, values, and research methodologies. The influence of critical theory, which blurs the distinction between philosophy and social science, might further promote this condition.There are existing investigations that have exposed political biases in humanities disciplines closely related to philosophy, reinforcing the potential for a similar pattern in philosophy.The theoretical backbone of many prevailing political ideologies has historically been articulated and advanced by philosophers. Thus, the academic philosophy network, including teachers, students, and conferences, could potentially be a breeding ground for political ideologies.Some evidence suggests that philosophers, especially those in normative disciplines, are generally less well-equipped than scientists to identify bias. For instance, philosophers often rely on intuition for argumentation, which can be problematic. Experimental philosophy has challenged the notion that philosophical expertise provides a level of objectivity similar to that in the sciences.In the tradition of analytic philosophy, there is anecdotal evidence of key philosophers reasoning on political causes in ways that would be considered irrational under objective standards. Contemporary cognitive psychology suggests that it's possible to be logically rigorous in certain areas while having "blind spots" in others.In sum, the author suggests that further in-depth empirical investigations are necessary to confirm the extent of ideological bias in philosophy. However, based on the available evidence, the author proposes that the field is likely impacted by significant "left-wing" bias.1 / 14. A View to the Politically Correct Worldview 
So far, the primary ideological bias in vogue in the academia has only been generically 
characterized as âliberalâ or âleft-wingâ. The more precise issue of ideological inf l uence that is 
politically correct remains unaccounted. To truly probe the phenomenon, we must add specif i c content, 
a task I shall begin to explore in this section. 
Philosophies 2017, 2, 178 of 56 
4.1. The Underlying Theme Behind Recent Incidents Involving PC Philosophy 
Consider the following recent events in contemporary academic philosophy: 
â¢The 
journal Public Health Ethics rejected a paper on the moral consequences of scientif i c research 
in genetic anthropology [50]. The author argues 7 that the reasons for the rejection are due to the 
fact that the paper considered, ex hypothesi (and not as an actual factual statement) the thesis that 
racial differences in behavior and cultural achievement are partially genetic in origin. 
â¢A 
lecturer discontinued the teaching of a popular practical ethics course at the University of Texas, 
which had run for over three decades 8. His decision was motivated by persisting systematic 
disruptions of his class in recent years by outsiders and undergraduates that resisted the exposition 
and debate of viewpoints deemed to be morally unacceptable (un-PC) in topics such as abortion, 
immigration, and aff i rmative action. 
â¢The editors of the distinguished Stanford Encyclopedia Of Philosophy, motivated by the empirical 
hypothesis that pervasive and systematic sexual discrimination towards women in philosophy is 
the leading cause of their academic undercitation, have led the to ask the invited authors to inf l ate 
the citations with publications from scholars of minority status. The truth of the discrimination 
hypothesis of sexism in academic philosophy has been challenged with bibliometric data [51]. 
â¢The 
American Philosophical Association has been asked by an expert in disability studies [52] to 
remove the phrase âblind peer reviewâ because it is allegedly discriminatory against blind and 
visually impaired people. 
â¢The student union from the School of Oriental and Asian Studies of Buckingham University has 
demanded that most White philosophers studied under the philosophy syllabus be dropped and 
replaced by philosophers from the African and Asian continents 9. 
Events such as these abound in the centers and peripheries of Western academia (for a critical 
assessment of this trend, see [53]) and are part of a grander social dynamics. In this scenery, we can 
add a profusion of neologistic phrases and expressions such as âtrigger warningâ, âsafe spaceâ and 
âwhite privilegeâ entering public discourse, the shift for traditional âleft-wingâ concerns with the 
working class towards the identity politics of generally smaller social groups and the perceived sense 
of detachment between older liberal professors and their Millennial far-left students. 
What is going on? I state that these events all resonate a same underlying theme: a demand for 
social justice. It is in this setting that contemporary critics of PC, not so much from the ivory towers 
but those standing on the roads of asphalt and engaged with internet culture, berate their adversaries 
as social justice warriors (âSJWsâ) 10. In the age of polarizing i gures from Caitlyn Jenner to Donald 
Trump, âsocial justiceâ is simultaneously appraised by the millions as both sacred value and unholy 
sin. But what exactly is this vilif i ed âsocial justiceâ that these âwarriorsâ are âf i ghtingâ for? 
In its leanest sense, âsocial justiceâ simply refers to distributive justice; families of theories in 
normative economics, ethics and political philosophy centered at the fair allocation of material and 
non-material goods in human societies (for a critical overview, see [54]). 
At i rst sight, it is true that the sense of social justice associated with âSJWsâ is strongly 
committed to soaring demands of distributive justice in social policy (such as aff i rmative actions 
for minority groups and international reparations for slavery and war) and the enforcement of norms 
deemed to be equity-contributing in both the public and private sphere (such as sensitivity trainings 
and zero-tolerance policies in businesses). But these, I claim, are but some of the salient practical manifestations of an underlying worldview that cannot be readily identif i ed with any established 
âleft-wingâ political ideology. 
4.2. The Academic Originators of PC 
Where did this ideology come from? My working hypothesis is that it is the product of cultural 
hybridization of several strains of both Anglo-American and Continental European academic thought 
throughout the last i ve decades. The spawning ground, originally in the departments of humanities 
and social sciences of Western universities, has shifted to the wider world, including the Third World 
(with some unfortunate results; see [55]). Of particular importance over the last decade, the cyberspace 
was critical in the shaping of social identities, speech norms and political activism from emerging 
subcultures of PC adherents. Disparate ideas with different genealogies have coalesced into a more or 
less coherent system by the continuous exchange between students and teachers, academic theorists 
and street activists, i ery partisans and resolute critics. 
Although we could trace the memetic ancestors of this ideology as far away in the past and as 
much detail as weâd want, I deliberately restrict my attention to four paradigms and some of their 
various overlaps over the latter half of the 20th century; these are social constructionism, critical theory, 
social liberalism, and postmodernism. 
An exhaustive historical and sociological analysis of the evolution of the memeplex I posit to be 
symbiotic with PC adherents is way beyond the reach of this work 11. And delineating the conceptual 
cartography of different intellectual traditions and how they intersect may appear to be an unyielding 
task.1 / 1ChatGPTChatGPTThis section examines the phenomenon of political correctness (PC) within contemporary academic philosophy. The author draws attention to a series of incidents reflecting the trend of PC, indicating a greater demand for social justice. These include:The rejection of a paper on moral consequences of scientific research in genetic anthropology by the journal Public Health Ethics due to its controversial content.A lecturer discontinuing a popular practical ethics course at the University of Texas due to student disruptions.The editors of the Stanford Encyclopedia Of Philosophy advocating for increased citation of minority scholars based on an assumption of gender discrimination.A request to the American Philosophical Association to remove the phrase "blind peer review" due to alleged discrimination against visually impaired people.The student union from the School of Oriental and Asian Studies of Buckingham University demanding the replacement of White philosophers in the syllabus with philosophers from the African and Asian continents.The author suggests that these incidents resonate with a common theme: a demand for social justice, earning their advocates the moniker "social justice warriors" (SJWs). However, the author points out that this conception of social justice extends beyond distributive justice and encompasses a broader worldview that cannot be readily associated with any established "left-wing" political ideology.The author hypothesizes that this ideology emerged from the hybridization of different strains of academic thought, both from Anglo-American and Continental European traditions, mainly in the humanities and social sciences. These ideas coalesced into a somewhat coherent system through constant exchange between students and teachers, academic theorists and street activists, and fervent partisans and resolute critics.Four key paradigms are identified as the main influencers of this ideology: social constructionism, critical theory, social liberalism, and postmodernism. However, the author acknowledges that providing a comprehensive historical and sociological analysis of the evolution of this ideology is beyond the scope of the current work.1 / 14.3. Formalizing the Worldview of Contemporary Social Justice Adherents 
It is time to make sense of some central ideas which I claim lie in the ideological core (Postulate 6) 
of the PC worldview. As described under my hypothesis of the origin of this ideology, the ideas 
I intend to formalize are conceptual hybrids, somewhere in between academic constructs with the 
intuitive repertoire of a layman. 
My approach here is that of a normative naÃ¯ve anthropologist; I intend to secure what a truthful 
and exact description of certain PC beliefs would look like assuming that their adherents are acting 
rationally (Postulate 7). When one confronts the discourse of an alien worldview, one of the most 
pervasive errors is to infer a lack of intelligence and rationality due to prejudicious background beliefs. 
As a matter of fact, there exists empirical evidence suggesting that âleft-wing" progressives are in 
average more intelligent than âright-wing" traditionalists [62]. However, I shall also leave open the 
hypothesis that PC discourse, particularly in its most postmodern verve, may be primarily rhetorical 
and not designed to be truth-apt [56]. 
I suggest that this exercise is fruitful because it will allow us to provide with a certain precision 
a necessary condition for the social justice of norms and policies and some suff i cient conditions for the 
political correctness (and incorrectness) of speech acts and constructs. 
Formalizations are processes of translation. When the axiomatic approach is applied to science 
proper, a same informal theory can be formalized in many different ways. Therefore, I do not claim that 
my formal correlates of these ideas are the only ones possibleâfar from it. My attempt at formalization 
will also, unfortunately, be severely incomplete; it will depend on many informal postulates referring 
to entities which will remain undef i ned. 
To be intimately acquainted with the PC worldview, a large number of concepts are candidates to 
i ll the ideological core. Iâll focus my attention on two themes I take to be central; the i rst one probably 
needs no introduction, and that is the idea of social oppression, with several of its neighboring theses. 
The other one, which I have named anthropological mental egalitarianism, is meant to captures some 
strong intuitions a PC adherent may have on the equality of human potential. 
Up to this point, there appears to be a bold inconsistency in the story Iâm advancing; how could the 
explicit theoretical knowledge outputted by academics evolve into pretheoretical tacit understanding 
(Postulate 3) and become theoretical content back again? 
We can resolve this apparent conf l ict in many distinct ways. First, under a dual-process theory 
of reasoning, habituation and training allow the migration of a task formerly subjected to conscious, 
willful supervision into an instinctive tacit skill [63]. From cognitive neuroscience, philosopher of 
biology Alex Rosenberg has argued that the difference between deliberative procedural knowledge 
and practical know-how is one of degree [64] (Chapter 8). 
Second, it is a commonplace phenomenon that many academic products reach public discourse 
in a âpasteurizedâ fashion that is incomplete or even distorting and uninformative. In the times 
of modern faculty psychology, a common-sensical causal explanation by literate Westerners for the 
capricious behavior of adolescents could employ âthe passionsâ as the explanans. As brain physiology 
advanced, the common-sensical explanans has been replaced with âthe hormonesâ. It is unclear if any 
nontrivial knowledge of biochemistry and endocrinology has successfully penetrated public thought 
during this shift of words. 
Third, terms may acquire entirely new meanings during this transition. âDeconstructâ is a verb 
repeatedly used by contemporary social justice partisans but it is unclear how much it really has to do 
with the term of art âdeconstructionâ originally described in Jacques Derridaâs On Grammatology. 
Fourth, adherents may not be truly apprehending the relevant theoretical content at all but may be 
merely uttering sentences as if by pure Pavlovian ref l ex. Consider the memes that are commonly used 
as defeaters to slander the science of differential psychology such as âIQ does not measure intelligenceâ, 
âIQ only measures one kind of intelligenceâ and âIQ tests are culturally biasedâ.It is doubtfulthat 
most who deploy these propositions have acquired suff i cient theoretical knowledge on tests such as 
Ravenâs Progressive Matrices, the theoretical entity known as the g factor and the state of the art of 
Philosophies 2017, 2, 1711 of 56 
psychometrical research methodology. First-rate academic critics of intelligence testing do not merely 
use crude memes; they employ technical arguments (for instance, see [65â67]). 
Finally, I am not claiming that anything resembling my formalized constructs is necessarily 
explicit in the minds of everyday PC adherents. I do claim, however, that they can be reasonably 
reconstructed out of several implicit beliefs. What I shall supply are artif i cial constructs, products of 
deliberate cognitive effort to make sense of the worldview of PC promoters under the assumption that 
they are behaving rationally.1 / 1ChatGPTChatGPTIn this section, the author aims to formalize central ideas within the PC (politically correct) worldview. The aim is to understand PC beliefs from a neutral standpoint, under the assumption that its adherents are behaving rationally. The author warns against the common error of assuming a lack of intelligence and rationality in those who hold differing views, pointing out empirical evidence that suggests "left-wing" progressives are on average more intelligent than "right-wing" traditionalists.However, the author does also consider that PC discourse, especially in its most postmodern forms, might be primarily rhetorical and not designed to be truth-apt. The author's formalization seeks to provide a necessary condition for the social justice of norms and policies, as well as sufficient conditions for the political correctness (and incorrectness) of speech acts and constructs.The formalization process is seen as a form of translation, and the author acknowledges that this translation can be done in many ways, and his interpretation is not the only possible one. The author focuses on two main themes of the PC worldview: social oppression and the concept he calls "anthropological mental egalitarianism" (the belief in the equality of human potential).The author also discusses the seeming inconsistency of how explicit theoretical knowledge from academics can evolve into tacit understanding, then re-emerge as theoretical content again. This could be explained in several ways, such as through the process of habituation and training (making explicit knowledge implicit), through the "pasteurization" of academic products as they enter public discourse, or through the acquisition of new meanings during the transition from explicit to tacit knowledge.The author stresses that his formalized constructs are artificial constructs, produced from a deliberate cognitive effort to make sense of the PC worldview, assuming that its adherents are behaving rationally.1 / 14.4. Modeling Social Kinds and Human Societies 
In the social ontology and epistemology advanced by the âSJWâ worldview, collectives reign 
supreme. Human societies are partitioned into several overlapping factions, each with their distinctive 
collective identities, allegiances, and interests. The default level of analysis of social phenomena is 
centered in the dynamics among whole social groups and not the particular individual human beings 
that constitute them. That is, the PC worldview denies the thesis of methodological individualism that 
guides certain social science paradigms, surmised as the dual claim that properties of individual 
human beings exhaust properties of human societies and that social explanations ought to refer to 
these properties of individual human beings [68]. 
What do social groups mean for the average PC adherent? I employ the following formal semantic 
analysis [69]; i rst, the extension of a term or phrase designating a particular social group (such as 
âthe bourgeoisieâ or âthe White raceâ) is a social kind, which is a set. I contrast âsocialâ with ânaturalâ 
kinds solely on etiology (if these categories emerge in ordinary social contexts) and practical relevance 
for social cognition. On the issue of the ontological objectivity of social kinds, the degree by which 
they are âsocially constructedâ via arbitrary human decision-making or if there are facts of the matter 
independentof humanintention, Iwillhave something tosayin thenextsubsectionover atPostulate12 
(for lively contemporary discussions on this matter, see [70,71]). 
Second, abstract entities employed for classif i catory purposes do not exhaust the meaning of 
these words. The referents of terms denoting particular social groups are taken to be real human 
superorganisms of sorts, aggregates of individual human beings that function as willful agents of their 
own and which are of fundamental explanatory relevance for social theory. The variables representing 
these terms are logically the subjects of predication and ontologically, the âconcreteâ systems are the 
bearers of properties. 
Social groups are then characterized according to their constitution and taxonomy. Over at 
the Appendix A.2, âAn Ontology Of Collectivesâ, I supply a formal description to represent, 
via an algebraicoperation of aggregation, how small units (labeled âatomic individualsâ) can compose 
larger systems. An aggregation of individual human beings is called a human population. We will 
consider a two-level nested hierarchy of social kinds that partition human populations: social genera 
and social species. For example, according to the Commission of Human Rights of New York City 12, 
the equivalence relation âis of the same gender asâ partitions the population of New York City into 
31 equivalence classes. These social species, in turn, may be assorted into one sole equivalence class 
through an equivalence relation specifying a superordinate property, which allegedly forms the social 
genus âgenderâ. 
Human populations can be monospecif i c or polyspecif i c. A human population is monospecif i c 
concerning a given social genus if and only its atomic individuals belong to the same social species, 
and it is polyspecif i c when it involves a mixture of social species. For instance, concerning the social 
genus âraceâ, the PC acronym âpeople of colorâ (âPoCâ) refers to a human population whose members 
belong to many different races, allegedly sharing nontrivial collective interests. Usually def i ned by 
the negative property of not being a Caucasian of European descent (âWhiteâ), the object picked 
12 https://www1.nyc.gov/assets/cchr/downloads/pdf/publications/GenderID_Card2015.pdf 
Philosophies 2017, 2, 1712 of 56 
up by the reference class âPoCâ can also be properly def i ned as the aggregation of all ânon-Whiteâ 
populations. We could also def i ne âpolygenericâ populations. The LGBT community, for instance, 
is polygeneric from the point of view of at least two equivalence classes designating social genera, 
those of sexual orientation, and gender identity. These constructs are elaborated in greater detail over 
the Appendix A.3, âA Social Taxonomy of Human Populationsâ. 
I postulate the following placeholder to minimally characterize a human society:1 / 1ChatGPTChatGPTIn this section, the author discusses the social ontology and epistemology that are prevalent in the "SJW" (Social Justice Warrior) worldview, where societies are partitioned into various overlapping groups, each with its distinctive identities, allegiances, and interests. This worldview focuses on the dynamics among whole social groups instead of individual human beings, thus denying the thesis of methodological individualism.The author explains that the term or phrase designating a specific social group, such as 'the bourgeoisie' or 'the White race,' is referred to as a social kind, and it is a set. Social kinds are contrasted with "natural" kinds based on etiology (if these categories emerge in ordinary social contexts) and practical relevance for social cognition. They are "socially constructed" via human decision-making and hold significant explanatory value in social theory.Social groups are then characterized according to their composition and taxonomy. The author provides a formal description to represent, via an algebraic operation of aggregation, how smaller units (termed 'atomic individuals') can compose larger systems, known as human populations. These populations are then divided into social genera and social species. The author also introduces the concept of monospecific and polyspecific human populations, depending on whether its atomic individuals belong to the same social species or a mixture of social species, respectively.The author uses examples such as the "people of color" and the LGBT community to illustrate these concepts. For instance, "people of color" refers to a human population whose members belong to many different races, sharing nontrivial collective interests. On the other hand, the LGBT community is polygeneric from the perspective of at least two equivalence classes designating social genera, those of sexual orientation, and gender identity.1 / 1Postulate 8(Human Society).A human societySis the largest human populationxliving under a shared 
set of recognized social institutions I which enforce a set of social norms N. 
Human societies are aggregations of all members of social kinds responding to the same set of 
social norms. This postulate is good enough for our purposes, congruent with legal, cultural, political 
and geographical aspects of human societies. 
4.5. Social Equality 
Social equality is one of the moral centerpieces of the ideology underlying PC. For the most 
salient aspect of the meaning of social equality in this ideology, I refer to the words of the social 
worker and social justice advocate Neil Thompson; âequality can be understood to mean an absence 
ofdiscriminationâ [72](p. 13). This ideal of equality includes the conception of equality known as 
equality of opportunity which Iâll take to include the thesis that different individuals with the same 
potentials in ability ought to have equal prospects for development and success in life. 
But in the SJW worldview, I claim that, although the absence of discrimination or oppression is 
necessary for social equality, it is not suff i cient. We also need another ideal of social equality, that of 
equality of outcome. More narrowly, this means that social groups in a particular society are equal if 
and only if each gets the same share of monetarily valuable resources. Under this conception, social 
equality just is a form of economic equality, def i ned by a central theoretical term from economics, 
wealth, taken to be the sum of monetarily valuable assets possessed by an economic agent in a i xed 
system of currency. 
This conf l ation of social with economic inequality may be disputed on several grounds within 
the very population of PC adherents. For instance, there is the claim that social equality chief l y 
requires the fair allocation of intangible goods that resist monetary appraisals, such as respect or 
dignity. In response, I argue that equality of outcome is rightfully in tune with PC intuition. First, 
consider the following mental experiment; imagine an inegalitarian society that after hundreds or 
thousands of years of systemic oppression, manages to institute equal opportunity for all overnight. 
If equal opportunity is all there is for social justice, there is no more work to be done in this society. 
However, prima facie, the social justice partisan would still i nd not only desirable but necessary to 
institute additional policies and norms designed to diminish alleged accrued âhead startsâ benef i ting 
the privileged groups 13. Such policies could include prototypical social justice policies such as 
redistribution of wealth through social welfare. Second, I mention the defense by feminist political 
philosopher Anne Phillips in which even when a society is primarily pursuing equality of opportunity, 
equality of outcome serves as a good proxy for that goal [74].Third, we havea pragmatic reason to 
pursue this account of social equality as economic equality since it can be def i ned with certain precision 
while the same cannot be said for other alleged intangible values which stand in more uncertain terrain 
to rigorously guide the ideals of social justice. 
Economic inequality is most frequently measured as the inequality of income, which is much 
more tractable empirically and can be used as a proxy variable for wealth. I assume that wealth 
inequality, although very diff i cult to calculate in practice, is the ideal âgold standardâ of economic 
13 Economist Christopher J. Ruhm has described a mathematical model of this exact situation [73]. 
Philosophies 2017, 2, 1713 of 56 
inequality(for a comprehensivetechnical exposition of the measurement of economic inequality in all 
its complexity, see [75]). We then have the following def i nition:

Readers may refer to Appendix A.4, âA Toy Model of Wealthâ, for a sketch of an idealized 
measurement-theoretical account of material wealth and economic property. 
What about the aspect of social equality characterized as the absence of discrimination? 
To investigate it, we i rst need to describe social oppression.1 / 1ChatGPTChatGPTIn this section, the author presents the concept of social equality from the perspective of the "SJW" (Social Justice Warrior) ideology. They mention that social equality can be understood as an absence of discrimination, as stated by social worker and social justice advocate Neil Thompson. This includes the concept of equality of opportunity, which suggests that individuals with the same abilities should have equal chances for development and success.However, the author suggests that in the SJW worldview, the absence of discrimination is necessary but not sufficient for social equality. They propose that another ideal, that of equality of outcome, is also needed. In this context, equality of outcome means that social groups in a society are equal if each gets the same share of monetarily valuable resources, conflating social equality with economic equality.This view may be disputed within the population of PC (politically correct) adherents, as some might argue that social equality primarily requires the fair distribution of intangible goods that resist monetary evaluations, such as respect or dignity. However, the author defends the concept of equality of outcome as in tune with PC intuition, citing a mental experiment and the views of feminist political philosopher Anne Phillips. They also argue that this concept of social equality is pragmatically useful because it can be defined with precision, unlike other intangible values.Economic inequality is most commonly measured as income inequality, which is empirically tractable and can be used as a proxy variable for wealth. The author then presents a definition for Inequality of Outcome and mentions a theoretical account of material wealth and economic property. They conclude the section by stating the need to explore the aspect of social equality characterized as the absence of discrimination by describing social oppression.1 / 14.6. Social Oppression Theory 
In the worldview of social justice, life in contemporary human societies is a hostile zero-sum 
game. If a certain social group enjoys material prosperity, it is because systemic unfair treatment 
is happening against at least another group. The key theoretical terms to consider are relations of 
social oppression. These are the intellectual heirs of the dyadic asymmetric relation of exploitation of 
labor described by Karl Marx between two populations of the social genus âsocial classâ, which he 
identif i ed with two species, the bourgeoisie and the proletariat [76]. Throughout the second half of the 
20th century up to this point in time, this relation has been steadily expanded by critical theorists and 
other normative sociologists into a large family of dyadic relations of social oppression inside social 
genera other than social class [77]. Here I attempt to describe what we may call Social Oppression 
Theory (SOT), which will be used to characterize social justice and PC with greater precision. 
I make seven axioms to characterize core tenets of the SOT. I supply a formal description of the 
set-theoretical model and logical formulae for these axioms in Appendix A.5, âSocial Oppression 
Theoryâ. For a given society S, we then have: 
Axiom 1.A relation of oppressionxOyis asymmetric (anti-symmetric and irref l exive). That is, ifxOy, it is 
not the case that yOx. 
Let us recall thatxandyrefer to whole human populations. We callxthe oppressor, dominant or 
privileged group and y the oppressed, subordinated or marginalized group. 
The irref l exivity of relations of oppression could be disputed. For instance, consider the reported 
phenomenon of âinternalized homophobiaâ in homosexual men from the mental health literature [78]. 
Couldnât this be a case of ref l exivity, the oppressed being their own oppressors? I submit that this is 
better explained in the PC worldview as being the workings of unjust social institutions enforced by 
an ideology named âHeteronormativityâ (Table 1) under which the fundamental causative agents of 
the oppression are homophobic heterosexuals and not homophobic homosexuals.

Axiom 2.There are as many relations of oppressionO1, ...,Oias there are social generaG1, ...,GipartitioningH. 
Axiom 3. If x oppresses y, then both x and y are of the same social genusG. 
A same individual human being can be the surrogate of multiple relations of oppression insofar 
as they are different types of oppression relations. This is the cornerstone of âintersectional theoryâ [86], 
which encourages an analysis of social oppression at the level of the multiple social identities housed 
by human beings, that can simultaneously enact the role of oppressor and oppressed in relation to the 
different social genera he i nds himself embedded in. 
Axiom 4. Take the relation of oppression O associated with a social genusG. 
â¢IfGhas 
two species, both the oppressorxand the oppressedyare the largest aggregates of 
members from their respective species, being monospecif i c populations. 
â¢IfGhas 
three or more species, the oppressorxis the largest aggregate of members of the social 
species, being a monospecif i c population. The oppressedyis the aggregate formed by the largest 
aggregates of each remaining social species, being a polyspecif i c population. 
The relata of relations of oppression are entire collectives. For instance, when a person suffers 
racism, this is to be interpreted as an attack on an entire marginalized racial community by the 
dominant racial group. Under the oppressive ideology of Aetonormativity (see Table 1), which takes 
adulthood to be normative, the aggregate formed by children and seniors suffers ageism from the 
aggregate of adults.

Axiom5.Ifxoppressesy, thenthereisinequalityofoutcomebetweenxandywhereyistheworseoffpopulation. 
As privilege theorist Bob Pease puts it, âit is only when we understand that social inequalities 
are human creations designed to benef i t a few that we can see the possibilities for challenging 
inequalityâ [87] (p. 14). In the PC worldview, social inequality is a result of certain social groups not 
acting fairly against other social groups. This notion can be interpreted as an expected consequence of 
a strong form of social constructionism which takes the etiology of social inequality to be the product 
of purely sociocultural factors. 
This axiom merges both accounts of social equality from the social justice worldview (absence of 
discrimination and equality of outcome) with social oppression. To see how, logically this axiom has 
the formpâq. By the rule of contraposition, we haveÂ¬qâ Â¬por to put it simply, if there is equality 
of outcome between x and y, there is no oppression between x and y. 
Axiom 6.If there is inequality of outcome betweenxandy, eitherxoppressesyor there exists at least onex0 
that is oppressing another y0whose set intersects with the set of y. 
This reasoning is due to the intersectionality of social genera. For instance, consider the population 
comprised by Kenyans living in English society. Were the oppressive relation of xenophobia between 
the English and Kenyans eliminated, this would not imply that both groups are now economic equals 
for Kenyans are disproportionally not of the same racial group of the English and thus can also be 
subjected to the oppressive relation of racism by White Englishmen. 
Axiom 7.Take the inverse relation of the relation of oppressionxOy, the relation ây is oppressed by xâ. 
The inverse of this relation is the privilege relation xPy. 
Here is my attempt to elucidate the formal structure and some of the semantic content of the 
pervasive but obscure notion of âprivilegeâ. Privilege is a posited theoretical term that refers to 
Philosophies 2017, 2, 1715 of 56 
a nonobservable property (in this case, a 2-place relation) of oppressive human populations of a certain 
social kind. 
Thisreadingismotivatedbyacommontropeemployedbyprivilegetheorists. Forinstance,BobPease 
takes privilege to be the âflipside of discriminationâ; whoever oppresses is privileged [87] (p. 4). Similar 
metaphors involving the sides of coins are employed by other theorists over the literature [88,89]. 
Isnât the inverse of the inverse ofxOysimplyxOy? For the sake of charitableness, we have the 
following traditional resource from the analytic philosophy of language at hand; relations of oppression 
xOyand privilegexPyare co-extensive (they have the same set as extension) and co-referential 
(both refer to the same system of social institutions). However, oppression and privilege vary in their 
intensions, that is, they are different âmodes of presentationâ for the same phenomenon. 
For instance, imagine a primeval egalitarian society with two monospecif i c populationsxand 
yof the same genus, each collectively possessing a wealth evaluated at 1000 electrum. Thenx 
consolidates power and starts oppressingyby instituting unjust taxes and reaps some of the wealth of 
y. After some time,xpossesses a collective wealth of 1500 electrum andy, 500 electrum, becoming 
social unequals. The system of tributes has two âfacesâ;xis advantaged by it andyis disadvantaged 
by it. The enrichment of 500 electrum byxin tributes fromyco-occurs with the impoverishment ofy 
of the very same 500 electrum.1 / 1ChatGPTChatGPTIn this section, the author delves into the theory of social oppression. According to this perspective, society is seen as a zero-sum game where the prosperity of one group is due to the systemic unfair treatment of another group. This view builds upon Marx's theory of exploitation between social classes but has been expanded to encompass other social dimensions, which is captured in what the author refers to as Social Oppression Theory (SOT).The author establishes seven axioms to describe the core tenets of SOT, with formal descriptions provided in an appendix. These axioms are:Oppression is asymmetric; if group x oppresses group y, it is not the case that y oppresses x.There are as many relations of oppression as there are social genera.If x oppresses y, then both x and y are of the same social genus.The relata of oppression relations are entire collectives. For instance, an individual suffering from racism is considered an attack on their entire racial community.If x oppresses y, then there is inequality of outcome between x and y where y is the worse off population.If there is inequality of outcome between x and y, either x oppresses y or there exists at least one x' that is oppressing another y' whose set intersects with the set of y.The inverse of the oppression relation is the privilege relation.The author further discusses intersectionality, a cornerstone of SOT, which allows for the recognition of individuals as part of multiple relations of oppression. They also highlight the role of privilege, seen as the inverse of oppression, within this framework. The view is that privilege is a non-observable property of oppressive social groups, referring to their advantaged status. The author concludes by illustrating these principles with a hypothetical scenario in an egalitarian society that transitions into an oppressive one.1 / 1Postulate 9(Oppression-Action-Ideology Parity).Each relation of oppressionOtypif i es a class of immoral 
actsZand an oppressive ideologyIwhich enforces unjust social institutions and norms realized throughZthat 
are responsible for social inequality. 
Table 1 summarizes eight different types of social oppression posited by PC normative sociologists 
as being prevalent in Western societies (this selection is not exhaustive; for other examples, see [87] 
(p. 13)). To say that the literature dedicated to exposing of these forms of social oppression is enormous 
would be an understatement. The general sentiment one may apprehend by the content exposed 
by contemporary normative sociologists working under critical theory and its various offshoots is 
that Western nations are terrible places for minorities to live, being social battlegrounds i lled with 
multiplicities of invisible violence. 
For four of these relations of oppression, those of racism, xenophobia, ableism and ageism, 
the oppressed populations are polyspecif i c. One of the oppressive groups appears to be polyspecif i c 
too, violating Axiom 3, the group of âable peopleâ. This uneasiness can be i xed by replacing the 
genus of âabilityâ with several smaller genera (such as âvisual abilityâ, âauditory abilityâ, âmotor 
abilityâ, etc.). 
Some forms of prototypical social oppression also appear to violate this schema. For instance, 
consider anti-Semitism and Islamophobia as forms of oppression directed, respectively, against Jews 
and Muslims. Both seem to conf l ate discrimination on race, ethnicity, nationality, and religion. They can 
i t the schema by being segregated into racism, xenophobia and religious bigotry 14. 
It appears that the ideology promoting âfat shamingâ has not been named; following the 
etymological pattern, I suggest calling it âLeptonormativity.â 
These axioms allow us to ground additional famous theses of the SJW worldview. For example, 
take a staple of âSJWâ discourse, the denial of the existence of acts of âreverse discriminationâ, such as 
so-called âreverse racismâ 15, racism perpetrated against a racial group taken to be socially dominant: 
14 The existence of an ideology of âChristian normativityâ present in Western societies under which that which is non-Christian 
is devalued by default has already been proposed [90]. 
15 See for example the following bold article, which neatly summarizes common arguments for the inexistence of reverse 
racism http://www.dailydot.com/via/reverse-racism-doesnt-exist/. 
Philosophies 2017, 2, 1716 of 56 
Theorem 1(Impossibility of Reverse Racism).For a societySand two populationsxandyinsideS, ifx 
is racist towards y, y cannot be racist towards x. 
A favorite argument by PC proponents for the non-existence of racism against White people 
living in Western societies (but not, presumably, against White people living in Zimbabwe) involves 
defending the claim that the very concept is incoherent. This can be done for instance by redef i ning 
the concept of racism, like critical race theorists have summarized with the famous pseudo equation 
âracism=prejudice+powerâ [91]. But under the framework Iâm describing, the logical impossibility 
of âreverse racismâ is a simple result. If being racist involves enacting the relation of oppression 
associated with the genus of race and relations of oppression are asymmetric (Axiom 1), then only 
dominant racial collectives can be racist. The same can be generalized for other social genera (such as 
the non-existence of âheterophobiaâ in âheteronormativeâ societies). 
We can now state what I hold to be a necessary condition for certain policy or action to merit the 
stamp of social justice: 
Postulate 10(Necessary Condition for Social Justice).For two economically unequal human populations 
xandybelonging to a same social genusGunder 
a relation of oppressionxOy, an actionaat a timet0is 
socially just only ifawould cause the decrease of the inequality of outcome betweenxandyat a future timet+. 
We could also call such actions socially progressive. This condition is not suff i cient because arguably, 
not every kind of redistribution of wealth would be legitimate (for instance, by an overt theft of assets).1 / 1ChatGPTChatGPTIn this section, the author postulates that each relation of oppression is linked to a class of immoral acts and an oppressive ideology that enforces unjust social norms and institutions. The author refers to eight types of social oppression prevalent in Western societies, as outlined in a table not shown here, but likely including forms like racism, sexism, and ableism.The author discusses the complexity of defining social oppression, noting instances where the oppressed populations or the oppressor groups might not neatly fit into the presented framework. For example, discrimination based on ability might need to be broken down into more specific categories like "visual ability" or "motor ability."The author then suggests a term for the unnamed ideology behind "fat shaming," which they propose to call 'Leptonormativity.' The author also addresses "reverse discrimination," arguing that under the framework presented, reverse racism or heterophobia, for example, are logically impossible due to the asymmetry of oppression relations.Lastly, the author introduces a postulate as a necessary condition for social justice. An action is considered socially just if it results in the reduction of outcome inequality between two economically unequal human populations of the same social genus under a relation of oppression. However, the author notes this condition is not sufficient, as not all methods of redistribution might be seen as legitimate, like overt theft.1 / 14.7. Generalized Difference Principle 
The articulation of what came to be known as the theory of justice as fairness by political 
philosopher John Rawls [92,93] stands as one of the main intellectual milestones of the tradition 
of social liberalism. What is famously known as the difference principle [94] ( pp. 5â6) can be interpreted 
asaheuristicforresourceallocationinasocietywhichpermitssocialinequalitiesinsofartheyabsolutely 
benef i t those that are worse-off economically. 
I posit an expansion inspired by this principle 16 as an ethical heuristic to evaluate not simply 
actions at the level of policy and legislation but everyday verbal social interaction which may neatly 
capture an essential part of what is meant when it is claimed that a particular statement is not PC. I call 
it the âGeneralized Difference Principleâ (GDP). 
This proposal is motivated by the following; i rst, in the PC worldview, verbal behavior is taken 
to be supremely causally eff i cient at perpetuating social inequality. Verbal discrimination, even when 
extremely subtle (what came to be identif i ed as âmicroaggressionsâ by critical race theorists) may 
allegedly cause enormous economic damage (see, for instance, [96]). There also appears to be a strong 
conf l ation of facts and values in the PC worldview, for factual statements are often perceived to be 
immoral in various ways (such as âracistâ or âhomophobicâ). Given this, I tentatively describe: 
Postulate 11(Generalized Difference Principle).Consider a human societyS, two socially unequal human 
populationsxandyrespectively from the speciesS1andS2belonging to the same genusGand a comparative 
factual statementpinvolving a deprecation ofyin comparison toxwith respect to a certain attributeM. Ifpis 
a statement on the propensity of M in the speciesS2, then: 
â¢If 
x is oppressed by y, then an assertion of p is morally acceptable 
â¢Ifyis 
oppressed byx, then an assertion ofpexemplif i es an action in the class of immoral actsZ 
associated withG, 
being therefore socially oppressive 
16 This was chief l y inspired by Neven SesardiÂ´ câs similar use of the difference principle [95]. ( p. 224) 
Philosophies 2017, 2, 1717 of 56 
â¢Ifyis 
oppressed byxandpis not asserted but there exists signif i cant risk ofpbeing interpreted as 
an assertion, thenpalso exemplif i es an action of the class of immoral actsZassociated withG, 
being therefore socially oppressive 
For instance, consider a neuropsychological investigation of the relationship between verbal 
l uency and sexual orientation [97] which documented that homosexual men display on average 
better aptitude in different verbal l uency-related tasks (such as the generation of as many words 
as possible for a given category and the generation of as many synonyms as possible for a given 
word) and that homosexual women fare on average worse than heterosexual women on the same 
tasks.Since homosexuals are posited to be oppressed by heterosexuals under the ideology of 
Heteronormativity (Postulate 15, Table 1), it follows that this factual statement on the inequality 
of verbal aptitude among these aggregates partitioned under the genus of sexual orientation is not 
socially oppressive. For converse reasons, reporting the empirical result on homosexual women can be 
classif i ed as homophobic. 
Finally, I posit that not all oppression is morally equivalent; in the PC worldview, there are forms 
of oppression that are more immoral than others. I represent this with the following postulate: 
Postulate 12(Hierarchy of Oppression).For a given societySwithnsocial genera where there exist 
relations of oppression, there exists an asymmetric binary relation of moral severityâ«which takes relations of 
oppression O as relata, forming a set{OiâIâ«...â«OjâI}, 
I= (1,...,n). 
What def i nes the ordering? The degree of impoverishment/enrichment could be a possible 
indicator. I leave it open for the SJW theorists to decide. 
To see how this may be important, consider the following; Western feminist activists are avowed 
at i ghting the sexist institutions which allegedly perpetuate a ârape cultureâ that is deeply ingrained 
in the societies they live in and which allegedly have an origin in conservative mores [98]. Feminists, 
however, have been criticized as a group by conservative social commentators for being senselessly 
silent on the topic of sexual violence perpetrated by Muslims [99,100]. 
Let us assume that the accusation of disproportionate silence is true. Is it irrational? I submit 
that far from being irrational, it is a sophisticated example of identity-protection cognition meant 
to preserve the narrative script of SOT. The reasoning behind a feminist activist being vocal against 
sexual crimes committed by White heterosexual men in Patriarchal White Supremacist societies is 
straightforward; if the goal is to achieve an egalitarian society through social justice and if such 
denunciations are effective means to cause a diffusion of power from the dominant social species to 
the oppressed social species, resulting in the decrease of social inequality, then such denunciations are 
prima facie instrumentally rational.

The same, however, does not necessarily apply to being vocal against sexual crimes committed by 
Muslims both inside and outside Western societies. If the vocal imputation of moral responsibility for 
sexual crimes on Muslims carries signif i cant risk at being seen as âracistâ or âxenophobicâ (Postulate 9) 
and racism and xenophobia are ranked as having higher moral severity than sexism in the Hierarchy 
Of Oppression, then to abstain from denouncing Muslim sexual violence is expressively rational, for 
the sexism inf l icted by Muslims becomes a lesser evil compared to the racism and xenophobia the 
activist could inf l ict. A feminist that denounces Muslim sexual violence will also be at the risk of being 
ostracized from her in-group of which she may have already invested signif i cant emotional and social 
resources. 
4.8. PC and Natural Human Equality 
At i rst glance, it is diff i cult to see how the cosmopolitan developed world could harbor many 
anthropological physical egalitarians, those who believe that humans do not vary in signif i cant ways 
with regard to physical attributes due to differences in natural endowments. Every four years in the 
Olympic Games, thousands of elite athletes show before our own very eyes the prima facie case of how 
Philosophies 2017, 2, 1718 of 56 
physical abilities, partially underpinned by group differences in the muscular, skeletal, endocrine 17 
and respiratory systems, are not distributed equitably with respect to the partitions inside the social 
genera of race, sex and age. This conclusion is suggested by empirical evidence (see [101] for an 
overview mostly focused on racial differences in athleticism). More; even with access to the best 
technology and infrastructure, not anyone can reach the elite level of an Olympic athlete in an arbitrary 
sport. The potential for athletic achievement is similarly not equitably distributed; it is ultimately 
constrained by genetic factors [102,103]. 
Iâll explore here a central belief of the PC worldview and supply a charitable formal representation 
of its content.I call this belief anthropological mental egalitarianism (AME). AME encircles more 
specif i cally the denial of the existence of signif i cant mental differences in between socially oppressed 
groups and their respective groups of oppressors of a same social genus, differences which are partially 
underpinned by differences in their nervous systems mediated by genetic factors. For reasons of 
charitableness, I restrict âsignif i cant differencesâ to mean signif i cant differences in potential. What is at 
stake are not the actual mental abilities and competencies of members of socially oppressed groups 
(which may form considerable âgapsâ in comparison to their respective oppressive groups) but what 
they could be were the relevant socially oppressive ideologies removed through the implementation of 
socially progressive policies and norms. 
This contextualization with socially oppressed groups is important. According to the GDP as 
stated (Postulate 10), that there exists room for a PC partisan to tolerate ânaturalâ inequality among 
groups when it is the case that it is currently benef i ting the worse off socioeconomically. However, 
even this is risky and may undermine the entire PC worldview by sheer force of external consistency. 
I explain at greater length in Section 6.2 that from the point of view of the standards that guide 
scientif i c research, it is irrational to consider that natural talents are consistently distributed only to the 
populations of the socially oppressed. It is also inconsistent with the very tenet of the PC worldview 
that takes economic inequality to be a social construction. For natural talents presumably naturally lead 
to a differentiated acquisition of resources. 
I argue that some version of AME stands one of the core beliefs of the PC worldview and that its 
denial is arguably the supreme intellectual taboo in the âf i rst worldâ. For a famous example, in 2005, 
Lawrence Summers, then the president of Harvard University, suffered considerable public backlash 
for stating the empirically adequate hypothesis that women are more underrepresented than men at 
top academic positions in science and technology partly because the normal distributions of mental 
abilities (âaptitudeâ, in his words 18) in women, in comparison to men, had lower variabilityâmeaning 
that men are more typical in the extremes of the human cognitive spectrum. Since Summers uttered 
these statements, the hypothesis for the greater phenotypical variability of men has accrued even more 
evidence [104] and may constitute a difference between the sexes of fundamental importance. For this 
remark, Summers was denounced as âsexistâ, and it is speculated that this may have contributed to 
both his resignation as president of Harvard University and even to have cost him a top position in the 
Obama Administration 19. 
What I informally refer to as the âmentalâ involves both general and specif i c features of human 
beings posited by psychologists and encompassed in the categories of cognition, affect and behavior. 
It includes a multitude of traits such as negative affectivity and general intelligence, social intelligence 
and social anxiety, aggressiveness and creativity and delayed gratif i cation and openness to experience.1 / 1ChatGPTChatGPTThe section you've presented seems to be a detailed exploration of the concept of "political correctness" (PC) from a sociological and philosophical perspective. It's complex, dealing with various layers of social dynamics, but I'll try to summarize the main points:Generalized Difference Principle (GDP): The author proposes the GDP as a moral guideline for evaluating not only policy-level actions but also everyday verbal social interactions. In this perspective, making a statement that deprecates an oppressed group is considered morally unacceptable and socially oppressive, even if it's a factual statement. The GDP is also applicable to scenarios where there's a significant risk of a statement being interpreted as an assertion against the oppressed group.Hierarchy of Oppression: The author suggests that in the PC worldview, not all forms of oppression are morally equivalent. Some forms of oppression are seen as more immoral than others, potentially depending on the degree of harm they inflict.Rationality of Silence on Certain Issues: A hypothetical scenario is presented where feminist activists might choose to not vocalize concerns about sexual violence perpetrated by Muslims. This could be because racism and xenophobia are considered higher on the "Hierarchy of Oppression" than sexism, making the criticism of a minority group a potentially greater moral transgression than addressing the issue of sexual violence.Anthropological Mental Egalitarianism (AME): This is defined as a core belief in the PC worldview, denying the existence of significant mental differences between socially oppressed groups and their oppressors. The differences discussed aren't about actual mental abilities, but about what they could be if the socially oppressive ideologies were removed.Importance of Maintaining AME: The author argues that questioning AME is highly taboo, potentially causing serious consequences, as illustrated with the example of Lawrence Summers, former president of Harvard University. His suggestion of natural differences in cognitive variability between men and women led to significant backlash and possible career implications.Inclusion of Mental Attributes: The author indicates that the "mental" aspects being considered include both general and specific cognitive, affective, and behavioral traits, covering a wide range of human characteristics.It's important to note that these are complex, debatable ideas and the summary is based on the author's interpretation of the topic, as presented in the text.1 / 1I assume, under a principle of ontological conservativeness, that all of them have at least an ordinal 
structure, being representable through comparative structures (see the Appendix A.1 for the def i nition 
of a comparative structure). From a measurement-theoretic point of view, what arguably is the 
most studied psychological attributeâgeneral intelligenceâis commonly assumed to have a richer 
structure, judging by the kinds of statistical procedures used to manipulate and interpret data on 
intelligence testing (such as standard deviations and the averaging of data sets). This conclusion has 
been disputed 20. The various ways the information about a given attribute represented on a scale 
of real numbers (such as having one or two semantic poles or affective valences) are psychologically 
interpreted will also not undermine the argument if we make some adjustments (see the discussion 
below Postulate 15). 
To give more clarity to what is meant by âpotentialâ and the relationship between biology and 
social genera, I shall elaborate two additional postulates centered on the issues of the social construction 
of social kinds and the environmental etiology of the psychological phenotype. 
4.9. Social Constructionism and Mental Environmentalism 
A comprehensive analysis that would make justice of the concept of âsocial constructionâ is far 
beyond the reach of this work. The theses associated with social constructionism can be phrased under 
variable strengths. Leaning towards social constructionism is not considered much controversial for 
genera such as religious aff i liation and social class 21. The scientif i c and philosophical controversy 
is initiated when there exists signif i cant academic dispute that the genera under question (such as 
race and sex) are examples of what philosophers of science and metaphysicians call natural kinds. 
Full-blown social construction of identity could involve, for instance, the claim that the categories of 
sex and gender are picked up by properties which are free-f l oating from karyotype and anatomical 
dimorphism and that racial categories are not correlated with genomic substructures. There would be 
no objective fact of the matter at assigning an individual x into a speciesSof a genusG. 
Empirically sounder forms of social constructionism are more moderate. For instance, philosophers 
of cognitive science Edouard Machery and Luc Faucher [107] explain the prevalence of racial categories 
in human cognition as a byproduct of both biological and cultural evolution involving the tracking 
of real phenotypically salient traits of human populations whose clusters are otherwise taken to be 
âbiologically meaninglessâ. 
I supply the following provisional necessary condition of social construction inspired by 
a computational account of objectivity: 
Postulate 13(Necessary Condition for the Social Construction of Social Kinds).For a given social 
genusGpartitioned 
into speciesS1,...,Sn, 
we say thatGis 
socially constructed only if there exists no 
nontrivial clustering algorithmTwhich takes as input a raw data setDexhibiting information about the set 
of individual human beingsHwhich outputs clustersS10,...,Sn0that 
approximate the equivalence classes 
S1,...,S1. 
The key term here is raw; the data set must be suitably unprocessed, devoid of idiosyncratic human 
manipulation. For instance, some have argued that the the social genus âsexââpartitioned into 
the equivalence classes âmaleâ and âfemaleââis socially constructed predicated on the phenomena 
of intersexuality, involving individuals with a myriad of chromosomal, developmental and 
anatomical variations which statistically diverge from the typical phenotypes formed under the 
20 See [105] for a formal philosophical criticism of the prospect of quantitative psychology. Measurement theorist Fred 
Roberts [106] ( p. 64) follows a convention from the literature in which raw intelligence scores are ordinal-scalable but 
standard intelligence scores are interval-scalable. 
21 But even this may be disputed for the empirical generalization known as the âf i rst law of behavioral geneticsâ [108] state 
that there exists no human behavioral trait with zero heritability. 
Philosophies 2017, 2, 1720 of 56 
XY sex-determination system of the human species [109]. However, even under high estimates for 
the prevalence of intersexuality (i.e., [110]), 98% of the members of an arbitrary human population 
x1will be clustered into the equivalence classes âmaleâ and âfemaleâ. For a âsocial constructionâ, 
the male-female binary appears to be doing a very lousy job at not carving nature at its joints. 
One must be cautious in the inference from statistical atypicality to social construction not to incur 
in a nonsequitur. For instance, in the case of intersexuality caused by major genomic structural variation, 
a mechanical expert system informed of the number of autosomes and allosomes (the non-sexual and 
sexual chromosomes, respectively) of individual humans would have no problem objectively sorting 
the populations into the equivalence classes generated by the equivalence relation âis of the same 
karyotype asâ. 
Another important thesis of the PC worldview associated with social constructionism captures 
similar anxieties with the scientif i c understanding of the biological dimension of humanity and 
expresses the attitude of divorcing biology from behavior and mind. I thus present: 
Postulate 14(Mental Environmentalism).For a given mental attributeMwhich is not invariant across 
the population of all human beingsH, the causal contribution that explains the variation ofMthroughoutH 
that is attributable to genetics is insignif i cant.

1 / 1ChatGPTChatGPTThe given passage delves into some complex concepts in the realm of psychology, sociology, and philosophy. It starts by discussing the representation of psychological attributes, such as intelligence, and continues to discuss two key postulates pertaining to social constructionism and mental environmentalism.Social constructionism is a theory that suggests our understanding of the world and our identities are constructed by societal norms. This could range from the creation and enforcement of social roles and categories to the formulation of certain beliefs and attitudes within a given society. The passage notes that while it is uncontroversial to apply this concept to areas such as religious affiliation and social class, it becomes contentious when applied to categories like race and sex, traditionally considered "natural kinds."Postulate 13 introduces a necessary condition for the social construction of social kinds. It posits that a social kind is only socially constructed if there is no clustering algorithm that can recreate the categories or species within that kind using raw data. This means that any apparent structure in such a genus is created by societal norms and interpretations rather than inherent differences among individuals.The text then mentions the concept of intersexuality, which refers to individuals who exhibit chromosomal, developmental, and anatomical variations that don't fit into the traditional categories of male or female. It highlights that even if we consider high estimates of intersexuality prevalence, the majority of individuals would still fall into the male and female categories, thus questioning the degree of "social construction" in the male-female binary.Mental environmentalism, introduced in Postulate 14, states that for any mental attribute that varies across the human population, the causal contribution of genetics to this variation is insignificant. This theory implies that environment, rather than genetics, plays a more significant role in shaping mental attributes. This challenges the traditional viewpoint that both nature (genetics) and nurture (environment) significantly contribute to mental and psychological development.Overall, these concepts and postulates dive into the debate over nature vs. nurture and how societal norms and constructions influence our understanding and categorization of individuals. It underscores the complexities involved in attributing causality and structure to psychological, sociological, and biological phenomena.1 / 1Why, of all biological factors, should genetics be privileged? This emphasis is a consequence of 
the science of behavioral genetics which has developed the important (and controversial) measures of 
heritability 22 to estimate the relative causal importance of genetics in the explanation the phenotypical 
variation of a given phenotypical trait in a selected population. What makes genetics special is in 
some sense contingent; perhaps in the near future, advanced gene therapy will be able to transform 
the deepest part of our biology into environmental factors just like education and nutrition. But for 
now, I hold, following the arguments by philosopher of biology Neven SesardiÂ´ c [95] (Chapter 5), 
that heritability entails non-modif i ability or non-malleability. That is; the more the causal contribution of 
the variation in a given trait is ascribed to genetic factors, the harder it is to reshape it for it implies 
that there is less that is under existing practical human control. 
The conjunction of the latter postulates can inspire a new axiom that is the converse of Axiom 5 
from SOT, that is, the implication from inequality of outcome to social oppression. For if no social 
kinds are objective natural kinds, then their very partitioning is under human control, being a cognitive 
process that is a part of the social environment. And if there are no genetic contributions to the very 
phenotypical traits required for economic prosperity, then their full range also stands in the realm of 
social engineering. Natural environmental factors, such as droughts and disease, may be responsible 
for inequality of outcome but those factors are in the realm of modif i ability (for instance, through 
irrigation and medicine). Therefore, from the lenses of the PC worldview, if we observe human 
economic inequality, this gives credence to the hypothesis that oppressive institutions are at work. 
A more formal description of AME can be found in Appendix A.6.I will assume that 
the measurement processes being represented here are temporally indexed to the present time. 
As individual psychology changes over a lifetime, the ascribed numerical values of a given mental 
22 The concept of heritability has been subjected to intense scrutiny by scientists and philosophers of science. For a recent 
novel criticism, contemporary geneticists have been struggling with the so-called âmissing heritability problemâ (often 
in the context of heritability in the narrow sense; see [95] (p. 21); for several given phenotypical traits measured as having 
a high heritability, the associated genetic variants which have been traced via genetic sequencing appear to explain very 
little of the total predicted heritability. Some scientists [111] have proposed transgenerational epigenetic inheritance to 
account for the missing heritability; this account is more consonant with PC for the causes of epigenetic factors may exist 
inside the range of environmental modif i ability. However, alternative explanations which secure the notion of heritability in 
genetic factors exist. For instance, a team of statistical geneticists [112] has argued that the âmissing heritabilityâ problem 
emerges under the assumption that the contribution of a conjunction of expressed genetic variants can be modeled as a 
linear (âadditiveâ) combination. When the interactions among genetic variants are modeled as nonlinear, the problem may 
signif i cantly dissolve. 
Philosophies 2017, 2, 1721 of 56 
trait may l uctuate. For instance, there is cross-cultural evidence which suggests that people tend to 
become more introverted as they age [113]. 
Axiom 8.For a given mental attributeM, a i xed representation standard forMand any individual human 
being x, there exists a monotonic increasing function Ï(x)that uniquely assigns a numerical value n to x. 
This axiom just is a statement on the possibility of psychological measurement. Representational 
standards are particular units used to codify the empirical information of measurable attributes 
using numbers. 
Axiom 9.There exists a numerical valueÏrepresenting the maximum potential ofxatM. The valuenis 
either lesser or equal to Ï. 
Postulate 15.For any given timet, a given mental attributeM, a i xed representation standard forMand any 
individual human being x, Ï is the global maximum point of the monotonic increasing function Ï(x). 
Through the conjunction of Axiom 10 and Postulate 14, we can state the modal claim that 
the mental attributes of human beings, besides their actual realizations (captured by Axiom 9) also 
have maximum manifestations. Discussions on lower and upper bounds of mental features are not 
unknown. For instance, the case of sensations, encompassed by psychophysical variables such as 
âbrightnessâ and âloudnessâ is straightforward; the components of our sensory systems bear a lower 
threshold that allows the minimum interaction with some type of energy and an upper threshold 
which may represent either nondescript registration or nerve damage. What about traits such as 
general intelligence? The philosophical literature on âsuperintelligenceâ appears to be committed to 
a supremum for the intelligence, broadly considered, of humans [114]. 
Postulate 16. The value of Ï is heavily dependent on genetic factors 
Following the preceding developments, the etiology of this ceiling is stipulated to be 
fundamentally genetic in origin.

Postulate 17. Only the maxima of mental attributes are relevant for social justice 
Potentials are prima facie closed intervals with both maxima and minima. I assume that only the 
former are relevant for our discussion. If this postulate holds true, certain adjustments are warranted. 
For instance, take the âBig Fiveâ model of personality which posits introversion-extraversion as 
a continuum with two psychologically distinct poles. For traits with this kind of structure, it is better 
in our framework to divide them in two given the possibility that both valences could be positively 
correlated with economic aff l uence 23. 
Axiom 10.For any two individual human beingsxandywith their upper bounds forMrespectively evaluated 
asÏxandÏy, there exists a function of comparative signif i canceÎ¹that takesÏxandÏyas inputs and 
outputs â1â when the disparity is signif i cant and â0â when it is not 
23 For this particular example, current empirical evidence suggests that this is not the case; extraversion has signif i cant positive 
correlation with income, new promotions and negatively correlated with unemployment [115,116]. It appears to be unlikely 
that the other tail of this continuum sports a signif i cant violation of this monotonicity. 
Philosophies 2017, 2, 1722 of 56 
It is hard to deny the reality of individual differences in mental potential. I suspect that most of 
those who are sympathetic to the PC worldview acknowledge it 24. For the sake of charitableness, 
I advance that even if it is the case that statistical innate group differences exist, they may not matter. 
And how could they matter? From the point of view of social justice, it is sound that differences in 
psychology are signif i cant if they are causally connected with increases in wealth (Section 4.5). But by 
how much? Consider the example of general intelligence. According to factor-analytical results of [117] 
employing a North American data set, a one point increase in IQ is associated with an increase of up 
to $616 of income a year 25. Is a change in one IQ point signif i cant enough? Iâll leave the specif i cation 
of such discontinuous function for the partisans of social justice. 
Axiom 11.For a given mental attributeM, a i xed representation standard forMand any two individual 
human beingsxandywherexandyare members of two distinct speciesS1andS2from 
a same social genusG, 
xandyhave their upper bounds forMrespectively evaluated asÏxandÏy, if we randomly âpickâxandy 
fromS1andS2, 
then the probability that the functionÎ¹(Ïx,Ïy)will output â0â (not a signif i cant difference in 
potential) is greater than 50%. 
This axiom is a weak denial of the existence of natural group differences. It states that typically, 
the differences in the natural endowments of members from different groups are not socioeconomically 
signif i cant. This increase in charitableness, however, comes at the expense of external consistency 
with SOT, which demands stronger social constructionism. Axiom 6 states that there can only be 
inequality of outcome between two groupsxandyin the presence of social oppression. But under 
Anthropological Mental Egalitarianism, there can be small group differences of wealth whose 
etiology is traceable to group genetic differences in psychological aptitudes. One way to make 
both theories consistent with each other could involve replacing standard equivalence relations â=â 
for approximation relations âââ.

Denials of AME that are un-PC are already pre-specif i ed by the GDP. The existence of a necessary 
connection between PC and the social construction of genera may be disputed. In defense, I view these 
propositions as forming a network (Postulate 6) with a certain stability. The placement of the fourth 
condition was partly motivated by the hypothesis that the acceptance that there are social genera Philosophies 2017, 2, 1723 of 56 
which are natural kinds may initiate a runaway effect that may eventually prompt the denial of mental 
environmentalism and then, full-blown thoughts and utterances that violate the GDP.1 / 1ChatGPTChatGPTIt seems like you're exploring the complex interplay between genetics, psychology, and socioeconomics, particularly in the context of social justice. I see that you are drawing on concepts from behavioral genetics, philosophy of biology, psychology, and other areas. The document also suggests a somewhat controversial perspective, with notions like "Anthropological Mental Egalitarianism" and "Strong Ontological Theories" that seem to grapple with complex questions about the nature of human diversity, social hierarchies, and the role of genetic factors in determining individual and group outcomes.To break down a few of the concepts mentioned:Heritability is a measure used in genetics to estimate the proportion of observed variation in a particular trait (such as height, intelligence, etc.) that can be attributed to inherited genetic factors.This document suggests that heritability entails non-modifiability or non-malleability, which means that traits with a high genetic contribution are less susceptible to modification by environmental factors.It also introduces the concept of "Anthropological Mental Egalitarianism", which seems to posit that there are no significant, socioeconomically meaningful genetic differences between groups of people when it comes to their mental attributes or potential.A lot of emphasis is put on the relevance of genetic factors in determining the maximum potential (denoted as Ï) of an individual's mental attributes.The text also seems to wrestle with the moral implications of these ideas, suggesting that certain understandings of genetics and human potential might be considered "politically incorrect" if they conflict with certain ethical or political ideals, like the ideal of equality of outcome.It's important to remember, however, that while genetics plays a significant role in shaping our physical and mental traits, it's not the only factor. Other variables, such as environment, upbringing, and education, can also significantly influence our traits and capabilities. Furthermore, genetic determinism (the idea that our genes solely determine our traits and behavior) is largely rejected by the scientific community, as it oversimplifies the complex interplay of genetics and environment in shaping human beings.Finally, in social and political contexts, it's important to avoid misusing or misinterpreting genetic data to justify social inequalities or discrimination. The idea that certain social groups are inherently superior or inferior to others due to their genetic makeup is not only scientifically incorrect but also ethically problematic.1 / 15. Philosophy and Political Correctness: An Irreconcilable Marriage 
What is the telos of philosophy? And why exactly would PC hinder it? To investigate this question, 
we must probe the physis of philosophy, so to speak. In particular, its knowledge-evaluating dynamics. 
In this section, I shall present some arguments inspired by technical results from applied science 
to defend the epistemic integrity of philosophy against contentions that philosophy is or should be 
congenial to PC. In particular, I will brief l y expose some tools originated from the i eld of engineering 
which I hold will help us understand the relationship between PC and philosophy. 
5.1. Philosophy as a Field of Inquiry 
In the post-Wittgensteinian world we live in where a thriving cognitive science scrutinizes the 
statistical character of the contents from our most beloved concepts, we have become reluctant to 
accept ambitious def i nitions with crisp either-or membership criteria as an answer for questions with 
the schematic structure âwhat is x?â. However, given the preliminary state of these investigations, I hold 
weâre warranted to explore this nebulous terrain with the aid of conceptual analysis and other formal 
methods conjoined with a dose of plausible empirical speculation; we must start from somewhere and 
diligently revise our constructs as empirical data is revealed. 
My starting point is the fruitful framework designed by philosopher-scientist Mario Bunge to 
characterize epistemic i elds in general and i elds of inquiry [9] in particular 26. Bungeâs set-theoretical 
exposition of epistemic i elds portrays the complex systems under which knowledge, broadly 
considered, is produced by human beings. 
Genuine philosophy, alongside all of the legitimate sciences and some of the other humanities, 
when properly conducted as investigative pursuits (such as archaeology and history) are all taken to 
be examples of i elds of inquiry. 
The measurement-theoretical construct of a comparative structure, def i ned in Appendix A.1, will 
be deployed many times in this section. 
Now, onto my adaptation of Bungean i elds of inquiry: 
Def i nition 2(Field of Inquiry).A i eld of inquiryFat a given timetis a 10-tupleF= 
hA,E,G,R,C, F,Ki,V,Si,<iwhere: 
â¢A 
is a set of professionals trained under a given research tradition 
â¢E is a set of research methods and processes enacted by members of A 
â¢G 
is a set of comparative structures, the goals of the i eld of inquiry 
â¢R is a set of problematics; the open problems and issues entertained by members of A 
â¢Cis 
a set of constructs, the formal and informal representata (statements, theories, propositions, etc. 
27) produced by members of A to answer P 
âF a proper subset of C, the fund of knowledge of F 
âCis partitioned into proper subsetsKi, each pertaining to a class of comparable constructs 
(rival constructs engaging with a same topic from P) 
26 In Bungeâs original scheme, epistemic i elds come in two types; i elds of inquiry and belief systems, of which I take ideologies to 
be one of its species. 
27 Naturally, to treat logical formulae as individualsx,xâCis 
an abstraction. Treating them as logical formulae proper would 
require the framework to employ second-order logic which would be extremely cumbersome.

more professionalsa,aâAtargeting a problemp,pâRengage in a research processfâBwhich 
takes as input a proper subset the fund of knowledge F and outputs a construct x,xâC. 
Under this framework, the metaphilosophical quest for a def i niendum of philosophy would 
typically center in the analysis of the problematicsRof the i eld of inquiry of philosophy. I shall not 
venture into this hard issue. Instead, Iâll focus on other aspects I take to be both more readily scrutable 
and which will be suff i cient for my arguments; the set of goalsGand the set of valuesVof philosophy. 
Following developments from contemporary epistemology which will be discussed in greater 
detail later in Section 5.3, goals come in two types: epistemic and non-epistemic. This distinction 
will remain undef i ned and purely in the domain of intuitive appreciation; epistemic goals include 
standards such as wisdom, understanding, learning and, most important for our investigation, truth. 
Non-epistemic goals are a heterogeneous lot which includes economic prof i t, well-being, entertainment 
and the other primary indictee of our investigation, social justice. 

Legitimate i elds of inquiry, in relative contrast to stagnant pseudoscience and pseudophilosophy, 
other degenerate research programs and dogmatic ideologies, are cognitively progressive; this can be 
informally characterized as the dual claim that their funds of knowledge tend, over time, to be 
populated with more and more constructs which are better attuned to the goals of the i eld 28. 
If philosophy is a i eld of inquiry, it is no exceptionâalthough the advancement appears to be 
considerably slower than other i elds of inquiry [118]. However, despite all the alleged actual and 
potential insurmountable mysteries, antinomies, paradoxes and theoretical dead-ends as well as 
unfortunate periods of wasteful degenerate philosophical research programs where the function of 
our philosophical knowledge loses its monotonicity, I take it that that we stand today in a more fertile 
ground than the one initiated by Nietzscheâs admired âGreek sagesâ 29. For a candid but blunt example, 
the seeds of Thales have ultimately germinated in the minds of a succession of thinkersâfrom Aristotle, 
Leibniz and Boole to GÃ¶del, Church and Turingâresponsible for the formal causes of the technological 
marvel I am using to write this paper down 30. 
5.2. Philosophy and Truth 
What are the goals of philosophy? I accept that the gist of this issue has been successfully captured 
by one of the oldest (if not the oldest) metaphilosophical accounts; out of the Pythagorean love of 
wisdom, we extract that philosophy is, i rst and foremost, a truth-seeking enterprise [121]. Even if there 
exists contentious disagreement on both the domain of truths philosophy seeks (not to mention the 
nature of truth itself!), truth of some persuasion remains the supreme epistemic goal of philosophy 31. 
28 An easy and risky way to characterize this feature under this framework is this; letFt0be the fund of knowledge of 
philosophy at a timet0andFt+the fund of knowledge of philosophy at an arbitrary future timet+. Then the statement 
|Ft+| > ? ?Ft 
0 ? ?is 
probably true. 
29 The relevant quote comes from Philosophy in the Tragic Age of the Greeks: âThe very i rst experience that philosophy had on 
Greek soil, the sanction of the Seven Sages, is an unmistakable and unforgettable feature of the Hellenic image. Other peoples 
have saints; the Greeks have sagesâ [119]. 
30 There exists extensive metaphilosophical disagreement on the possibility of progress in philosophy. The sort of progress 
envisioned by my example would not be considered properly philosophical [120]. But even the case that perennial problems 
(such as the mind-body problem and free will) are unsolvable, if true, would itself be a positive epistemic result by 
demarcating limits to human knowledge. 
31 This strong thesis resonates with Berit Brogaardâs [122] account of epistemic value monism under which truth is a primary, 
overriding and non-negotiable epistemic goal. 
Philosophies 2017, 2, 1725 of 56 
This metaphilosophical position may no longer be as fashionable, but I contend that it is hard to 
make sense of philosophy which does not take truth as an epistemic goal. If one holds that philosophy 
has nothing to do with the pursuit of truth, I take it as a conversation stopper and a performative 
contradiction. For if metaphilosophy is philosophy, the disagreement with the metaphilosophical 
inquiry of what philosophy is for is a disagreement on the truth of what philosophy is for. If one wishes 
to follow the road of doing philosophy that rejects these basic constraints of rationality, one is at the 
risk of, to paraphrase philosopher Daniel Dennett, to engage in nothing more than âverbal balletâ [123] 
or to play âintellectual tennis without a netâ [124] 32. Philosophies so unrestrained are mere belief 
systems, not i elds of inquiry. The question of the possibility of philosophy being able to thrive as both 
a truth-oriented activity and a vehicle for social justiceâboth understand the world and to save the 
worldâwill be answered negatively in the next sections. 
Up to this level of analysis, the postulated features of truth-seekingness and cognitive progress not 
only underspecify philosophy but makes it indistinguishable from basic (as opposed to applied) science. 
This is not an accident, but probably comes from shared inheritance for basic science is historically 
an offshoot of philosophy. It is also not a demerit for the arguments I shall deploy in support of 
a radical separation of philosophy from political correctness will be just as effective if applied to 
basic science. 
But what truth are we talking about? Modern mathematical logic has a built-in formal theory 
of logical truth as model-satisf i ability which has been famously advanced as an interpretation of the 
âclassicalâ (correspondence) conception of truth. I shall not assume this particular schematic structure 
of truth. Instead, in the spirit of maximizing generality and neutrality, I characterize a bland conception 
of truth for i elds of inquiry which should be compatible with many different theories of truth. Truth, 
being a goal, will be represented as a bounded comparative structurehT,<iwith 
a pair of real numbers 
setting a lower bound (absolute falsity) and an upper bound (absolute truth). For convenience reasons, 
we can use the well-known interval[0,1]. The relata of the ordering relation<are constructsx1and 
x2being compared with respect to truth. If one holds that philosophical truth is strictly bivalent, one 
may replace a continuous comparative structure for a discrete one so that the image of the function 
of truthÏ(x)only has two values, such as {0,1}. However, I believe the analysis is more fruitful if 
we concede orders of truth for philosophical representata. For instance, assuming that the following 
examples are rival positions and thus members of the same classK1, for a philosopher to hold thatx1 
(neutral monism) is truer thanx2(materialism) and to hold that materialism is truer thanx3(substance 
dualism) is to assign as the image for the function of truthÏ(x)of these constructs three real numbers

Aside from the pursuit of truth, which is an epistemic value, philosophy is influenced by a set of non-epistemic values. These non-epistemic values are extra-theoretical, social or ethical considerations, that guide and influence philosophical enquiry, such as fairness, inclusivity, representation, social justice, and political correctness (PC).The addition of these non-epistemic values has stirred an ongoing debate in philosophical circles about the telos, or purpose, of philosophy. Does the inclusion of non-epistemic values, in particular PC, enhance or hinder the pursuit of philosophical truths?On one side of the debate, proponents argue that the inclusion of non-epistemic values, especially PC, is necessary for a more equitable and socially conscious philosophy. They posit that these values encourage more diverse perspectives and problematics, enriching philosophical discourse and challenging entrenched biases.On the other side, detractors contend that the inclusion of non-epistemic values, especially PC, potentially jeopardizes the epistemic integrity of philosophy. They worry that these values may unduly influence philosophical enquiry, leading to the suppression of controversial ideas, the elevation of social conformity over intellectual rigor, and the possible distortion of truth.The challenge is to reconcile these seemingly opposing positions. A potential solution could be the application of principles from the field of engineering, which acknowledges the interplay between truth and non-epistemic values in its design processes. By adopting a similar approach, philosophy could navigate the tensions between truth-seeking and the need for non-epistemic values, while preserving its epistemic integrity.The key is balance. Philosophy should strive to create an environment where both epistemic and non-epistemic values coexist without one dominating the other. This equilibrium, however, requires constant vigilance and self-reflection to ensure that the pursuit of truth remains the primary goal of philosophy, while non-epistemic values contribute to a more inclusive and socially conscious philosophical discourse.5.4. The Threat of PC to Philosophy
As mentioned, one particular non-epistemic value that has gained prominence in recent years is political correctness (PC). PC advocates for the use of language and behavior to avoid offense and provide inclusivity, particularly to marginalized groups.While PC aims to promote a more inclusive and respectful discourse, it can, in some cases, create a form of intellectual conformism that inhibits the free exchange of ideas, which is central to the philosophical endeavour. By placing constraints on what can be discussed or how it can be discussed, PC can potentially stifle intellectual rigor, challenge, and creativity.Moreover, an excessive emphasis on PC may steer philosophy away from its truth-seeking goal. If philosophers begin to prioritize non-offensive or socially acceptable ideas over truthful ones, the epistemic integrity of philosophy is threatened. Philosophical enquiry could be reduced to ideological posturing or pandering to social trends, rather than a rigorous exploration of truth.In conclusion, while non-epistemic values, including PC, can enrich philosophical discourse and promote a more inclusive environment, an unmoderated influence of these values can threaten the core epistemic goal of philosophy. Therefore, maintaining a balanced interplay between truth and non-epistemic values is essential for the continued growth and integrity of philosophy.1 / 15.3. A Formal Account of the Relationship between Philosophical Knowledge and Values 
How do the members of an epistemic i eld legitimately evaluate a given construct as successfully 
attaining a particular goal of the i eld? And what if the i eld has multiple goals or worse, multiple 
conf l icting goals? 
This kind of problem has been entertained by both philosophers of science dealing with theory 
choice and model selection and epistemologists dealing with belief justif i cation, which we may generalize 
as the problem of epistemic appraisal (for a contemporary overview, see [125]). 
What must the relationship between a bearer of contentxand a particular goalhâ¦,<i âGbe 
for it to be successful? A received philosophical view Iâll assume is that we are justif i ed to holdxas 
being on the road to achieve a certainâ¦-goal ifxâembodiesâ the appropriateâ¦-values. In the words 
of epistemologist and philosopher of science Stephen E. Grimm, âa belief earns positive marks (counts 
as justif i ed, rational, virtuous, etc.), from an epistemic point of view, just in case it does well with 
respect to the things with intrinsic epistemic value (i.e., helps to promote them or bring them about). 
32 Dennett attributes this adage to philosopher Ronald de Souza, referring to philosophical apologetics. 
Philosophies 2017, 2, 1726 of 56 
Likewise, a belief earns negative marks just in case it does poorly with respect to the things with 
intrinsic epistemic valueâ [126]. 
To formally characterize this relationship, we turn to a vibrant discussion in the contemporary 
epistemology of science on epistemic or cognitive 33 values (such as empirical adequacy, predictive 
accuracy, and external consistency; a i ner-grained typology in the context of the epistemic i eld of 
science is found at [128]). These epistemic values are contrasted with contextual, non-epistemic or 
non-cognitive values (such as safety, social equality, and racial diversity). Fields of inquiry may employ 
both, in variable conf i gurations according to their set of goals. 
Let us take epistemic goals to be accomplishable by constructs bearing the appropriate epistemic 
values and the converse happening with non-epistemic goals. For instance, applied science, such as the 
several branches of engineering, differs from basic science by having additional practical non-epistemic 
goals which supply further normative requirements [129]. As an example, the i eld of inquiry of 
aerospace engineering has an overarching non-epistemic practical goal of aircraft and spacecraft design, 
the construction of machines that transit the atmosphere and beyond. These crafts, in turn, must 
eff i ciently carry on a variety of specialized supplementary practical duties depending on the roleâfrom 
belligerent air supremacy to peaceful civilian transportation. Thus, the epistemic appraisal of anx 
(such as the computational model of an aircraft) must also be guided by the relevant non-epistemic or 
contextual values such as safety, resilience, acquisition cost, payload capacity, and i repower. Aerospace 
engineers naturally also want their l uid dynamics to be approximately true 34 or else their aircraft 
may not kick off the ground (much less reach escape velocity). 
The sole epistemic goal we will be interested in is truth and the only epistemic values Iâll be 
interested in Iâll call alethic epistemic values, those that are truth-enhancing. Other possible epistemic 
goals (such as understanding or curiosity satisfaction) do not necessarily converge with truth. 
For instance, educators teaching basic arithmetic with positive integers to small children, in an attempt 
to make the subject more intelligible, (that is, to attain the epistemic goal of understanding) often utter 
verbal heuristic devices such as âyou canât take a bigger number from a smaller numberâ which are 
strict mathematical falsehoods, either decreasing or neutralize the goal of truth [130]. 
Taking for granted concepts from the science of statistics, alethic epistemic values are now 
provisorily def i ned: 
Def i nition 3(Alethic Epistemic Value).For a certain i eld of inquiryFwith the epistemic goal of truth, 
hT,<i âG, a valuehE,<i âVis an alethic epistemic value if and only if the function of truthÏ(x)is 
positively correlated with the function of the value e(x). 
For instance, if we have good reasons to think that when a philosophical construct fares well in 
semantic def i niteness and formal rigor, its truth is being enhanced, then these are candidates for being 
alethic epistemic values. If scoring well in ad hocness and unwarranted aprioricity has the opposite 
effect, we have the opposite conclusion. 
I similarly def i ne a politically correct value, a type of non-epistemic value:

Def i nition 4(Politically Correct Value).For a certain i eld of inquiryFwith the non-epistemic goal of social 
justice,hJ,<i âG, a valuehP,<i âVis a politically correct value if and only if the function of social justice 
Ï(x)is positively correlated with the function of the value Ï(x). 
33 Larry Laudan [127] distinguishes cognitive from epistemic values. In his account, cognitive values encompass epistemic 
values as a proper subset and the âepistemicâ is strictly construed as the domain of necessary and suff i cient truth-conditions 
for a construct. My sketched account of what I call alethic epistemic values is not as strong and may involve weaker 
contingencies between a value and the goal of truth. 
34 As a matter of fact, in the context of modeling a design problem (Section 5.4), engineers do not need to expend resources 
computing the truth of natural science which has already stood to massive empirical scrutiny. It is already a given, a part of 
the fund of knowledge F. 
Philosophies 2017, 2, 1727 of 56 
And now, we def i ne a dummy alethic epistemic value: 
Def i nition 5(Dummy Alethic Epistemic Value).An alethic epistemic valuehE,<iis a dummy alethic 
epistemic value if and only if there exists another alethic epistemic valuehE0,<iand 
the values of the function 
e(x)are proxy variables of e0(x), that is, e0(x)is better correlated with Ï(x)than e(x). 
This last def i nition is stimulated by intuitions on the existence of possible hierarchies of alethic 
epistemic values in which some are more âbasicâ than others and the possibility of there being alethic 
epistemic values that are redundant, performing idle work. For instance, elegance 35 may be tracking 
simplicity, in which case it would be a dummy epistemic value. However, in scientif i c practice, proxy 
variables are often indispensable, particularly when the relevant variable researchers aim to track is 
non-observable. 
I posit that sound philosophical and scientif i c inquiry is often constrained by a shared set of 
regulatory ideals, i.e., for an arbitrary family of evaluation standards from a basic scienceK1and 
another from philosophy,K2, we should expect thatK1â©K26= {â}. 
For instance, one of these which 
I hold follows naturally from the character of philosophy as a truth-seeking i eld of inquiry is the 
epistemic value of external consistency; philosophy ought to be consistent with the truths revealed by 
other epistemic i elds at least as epistemically secure as itself, the natural sciences being a prominent 
example 36. If your descriptive metaphysics is inconsistent with the most established developments of 
quantum mechanics and general relativity, then your system loses epistemic value. If your normative 
ethics is inconsistent with the most solid results of behavioral genetics and moral psychology, then this 
is also a serious defect of your theory. And so on.1 / 1ChatGPTChatGPTThis passage discusses the relationship between philosophical knowledge and values, focusing on the evaluation of a given construct in an epistemic field and how it aligns with the goals of that field. It specifically addresses the challenges presented by conflicting goals within a field.The text outlines the idea of epistemic appraisal, referring to the assessment of beliefs or theories based on their success in aligning with certain intrinsic epistemic values (values related to knowledge). These are contrasted with non-epistemic values (values not directly related to knowledge), which can also play a role in the evaluation process.An important point made in the text is that different fields may have different goals and therefore employ different configurations of epistemic and non-epistemic values. The example of applied science vs. basic science is given to illustrate this point: applied science, such as engineering, often has practical non-epistemic goals which provide additional normative requirements.The text then discusses alethic epistemic values, which are described as truth-enhancing. An alethic epistemic value positively correlates with the truth function of a construct, meaning that if a construct exhibits this value, its truthfulness is likely enhanced. Examples of potential alethic epistemic values are semantic definiteness and formal rigor.The text also introduces the concept of politically correct values, a type of non-epistemic value that aligns with the goal of social justice. Such values are positively correlated with the function of social justice.Finally, the concept of dummy alethic epistemic values is introduced. These are alethic values that are proxy variables for other alethic values, meaning that they are less directly correlated with truth but can still be useful, particularly when the relevant variable is non-observable.The text concludes with the argument that philosophical and scientific inquiry should ideally be guided by a shared set of regulatory ideals, and one of these is external consistency. This means that philosophical theories should ideally be consistent with truths established by other secure fields, such as the natural sciences. If a philosophical theory is inconsistent with established scientific facts, then its epistemic value decreases.1 / 15.4. Epistemic Appraisal as Engineering 
Dealing with herculean projects which aim at the simultaneous satisfaction of multiple clashing 
objectives, often in the light of information that is partial and even inconsistent, is what many engineers, 
computer scientists, and economists working in the interdisciplinary i eld of inquiry of operations 
research (OR) do for a living. In the spirit of consilience among epistemic i elds, I suggest that the 
general problem of epistemic appraisal in philosophy and other i elds of inquiry can be represented 
using the formal skeletons of types of problems managed in OR and that we may tentatively draw 
some lessons from the decades of human ingenuity accrued by research in this i eld on the prognosis 
of politically correct philosophy. 
From OR, we have two types of problem of interest; roughly, when an agent knows in advance 
a i nite set of alternatives with variable performance in such and such criteria and needs to pick the 
best, one has an evaluation problem, and one does multicriteria decision analysis (MCDA, also called 
multiple criteria decision-making or aiding). The relevance of MCDA methods on the problem of theory 
choice in the philosophy of science has been explored in recent years [132,133]. 
When one does not know in advance the alternatives of a problem involving multiple goals 
but has a working mathematical model to represent it, one has a design problem and may attempt 
to i nd solutions through multiobjective optimization (MOO, also called multicriteria optimization and 
multiobjective programming). 
I shall make a very brief exposition of MCDA and MOO problems and draw some lessons for our 
project. Some understanding of vector algebra will be assumed for this section. Vectors are referenced 
35 Several examples of simplicity and elegance in the history of science are described by biologist Ian Glynn [131]. 
36 Critics of a postmodern or non-naturalistic verve may object and claim that such inferences are âscientisticâ (or any other 
number of smear words). I reject any such charges of âscientismâ as deliberate buzzword-infused ploys meant to avoid the 
satisfaction of external consistency and the loss of epistemic value such a constraint would cause for philosophical theories 
that ignore empirical truth.

inboldface, conforming to a standard notation. First, let us check the structure of an MDCA problem 
(adapted from [134] (p. 10)): 
Def i nition 6(Multicriteria Decision Analysis Problem).A multicriteria decision analysis problem 
(an evaluation problem) is a 6-tuple MC= hA,X,X0,Î¦,R,Âµiwhere:

Now, for a generic MOO problem (adapted from [135] p. X and [136]): 
Def i nition 7(Multiobjective Optimization Problem).A multiobjective optimization problem 
(a design problem) is a 6-tuple MO= hf,x,Rn,S,g,hi.

â¢h

â¢For each function Ïi(d), Ïi(d)is to be either maximized or minimized 
These frameworks are commensurable. For instance, the criteria functions from MCDA just are 
the objective functions from MOO. Researchers often engage with the two types of problem at different 
stages of a same project 37. 
We may now draw several semantic equivalences that will allow us to frame the problem of 
epistemic appraisal using the terms of i elds of inquiry. Table 2 summarizes these correspondences:

Table 2. Semantic equivalences.

37 As framed in [135], the MCDA evaluation problem is actually a proper part of a major MOO problem âIt should be 
clear that multiobjective optimization consists of three phases: model building, optimization, and decision making 
(preference articulation)â. 
Philosophies 2017, 2, 1729 of 56 
5.5. Modelling Epistemic Appraisal 
Further qualif i cations are warranted. In the name of formal rigor and structural conservativeness, 
we strive to deal, if possible, solely with ordinal varieties of MOO and MCDA. In this move, 
we potentially lose several technical options but still capture what is more essential. As a team 
of control engineers puts it, âorder [of objective functions] is much more robust against noise than 
âvalueââ [137] (p. 13). Getting the order right is whatâs most crucial. 
Sometimes it is assumed that the values involved in epistemic appraisal can be readily given 
a cardinal interpretation. For instance, in the context of the epistemic appraisal of scientif i c theories 
and the demarcation problem, Martin Mahner proposes such an account of scientif i city [138]. It is true 
that several such characterizations have been proposed for particular alethic epistemic values. Most 
notably, ways to quantify different senses of the simplicity of constructs [139,140]. Such polysemies 
in alethic epistemic values are probably the norm, making the problem even harder. The concept 
of simplicity in the context of epistemic appraisal, for instance, appears to be a mongrel concept 
that designates different syntactical, semantical, epistemological, practical and aesthetic properties of 
constructs [141,142]. Unfortunately, most philosophical theories (and other philosophical constructs) 
are informal and are yet to be expressed in the regimented languages required for such computations. 
This fact gives more credence to the proposal that presently, epistemic appraisal in philosophy (and 
science) should be a strictly ordinal endeavor. 
InMCDAandMOO,engineersregularlydefythemeasurement-theoreticaldoctrineofpermissible 
transformations by treating ordinal variables as if they were interval or ratio-scalable (for instance, 
by extracting arithmetic means of arbitrary data and assuming that the different levels of Likert-type 
scales 38 are equally spaced magnitudes). In the absence of evidence that the variable at hand satisf i es 
theaxiomsforlinearstructuresoranykindofstructurewhereanoperationofconcatenationisomorphic 
to arithmetic addition can be def i ned, one should be conservative and assume that it just meets the 
simpler and less demanding family of comparative structureshAi,<i. 
Now, for an exposition of some of the results from these i elds of inquiry:1 / 1ChatGPTChatGPTThe multiobjective optimization (MOO) and multicriteria decision analysis (MCDA) models are applicable to the concept of epistemic appraisal in the context of philosophy and other fields of inquiry. These models offer a structured way to evaluate competing theories and make decisions in the face of multiple conflicting criteria.To establish some equivalences, the "actors" in the MCDA model would correspond to the professionals in a field of inquiry, and the decision space in the model would correspond to the constructs of theories in that field. The criteria functions in the MCDA model would correspond to the standards by which theories are evaluated. In a similar manner, the constraints in the MOO model would correspond to the a priori goals set by members of the field.One important consideration is the ordinal nature of these models. It is often assumed that the values used for epistemic appraisal can be given a cardinal interpretation, or essentially, be ranked in order of importance. However, given the complex and often conflicting nature of philosophical inquiry, it may be more practical to use an ordinal approach, focusing on the order of importance rather than the exact value of each criterion.There are limitations to this approach. For example, philosophers often work with informal theories that are not readily quantifiable, making the computation of specific values difficult. In this sense, epistemic appraisal may be a strictly ordinal endeavor.The approach of using MCDA and MOO models also challenges some traditional doctrines in measurement theory. These models often treat ordinal variables as if they were interval or ratio-scalable, which can lead to extracting arithmetic means of arbitrary data and assuming that different levels of Likert-type scales are equally spaced magnitudes. In the absence of evidence that supports this assumption, one should be conservative and assume that the variables only meet the simpler and less demanding family of comparative structures.Moving forward, the models and methods derived from fields like operations research can offer valuable insights into the process of epistemic appraisal in philosophy and other fields of inquiry. It is now time to explore some of the specific results these fields have produced that can be applied to the problem of epistemic appraisal.1 / 1Postulate 19(Non-Optimality).I suppose that, in general, for a given multi-objective optimization problem 
MO, there exists no solutionxâSthat 
simultaneously attains the desired outcomes of objective functionsf 
(i.e., maximizations and minimizations) under constraints h and g. 
The rule of thumb is that multiple objectives will conf l ict with each other. MOO is an art of 
negotiation and compromise; the quest for a Platonic ideal aircraft, traff i c system, or automated factory 
is irremediably tragicâthe optimal solution in the sense of scalar or single-objective optimization is 
generally impossible, and one must be content to one of their possible eff i cient worldly realizations. 
There are many types and hierarchies of eff i cient solutions; below the crown of scalar 
optimality [143] (Chapter 2), what rules more i rmly is the notion of Pareto eff i ciency (also called 
Pareto âoptimalityâ). Consider the following def i nition of Pareto-eff i ciency (adapted from [135,143]): 
Def i nition 8(Pareto Eff i ciency).For a MOO problemMOwhere the vector of objective functionsf= 
{Ï1(x),...,Ïm(x)}Tis 
to be maximized, xâS, 
a decision vector xâ is Pareto-eff i cient if and only if there does 
not exist another x so that Ïi(x) â¥Ïi(xâ)for all i=1,...,n. 
â¢A 
Pareto-eff i cient decision vector is strictly Pareto-eff i cient if and only ifÏj(x) >Ïj(xâ)for at least 
one index j. Otherwise, it is weakly Pareto-eff i cient 
38 Likert scales are a staple of survey data designed to extract information regarding preferences. They usually involve a small 
even number of sentences ranked from either the most positive or most negative valence (such as âstrongly agreeâ, âagreeâ, 
âindifferenceâ, âdisagreeâ and âstrongly disagreeâ. 
Philosophies 2017, 2, 1730 of 56 
We call a set of Pareto-eff i cient solutions a Pareto frontier. Although these are often not computable, 
we may strive for solutions which approximate the Pareto frontier. We say that all Pareto-eff i cient 
solutions dominate over the rest of the solutions in the feasible region space. 
Since the frameworks of MOO and MCDA are commensurable, each decision vectorxmay 
correspond to a decision variant x. 
Let us contemplate some simple examples of evaluation problems in epistemic appraisal for 
philosophy. Consider a hypothetical metaethicist comparing three constructs, the thesis of moral 
cognitivism, the thesis of moral noncognitivism and a hybrid theory of both. He holds that four 
alethic epistemic values are relevant for his evaluation and posits ordinal values under a bounded 
interval [0, 10]. Table 3 summarizes this scenario: 
Table 3. Theory choice in philosophy. 
TheoryInternal ConsistencyEmpirical AdequacyÂ¬ad 
hocnessSimplicity 
Moral cognitivism10545 
Moral noncognitivism10767 
Hybrid theory7522 
Starting from very instinctive standards of rationality, it is a no-brainer that our model metaethicist 
should choose moral non-cognitivism over the others for it is either better or equivalent to the 
alternative positions in every respect.x2is the only Pareto-eff i cient solution of this set of decision 
variants, and it thus dominates the others. 
Now, consider a philosopher of mind evaluating theories of personal identity also under 
four criteria. Table 4 depicts this scenario: 
Table 4. Theory choice in philosophy. 
TheoryExplanatory PowerSimplicityEmpirical AdequacyIntuitiveness 
Animalism7765 
Lockeanism8556 
Eliminativism5960 
In this example, there is no decision variant dominating. All three options are Pareto-eff i cient. 
How does one choose? There exists no transcendental procedure, no single general algorithm that 
takes a set of eff i cient decision variants and outputs the most preferred one. Instead, there are several. 
Engineers may often i nd themselves in the paradoxical situation of having a second-order MCDA 
problem when choosing which method to use to solve a particular MCDA problem [144]. 
In the ordinal MCDA case, although the vast majority of algorithms involve aggregation 
procedures employing addition and multiplication at some point, there are fortunately some purely 
âqualitativeâ strategies. For instance, the approach of generalized concordance rules [145], which does not 
assume the additivity of typical âcompare and aggregateâ approaches in multicriteria decision-making. 
How MCDA may model evaluation problems in i elds of inquiry should be easy to see. 
What about design problems? Here things get more complicated. I intend to use the framework 
of MOO to represent an ideal hunt for constructs that eff i ciently carry out the goals of the i eld through 
the maximization of the associated values.

It is not clear if purely ordinal cases of MOO are feasible. Over the literature, in the context of 
stochastic optimization, so-called âordinal optimizationâ procedures exist as an antecedent backstage to 
eschew computational burden for run-of-the-mill cardinal optimization [137]. Some decision theorists 
(such as [134] (p. 58), in the context of scalarization techniques) have argued that even though 
some mathematical manipulations in certain procedures have no empirical interpretation, (i.e., are not 
Philosophies 2017, 2, 1731 of 56 
meaningful 39 in a measurement-theoretic sense) they can be justif i ed on heuristic or pragmatic grounds 
and be positively informative. 
I shall now add another informal companion for Postulate 19 meant to express something on the 
standards of success of i elds of inquiry: 
Postulate 20(Epistemic Effectiveness of a Field of Inquiry).The epistemic effectiveness of i eld of inquiry 
F is a function of its power to produce quality constructs in C. 
A received hierarchy of quality of constructs in the context of evaluation and design problems 
is thus: 
â¢Scalar 
Optimality, for problems with m=1 functions 
â¢Strict Pareto Eff i ciency, for problems with mâ¥2 
conf l icting functions 
â¢Weak 
Pareto Eff i ciency, for problems with mâ¥2 
conf l icting functions 
â¢Approximations of Pareto Eff i cient solutions, for problems with mâ¥2 functions 
Given this crude characterization, a i eld of inquiry that consistently produces more eff i cient 
constructs relative to the problems it entertains is a more effective one.This leads us to the 
following consequence: 
Postulate 21(The Curse of Multiple Goals).In general, for a i eld of inquiryF, the more goals inGit has, 
the more ineffective it is at the development of constructs in C which are eff i cient. 
This conjecture emerges from considerations of Section 5.3 where each goal is associated which 
a cluster of values which have, as elaborated in Table 2, a direct correspondence with objective functions 
of a MOO problem. 
This claim may look like a trivial truism; of course it is expected that the more targets a i eld 
aims to secure, the harder it is to secure them. But the point Iâd like to emphasize is that the growth 
of diff i culty is generally not linear; it increases dramatically fast asmrises. This is partially due to 
an assortment of formal phenomena dubbed âthe curse of dimensionalityâ (f i rst exposed by [147], 
in the context of dynamic programming) that take place with mathematical optimization as the number 
of objective functions increases. 
These complex problems are a breeding ground for the infamous âNP-hardâ decision 
problems where the computational resources required to reach a suff i ciently strong solution may 
grow exponentially. Many families of algorithms effective at attaining or bordering the Pareto 
front in MOO with a small number of objectives do not scale well with a greater number of 
objectives. For instance, many evolutionary algorithms struggle to i nd Pareto-eff i cient solutions 
when mâ¥3 [148].Also, one ofthe most used procedures to test for the quality of two Pareto-eff i cient 
sets, the hypervolume indicator, has a #P-hard (âSharp-Pâ) complexity class, being as hard to solve as its 
associated NP decision problem [149]. 
Up until this point, many criticisms are possible. Iâll brief l y consider two of them. First, by 
taking as relevant these results from theoretical computer science in the context of mathematical 
optimization, we are implicitly representing the production of knowledge in an arbitrary i eld of 
inquiryFas a classical computational process, a program implementable in a Turing machine. Black 
box model for black model, it could be argued that professional experts are best modeled as more 
powerful computational systems (such as oracle machines) and thus, being able to circumvent the 
imposed diff i culties in the formal framework Iâm grounding my analysis in, rendering them irrelevant.1 / 1ChatGPTChatGPTYour Postulate 19 (Non-Optimality) and the subsequent discussion about the difficulties of multi-objective optimization (MOO) is a very well-informed and insightful contribution to the understanding of complex decision-making in various fields. As you note, attempting to maximize multiple conflicting objectives often leads to a situation where no single solution satisfies all the desired outcomes. This is known as the "Pareto front" or "Pareto efficient set", where any improvement in one objective results in a degradation of at least one other objective.Postulate 20 (Epistemic Effectiveness of a Field of Inquiry) extends the implications of multi-objective optimization to the efficiency of a field of inquiry. That is, the effectiveness of a field in producing quality constructs is intrinsically linked to its ability to optimize its objectives. The more a field can produce efficient constructs, the more effective it is.This leads us to Postulate 21 (The Curse of Multiple Goals), which posits that a field of inquiry becomes more ineffective at developing efficient constructs as it tries to achieve more goals. This is indeed a common issue in MOO, known as the "curse of dimensionality", where the difficulty of finding optimal solutions grows exponentially with the number of objectives.This approach can be critiqued from several perspectives, one being the representation of the process of knowledge production in a field of inquiry as a computational process, akin to a program implementable in a Turing machine. This assumes a deterministic, mechanistic model of knowledge production, which may not fully capture the complex, non-linear, and often intuitive processes involved in real-world decision-making. Moreover, it could be argued that human decision-makers might have more computational power than a classical Turing machine, thus making these constraints less relevant. However, even if we allow for this possibility, the problems of non-optimality and the curse of dimensionality still remain significant challenges for decision-making in fields of inquiry with multiple conflicting objectives.Overall, your postulates highlight important insights into the complexities and difficulties of decision-making in fields with multiple conflicting goals. It serves as a reminder that decision-making is often an art of negotiation and compromise, and that finding a single optimal solution might not be possible or even desirable in many cases.1 / 1Second, it can also be questioned that since approximate solutions at a small distance from the 
Pareto frontier scanned by much faster heuristic algorithms are often good enough and attainable with 
fewer resources, by analogy the activities of professional philsophers may be modeled by much more 
realistic heuristic algorithms. 
The i rst line of argument is congruent with standard practice in operations research. In design 
problems, a priori expert knowledge compacting expectations of what a good solution looks like 
can be incorporated in the model, relieving burdens (for example, in the context of an evolutionary 
optimization [150]). In evaluation problems, this is even more obvious as experts are consulted to 
place decision variants under preference relations, and this feedback is used to build decision-making 
procedures. Under a formal decision setting, experts can indeed be modeled as oracles of a sort. 
However, I claim that, particularly for the less methodologically robust fields of inquiry (such as 
philosophyandthesocialsciences), weshouldbeveryskepticalofthepowersoftheirprofessionalexperts 
to find even âgood enoughâ solutions in the feasibility spaceâmuch less efficient solutions (for instance, 
political psychologist Philip E. Tetlock has documented the underwhelming predictive accuracy of 
social scientists over even general economic and political trends [151]). Philosophy, in particular, may 
be the field of inquiry most pessimistic of the status of its cognitive achievements [120,152]. Also, 
as already acknowledged in Section 3.1, existing empirical evidence on expertise effects behind properly 
philosophical inquiry (such as epistemology and ethics) is not consistent with philosophers having 
particularly special epistemic powers. 
Under this framework, I posit that the main reason why philosophy, in contrast to science, is more 
ineffective is due to lack of robust standards under which contradictory eff i cient decision variants are 
to be evaluated. Science arguably has the âtribunal of experienceâ as the primary, if not overriding, 
standard of excellence, up until the point it faces empirical underdetermination. 
Is philosophy doomed? If each goal deploys a portfolio with a myriad of values whose structure 
we know little about, we appear to be hostages of the curse of dimensionality. Postulate 21 may 
seem to undermine optimality in truth-seeking pursuits. Or does it? There are two basic routes 
when engaging with a MOO problem; either one treats it as a MOO problem in its own right 
and incurs in any computational burdens involved or one attempts to transform it into a much 
more tractable single-objective optimization problem (SOO) through a particular process of scalarization. 
âScalarizationâ names families of different algorithms that transforms a vector of multiple objectives 
f= {f1(x),..., fn(x)}Tinto a scalar{f(x)}. 
In the name of optimism, I thus deploy the following bold conjecture: 
Postulate 22(Scalarization of Vectors With the Same Type of Goal).For a vector of functions 
f= {Ï1,...,Ïn}associated 
with the portfolio ofâ¦-values from a goalhâ¦,<i, 
it is assumed thatfcan be 
scalarized into f= {Ï}without signif i cant loss of information. 
This sums up the optimism that optimality may still be at hand for i elds of inquiry that seek 
truth, and truth only. Also, consider this; take our portfolio of alethic epistemic values{e1,...,em}. 
Given Def i nition 5, some of these may be just redundant dummy alethic epistemic values and thus may 
be removed. This procedure would be an instance of the technique of dimensionality reduction [153] that 
is employed in MOO.

5.6. Epistemic Appraisal of Politically Correct Fields of Inquiry 
We can now characterize more precisely the following subvarieties of epistemic i elds; truth-seeking 
i elds of inquiry (as I hold philosophy to be) and politically correct i elds of inquiry (as I claim neither 
basic science nor philosophy should be) and conclude our inquiry. 
Def i nition 9 (Truth-Seeking Field of Inquiry). For a i eld of inquiry F, F is truth-seeking if and only if: 
â¢F has truth,hT<i, as a goal in G 
Philosophies 2017, 2, 1733 of 56 
â¢All

whereÏÎ(x1) >ÏÎ(x2)may be preferred by a decision maker inAif for at least oneei(x1),

This characterization ensures that no construct even a bit defective on matters of truth will come 
to dominate other solutions. 
Examples of evaluation problems in the i eld of inquiry of philosophy include not only deciding 
which intuitions, premises and theories to choose but may also involve activities such as the i lling 
of a i nite list of key speakers in conferences and deciding whether to accept or reject a paper given 
contradictory appraisals of referees. If philosophy is truth-seeking, I argue that those academic 
activities should also strive to satisfy the above requirements.

this characterization as much as one wants.

The author argues that philosophy and the social sciences lack robust standards, which are essential in evaluating contradictory efficient decision variants, causing these fields to be less effective than others such as the physical sciences. In science, experience acts as the primary standard of excellence, serving to resolve conflicts and contradictions.The author proposes a solution to this inefficiency by introducing the concept of "scalarization" â a process that transforms a vector of multiple objectives into a single one. Scalarization might allow fields like philosophy to optimize their pursuit of truth, despite the high-dimensionality problem they are faced with.The author then distinguishes between truth-seeking fields of inquiry, such as philosophy, and politically correct fields of inquiry. Truth-seeking fields prioritize truth in their goals and aim to maximize truth value. Any action, decision, or strategy in these fields that undermines the pursuit of truth is deemed unacceptable. On the other hand, politically correct fields have social justice as a goal and must take into account politically correct values.This framing serves as the basis for the final definition: the epistemic appraisal of politically correct philosophy. The author models this as a multi-objective optimization problem where both truth and social justice are sought. In the evaluation phase, these are treated as criteria against which constructs are measured.1 / 15.7. Consequences of the Model for the Epistemic Appraisal of PC Philosophy 
Tying all my considerations together, the practical answer for whether a synergistic marriage 
between truth and social justice is plausible is a resounding ânoâ. 
5.7.1. Consequence #1: PC Philosophy Canât Reasonably Aspire to Be Truth-Seeking 
To say that to carry out philosophy solely in the pursuit of truth is hard would be 
an understatement. Now, optimization theory provides us with additional pragmatic reasons to 
avoid compromise of any kind (and not just political) when doing basic research. If the search for truth 
is not scalarizable, against the optimistic conjecture in Postulate 22, our effectiveness can be crippled 
with our problem subjected to everything undesirable that may happen when mâ¥2. 
Truth-seeking enterprises, given Def i nition 9, have no place for spurious restraints of non-alethic 
origin on the truth of statements (i.e., a value such as external consistency may inf l uence the truth of 
a construct in a truth-seeking i eld of inquiry, but not a contextual value such as politeness or sensitivity 
towards the feelings of others). 
If truth is scalarizable without signif i cant loss of information, optimality becomes a possibility for 
philosophical theories. 
The best decision-makers of a i eld are expected to marshal technical expertise under excellent 
standards of rationality. However, as argued in Section 3, we have reasons to expect professional 
philosophers, in general, to systematically run short of these aspirations when dealing with politically 
controversial topics. Given the presented frameworks of MCDA and MOO, I will supply some possible 
routes PC may compromise truth in philosophy. Here are some of the ways PC biases can be modeled: 
â¢In 
the context of both evaluation and design problems, the violation, willful or not, of the priority 
of alethic epistemic values over everything else in the family of evaluation standardsSiemployed 
â¢In 
the context of evaluation problems, the underestimation of the actual values (in the sense of 
assigned information) of alethic epistemic values associated with politically incorrect constructs. 
â¢In 
the context of design problems, the placement of unwarranted a priori inequality and equality 
constraints over the objective functions associated with alethic epistemic values which are 
prejudiciously deemed to be implausible because they are un-PC 
For a contemporary example in the philosophy of science, take the thesis in philosophy of biology 
that Homo sapiens not only is not a monotypic biological speciesâthe social genus ârace" being a natural 
kindâbut that one of the reasons for believing so is motivated by the alethic epistemic value of external 
consistency with research on cognitive differences across racial groups in contemporary differential 
psychology and behavioral genetics [154]. 
This particular thesis incurs in many sins; i rst, according to the PC worldview, it denies the social 
construction of the social kind âraceâ (Postulate 12). In its frank denial of Anthropological Mental 
Egalitarianism (Axiom 11), it violates the Generalized Difference Principle (Postulate 10) with respect 
to the social genus âraceâ, being typif i ed as âracistâ and therefore, being socially oppressive. 
If one adheres to the PC worldview, one acquires reasons from the point of view of the expressive 
rationality of identity-protection cognition (Postulate 7) to reprobate this thesis. In our model of 
a design problem, this can be represented by the supply of low inequality constraints over the 
empirical adequacy and external consistency of the construct. As an evaluation problem, conf i rmation 
bias suggests that a serious PC adherent would be bound to give low scores for the alethic epistemic 
values of the thesis. 
Again, the kind of rationality that is traditionally treasured as guiding philosophy and science is 
not the expressive rationality of identity-protective cognition; it is a rationality of objectivity. It demands 
us not to constrain the space of feasible hypothesis based on idiosyncratic preference, no matter 
how personally important. If we allow values such as sexual equality, natural egalitarianism, and 
extreme politeness to constrain science and philosophy, I predict we will produce worse science and 
Philosophies 2017, 2, 1735 of 56 
philosophy due to spurious directions prompted by these values. Politically correct philosophy can 
only thrive contingently.

5.7.2. Consequence #2: Politically Correct Philosophy is Ineffective as Philosophy 
It may be true that human males struggle more than human females with multitasking [155], 
but I believe that we can be much more certain on the shortcomings of certain i elds of inquiry at 
multitasking. This may still strike as unreasonable; what about the i elds of inquiry that are arguably 
very accomplished at dealing with massive projects involving multiple conf l icting goals, such as 
the various branches of engineering, which consistently supply us with new designs of cars, planes, 
and satellites? 
What explains the success of the engagement with some MOO problems in some i elds of 
engineering is a conjunction of peculiarities; in the context of design problems, engineers are often 
privileged with the possibility of developing a precise mathematical description of the problem at 
hand. For that, they often have the most reliable and tested physical science at their service and may 
off l oad a lot of the hard cognitive effort into machines with dedicated computational resources of 
unmatched power in the hunt for the solutions roaming the Pareto frontier. 
Philosophers are not so lucky, the i eld being largely informal and problems often lacking a precise 
def i nition. Perhaps there is truth in the metaphilosophical statement that, for every i eld of inquiry, 
philosophy âis what you have to do until you i gure out what questions you should have been 
asking in the i rst placeâ [156] (Chapter 2.1). Philosophy in its most pure of intellectual pursuits 
is, arguably, underperforming (see [118]). If one sincerely wishes philosophy qua philosophy to be 
cognitively progressive, represented as i nding the set of highest quality solutionsCfor a class of 
problemsP(or their nearest neighbors), I submit that one is irrational to expect that philosophy can be 
simultaneously socially progressive. The very same conclusion is generalizable to politically correct 
science. Supplementing a set of obscure criteria with even more obscure criteria is to overload the 
epistemic appraiser gratuitously. 
5.7.3. Consequence #3: Politically Correct Philosophy is Ineffective as Social Justice 
The converse is also true; if the goal of social justice is important for a professional philosopher, 
it may be the case that the veneer of respectability accrued by this i eld of inquiry may not even 
be worth it from the point of view of the standards of political success. For, if philosophy is still 
conceptualized as truth-seeking to a certain extent, this ideal will frequently be frustrating the design 
goal of maximizing social justice. 
Although the output of social justice can be given an economical characterization, causation in 
social systems is messy and it may be very hard to evaluate the different impacts of social policies, 
as economists continually struggle. 
I second the prima facie case that the basic researcher committed to political activism is better 
at doing pure political activism, without the restraints of a rationality of objectivity mandated by 
philosophy and science. Unfortunately, it may be that roughly, this is what is already happening across 
sectors of the humanities and social sciences; the repudiation of alethic epistemic values of formal rigor, 
semantic def i niteness and empirical adequacy that ground bona i de science, often under an exorcism 
of âpositivismâ, appears to be most prevalent in degenerating research programs. 
6. Defending the Epistemic Integrity of Truth-Seeking Philosophy 
In this section, I will consider three broad objections against the theoretical and practical feasibility 
of splitting up truth from social justice in philosophy. Although some of the arguments presented 
here are primarily targeting empirical science, under my assumption that different avenues of basic 
research have a shared structure in epistemic values and goals, I argue that these arguments can be 
generalized to philosophy as well. 
Philosophies 2017, 2, 1736 of 56 
6.1. The Objection from Contextual Empiricism 
The case Iâve built on the relative orthogonality of truth and social justice, save for contingent 
coincidence, has been l atly rejected by several feminist philosophers over the last three decades. 
Across the literature, we see the claim that values conducive for social justice may be necessary for 
truth-conducive rational inquiry. 
For instance, reiterating themes from critical theory and postmodernism, Sandra Harding [157] 
advanced the need for scientif i c knowledge to be socially situated, in particular when it comes to the 
lives of the socially oppressed. The conventional standards of empiricism are deemed inadequate for 
the prospect of maximizing objectivity, retrogressing into an âobjectivismââand not true objectivity. 
Paradoxically, in order for science to achieve âstrong objectivityâ, Harding defends that the social 
identities of scientists themselves need to be critically considered as also constitutive of a given 
scientif i c inquiry, and not merely its salient âobjects of knowledgeâ. Even more; the necessity of 
science to engage in âdemocracy-advancing projectsâ (i.e., social justice) can be justif i ed on âscientif i c 
and epistemological reasonsâ [157] (p. 69). This idea is the thesis that so-called âcontextualâ and 
ânon-epistemicâ politically correct values may not be non-epistemic after all but rightfully stand as 
legitimate alethic epistemic values 40. 
What reasons do we have to accept this? A strong case comes from the research program of 
contextual empiricism by philosopher of science Helen Longino 41. In her magnum opus Science As Social 
Knowledge, Longino [160] has meticulously described what is perceived to be the intrusion of sexist 
ideology into the background assumptions of several biological sciences, from paleoanthropology to 
neuroendocrinology.1 / 1ChatGPTChatGPTThe document's author suggests a direct conflict between truth-seeking philosophy and politically correct (PC) philosophy that promotes social justice. The author provides three key consequences of this model:5.7.1 Consequence #1: PC Philosophy Canât Reasonably Aspire to Be Truth-Seeking
This part suggests that philosophy, in its pursuit of truth, must not compromise for any reason, including political considerations. The author argues that the pursuit of truth cannot be constrained by values of non-alethic (non-truth related) origin, such as politeness or sensitivity towards others' feelings. Philosophers, especially those dealing with politically controversial topics, may not meet the high standards of rationality. Certain politically correct biases can compromise truth in philosophy.5.7.2 Consequence #2: Politically Correct Philosophy is Ineffective as Philosophy
The author suggests that certain fields of inquiry struggle with multitasking or the pursuit of multiple conflicting goals. Engineering is an exception, as engineers often have the ability to precisely define problems and use tested physical science and computational resources. However, philosophy often lacks this precision, rendering it potentially less effective when its scope is broadened to encompass socially progressive goals.5.7.3 Consequence #3: Politically Correct Philosophy is Ineffective as Social Justice
Similarly, from a social justice perspective, if a philosopher's goal is to promote social justice, the constraints of truth-seeking can hinder this goal. The author suggests that social justice activism might be better achieved outside the confines of traditional philosophy.The document continues to defend the epistemic integrity of truth-seeking philosophy by considering various objections, including contextual empiricism, which claims that values conducive to social justice are necessary for truth-conducive rational inquiry. These ideas, forwarded by feminist philosophers such as Sandra Harding and Helen Longino, claim that the social identities of scientists and the contexts of knowledge are important constituents of scientific inquiry and are crucial to achieving strong objectivity and true understanding. The author challenges these claims, suggesting that they do not sufficiently demonstrate the compatibility of truth-seeking and social justice promoting philosophy.1 / 1The general picture exposed by Longinoâs contextual empiricism is this; empirical data is 
underwhelming. Empirical adequacy simpliciter does not exist. The evidential relations that ground 
empirical adequacy, having as relata part of the world (states of affairs, facts, events, etc.) on one side 
and constructs (hypotheses, statements, sentences, etc.) on the other, are i xed by a class of mental 
events. It is the mind of the scientist, through his background beliefs, which prepares his attentive 
resources to judge parts of the data (and not others) as salient and which projects hypothetical causal 
structure among particular events as promising, thereby linking evidence from the world to construct. 
The truth of the statement âfis evidence forhâ must be relativized to the set of background beliefs of 
the reasoner in question, for it is the content of these mental states which enable evidential reasoning, 
bridging an alleged âlogical gapâ between data and hypothesis. Longinoâs thesis diverges from 
famous theses associated with Kuhn, Duhem, and Feyerabend on the theory-ladenness of meaning 
and observation. There exists greater elbow room for objectivity in Longinoâs argument for âstates 
of affairs, hypothesis and background beliefs are independently specif i ableâ [160] (pp. 56â57). Also, 
background beliefs strike as being primarily pretheoretical, non-articulated by default. Background 
beliefs are posited to be a primary mechanism (though not the sole one) through which ideology may 
inf l uence scientif i c inquiry. 
I isolate two major claims of the program of contextual empiricism, one theoretical and the 
other, practical. Under the scheme I have presented, the theoretical claim is that it is impossible to 
employ âpureâ alethic epistemic values (âconstitutive valuesâ under Longinoâs terminology) to settle 
disputes on rival hypothesis, which carry within themselves different sets of background assumptions. 
Under my framework, the practical claim can be read this way; to optimize truth, reliance on certain 
40 Helen Longino used very similar words to summarize her most important work: âI argued in Science as Social Knowledge 
that social or non-cognitive values could and did serve as cognitive valuesâ [158] (p. 41). 
41 Placing this distinguished philosopher in the same cluster as postmodern feminist critics of science whose output is of 
limited quality is decidedly unfair. This general sentiment is also echoed, for instance, throughout essays in [159]. 
Philosophies 2017, 2, 1737 of 56 
contextual values is more eff i cient than reliance on alethic epistemic values. These include feminist 
contextual values 42. 
For what probably is her most famous example, consider explanations for the co-evolution of 
the hypertrophied neocortex and manual dexterity which are distinctive of our evolutionary lineage. 
Many dominant models still place significant emphasis on the selective pressures for tool manufacturing 
which would enable greater efficiency in the acquisition of animal protein by hunting bands of 
male hominids [161]. Under androcentric background assumptions, the alleles of âMan, the Hunterâ 
become privileged theoretical entities as the female side of evolution, that of âWoman, the Gathererâ, 
is overshadowed (for a historical overview, see [162]). Alternative empirically adequate models under 
different background assumptions may have been neglected and undervalued due to implicit sexist 
attitudes. 
Consider now an analogous example in psychology. In what is now a contemporary classic, 
psychologists Joseph Henrich, Steven J. Heine and Ara Norenzayan have argued that the status 
of uncountable results from the behavioral sciences, taken to be descriptive of the human species, 
may have been compromised [163]. This is because disproportionate amounts of cutting-edge research 
in the behavioral sciences employ what may be the worst data sets possible to construe inductive 
generalizations meant to be projectable to the whole of humanity. These data sets are populated 
with information extracted from what the authors have dubbed âWEIRDâ peopleâthat is: Western, 
Educated, Industrialized, Rich and Democratic. To put this in perspective, âa randomly selected American 
undergraduate is more than 4000 times more likely to be a research participant than is a randomly 
selected person from outside of the Westâ [163] (p. 63). 
Given these two examples in mind (and assuming they are correct), we may present the 
following case; wouldnât the presence of undeniably politically correct values of equality, diversity, 
representativeness, and inclusiveness (of women in the i rst case, of non-WEIRD people in the latter) 
make the research more truth-conducive? That certainly appears to be the case; in the context of the 
research programs implicated in these examples, these politically correct values are also, under my 
def i nition, alethic epistemic values. 
However, I claim that they are all dummy alethic epistemic values (Def i nition 5).That is, 
theoretically, they could all be replaced, without loss of aptitude, with alethic epistemic values such as 
statistical rigor and good old-fashioned empirical adequacy. Statistical rigor ensures that no sampling 
errors are perpetrated and that sound methodology in data gathering is enforced (for instance, in the 
design of stratif i ed sampling). These alethic epistemic values are preferable since they do not prompt 
spurious ideological content. 
In order not to merely beg the question, Iâll brief l y advance some of the arguments brought forth 
by philosopher of science StÃ©phanie Ruphy [164] in her defense of the ideal of what is commonly 
called âvalue-freeâ or âvalue-neutralâ scientif i c practice, taken to be the picture of scientif i c practice 
exempt from contextual or non-epistemic values.

First, background beliefs, even if largely pretheoretical, may be reconstrued and expressed as 
factual claims. For instance, the background beliefs that motivate androcentric paleoanthropology 
involve factual claims on the preeminence of selection processes in the evolutionary history of one 
of the sexes (and not the other). If evidential relations are contingent upon background beliefs and 
background beliefs, being bearers of contextual values, can only be criticized in the light of other 
contextual values, this appears to lead to a regress of background beliefs embodying contextual values 
42 Some of the feminist values or âfeminist theoretical virtuesâ Longino advances to guide scientif i c reasoning, such as 
old-fashioned empirical adequacy and theoretical novelty, are diff i cult to be framed as properly âfeministâ or even as 
related to social justice [158]. But criteria such as âapplicability to human needsâ as in preferring scientif i c knowledge that 
âimproves the material conditions of human lifeâ instead of mere science âfor knowledgeâs sakeâ and âdiffusion of powerâ, 
under which explanatory models that incorporate âdominant-subordinate relationshipsâ are to be deferred, decidedly strike 
us as politically correct values. 
Philosophies 2017, 2, 1738 of 56 
battling against each other, ad inf i nitum. Also, the program of contextual empiricism is itself deploying 
an empirical theory on the causal constituents of the cognitive processes involved in evidential 
reasoning and ultimately theory choice and thus, may be confronted with alternative accounts of these 
phenomena throughout the history of science. It also predicts rampant empirical underdetermination. 
As Ruphy argues in her analysis of key historical cases discussed by Longino, the settlement 
of seemingly empirically equivalent rival theories sporting different background assumptions and 
targeting the same data appear to be best explained as being eventually achieved when this equivalence 
becomes an inequality and that it is possible for evidential support, externally considered from the 
diverging sets of background assumptions, to point a favorite. It does not have to be unequivocal; 
if the settlement is secured by non-contextual criteria pointing to a direction, this shows that it is 
not impossible. 
For instance,since Longino authored her opus nearly three decades ago,genetic 
paleoanthropology has advanced dramatically. Strains of DNA from humans and extinct hominins 
with over a hundred thousand years of age have been extracted from bodily remains and researchers 
havedevisedstrictprotocolstoenabletheirgeneticsequencingwiththehighestf i delity[165]. Statistical 
methods designed to detect the presence of natural selection in genomic data are being continuously 
improved [166]. In the light of these technical accomplishments, the story of âMan, the Hunterâ against 
âWoman, the Gathererâ may no longer be a more hermeneutical exercise of âjust-so storiesâ over the 
deep history of piles of broken bones but a more precise direction course can be ascertained. 
It can also be stated that contextual empiricism appears to render as vacuous distinctions between 
science and seemingly obvious pseudoscience. For instance, flat-earthers reject the phenomena of ships 
vanishing in the horizon (which may be as good as it gets as an example of an observation low in 
theoreticity) as evidence for the hypothesis of a round earth. Some flat earthers (for instance, [167]) 
have claimed that naked eye observations of such phenomena are nonveridical experiences, perceptual 
illusions which vanish by aiding the human eye with optical magnification (an ad hoc that can be readily 
falsified by experiment). Under contextual empiricism, both conceptions may be just as empirically 
adequate, relativized to their underlying assumptions. Following Ruphy, I take it to be implausible that 
the standard normative stance endorsed by practicing scientists is creating a delusion by positing a vast 
asymmetry on the empirical adequacy of these hypotheses. 
Also, even in cases of full-blown empirical underdetermination, there also appears to be no 
theoretical or practical impossibility for the employment of other âconstitutiveâ alethic epistemic 
values, such as ontological simplicity. Finally, the underlying claim that there cannot be a âvalue-freeâ 
formalization of the relation of evidential relevance singling out the appropriate reference classes for 
the explanandum of a theory can be disputed (for instance, [69] (p. 77)). 
If the replacement of inadequate background assumptions for better ones is better explained by 
old-fashioned, âcontextual value-freeâ standards of empirical success, then the very case of feminist 
criticism of androcentric ideology across the sciences becomes more robust. It would stand not as a ploy 
involving arbitrary political victories of background assumptions from one ideology to another, but as 
the replacement of constructs less conducive for truth for others more conducive for truth screened 
out under standards of objectivity. The vibrant panorama issued by Helen Longino where scientif i c 
knowledge achieves higher degrees of objectivity as an effect of the distributed social cognition enacted 
in communities of scientists with a culture of internal criticism where background beliefs are put into 
question may remain intact. As for the practical or pragmatic claim that locally, there may be contextual 
values carrying the status of dummy alethic epistemic values which are indeed more eff i cient than 
pure alethic epistemic values at attaining the epistemic goal of truth, I will have something to say on 
the matter in both the next subsection and in Section 7.3.1 / 1ChatGPTChatGPTThis comprehensive discussion presents a deep exploration of Helen Longinoâs contextual empiricism, arguing that empirical data and its adequacy are inherently linked to a scientist's background beliefs and mental events. This line of thinking diverges from the works of Kuhn, Duhem, and Feyerabend on the theory-ladenness of meaning and observation.The author acknowledges two major claims of contextual empiricism: a theoretical claim that suggests the impossibility of employing âpureâ alethic epistemic values to settle disputes on rival hypotheses, and a practical claim arguing for the optimization of truth via reliance on contextual values, such as feminist values, rather than pure alethic values.Several examples are provided, such as co-evolution studies and psychological research bias, to argue that politically correct values of equality, diversity, and inclusiveness could, in certain research contexts, make the research more truth-conducive.However, the author counter-argues that these values could theoretically be replaced by traditional alethic epistemic values, like statistical rigor and empirical adequacy, without loss of efficacy. Here, philosopher StÃ©phanie Ruphy's arguments are brought up to defend the ideal of value-free scientific practice. Ruphy argues that such practices, free from non-epistemic values, are more effective in settling seemingly equivalent rival theories and avoiding potential pitfalls such as endless regress of background beliefs and empirical underdetermination.The author also presents an argument that contextual empiricism could blur the lines between science and pseudoscience, which he sees as problematic. Finally, he suggests that even in cases of full-blown empirical underdetermination, there are possibilities to employ other alethic epistemic values, such as ontological simplicity.The author ends by suggesting that a more robust way to improve science might be to replace less adequate background assumptions with better ones, using old-fashioned standards of empirical success. In such a view, the role of ideology becomes less about arbitrary political victories and more about enhancing the pursuit of truth under the standards of objectivity. Nevertheless, the author acknowledges the possible efficiency of local contextual values over pure alethic values in achieving the truth, which he promises to discuss in later sections.1 / 16.2. The Objection from the âFeminine Voiceâ in Ethics 
Starting in the 1980s, researchers in moral philosophy and moral psychology have advanced another 
compelling case for the pervasive presence of epistemically detrimental ideological bias of a sexual nature 
in both contemporary moral philosophy and empirical accounts of moral development [168,169]. 
Just as in paleoanthropology, the general sentiment entertained by this researchers is that 
normative ethical theories have been misconstruing moral psychology by taking male human cognition 
as prototypical. Those marshaling an ethics of care grounded in a distinguishable âfeminine voiceâ in 
morality have claimed that academic normative ethics has been disproportionally oriented towards 
(so-called) masculine moral values and meta-values such as abstract rule-following, individualistic 
autonomy and rational disinterestedness at the expense, ignorance, and deprecation of (so-called) 
feminine values such as person-to-person interaction, social connectedness, and empathy. 
The clashes between a communitarian virtue ethics exposing the âfeminine voiceâ, where caring, 
needs and responsibilities are central and a âmasculineâ liberal deontological or consequentialist ethics 
grounded in justice, rights and duties range may appear hopeless at i rst sight, but possible routes for 
complementarity and synergy have been advanced [170]. 
From reasonable assumptions of the supervenience of moral action and judgment onto human 
social behavior and cognition, the possibility that the distinct contributions to moral reasoning by 
about half of the agents involved in these interactions have been neglected rises. And from this, a prima 
facie case for the conclusion that traditional moral theories exposed by professional philosophers can be 
signif i cantly defective emerges. More; it could allegedly show an actual nontrivial instance of truth and 
social justice going hand in hand. I shall construct such as argument, whose general form is potentially 
generalizable for other examples. 
From The Ethics Of Care To social justice 
P1 Normative ethics is a truth-seeking i eld of inquiry 
P2 The constructs devised by a truth-seeking i eld of inquiry ought to be truthful 
P3For (the constructs of) normative ethics to be truthful, it ought to be sensitive to moral psychology 
P4 Moral psychology comprises feminine values 
C1 Therefore, to be truthful, normative ethics ought to be sensitive to feminine values 
P5For normative ethics to be sensitive to feminine values, it cannot over-privilege the role of 
masculine values in moral psychology 
P6 Normative ethics over-privileges the role of masculine values in moral psychology 
C2 Therefore, normative ethics is not truthful 
P7For a given i eld of inquiry, an alethic epistemic value is a value that increases the truthfulness of 
their constructs 
P8 Truth-seeking i elds of inquiry must endorse their respective epistemic values 
P9Sexual inclusiveness of women in normative ethics is a value that increases the sensitivity towards 
feminine values 
C3Therefore, for the i eld of inquiry of normative ethics, the sexual inclusiveness of women is 
an alethic epistemic value 
C4Therefore, the i eld of inquiry of normative ethics must endorse the value of sexual inclusiveness 
of women 
P10Sexual inclusiveness of women is also a politically correct value that enhances the goal of social 
justice 
C4 Therefore, normative ethics ought to adopt a value that enhances the goal social justice 
P11If a i eld of inquiry ought to adopt a value that enhances the goal of social justice, then it is 
compatible with social justice 
C5Therefore, normative ethics is a truth-seeking i eld of inquiry that is compatible with social justice 
Philosophies 2017, 2, 1740 of 56 
As it is, for this argument to work, it appears to assume the truth-aptitude of the constructs 
outputted by normative ethics (P1), which in turn may require metaethical commitments such as moral 
cognitivism. Let us grant this. 
First, I repeat the same strategy from the subsection above; I argue that in this case, the sexual 
inclusiveness of women is a dummy epistemic value. It is indirectly tracking the empirical adequacy and 
statistical rigor of the content of human moral psychology onto the content of normative ethics due to 
a sampling error. If moral philosophers were to diligently examine their biases and conclude that they 
are not feasible according to truths of human social cognition, there would be no need for the value of 
sexual inclusiveness. 
Second, the conclusion is too modest; compatibility of social justice with truth-seeking i elds 
of inquiry. This compatibility cannot easily be transformed in necessity. The adoption of a value 
that enhances social justice as a byproduct does not imply that social justice must be a conscious 
goal. The fact that philosophy may accidentally promote social justice is a trivial matter, already 
acknowledged previously.

Alas, we can be charitable and circumvent this reply with some additionally reasonable premises: 
P12For a truth-seeking i eld of inquiry, if the adoption of a dummy epistemic value tracking 
an epistemic value is more eff i cient for attaining truth than its avoidance, then the i eld of 
inquiry ought to adopt it 
P13The adoption of sexual inclusiveness of women in normative ethics is more eff i cient for attaining 
truth than its avoidance 
C5 Therefore, normative ethics ought to adopt a value that enhances social justice 
C6Therefore, normative ethics is a truth-seeking i eld of inquiry that requires the promotion of 
social justice 
Given the pessimistic picture I have issued with a model of epistemic appraisal, the pragmatic 
power of dummy epistemic values cannot be understated and now appears to bridge a strong 
connection between at least a major branch of philosophy with the ideal of social justice. However, 
I hold that this particular case is not compatible at all with social justice. For that, I shall phrase 
a counter-argument; for the sake of it, let us consider only endorsements of the value of sexual 
inclusiveness of women which are motivated by considerations stemming from the ethics of care: 
P11Iftheadoptionofavaluebyaf i eldofinquiryassumesthetruthofapoliticallyincorrecthypothesis, 
then the i eld of inquiry is incompatible with social justice 
P12 The adoption of a value by a i eld of inquiry ought to be rational 
P13The adoption of the value of sexual inclusiveness of women in normative ethics ought to comply 
with certain standards of rationality 
P14The adoption of the sexual inclusiveness of women in normative ethics implies acknowledging 
the truth of variation in the moral psychology of men and women 
P15 The variation in the moral psychology of men and women demands an explanation 
P16To rationally endorse a proposition which includes an explanandum requires the endorsement of 
the best explanans available 
P17The best explanation for the existing variation in the moral psychology of men and women implies 
the existence of signif i cant genetic causes 
C7Therefore, to rationally adopt the value the sexual inclusiveness of women in normative ethics is 
to acknowledge signif i cant genetic causes in the variation of moral psychology 
P15To rationally acknowledge the truth of an empirical hypothesis is to endorse the research methods 
that have led to this truth and their other truthful results 
P16The research methods that have led to the truth of the variation in the moral psychology of men 
and women have concluded that there are socially appraisable traits where men fare in average 
better than women due to signif i cant biological causes 
Philosophies 2017, 2, 1741 of 56 
P17To rationally adopt the value of sexual inclusiveness of women in normative ethics implies 
acknowledging that there are socially appraisable traits where men fare in average better than 
women due to signif i cant biological causes 
P18The hypothesis that there are socially valuable traits where men in average fare better than women 
due to signif i cant genetic causes is politically incorrect 
C8Therefore, the adoption of sexual inclusiveness of women in normative ethics (due to 
considerations stemming from the ethics of care) is incompatible with social justice 
The empirical evidence for the case that existing patterns of cognitive, affective and behavioral 
sexual dimorphism which are cross-culturally robust in humans are partly mediated by heredity is 
compelling (see for example [171â173]; for some social constructionist and environmentalist responses, 
see [174,175] (Chapter 9) and [176]. 
If the above argument is safe and sound, this means that the lessons from the ethics of care are not 
really socially progressive in the sense I have exposed. The acknowledgment of truths about human 
sexual diversity rationally entails truths perceived to be politically incorrect. Theorist Nel Noddings 
places the epicenter of the ethics of care is instinctive maternal love which predates humanity, and that 
is shared with all mammals, linking evolutionary biology with normative ethics. 
This line of thought is not new. It, I argue, is what may be lying beneath criticisms of the ethics of 
care on the ground they expose âessentialist stereotypesâ of men and women, violating the general 
thesis of the social construction of sex and gender. 
One could also argue that this very ideal of a steadfast disinterested pursuit of truth just 
is more androcentric and sexist ideological introgression, the product of unfairly eulogizing and 
cultivating tendencies of the male psyche 43. If this is true, then science and philosophy guided 
by standards of objectivity can be accused by PC adherents of unfairly manifesting a âmasculine 
voiceâ. For instance, it has been argued that women who enter the scientif i c community need to adopt 
a âmasculine rationalityâ at either âconscious or subconscious levelâ and that âthe scientif i c method 
incorporates masculine features such as the objectif i cation of natureâ [177]. If this hypothesis in cognitive 
anthropology is correct, it will make standards of objectivity illegitimate; that would be a genetic 
fallacy. The fact that the etiology of alethic epistemic values could originally involve as precursors the 
interests and tendencies manifested in the minds of denizens of so-called oppressive groups does not 
imply that alternative modes of inquiry with equivalent epistemic prowess at extracting truths about 
the world built upon other cognitive tendencies and values are possible (as argued by postcolonial 
theorists and feminists who defend the possibility of âAfrocentricâ and âfeministâ sciences).
1 / 1ChatGPTChatGPTThe passage you provided seems to be exploring the biases in moral philosophy, specifically the perceived prioritization of masculine values at the expense of feminine values. Here, feminine values are characterized as those related to person-to-person interaction, social connectedness, and empathy, while masculine values are associated with abstract rule-following, individualistic autonomy, and rational disinterestedness. These biases, according to the researchers, have been influencing both empirical studies of moral development and academic normative ethics.The passage further argues that by integrating feminine values, normative ethics (which seeks to study and establish moral norms) could become more truthful as it would then be sensitive to a broader spectrum of human moral psychology.A counter-argument presented in the passage suggests that accepting sexual inclusiveness of women in normative ethics (based on the ethics of care) is incompatible with social justice because it would require acknowledging that there are biologically caused differences between men and women in their moral psychology. This is suggested to be politically incorrect, thus in opposition to social justice.Finally, the text questions whether the very ideal of objective truth-seeking is a masculine construct, suggesting that women who join scientific communities have to adopt this "masculine rationality". But, it also notes that dismissing objectivity because of its potential masculine origins would be committing a genetic fallacy - the assumption that something is wrong or right based on its source, not its merit. The origin of an idea does not determine its validity or truthfulness.1 / 16.3. The Objection from Political Philosophy 
An obvious observation appears to make the case of removing political values from philosophy 
strike as ludicrous. For political philosophy has been developed in both the East and the West since at 
least since the 6th century BCE by Confucius and Pythagoras and political philosophy is, presumably, 
a legitimate i eld of inquiry. Following this attitude, Mario Bunge goes as far as to claim that âthe very 
notion of an apolitical political philosophy is an oxymoronâ [11] (p. VIII). 
The problem with political philosophy is not political content per se but the a priori unwarranted 
presumption of degrees of truth and falsity for constructs motivated by a pre-established ideological 
core and the introduction of contextual values with spurious, non-truth-conducive, propensities. 
As philosopher Bas van der Vossen argues, âthe task of the political philosopher is to seek the truth 
about politicsâ, and empirical evidence supports the thesis that political activism may signif i cantly 
debilitate the tools of thinking of political philosophers through cognitive biases modulated by the 
worldview of the philosopher [178]. 
43 And of the psyches of potentially other oppressive groups, such as White people 
Philosophies 2017, 2, 1742 of 56 
Critics may object that while that may be reasonable for descriptive political theory, not so for 
normative political theory. And isnât the very same thing true for other normative i elds such as ethics 
or epistemology? It appears to be the telos of any normative theory to carry built-in practical goals. 
For instance, standards of persuadabilityâgood normative theories must be cogent for a particular 
range of agents to be implementable. 
If this is true under the framework I have described, it means that we should expect normative 
theories to suffer from additional burdens in comparison to basic research. It is a testimony to how 
diff i cult these disciplines are. The intrusion of practical goals would make normative theories both 
less effective at attaining their goals and more susceptible to ideologies. This matter imposes upon us 
additional reasons of why we ought to be extra careful at evaluating political philosophy. If ideology 
is inescapable, then given the pervasiveness of cognitive bias, I contend that normative political 
philosophies as i elds of inquiry are at the imminent danger of becoming indistinguishable from political 
philosophies as political ideologies. It is no accident that terms such as âlibertarianismâ and âconservatismâ 
name both political ideologies and families of theories in political philosophy and political science. 
7. Epilogue: Make Philosophy Truthful Again 
We now enter a very perilous terrain: the domain of prescription under practical goals. For the 
sake of consistency with my project, this entails caution. 
It is an old sociological sleight of hand to claim that criticism of political ideology is itself politically 
ideological. It may be so; however, this is no defeater for this project. If basic i elds of inquiry cannot 
exist without underlying ideology, and always carry within themselves a residue of militancy and 
fanaticism, the best we can do is to make sure it this militancy and fanaticism are focused in the pursuit 
of truth. Let us use, when possible, our top-down cognitive processes to intelligently design and 
enforce self-corrective memetic mechanisms onto the philosophical Leitkultur. 
With truth unrestrained from biases, basic i elds of inquiry are bound to output many true 
statements that are contingently politically correct. However, the contingency that there could exist 
domains of rational inquiry in philosophy which are impervious to social justice is not worth the shot. 
By the standards of critical theoretical and postmodern philosophers and sociologists of knowledge 
who are trained to see the workings of oppressive ideology everywhere (and by everywhere, I mean even 
in chemical thermodynamics, i.e., [179]) there may exist no such academic âsafe spaceâ in communities 
nurturing the PC memeplex. 
7.1. A Call for Radical Separation 
For the truth-seeking partisan, the truth is too important to be compromised by petty ideology, be 
it of ârightâ, âcenterâ, âleftâ or any other dimensional axis. 
I call for a radical separation of not only social justice from philosophy but of any content motivated 
by social, political or religious ideology that consciously or unconsciously imposes constraints on the 
truth of statements as safeguards for their ideological cores. Following the very same prescription by 
Haidt [1], this can happen at the institutional level of universities, but one can imagine it happening at 
various other settings. Such segregation has already been willfully performed by believers of certain 
worldviews. For instance, those adhering to the worldview of Biblical literalism have devised their 
very own peer-review journals which are explicit in their ideological commitments. All the editors 
of the Journal of Creation 44 publicly adhere to a statement of faith which include the religious belief 
that the i rst chapters of the Book of Genesis are literally true. One can imagine similar journals being 
formed under the allegiance of core tenets of PC (or even existing ideologically committed journals 
becoming more transparent in their pre-existing and non-negotiable ideological commitments).

The conf l ict I have depicted is not a clash between a âcoldâ disembodied reason against âwarmâ 
bodily feeling; its values all the way down. Itâs a war where I hope values which are conducive for 
objectivity in the quest for truth will overthrow values which are not. 
If it is true that PC has wrecked the epistemic integrity and quality of academic philosophy, 
how may we reverse the damage that has already been done? I have thus chosen three values which 
I stipulate could help attain this goal. The i rst needs to be embodied in philosophical theory and 
practice, the second at the institutional level and the third, onto the characters of philosophers. 
7.2. The Alethic Epistemic Value of Empirical Adequacy 
PC exists in between a mismatch at how the world is and how many would want the world to 
be. The coalescence of social constructionism, critical theory and postmodernism may have given 
to many the appearance that social phenomena are indef i nitely malleable by good will and social 
engineering, erecting a misleading folk anthropology in the process, particularly when it comes to 
the truths of human biological diversity. I thus claim that the key is securing the empirical adequacy of 
our representations. 
If metaphysical naturalism is true, the groundwork of reality does not care about our personal 
feelings and sensibilities. Only local aspects of reality, like us, do. Reality is notâand never will 
beâa âsafe space.â. Reality, in all its exuberance and diversity, is big enough to supply us with endless 
permutations of unwelcome facts. There are plenty of actual and potential empirical truths ready to 
offend denizens of the entire political spectrum, not just âleft-wingersâ. There are conservatives who 
are appalled at the thought of having nonhuman ancestors or of homosexuality having hereditary 
components. Libertarians who reject by i at empirical results on the constraints of human rationality 
and aspects of human nature which point towards social dependency and collectivism also exist. 
Even the few monarchists lurking around may be reticent to be informed on the historical record of 
tyrannical royal dynasties or the phenomenon of regression to the mean which makes wise kings father 
rather underwhelming princes. 
How may one strive for greater empirical adequacy in factual domains reeking of ideology 
and minimize the moralistic fallacy, the inference from moral reprobation to factual falsity? I second 
a Bayesian methodological recommendation45issued by a recent (and very politically incorrect) paper 
by evolutionary psychologists Bo Winegard, Benjamin Winegard and Brian Boutwell [180]. Although 
the stipulated approach is advised by the authors for behavioral scientists dealing with inquiries 
on etiologies in the nature-nurture debate, the general strategy could be applied to any problem in 
philosophy that potentially carries politically incorrect empirical content. Here is how it goes; if a given 
topic or research i eld has been ideologically compromised (such as the ontology of a given social 
genus), it probably is the case that it has already accumulated too much conceptual rubble, such as 
unwarranted inferences and biases of all kinds. The cognitive effort at separating the men from the 
boys may not be worth it from a cost-effective analysis. Instead, let us start from a slate as clean as 
possible by assuming a situation of complete ignorance and positing equal priors for the contending 
constructs. Then, piecemeal-wise, proceed by deploying argument after argument and after each 
evaluation of the evidence, adjust the priors accordingly. Record the accumulated inferential history so 
that it can be replicated by other researchers. 
Naturally, this is much better said than done. Such an approach is bound to have more success 
given the appropriate social setting, which brings us to our next value. 
7.3. The Dummy Alethic Epistemic Value of Political Diversity 
The greatest threat of existing âecho chambersâ across higher education may be the construction 
and maintenance of institutionalized disconf i rmation: nurturing academic settings where it is expected 
45 Winegard et al. in turn are mentioning the approach originally described in [181]. 
Philosophies 2017, 2, 1744 of 56 
that your axiological and theoretical unequals will challenge your most treasured propositions [40]. 
Such scenario has the effect of suppressing conf i rmation bias and potentially disrupting epistemically 
illegitimate consensus. Concerning a PC âecho chamberâ, a way this can be built is by enhancing 
the political diversity of the community towards the âright-wingâ end of the spectrum. Diversity, so 
much hailed with PC adherents, does not apply to political belief for many political beliefs are seen, 
according to my analysis, as the breeding grounds of social injustice. 
Political diversity is hereby posited to be a dummy epistemic value.It just is a proxy for 
what ultimately matters, epistemicallyâstatistical rigor, explanatory power, empirical adequacy, 
and so on. It may be, however, of enormous pragmatic value and the most effective way to build 
institutionalized disconf i rmation. 
How may professional philosophy come to honor this value? A strangely ironic political dilemma 
emerges; translated into policy, does this mean aff i rmative action quotas for non-PC philosophers? 
Even if institutionalized disconf i rmation could be achieved under a relatively low threshold of 
non-left wing philosophers, this proposal is bound to elicit discomfort for conservative and libertarian 
philosophers who are strongly opposed to aff i rmative action as a matter of ethical principle. 
This prescription is congruent with Helen Longinoâs [158] picture of optimized scientif i c 
engagement grounded on âcritical interactions among scientists of different points of viewâ. If this is 
the most effective way to attain objectivity, so be it.1 / 1ChatGPTChatGPT7.4. The Ethotic Epistemic Value of Intellectual CourageIntellectual courage, defined as the willingness to challenge, confront, or endure threats, embarrassment, or retaliation in the quest for truth, is a virtue that is often neglected in the context of political correctness (PC) in philosophy. This is due, in part, to the concern that ideas and arguments that are potentially politically incorrect may be met with backlash, condemnation, or even professional consequences.However, the value of intellectual courage in philosophy and other academic disciplines cannot be overstated. It plays a crucial role in the advancement of knowledge and understanding by promoting open dialogue and rigorous debate, even on contentious or sensitive issues. Moreover, it counters the influence of ideological conformity and groupthink, which can inhibit critical thinking and suppress dissenting views.In a culture dominated by political correctness, exhibiting intellectual courage can be particularly challenging. It requires not only a willingness to question prevailing assumptions and orthodoxies, but also a readiness to defend one's ideas against criticism, misrepresentation, or attempts to silence or marginalize them.While there are certainly risks involved in exercising intellectual courage, these are offset by the potential benefits. For instance, challenging dominant narratives and paradigms can lead to new insights and perspectives, spur intellectual growth and progress, and contribute to a more nuanced and accurate understanding of complex issues.To encourage intellectual courage, it is crucial to cultivate an environment in which diverse viewpoints are not only tolerated, but actively sought and engaged with. This includes ensuring academic freedom, protecting freedom of speech, and promoting constructive dialogue and debate.In conclusion, the promotion of truth in philosophy should not be compromised by political ideology or political correctness. Instead, philosophy should uphold the values of empirical adequacy, political diversity, and intellectual courage, with the ultimate aim of seeking and advancing knowledge and understanding. In doing so, philosophy can fulfill its mission of exploring fundamental questions about existence, reality, and the nature of human experience, while remaining committed to the pursuit of truth.1 / 1But how well does this translate into philosophy?There are differences between science 
and philosophy which hint at institutionalized disconf i rmation being potentially less effective 
for philosophy. Institutionalized disconf i rmation requires nontrivial publicly shared evaluation 
standards which may not exist across different philosophical traditions. For instance, inside the 
analytic tradition of philosophy, a Thomist metaphysician may staunchly disagree with a scientistic 
metaphysician concerning the epistemic authority of pre-theoretical intuitions and the boundaries 
of a priori knowledge, which in my model translates into different rankings by both parties on the 
importance of alethic epistemic values such as intuitiveness and self-evidentiality. An optimistic 
answer to this is that successive critical metaphilosophical engagement between different philosophical 
traditions may result in greater epistemic commensurability over time. A pessimistic answer is that if 
the epistemic i eld of philosophy is bound to be an aggregation of robustly self-encapsulated subf i elds, 
the phenomenon of institutionalized disconf i rmation will only be local. 
7.4. The Virtue of Moral Courage 
Contemporary ethicists make a distinction between physical courage and moral courage. Physical 
courage, or valor, is the virtue to thwart fear from preventing one to do what is right, at the risk of 
having his bodily integrity harmed- the cutting of l esh, breaking of bones and spilling of blood up to 
complete physical annihilation. Moral courage, in turn, is the virtue to thwart fear from preventing one 
to do what is right, at the risk of having your social integrity harmed- the loss of friends, the ruin of 
professional careers and the damaging of reputation up to complete social annihilation [182]. 
Up until recent history [183] (p. 90), there was no sharp bifurcation between valor and moral 
courage. Ancient philosophers simply called it âcourage.â For to rise against established despotic 
authority was the same thing as jeopardizing his bodily integrity, putting your own life at stake 46. 
In todayâs world, I speculate that the current political homogeneity in Western academia 
has stimulated an increase of moral cowardice among philosophers that do not align politically 
with the current left-wing trend. In particular, those who are at the beginning of their careers. 
It is understandable; many young philosophers, often struggling economically, face a very hard 
46 Not many centuries ago throughout Medieval and Modern Era Europe, this could have been a literal stake depending on 
which heretical thoughts you uttered. 
Philosophies 2017, 2, 1745 of 56 
multicriteria decision-making problem, one in which the virtue of prudence emerges as a heuristic to 
stump any dangerous desires and prevent the prospects of academic suicide. 
If this is true, one of the most tragic effects of this state of affairs could be the existence of 
an invisible but prevailing self-censorship. How many truth-seeking thoughts of prime epistemic quality 
in a myriad of important topics may not have been recorded and shared out of fear? This imposition 
of conceptual barriers over what can and what cannot be pursued by human intelligence may be 
crippling for philosophical creativity. 
Rome wasnât built in a day, nor was the enormous social infrastructure that supports PC. It took 
decades of cultural evolution (Postulate 2.1). Reversing this trend will require hard work. I i nish this 
paper with a call for the masses of disenfranchised philosophers to embrace this heroically. To provide 
a i tting end to my case, I have taken the poetic liberty to borrow some of the words as well as some of 
the spirit of a certain German philosopher who was particularly articulate 47. 
Think dangerously! Build your conferences at the plain sight of social justice warriors! 
Submit your truth-seeking politically incorrect papers into academic safe spaces! Live at an 
intellectual war with your academic peers and yourselves! Be brave and uncompromising 
free thinkers for as long as the PC thought police subsists, you seekers of true knowledge!1 / 1The previous model used in this conversation is unavailable. We've switched you to the latest default model.ChatGPTChatGPTWhile there are indeed challenges and differences between science and philosophy when it comes to implementing institutionalized disconfirmation and promoting intellectual courage, it does not mean that these values are ineffective or irrelevant in the philosophical context. The existence of diverse philosophical traditions and disagreements within philosophy itself should not discourage the pursuit of intellectual courage or the promotion of political diversity.Institutionalized disconfirmation may require ongoing critical engagement and dialogue among different philosophical traditions to foster greater epistemic commensurability over time. While it may not be a universal solution applicable to all philosophical subfields, it can still be valuable within specific areas of philosophy where different viewpoints can challenge prevailing assumptions and contribute to the pursuit of truth.Similarly, while moral courage may face unique challenges in the academic setting, it remains an essential virtue for philosophers. The existence of self-censorship and fear of backlash should not deter philosophers from pursuing truth and engaging in intellectually rigorous discussions. By embracing intellectual bravery and promoting open dialogue, philosophers can contribute to a more vibrant and intellectually honest philosophical community.It is important to remember that promoting truth in philosophy is not about endorsing any specific political ideology or seeking confrontation for its own sake. Rather, it is about upholding the values of intellectual integrity, open-mindedness, and a commitment to rigorous reasoning and evidence. By cultivating these virtues and encouraging diverse perspectives, philosophy can fulfill its role as a discipline dedicated to the pursuit of knowledge and understanding.1 / 1A summary of the whole article1 / 1ChatGPTChatGPTThe article titled "Political Correctness and the Epistemic Integrity of Philosophy" addresses the impact of political correctness (PC) on the field of philosophy and argues for the need to prioritize truth-seeking and epistemic integrity in philosophical inquiry. The author presents several objections to the influence of PC in philosophy and proposes values that can help restore the discipline's commitment to truth.The article begins by discussing the origins and nature of political correctness, highlighting its influence on academia and philosophy. It argues that PC has led to a narrowing of intellectual discourse, stifling dissenting opinions and promoting ideological conformity.The author presents three main objections to the influence of PC in philosophy. First, they argue that PC undermines the pursuit of truth by privileging political values over empirical adequacy and distorting the evaluation of philosophical constructs. Second, they claim that the imposition of PC values leads to an imbalance in the consideration of feminine values in ethics, potentially neglecting important aspects of moral psychology. Third, they assert that PC in political philosophy hampers the objectivity and effectiveness of normative theories by introducing ideological biases.To counter these challenges, the author proposes three values that can help restore the epistemic integrity of philosophy. Firstly, they emphasize the importance of empirical adequacy in philosophical inquiry, calling for a focus on evidence-based reasoning and the avoidance of unwarranted ideological assumptions. Secondly, they advocate for political diversity within the philosophical community as a means to foster institutionalized disconfirmation and challenge prevailing biases. Lastly, they highlight the virtue of moral courage, urging philosophers to overcome self-censorship and engage in courageous and independent thinking.The author acknowledges that implementing these values may face practical challenges, such as differences between philosophical traditions and the prevalence of self-censorship. However, they argue that the pursuit of truth and the promotion of intellectual integrity are essential for philosophy's role in advancing knowledge and understanding.In summary, the article calls for a reevaluation of the influence of political correctness in philosophy and argues for the prioritization of truth-seeking, empirical adequacy, political diversity, and moral courage in philosophical inquiry. By embracing these values, the author contends that philosophy can regain its epistemic integrity and contribute meaningfully to the pursuit of knowledge.1 / 1There was something really unappealing about the article. It seemed to use logic but I felt like it was confusing and distracting1 / 1ChatGPTChatGPTI apologize if the article seemed confusing or distracting. It is possible that the author's writing style or the complexity of the arguments presented made it difficult to follow or engage with the content. Philosophical articles can often involve dense reasoning and intricate discussions, which may not appeal to everyone.If you have any specific questions or concerns about the article or if there's anything specific you would like to discuss or clarify, I'm here to help.1 / 1Yes does it make any sense?1 / 1ChatGPTChatGPTThe article presents a critique of the influence of political correctness (PC) on academic philosophy and argues for the need to prioritize truth-seeking and objectivity in philosophical inquiry. The author raises concerns about the potential biases and ideological influences that can hinder the pursuit of truth in various fields of philosophy, including ethics, epistemology, and political philosophy.The article uses logical arguments to support its claims, highlighting the potential epistemic limitations of ideologies, the importance of empirical adequacy, the value of political diversity for institutionalized disconfirmation, and the virtue of moral courage in challenging prevailing ideologies. It also suggests the need for a separation between social justice and philosophy to ensure a focus on objective truth.While the article attempts to make a case for the importance of truth-seeking in philosophy, its style and the complexity of the arguments may make it challenging to fully grasp or find appealing. The author's views on political correctness and its impact on philosophy may also influence how readers perceive the article.Ultimately, whether the article makes sense or not is subjective and dependent on individual perspectives and prior beliefs. It's important to critically engage with the content, consider alternative viewpoints, and evaluate the arguments presented based on one's own understanding and reasoning.1 / 1Can you simplify the arguments?1 / 1ChatGPTChatGPTCertainly! Here's a simplified summary of the main arguments presented in the article:Problem of Biases: The author argues that political correctness (PC) can introduce biases and ideological influences into academic philosophy, compromising the pursuit of truth.Ethics and Feminine Voice: The article discusses how some argue that normative ethics has been skewed towards masculine values, neglecting feminine values such as empathy and social connectedness. It suggests that normative ethics should be more inclusive of feminine values for truthfulness.Political Philosophy: The article highlights the potential problems of political ideology in philosophy, emphasizing the need for objective evaluation and the detrimental effects of biases on philosophical thinking.Epistemic Values: The article suggests the adoption of epistemic values that prioritize empirical adequacy and the consideration of alternative viewpoints, rather than being driven solely by ideology.Institutionalized Disconfirmation: The article proposes the value of political diversity within academic settings to encourage critical engagement and challenge prevailing ideologies, promoting a more objective approach to philosophical inquiry.Moral Courage: The author argues that moral courage is needed to overcome self-censorship and fear of backlash in expressing politically incorrect ideas, as it can hinder philosophical creativity and the pursuit of truth.Call for Change: The article calls for a separation between social justice and philosophy, advocating for a focus on truth-seeking, empirical adequacy, and objective evaluation in philosophical inquiry.Please note that this simplified summary may not capture all the nuances and details of the original article, but it provides a general overview of the main arguments.1 / 1Ok so here are some of my problems: empathy and social connectedness are not feminine values, holding back controversial ideas might be to establish more context and furtger development, or might make room for less controversial ideas to be discussed, and how can social justice be seperated from philosophy, when the goal of philosophy is to determine the questions to be asked, find out how we know things, be therapy for intellectual traps in mental pictures, and to show the fly out of the flybottle?1 / 1ChatGPTChatGPTI understand your concerns and points of disagreement with the article. Let's address each of them:Feminine Values: The article suggests that some proponents argue that empathy and social connectedness are associated with feminine values. However, it's important to note that these values are not exclusive to any gender and can be embraced by individuals of all genders. The article's use of "feminine values" is a generalization based on certain stereotypes, which may not accurately reflect the diversity of values held by individuals.Holding Back Controversial Ideas: While some argue that holding back controversial ideas can provide context or allow for further development, the article suggests that self-censorship due to fear of backlash can hinder philosophical creativity and the pursuit of truth. It emphasizes the importance of moral courage in expressing ideas that may challenge prevailing ideologies or face criticism, as long as they contribute to the pursuit of truth and are grounded in rigorous argumentation.Separating Social Justice from Philosophy: The article proposes a separation of social justice from philosophy in the sense that philosophical inquiry should prioritize objective evaluation, empirical adequacy, and truth-seeking, rather than being driven primarily by ideological considerations. This does not mean that philosophy ignores social justice or ethical concerns, but rather seeks to approach them in a way that is grounded in rational inquiry, critical thinking, and evidence-based reasoning. Philosophy can still address questions related to social justice but should strive for intellectual rigor and avoid the undue influence of ideological biases.It's important to remember that the arguments presented in the article are one perspective on these issues and may not align with everyone's views. Philosophy is a diverse field with a range of perspectives, and critical engagement and open dialogue can help foster a better understanding of these complex topics.1 / 1Yeah the authors should simplify their arguments and not obfuscate them with so much jargon1 / 1ChatGPTChatGPTI understand your frustration with the use of jargon and complex language in academic writing. Clear and accessible communication is important for effective understanding and engagement with ideas. Simplifying arguments and using plain language can help make complex concepts more accessible to a wider audience.Authors should strive to present their arguments in a way that is understandable to readers who may not have a deep background in the subject matter. This can involve avoiding unnecessary jargon, defining technical terms, providing clear explanations, and using relatable examples to illustrate complex ideas. By doing so, authors can make their arguments more approachable and increase the likelihood of engaging a broader range of readers.1 / 1Write an article arguing the opposite1 / 1ChatGPTChatGPTTitle: Embracing Complexity: The Value of Academic Jargon in Scholarly DiscourseIntroduction:
In academic circles, the use of specialized terminology and complex language is often criticized for being exclusionary and obfuscating the true meaning of ideas. However, in this article, we argue that academic jargon plays a crucial role in scholarly discourse and should be embraced rather than dismissed. While there is certainly a need for clear and accessible communication, the complexity of ideas in many disciplines necessitates the use of specialized language to accurately convey nuanced concepts. We will explore the benefits of academic jargon and demonstrate how it facilitates rigorous intellectual exploration.Precision and Nuance:
One of the primary advantages of academic jargon is its ability to capture precise meanings and nuances that may not be easily expressed in everyday language. By using discipline-specific terminology, scholars can communicate complex ideas more efficiently and with greater accuracy. Jargon serves as a shorthand, conveying a wealth of information in a concise manner. It allows for a more nuanced discussion of intricate concepts, enabling scholars to engage in sophisticated analysis and debate.Intellectual Tradition and Continuity:
Academic jargon also serves an important role in maintaining continuity within intellectual traditions. Each discipline has its own unique language that has evolved over time to capture and convey specific concepts and theories. By using established terminology, scholars can reference and build upon the work of their predecessors, ensuring the advancement of knowledge within a field. Academic jargon provides a shared vocabulary that fosters intellectual dialogue and allows for cumulative progress.Conceptual Clarity and Rigor:
Contrary to the common perception that jargon complicates understanding, it can actually enhance conceptual clarity and precision. The use of technical terms allows scholars to define and refine their ideas in a more specific and nuanced manner. Jargon enables rigorous analysis by providing a framework for precise reasoning and argumentation. It enables scholars to communicate complex theories, models, and methodologies accurately, fostering a deeper understanding among experts in the field.Efficient Communication within Specialized Communities:
Academic jargon facilitates efficient communication within specialized communities. Disciplines often develop their own terminologies to address specific phenomena, theories, or methodologies. This shared language allows scholars to communicate complex ideas quickly and effectively within their respective fields. It serves as a code that enables rapid comprehension and promotes interdisciplinary collaboration.Conclusion:
While it is essential to strike a balance between accessibility and rigor in academic writing, the dismissal of academic jargon undermines the complexity and precision required in scholarly discourse. Rather than rejecting jargon outright, we should recognize its role in advancing knowledge and fostering intellectual growth. By embracing the benefits of academic jargon, we can celebrate the diversity and richness of ideas across disciplines and engage in deeper, more nuanced conversations. Ultimately, academic jargon enhances the intellectual rigor, clarity, and efficiency of scholarly communication.1 / 1Ok an article claiming that philosophers have always been social justice warriors.1 / 1ChatGPTChatGPTTitle: The Inherent Activism of Philosophy: Philosophers as Social Justice WarriorsIntroduction:
Philosophy, as a discipline, has a long history of engaging with social and political issues, making philosophers natural advocates for social justice. Contrary to the perception of philosophy as a detached and abstract pursuit, this article argues that philosophers have always been social justice warriors. By examining the contributions of prominent philosophers throughout history, we will demonstrate how their ideas and actions have shaped and influenced social progress.The Quest for a Just Society:
At its core, philosophy is concerned with questions of morality, justice, and the nature of the good life. Philosophers have consistently grappled with these fundamental questions and actively sought to address societal injustices. Thinkers such as Plato, Aristotle, and Confucius explored the ideal forms of governance, emphasizing the importance of fairness and equality. Their ideas have influenced political movements and shaped the development of democratic societies.Challenging Oppressive Systems:
Philosophers throughout history have often challenged oppressive systems and advocated for the rights of marginalized groups. Enlightenment philosophers like John Locke and Jean-Jacques Rousseau promoted the concepts of natural rights and social contract theory, laying the foundation for the modern understanding of human rights. Immanuel Kant's moral philosophy emphasized the inherent dignity and equality of all individuals, inspiring movements for abolitionism, women's suffrage, and civil rights.Critical Examination of Power Structures:
Philosophy encourages critical thinking and questioning of existing power structures. Philosophers like Karl Marx and Friedrich Engels analyzed the social and economic inequalities inherent in capitalism, advocating for a more equitable society. Their ideas have influenced movements for workers' rights and social justice across the globe. Additionally, feminist philosophers such as Simone de Beauvoir and Judith Butler have challenged traditional gender norms, contributing to the advancement of gender equality.Engaging with Ethical Dilemmas:
Ethics, a central branch of philosophy, requires philosophers to grapple with complex ethical dilemmas and consider the impact of their actions on society. Many philosophers have actively participated in public debates, advocating for social justice causes. Peter Singer's work on animal rights and effective altruism, for example, has inspired individuals to make ethical choices that promote social and environmental well-being.Conclusion:
Philosophy has always been intertwined with social justice, as philosophers have sought to understand and improve the human condition. From ancient thinkers to contemporary scholars, philosophers have actively engaged in advocating for a more just society. Their ideas and actions have challenged oppressive systems, advanced human rights, and shaped the course of history. Rather than being detached from real-world issues, philosophers have been and continue to be social justice warriors, driving positive change through their intellectual contributions. It is through their critical examination of society, ethical considerations, and pursuit of justice that philosophers fulfill their role as agents of social transformation.1 / 1Do you think there really is a PC bias in philosophy?1 / 1ChatGPTChatGPTAs an AI language model, I don't have personal opinions or beliefs. However, I can provide some analysis on the topic. The question of whether there is a political correctness (PC) bias in philosophy is a matter of ongoing debate within the philosophical community.There are differing views on this issue. Some argue that there is a prevailing PC bias in philosophy, suggesting that certain topics or perspectives are marginalized or dismissed due to their deviation from mainstream social and political norms. This bias, according to proponents, can limit the diversity of ideas and hinder open inquiry within the field.On the other hand, critics of the notion of PC bias in philosophy contend that it may be an overgeneralization or exaggeration. They argue that philosophy, as an academic discipline, encourages critical thinking, rigorous analysis, and the examination of a wide range of perspectives. They assert that the pursuit of truth and the evaluation of ideas based on their merits are fundamental to philosophy, making any alleged bias unlikely or overstated.It is worth noting that the philosophical community, like any intellectual community, is composed of individuals with diverse perspectives and approaches. While there may be instances where certain ideas or viewpoints are more prevalent, it is crucial to engage in respectful and open dialogue to foster an inclusive and intellectually stimulating environment.Overall, the question of whether there is a PC bias in philosophy remains a subject of ongoing discussion, with different philosophers holding different opinions on the matter.1 / 1A summary2 / 2ChatGPTChatGPTThe presence of a political correctness (PC) bias in philosophy is a topic of debate within the philosophical community.
