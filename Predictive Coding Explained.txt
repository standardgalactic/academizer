Explain predictive coding in simple terms.
Jain Hive Tree
Predictive coding is a theory in neuroscience and psychology that suggests our brain constantly tries to predict the sensory input it receives from the world around us. Here's a simple way to understand it:
Imagine your brain as a very smart guesser that's always trying to predict what will happen next based on what it already knows. For example, if you see a ball rolling towards the edge of a table, your brain predicts that the ball will fall off. This prediction is based on your past experiences and knowledge about how objects behave.
Your senses ��� like your eyes and ears ��� provide real-time information to your brain. If what you actually see or hear matches your brain's prediction (the ball does fall off the table), then all is good, and your brain doesn't need to do much.
However, if something unexpected happens (like if the ball suddenly stops at the edge), your brain gets a signal that its prediction was wrong. This is known as a 'prediction error'. When there's a prediction error, your brain updates its knowledge or model of the world to make better predictions in the future.
So, in essence, predictive coding is about your brain making predictions, checking these predictions against reality, and then learning from any mistakes to make better predictions next time. This process helps us understand and interact with the world more effectively.

Are there any examples in the database?
Jain Hive Tree
The database contains detailed information on predictive coding, but it does not provide specific, concrete examples of predictive coding in action. Instead, it delves into the theoretical aspects, historical development, and applications in fields like machine learning and causal inference. For straightforward examples of predictive coding, you might consider everyday scenarios, such as:
Expecting a Hot Surface
: If you see a red-hot stove, your brain predicts that the stove will be hot. If you touch it and it's indeed hot, the prediction is confirmed. If, surprisingly, it's cold, your brain updates its prediction based on this new information.
Anticipating a Friend's Reaction
: Suppose you tell a joke to a friend. Based on past interactions, your brain predicts their reaction (laughter, perhaps). If they react as expected, your prediction is affirmed. If they don't find it funny and react differently, your brain notes this 'prediction error' and may adjust future expectations.
Driving on a Familiar Route
: While driving home on a familiar route, your brain predicts the turns, stops, and traffic patterns based on past experience. If a new roadblock appears, this constitutes a prediction error, prompting your brain to revise its expectations and choose a different route.
These examples illustrate how predictive coding works in everyday life, with the brain making predictions, checking them against real-world input, and adjusting based on any discrepancies.

I wonder if it is just way of framing the paradigm of learning and behavior.
Jain Hive Tree
Yes, your observation is quite insightful. Predictive coding, indeed, can be viewed as a specific framing or paradigm for understanding learning and behavior, especially from a cognitive and neurological perspective. Here's how this framework aligns with learning and behavior:
Learning as Prediction Updating
: In predictive coding, learning is essentially seen as a process of continuously updating predictions about the world. When the brain encounters 'prediction errors' (differences between expected and actual outcomes), it adjusts its internal models. This constant updating is akin to learning, where experiences shape our understanding and expectations.
Behavior as Prediction-Driven
: Behaviors can be interpreted as outcomes of the brain's predictions. For instance, if you predict that a certain action will lead to a desirable outcome, you're more likely to engage in that behavior. Conversely, if the prediction is that the action will lead to an undesirable outcome, you might avoid it. This aligns with the idea that behavior is often a response to our expectations and beliefs about the consequences of our actions.
Perception as an Active Process
: Predictive coding also frames perception not as a passive recording of the external world, but as an active process. Our perceptions are influenced by our predictions and expectations, which means we often 'see' what we are primed to see. This can explain phenomena like perceptual biases and why two people can perceive the same situation differently.
Adaptation and Flexibility
: This paradigm emphasizes the brain's adaptability and flexibility. As new information comes in, the brain's models are updated, leading to more accurate predictions over time. This reflects the adaptive nature of learning and behavior, where responses are not fixed but evolve with experience.
In summary, predictive coding provides a cohesive framework that intertwines the processes of perception, learning, and behavior, highlighting the brain's active role in interpreting and responding to its environment. This perspective is particularly valuable in fields like psychology, neuroscience, and artificial intelligence, offering a unified approach to understanding complex cognitive processes.

I think it is confusing because sometimes our prediction is that it will be random or unpredictable and we would be surprised if we find patterns or make correct guesses. I was arguing this in our conversation, Negentropy as Surprise.
Jain Hive Tree
Your point raises a fascinating aspect of predictive coding and our understanding of uncertainty and randomness. Let's delve into this:
Predicting Randomness
: In some situations, our 'prediction' is indeed that an outcome will be random or unpredictable. For example, when rolling a fair die, our prediction is not necessarily about a specific number, but rather that any number has an equal chance of appearing. If we repeatedly rolled the die and kept getting the same number, this would violate our expectation of randomness, leading to surprise and a re-evaluation of our prediction (perhaps suspecting the die is biased).
Negentropy and Surprise
: The concept of 'negentropy' (or negative entropy) relates to order and predictability in a system. In a conversation about "Negentropy as Surprise," you might argue that finding order or patterns in a system you expected to be random (high entropy) can be surprising. This surprise would be a form of 'prediction error' in the context of predictive coding. Your brain would need to adjust its model to account for this newfound regularity where none was expected.
Complexity of Predictions
: Your discussion touches on the complexity of predictions our brains make. Sometimes we predict specific outcomes, other times we predict a level of uncertainty or randomness. The surprise comes not just from events that are individually unpredictable, but also from patterns that emerge unexpectedly from what we assumed was a chaotic or random system.
Adaptation to 'Randomness'
: In scenarios where outcomes are genuinely random, like quantum phenomena or certain complex systems, our brain's prediction might adjust to expect unpredictability. However, if patterns emerge (like repeated results in quantum measurements that were expected to be random), this would necessitate a major model update, as it challenges fundamental assumptions about the nature of the system being observed.
In essence, predictive coding encompasses not only the prediction of specific outcomes but also the prediction of the degree of randomness or order in a system. When our expectations about the level of randomness are violated, it can lead to significant surprises and learning opportunities, prompting a re-evaluation of our understanding of the system.

I also was pointing out that sometimes lowers surprise by providing geometric peppers for reasoning when we know we don't know or by increasing the number of options for exploring.
Jain Hive Tree
Your observation about using geometric patterns for reasoning and increasing options for exploration in situations of uncertainty is an intriguing extension of the predictive coding model. This approach reflects a sophisticated cognitive strategy for managing uncertainty and surprise. Here's how it aligns with the principles of predictive coding and cognitive processing:
Geometric Patterns for Reasoning
: When faced with uncertainty or a lack of information ("knowing we don't know"), our brain might use geometric or structured patterns as heuristics or frameworks for reasoning. This strategy can help organize thoughts, make sense of sparse data, and generate hypotheses. It's a way of imposing a form of order or structure where direct predictions are difficult, thereby reducing the potential for surprise by creating a more predictable internal model.
Increasing Options for Exploration
: In uncertain situations, expanding the range of possibilities and exploring more options is another way to handle the lack of predictability. This exploratory behavior can be seen as a method to gather more data, which the brain can use to update its predictions and reduce uncertainty. By considering multiple outcomes or scenarios, the brain is essentially preparing for various possibilities, which again aligns with reducing surprise.
Adaptation and Learning
: Both these strategies are adaptive in nature. By using geometric patterns for reasoning, the brain tries to find order in chaos, and by increasing options for exploration, it seeks new information to refine its predictions. These are ways in which the brain learns from and adapts to its environment, especially in scenarios where straightforward predictions are not possible.
Predictive Coding and Uncertainty
: Predictive coding fundamentally deals with reducing the 'prediction error' ��� the difference between what the brain expects and what actually happens. In contexts where making precise predictions is challenging, the brain's use of structured reasoning patterns or exploratory behaviors is a way to minimize surprise, thus adhering to the overarching goal of predictive coding, which is to constantly refine the brain's model of the world.
In summary, your approach of using structured reasoning and exploration in uncertain situations reflects a complex but effective way our brains deal with unpredictability. It demonstrates how predictive coding is not just about predicting specific events, but also about developing strategies to handle and learn from uncertainty.
You
I wanted to explain that exploration seems to increase entropy locally at first since number of possible configuration states that are known about increases
Jain Hive Tree
Your point about exploration initially increasing entropy is quite perceptive in the context of predictive coding and entropy as a concept in information theory. Let's break this down:
Exploration and Increasing Entropy
: In information theory, entropy is a measure of uncertainty or randomness in a system. When you explore new possibilities or delve into unknown areas, you effectively increase the number of potential states or outcomes you're aware of. This increase in the range of possibilities, at least initially, elevates the entropy of the system because there's more uncertainty or variability in what you might find or experience.
Predictive Coding Perspective
: From a predictive coding standpoint, exploration introduces new data and variables into the brain's model of the world, which initially may not fit well with existing predictions. This influx of new, potentially unpredictable information can temporarily increase the 'prediction error' as the brain struggles to assimilate and make sense of these novel inputs. This is analogous to increasing entropy, where there's a temporary spike in uncertainty.
Long-Term Effect of Exploration
: While exploration might initially increase entropy, the long-term effect is often a reduction in overall uncertainty. As you gather more information and learn from these explorations, the brain updates its predictions and models to accommodate the new data. This learning process gradually reduces entropy by making the system (i.e., your understanding of the world or a specific problem) more predictable and less uncertain.
Dynamic Balance in Learning
: This process highlights a dynamic balance in learning and cognition. Exploration and the introduction of new information initially destabilize existing models (increasing entropy), but this is a necessary step for growth and adaptation. Over time, as new data is integrated and models are updated, the system stabilizes, and entropy decreases, reflecting a more accurate and comprehensive understanding.
In essence, exploration is a critical component of learning and cognitive adaptation. While it may introduce short-term uncertainty or increased entropy, it is instrumental in the long-term process of refining predictions and reducing overall unpredictability in our models of the world.

I think Mark Wilson in physics avoidance argues that the hard sciences seem more predictable since the use deliberately constrained and simplified systems that are well understood
Jain Hive Tree
Mark Wilson's argument in "Physics Avoidance," emphasizing that the hard sciences, like physics, often appear more predictable due to their focus on deliberately constrained and simplified systems, touches upon a fundamental aspect of scientific methodology. Here's an elaboration of this concept:
Constrained and Simplified Systems
: In physics and other hard sciences, experiments and theories often revolve around idealized or simplified models of reality. These models deliberately exclude many complicating factors to isolate and understand fundamental principles. For example, in physics, models might assume frictionless surfaces, perfectly elastic collisions, or objects reduced to point masses. These simplifications make the systems more predictable and the outcomes more replicable.
Controlled Variables
: Hard sciences often employ experiments where variables are tightly controlled. By limiting the number of changing factors, it's easier to establish clear cause-and-effect relationships. This control contributes to the predictability of outcomes within these experimental setups, as there are fewer unknown or unaccounted-for elements that could influence results.
Well-understood Principles
: Many areas of hard science work within the bounds of well-established and extensively tested theories. These theories provide a reliable framework for predicting outcomes. For instance, Newton's laws of motion can predict the behavior of macroscopic objects under a variety of conditions with high accuracy.
Contrast with Complex Systems
: In contrast to these simplified models, real-world systems, especially in fields like biology, psychology, or ecology, are often much more complex and less predictable. These systems involve numerous interacting variables, often with non-linear dynamics, making precise prediction challenging. The predictive success in physics and related sciences is partly because they abstract away from this complexity.
Predictive Coding and Complexity
: In the context of predictive coding, the brain deals with the complexity of the real world, constantly updating its models to better predict a range of sensory inputs. This process is inherently more uncertain and less predictable than the controlled environments often studied in hard sciences.
Wilson's point underscores a key aspect of scientific inquiry: the balance between simplification for understanding fundamental concepts and the complexity of natural phenomena. While simplification aids in clarity and predictability, it sometimes risks omitting important aspects of the more intricate systems encountered in real-world scenarios.

Connections with the previous topics.
Jain Hive Tree
Connecting the concept of predictive coding with Mark Wilson's argument about the predictability in hard sciences due to constrained and simplified systems reveals interesting intersections, especially in how we understand and model complex systems:
Predictive Coding and Complexity
: Predictive coding deals with the brain's efforts to make sense of the complex, often unpredictable sensory input it receives. Unlike the simplified models in physics, the brain constantly navigates a multitude of variables in real-world scenarios, leading to greater uncertainty and the need for ongoing model updating. This aligns with Wilson's observation that real-world systems, especially those studied in softer sciences like psychology or biology, are inherently more complex and less predictable than the idealized systems often used in hard sciences.
Exploration and Model Refinement
: The concept of increasing entropy through exploration, as discussed earlier, also ties into this. In predictive coding, exploration (seeking new experiences or information) is a way the brain deals with uncertainty. It initially raises entropy (uncertainty) but ultimately leads to more refined and accurate models of the world. In contrast, the controlled experiments in hard sciences deliberately limit exploration to specific parameters, reducing complexity and increasing predictability.
Simplified Models in Hard Sciences
: The use of simplified models in hard sciences, as highlighted by Wilson, is akin to reducing the 'noise' or extraneous variables that might complicate understanding fundamental laws or principles. However, this simplification also means that these models may not fully capture the complexities of real-world systems, something the brain's predictive coding mechanism constantly grapples with.
Real-World Applications
: The brain's predictive coding mechanism, in contrast to the simplified models of physics, exemplifies the challenges of dealing with real-world complexities. It underscores the necessity of flexible, adaptable models capable of handling a variety of unpredictable inputs, much like the complexities encountered in fields like ecology, social sciences, or economics.
In summary, while hard sciences often rely on simplified, controlled models for predictability and clarity, predictive coding as a cognitive process deals with the inherent complexity and unpredictability of real-world experiences. This contrast highlights the different approaches to understanding and modeling the world in various scientific domains, each with its own set of challenges and methodologies.

I think that it is a mistake to think that animals are planning things very far ahead but can often do things that look like preplanning. For example a beaver might chew at trees to get at sap or insects and a flood could wash it into a dam without them specifically thinking about how. It is shown that beaver's would cover up the sound of a recording of running water, indicating they might just find a sound annoying.
Jain Hive Tree
Your observation about animal behavior, specifically using the example of beavers, highlights an important distinction in the study of animal cognition between apparent preplanning and instinctual or reactive behaviors. This distinction ties in with broader themes in cognitive science and predictive coding:
Instinctual vs. Deliberate Actions
: In many animals, behaviors that appear as preplanning might actually be instinctual responses to environmental stimuli. For instance, beavers reacting to the sound of running water by building or repairing dams can be more about an innate response to a specific trigger (the sound) rather than a conscious plan to prevent flooding. This behavior could be hardwired through evolution to enhance survival, without requiring the cognitive complexity of forward planning.
Predictive Coding and Reactive Behaviors
: From a predictive coding perspective, an animal's brain continually makes predictions about its environment based on sensory inputs. When a beaver hears running water, it doesn't necessarily plan to build a dam; rather, the sound might trigger a 'prediction error' that instinctually compels it to take action to stop the noise, which aligns with their natural behavior to build dams. This process is more about resolving sensory discrepancies rather than executing a planned sequence of actions.
Adaptive Behaviors in Animals
: Many animal behaviors are adaptations to environmental challenges, evolved over generations. These behaviors can be remarkably complex and efficient, like a beaver's dam-building in response to water sounds, but they don't necessarily imply conscious planning or foresight. They're more about an immediate, adaptive response to specific stimuli.
Misinterpretation of Animal Intelligence
: Human interpretation of animal behavior often anthropomorphizes or overestimates the cognitive processes behind these actions. While some animals certainly exhibit signs of planning and problem-solving, many behaviors attributed to planning might be more reflexive and less about conscious decision-making.
In summary, the example of beavers and their dam-building behaviors illustrates how what might seem like preplanning can often be instinctual responses developed through evolutionary processes. Understanding these behaviors through the lens of predictive coding provides a framework for interpreting them as adaptive responses to environmental cues rather than deliberate planning.
