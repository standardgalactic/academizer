Unifying image-caption and image-classification datasets with prefix conditioning
TUESDAY, JUNE 27, 2023
Posted by Kuniaki Saito, Student Researcher, Cloud AI Team, and Kihyuk Sohn, Research Scientist, Perception Team

Pre-training visual language (VL) models on web-scale image-caption datasets has recently emerged as a powerful alternative to traditional pre-training on image classification data. Image-caption datasets are considered to be more ���open-domain��� because they contain broader scene types and vocabulary words, which result in models with strong performance in few- and zero-shot recognition tasks. However, images with fine-grained class descriptions can be rare, and the class distribution can be imbalanced since image-caption datasets do not go through manual curation. By contrast, large-scale classification datasets, such as ImageNet, are often curated and can thus provide fine-grained categories with a balanced label distribution. While it may sound promising, directly combining caption and classification datasets for pre-training is often unsuccessful as it can result in biased representations that do not generalize well to various downstream tasks.

In ���Prefix Conditioning Unifies Language and Label Supervision���, presented at CVPR 2023, we demonstrate a pre-training strategy that uses both classification and caption datasets to provide complementary benefits. First, we show that na��vely unifying the datasets results in sub-optimal performance on downstream zero-shot recognition tasks as the model is affected by dataset bias: the coverage of image domains and vocabulary words is different in each dataset. We address this problem during training through prefix conditioning, a novel simple and effective method that uses prefix tokens to disentangle dataset biases from visual concepts. This approach allows the language encoder to learn from both datasets while also tailoring feature extraction to each dataset. Prefix conditioning is a generic method that can be easily integrated into existing VL pre-training objectives, such as Contrastive Language-Image Pre-training (CLIP) or Unified Contrastive Learning (UniCL).


High-level idea
We note that classification datasets tend to be biased in at least two ways: (1) the images mostly contain single objects from restricted domains, and (2) the vocabulary is limited and lacks the linguistic flexibility required for zero-shot learning. For example, the class embedding of ���a photo of a dog��� optimized for ImageNet usually results in a photo of one dog in the center of the image pulled from the ImageNet dataset, which does not generalize well to other datasets containing images of multiple dogs in different spatial locations or a dog with other subjects.

By contrast, caption datasets contain a wider variety of scene types and vocabularies. As shown below, if a model simply learns from two datasets, the language embedding can entangle the bias from the image classification and caption dataset, which can decrease the generalization in zero-shot classification. If we can disentangle the bias from two datasets, we can use language embeddings that are tailored for the caption dataset to improve generalization.

Prefix conditioning
Prefix conditioning is partially inspired by prompt tuning, which prepends learnable tokens to the input token sequences to instruct a pre-trained model backbone to learn task-specific knowledge that can be used to solve downstream tasks. The prefix conditioning approach differs from prompt tuning in two ways: (1) it is designed to unify image-caption and classification datasets by disentangling the dataset bias, and (2) it is applied to VL pre-training while the standard prompt tuning is used to fine-tune models. Prefix conditioning is an explicit way to specifically steer the behavior of model backbones based on the type of datasets provided by users. This is especially helpful in production when the number of different types of datasets is known ahead of time.

During training, prefix conditioning learns a text token (prefix token) for each dataset type, which absorbs the bias of the dataset and allows the remaining text tokens to focus on learning visual concepts. Specifically, it prepends prefix tokens for each dataset type to the input tokens that inform the language and visual encoder of the input data type (e.g., classification vs. caption). Prefix tokens are trained to learn the dataset-type-specific bias, which enables us to disentangle that bias in language representations and utilize the embedding learned on the image-caption dataset during test time, even without an input caption.

We utilize prefix conditioning for CLIP using a language and visual encoder. During test time, we employ the prefix used for the image-caption dataset since the dataset is supposed to cover broader scene types and vocabulary words, leading to better performance in zero-shot recognition.

Experimental results
We apply prefix conditioning to two types of contrastive loss, CLIP and UniCL, and evaluate their performance on zero-shot recognition tasks compared to models trained with ImageNet21K (IN21K) and Conceptual 12M (CC12M). CLIP and UniCL models trained with two datasets using prefix conditioning show large improvements in zero-shot classification accuracy.

Study on test-time prefix
The table below describes the performance change by the prefix used during test time. We demonstrate that by using the same prefix used for the classification dataset (���Prompt���), the performance on the classification dataset (IN-1K) improves. When using the same prefix used for the image-caption dataset (���Caption���), the performance on other datasets (Zero-shot AVG) improves. This analysis illustrates that if the prefix is tailored for the image-caption dataset, it achieves better generalization of scene types and vocabulary words.

Study on robustness to image distribution shift
We study the shift in image distribution using ImageNet variants. We see that the ���Caption��� prefix performs better than ���Prompt��� in ImageNet-R (IN-R) and ImageNet-Sketch (IN-S), but underperforms in ImageNet-V2 (IN-V2). This indicates that the ���Caption��� prefix achieves generalization on domains far from the classification dataset. Therefore, the optimal prefix probably differs by how far the test domain is from the classification dataset.

Conclusion and future work
We introduce prefix conditioning, a technique for unifying image caption and classification datasets for better zero-shot classification. We show that this approach leads to better zero-shot classification accuracy and that the prefix can control the bias in the language embedding. One limitation is that the prefix learned on the caption dataset is not necessarily optimal for the zero-shot classification. Identifying the optimal prefix for each test dataset is an interesting direction for future work.

In a recent blog post by Google's Cloud AI Team and Perception Team, they discuss a novel pre-training strategy, known as "prefix conditioning", to unify image caption and classification datasets. The team presented their work at CVPR 2023 under the title "Prefix Conditioning Unifies Language and Label Supervision".
Traditionally, pre-training visual language (VL) models has depended heavily on image classification data. However, the emergence of image-caption datasets, which contain broader scene types and vocabulary words, has offered an attractive alternative, providing strong performance in few- and zero-shot recognition tasks.
However, directly combining caption and classification datasets for pre-training often results in biased representations that don't generalize well to various downstream tasks. This is where prefix conditioning comes into play. It's a simple yet effective method that uses prefix tokens to separate dataset biases from visual concepts. The strategy helps the language encoder learn from both datasets, while also tailifying feature extraction to each dataset.
Inspired by prompt tuning, prefix conditioning learns a text token for each dataset type. During training, these tokens absorb the dataset's bias, allowing the remaining text tokens to focus on learning visual concepts.
The researchers demonstrated that prefix conditioning, applied to models like CLIP and UniCL, led to significant improvements in zero-shot classification accuracy. Interestingly, the prefix used during test time also influenced performance. Using the prefix tailored for the image-caption dataset, the performance on other datasets improved, indicating better generalization of scene types and vocabulary words.
One of the limitations highlighted was that the prefix learned on the caption dataset is not necessarily optimal for zero-shot classification. The team pointed out that identifying the optimal prefix for each test dataset is an interesting direction for future work.

Abstract
Visual conversation has recently emerged as a research area in the visually-grounded language modeling domain. It requires an intelligent agent to maintain a natural language conversation with humans about visual content. Its main difference from traditional visual question answering is that the agent must infer the answer not only by grounding the question in the image, but also from the context of the conversation history. In this paper we propose a novel multimodal attention architecture that enables the conversation agent to focus on parts of the conversation history and specific image regions to infer the answer based on the conversation context. We evaluate our model on the VisDial dataset and demonstrate that it performs better than current state of the art

In a paper presented at the Advances in Internet, Data & Web Technologies Conference, Lorena Kodra and Elinda Kajo Me��e discuss a new approach to visual conversation, an area of research in visually-grounded language modeling that involves intelligent agents conducting natural language conversations about visual content.
The authors propose a novel multimodal attention architecture that allows the conversation agent to concentrate on specific parts of the conversation history and specific image regions to infer answers based on the conversation's context. This model differs from traditional visual question answering in that the agent is required to draw conclusions not only from the question's image-based grounding, but also from the conversation's history.
The proposed model was tested on the VisDial dataset, which is a popular benchmark for visual dialog tasks, and the authors demonstrate that their approach outperforms current state-of-the-art methods. The implication is that their multimodal attention architecture can enable more accurate and context-aware responses in visually-grounded conversational agents.

Abstract
This work is extended from our participation in the  Dialogue System Technology Challenge (DSTC7), where we participated in the Audio Visual Scene-aware Dialogue System (AVSD) track. The AVSD track evaluates how dialogue systems understand video scenes and responds to users about the video visual and audio content. We propose a hierarchical attention approach on user queries, video caption, audio and visual features that contribute to improved evaluation results. We also apply a nonlinear feature fusion approach to combine the visual and audio features for better knowledge representation. Our proposed model shows superior performance in terms of both objective evaluation and human rating as compared to the baselines. In this extended work, we also provide a more extensive review of the related work, conduct additional experiments with word-level and context-level pretrained embeddings, and investigate different qualitative aspects of the generated responses.

Introduction
The  Dialogue System Technology Challenge (DSTC7) (D���Haro et al., 2020) proposed the Audio Visual Scene-aware Dialogue System (AVSD) track, which focuses on dialogue systems of multiple modalities. Arising from the related tasks in visual Question-Answering (VQA) (Antol, Agrawal, Lu, Mitchell, Batra, Lawrence Zitnick, Parikh, 2015, Goyal, Khot, Summers-Stay, Batra, Parikh, 2017), image captioning (Vinyals, Toshev, Bengio, Erhan, 2015, Xu, Ba, Kiros, Cho, Courville, Salakhudinov, Zemel, Bengio, 2015), video captioning (Hori, Hori, Lee, Zhang, Harsham, Hershey, Marks, Sumi, 2017, Li, Yao, Pan, Chao, Mei, 2018), and visual dialogues (Das, Kottur, Gupta, Singh, Yadav, Moura, Parikh, Batra, 2017, Das, Kottur, Moura, Lee, Batra, 2017), the AVSD track provides an interesting setting for dialogue research. In addition to processing information in traditional dialogue research such as dialogue context and user utterances, the dialogue agents in AVSD track are required to integrates not only visual features but also audio features from video input. Compared to visual dialogues (Das et al., 2017b), the proposed tasks in this track involve more complex features with larger feature space (i.e. temporal visual and audio features across multiple video frames).

Our approach for this track is delineated in this paper. Our two entries to this track are developed upon the baseline model (Hori et al., 2018), and exploit a hierarchical attention mechanism on question features, caption features, and visual and audio features of the input video. The attention strategies are adopted similarly to Anderson et al. (2018), including question-guided attention on caption and video features. In the VQA setting, using attention contributes to the increase of accuracy in selecting the correct answers. In the context of AVSD track, we aim to explore how this attention mechanism could be utilized in a dialogue setting in combination with visual and audio features of input videos to generate natural responses. We also integrate both visual and audio features using a nonlinear fusion technique to combine these features for better representations. Our proposed approach shows superior performance as compared to the baseline model in terms of both automatic metrics and human evaluation. In this work, we also extended our submission to the DSTC7 in 3 areas:
���
We include a review of related work in the research domains of dialogues and multiple modalities.

���
We conduct additional experiments to examine the model performance with different word-level and context-level pretrained embeddings.

ABSTRACT

As an intelligent way to interact with computers, the dialog system has been catching more and more attention. However, most research efforts only focus on text-based dialog systems, completely ignoring the rich semantics conveyed by the visual cues. Indeed, the desire for multimodal task-oriented dialog systems is growing with the rapid expansion of many domains, such as the online retailing and travel. Besides, few work considers the hierarchical product taxonomy and the users' attention to products explicitly. The fact is that users tend to express their attention to the semantic attributes of products such as color and style as the dialog goes on. Towards this end, in this work, we present a hierarchical User attention-guided Multimodal Dialog system, named UMD for short. UMD leverages a bidirectional Recurrent Neural Network to model the ongoing dialog between users and chatbots at a high level; As to the low level, the multimodal encoder and decoder are capable of encoding multimodal utterances and generating multimodal responses, respectively. The multimodal encoder learns the visual presentation of images with the help of a taxonomy-attribute combined tree, and then the visual features interact with textual features through an attention mechanism; whereas the multimodal decoder selects the required visual images and generates textual responses according to the dialog history. To evaluate our proposed model, we conduct extensive experiments on a public multimodal dialog dataset in the retailing domain. Experimental results demonstrate that our model outperforms the existing state-of-the-art methods by integrating the multimodal utterances and encoding the visual features based on the users' attribute-level attention

The research paper "User Attention-guided Multimodal Dialog Systems" by Chen Cui, Wenjie Wang, Xuemeng Song, Minlie Huang and others addresses the limitations of traditional text-based dialogue systems that fail to incorporate the rich semantics conveyed by visual cues. This research emphasizes the growing demand for multimodal task-oriented dialog systems, especially in expanding sectors like online retailing and travel.
The authors introduce the Hierarchical User Attention-guided Multimodal Dialog system (UMD), which considers both the hierarchical product taxonomy and users' attention to products. UMD is designed to pick up on the nuances of user attention as they express interest in different product attributes like color or style during the dialogue.
UMD operates on two levels: the high level and the low level. At the high level, a bidirectional Recurrent Neural Network is used to model the ongoing dialogue between users and chatbots. On the low level, a multimodal encoder and decoder are employed. The multimodal encoder uses a taxonomy-attribute combined tree to learn the visual presentation of images and employs an attention mechanism to allow visual features to interact with textual features. The multimodal decoder then selects the necessary visual images and generates textual responses based on the dialogue history.
To validate the effectiveness of their proposed model, the authors conducted extensive experiments using a public multimodal dialogue dataset in the retailing domain. The results showed that their model outperformed existing state-of-the-art methods, highlighting the advantage of integrating multimodal utterances and encoding visual features based on users' attribute-level attention.

ABSTRACT
Multimodal dialog system has attracted increasing attention from both academia and industry over recent years. Although existing methods have achieved some progress, they are still confronted with challenges in the aspect of question understanding (i.e., user intention comprehension). In this paper, we present a relational graph-based context-aware question understanding scheme, which enhances the user intention comprehension from local to global. Specifically, we first utilize multiple attribute matrices as the guidance information to fully exploit the product-related keywords from each textual sentence, strengthening the local representation of user intentions. Afterwards, we design a sparse graph attention network to adaptively aggregate effective context information for each utterance, completely understanding the user intentions from a global perspective. Moreover, extensive experiments over a benchmark dataset show the superiority of our model compared with several state-of-the-art baselines

The authors present a novel relational graph-based context-aware question understanding scheme. This approach aims to enhance the comprehension of user intentions, shifting the focus from local to global perspectives.
The first step in the process involves the use of multiple attribute matrices, which serve as guidance information. These matrices help in exploiting the product-related keywords present in each textual sentence, thereby strengthening the local representation of user intentions.
Following this, the authors propose a sparse graph attention network. This network's function is to adaptively aggregate effective context information for each utterance, thereby enabling a complete understanding of user intentions from a global perspective.
The authors carried out extensive experiments using a benchmark dataset to verify the effectiveness of their proposed model. The results displayed the superiority of their approach compared to several existing state-of-the-art baseline models, emphasizing the potential benefits of their relational graph-based context-aware scheme in improving question understanding in multimodal dialog systems.

Scalable Generative Models for Multi-label Learning with Missing Labels
Vikas Jain, Nirbhay Modhe, Piyush Rai Proceedings of the 34th International Conference on Machine Learning, PMLR 70:1636-1644, 2017.
Abstract
We present a scalable, generative framework for multi-label learning with missing labels. Our framework consists of a latent factor model for the binary label matrix, which is coupled with an exposure model to account for label missingness (i.e., whether a zero in the label matrix is indeed a zero or denotes a missing observation). The underlying latent factor model also assumes that the low-dimensional embeddings of each label vector are directly conditioned on the respective feature vector of that example. Our generative framework admits a simple inference procedure, such that the parameter estimation reduces to a sequence of simple weighted least-square regression problems, each of which can be solved easily, efficiently, and in parallel. Moreover, inference can also be performed in an online fashion using mini-batches of training examples, which makes our framework scalable for large data sets, even when using moderate computational resources. We report both quantitative and qualitative results for our framework on several benchmark data sets, comparing it with a number of state-of-the-art methods

This research paper "Scalable Generative Models for Multi-label Learning with Missing Labels" by Vikas Jain, Nirbhay Modhe, and Piyush Rai, proposes a scalable and generative framework for multi-label learning with missing labels. The study addresses the need for an effective and efficient way to handle missing data in the context of multi-label learning, a common problem in machine learning.
The authors' framework includes a latent factor model for the binary label matrix. This model is coupled with an exposure model that accounts for the missingness of labels���specifically, whether a zero in the label matrix actually represents a zero or a missing observation. The latent factor model also assumes that the low-dimensional embeddings of each label vector are conditioned directly on the corresponding feature vector for that example.
The generative framework designed by the authors allows a simple inference procedure, meaning the parameter estimation simplifies to a sequence of straightforward weighted least-square regression problems. Each of these can be solved quickly, efficiently, and in parallel. Furthermore, inference can also be performed in an online manner using mini-batches of training examples. This design makes the framework scalable for large datasets, even with moderate computational resources.
The authors validate their framework with quantitative and qualitative results on several benchmark datasets, and compare its performance to various state-of-the-art methods. This research presents a promising approach to handling the missing label problem in multi-label learning.

Model-Advantage and Value-Aware Models for Model-Based Reinforcement Learning: Bridging the Gap in Theory and Practice
Nirbhay Modhe, Harish Kamath, Dhruv Batra, Ashwin Kalyan
Download PDF
This work shows that value-aware model learning, known for its numerous theoretical benefits, is also practically viable for solving challenging continuous control tasks in prevalent model-based reinforcement learning algorithms. First, we derive a novel value-aware model learning objective by bounding the model-advantage i.e. model performance difference, between two MDPs or models given a fixed policy, achieving superior performance to prior value-aware objectives in most continuous control environments. Second, we identify the issue of stale value estimates in naively substituting value-aware objectives in place of maximum-likelihood in dyna-style model-based RL algorithms. Our proposed remedy to this issue bridges the long-standing gap in theory and practice of value-aware model learning by enabling successful deployment of all value-aware objectives in solving several continuous control robotic manipulation and locomotion tasks. Our results are obtained with minimal modifications to two popular and open-source model-based RL algorithms -- SLBO and MBPO, without tuning any existing hyper-parameters, while also demonstrating better performance of value-aware objectives than these baseline in some environments

The research paper "Model-Advantage and Value-Aware Models for Model-Based Reinforcement Learning: Bridging the Gap in Theory and Practice" by Nirbhay Modhe, Harish Kamath, Dhruv Batra, and Ashwin Kalyan, explores the practical benefits of value-aware model learning in model-based reinforcement learning (MBRL) for continuous control tasks.
Model-based reinforcement learning is a type of reinforcement learning where an agent learns to make decisions based on a predictive model of the environment. Despite its many theoretical advantages, value-aware model learning had not seen extensive practical application due to several inherent challenges. This research addresses this gap.
The authors derive a novel value-aware model learning objective by bounding the model-advantage, i.e., the difference in model performance between two Markov Decision Processes (MDPs) or models, given a fixed policy. Their derived objective showed superior performance compared to prior value-aware objectives in most continuous control environments.
Additionally, the authors identify a problem with stale value estimates when naively substituting value-aware objectives instead of maximum-likelihood in dyna-style MBRL algorithms. They propose a solution to this problem, effectively bridging the long-standing theoretical and practical divide in value-aware model learning. This allows successful implementation of all value-aware objectives in solving several continuous control tasks, specifically those related to robotic manipulation and locomotion.
The authors show their results using minimal modifications to two widely-used, open-source MBRL algorithms, namely, Stochastic Lower Bound Optimization (SLBO) and Model-Based Policy Optimization (MBPO). They did this without tuning any existing hyper-parameters and demonstrated better performance of value-aware objectives than these baselines in some environments. This research highlights the potential for practical application of value-aware model learning in the field of reinforcement learning.

Probability Monads from scratch in 100 lines of Haskell
2022-12-17
The final code is on Github.

I recently spent some time trying to learn Haskell, when I stumbled across the concept of probabilistic functional programming, originally based on this PFP library. Due to Haskell���s syntax sugar for monad computations, expressing probability distributions as monads allows you to implement something like a mini probabilistic programming language in less than 100 lines of code. I thought that���s pretty neat, so I decided to write this post that walks through a simple implementation from scratch.

The result is not comparable to a real probabilistic programming language in terms of performance or expressiveness, but I think it���s a great learning tool to get an intuitive understanding for manipulating probability distributions. If you are not super familiar with Haskell or monads, you should still be able to get the general idea, though some of the terse syntax may look a bit confusing.

Defining Distributions#
Let���s start by defining a probability distribution. In this post, we���ll only work with discrete distributions. People have extended the same approach to work with continuous distributions, but that���s beyond the scope of this post. As our representation, we use a simple list of (value, probability) tuples, where value could be anything (a generic). For example, a fair coin flip could be represented as [(Heads, 0.5), (Tails, 0.5)] or [(1, 0.5), (0, 0.5)].

-- | We use a Double as the representation for probabilities
type Prob = Double

-- | A distribution is represented as a list of possible values
-- and their probabilities
newtype Dist a = Dist [(a, Prob)]

-- | Helper function to access the inner list wrapped by the distribution
unpackDist :: Dist a -> [(a, Prob)]
unpackDist (Dist xs) = xs
A valid probability distribution must adhere to two laws:

All probabilities must be greater or equal than 0
The sum of all probabilities must be 1
We are not checking these laws when we create a Distribution. As long as our operations conserve these laws, we only need to check them when initially creating distributions, which usualy happens through helper functions that we���ll define later.

Note that nothing prevents our Distribution from having duplicate values. For example, both of

[(Heads, 0.5), (Tails, 0.5)]
[(Heads, 0.3), (Heads, 0.2), (Tails, 0.5)]
are valid representations of the same distribution. There���s nothing inherently wrong with this in terms of correctness, but more elements mean extra computational cost. And when we print our distribution, we don���t want to see duplicates. So let���s define a helper function that combines equal values by summing up their probabilities. We do this by converting the values to a Map, combining them via (+) and then converting back to a list. Probably not the most efficient way, but we don���t care about performance for our little experiment.

import qualified Data.Map as M

-- | Combines outcomes that occur multiple time
squishD :: (Ord a) => Dist a -> Dist a
squishD (Dist xs) = Dist $ M.toList $ M.fromListWith (+) xs
We also need a helper function to normalize probabilities to 1. That will come in handy when creating distributions later. As a convention, we���ll suffix functions that act on distributions with D and functions that act directly on a list of values and probabilities with P. Because a Distribution just wraps a list these are the identical, but sometimes we need to manipulate the inner list directly.

-- | Sum all probilities in the given list
sumP :: [(a, Prob)] -> Prob
sumP = sum . map snd

-- | Normalize the probabilities to 1.0
normP :: [(a, Prob)] -> [(a, Prob)]
normP xs = [(x, p / q) | let q = sumP xs, (x, p) <- xs]
Before we start working with distributions, we need a way to print them. The following code implements a Show instance for Distribution. This allows us to convert it to a string. It looks a bit complicated, but most of the code calculates the padding so that we get nicely aligned output. Note that we call our squisD function here to make sure we don���t see duplicate values.

instance (Show a, Ord a) => Show (Dist a) where
  show d = concatMap showRow $ (unpackDist . squishD) d
    where
      showRow (elem, prob) = padded elem ++ " | " ++ printf "%.4f" prob ++ "\n"
      padded elem = replicate (maxElemLen - (length . show) elem) ' ' ++ show elem
      maxElemLen = maximum $ map (length . show . fst) (unpackDist d)
Finally, let���s define an Event as a function that maps an outcome to a boolean value. For example, the event that a roll of a fair 6-sided is even has a probability of 50%.

-- | An event maps an outcome to a truth value
type Event a = a -> Bool
To compute the probability of an event, we sum the probabilities for the values where the event function evaluates to true.

-- | Evaluate the probability for the given event
evalD :: Event a -> Dist a -> Prob
evalD p = sumP . filter (p . fst) . unpackDist
Let���s look at some examples of what we can do with what we���ve implemented so far. A few helper functions for creating distributions:

-- | Create a uniform distribution
uniform :: [a] -> Dist a
uniform xs = Dist . normP $ map (,1.0) xs

-- | A fair n-sided die
die :: Int -> Dist Int
die n = uniform [1 .. n]

-- | A coin that lands on x with probability f and y with probability 1-f
coin :: Prob -> a -> a -> Dist a
coin f x y
  | f < 0.0 || f > 1.0 = error "f must be between 0 and 1"
  | otherwise = Dist [(x, f), (y, 1 - f)]
-- A 6-sided die
��> die 6
1 | 0.1667
2 | 0.1667
3 | 0.1667
4 | 0.1667
5 | 0.1667
6 | 0.1667

-- A coin with probably 0.3 of coming up heads
��> coin 0.3 True False
False | 0.7000
 True | 0.3000

In this blog post, the author discusses how they implemented probability monads in Haskell from scratch to create a simple version of a probabilistic programming language. This exercise serves as a learning tool to understand how to manipulate probability distributions.
The blog begins with a definition of discrete probability distributions, represented as a list of (value, probability) tuples, with the "value" being a generic term that could represent anything.
In Haskell, the author codes these distributions as follows:
haskell
Copy code
type Prob = Double
newtype Dist a = Dist [(a, Prob)]
unpackDist :: Dist a -> [(a, Prob)]
unpackDist (Dist xs) = xs
The author reminds us that a valid probability distribution must adhere to two rules: all probabilities must be greater than or equal to 0, and the sum of all probabilities must equal 1.
They go on to provide code for various functions, including one that 'squishes' multiple occurrences of outcomes in a distribution by summing their probabilities and another one to normalize probabilities to 1. The author also discusses how to display the distributions, ensuring duplicate values are not shown, and how to define and evaluate events.
Here is how the functions are defined:
haskell
Copy code
squishD :: (Ord a) => Dist a -> Dist a
squishD (Dist xs) = Dist $ M.toList $ M.fromListWith (+) xs

sumP :: [(a, Prob)] -> Prob
sumP = sum . map snd

normP :: [(a, Prob)] -> [(a, Prob)]
normP xs = [(x, p / q) | let q = sumP xs, (x, p) <- xs]

type Event a = a -> Bool
evalD :: Event a -> Dist a -> Prob
evalD p = sumP . filter (p . fst) . unpackDist
Finally, the author presents some examples of how to use these functions to create distributions, such as creating a uniform distribution, a fair n-sided die, and a coin with a specific probability of landing heads up:
haskell
Copy code
uniform :: [a] -> Dist a
uniform xs = Dist . normP $ map (,1.0) xs

die :: Int -> Dist Int
die n = uniform [1 .. n]

coin :: Prob -> a -> a -> Dist a
coin f x y
  | f < 0.0 || f > 1.0 = error "f must be between 0 and 1"
  | otherwise = Dist [(x, f), (y, 1 - f)]
They provide sample outputs showing a 6-sided die's distribution, a coin with a 30% chance of landing heads up, and the probability of rolling an even number with a 5-sided die.
The author concludes that while their resulting program isn't comparable to a full probabilistic programming language in terms of performance or expressiveness, it's a valuable tool for understanding the basics of manipulating probability distributions.

Functors and Marginalizing#
With the basic definitions in place, let���s move on to something more interesting. Before we make Distribution a Monad, we need to make it a Functor and Applicative. You���ve probably seen the idea behind functors in other programming languages. A functor needs to implement the fmap function, which can also be used through the <$> operator. If you���ve ever used map in other languages, that���s the same thing. In Haskell, map is specific to lists, while fmap is the generalized version that can be applied to all functors. For example, List has an instance of functor that allows us to apply a function to each element. You can think of a functor as a kind of container, and fmap allows us to lift a function over the structure and apply it to values inside the container. For our distribution this means mapping existing values to new values without touching their probabilities.

-- We  apply the given function to each value in the distribution
instance Functor Dist where
  fmap f (Dist xs) = Dist $ [(f x, p) | (x, p) <- xs]
That doesn���t seem terribly useful at first, but by combining it with our squishD function, we���ve just implemented Marginalization, or summing over variables we don���t care about. For example, if we have a distribution of two variables (a, b), we can fmap the (a,b) tuples to a and we���ll end up with the marginal distribution:

sample =
  Dist
    [ ((0, 0), 0.1),
      ((0, 1), 0.2),
      ((1, 0), 0.3),
      ((1, 1), 0.4)
    ]


��> sample
(0,0) | 0.1000
(0,1) | 0.2000
(1,0) | 0.3000
(1,1) | 0.4000
-- Map the tuple to the first value (sum over the second)
��> fst <$> sample
0 | 0.3000
1 | 0.7000

-- Map the tuple to the second value (sum over the first)
��>  snd <$> sample
0 | 0.4000
1 | 0.6000
Combining Distributions with Applicative Functors#
A common operation is to combine distributions. Let���s say we perform 2 independent coin flips and we want to know the joint distribution of this experiment. That is, we want to implement the Chain Rule

In the general case, P(x,y) = P(x|y)P(y)
If x and y are independent, P(x,y) = P(x)P(y)
fmap doesn���t really help us here, because it only lifts a function only over a single structure. What we want is a common use case for Applicative, which is also a requirement for being a Monad. Lying somewhere between functors and monads, appliative functors can be difficult to grasp at first. It took a while and looking at some examples before it clicked for me. I recommend checking out the Haskell Typeclassopedia entry and original paper for a deeper dive. Because it���s a bit out of scope I will only give a brief explanation here that doesn���t quite do it justice.

The main thing that Applicative gives us is the <*> operator (pronounced app). While functor allowed us to apply a simple function to a distribution of values, an applicative functors allows us to apply a distribution of functions to a distribution of values.

In this section, the author continues their discussion by explaining how to implement functors and applicatives in their implementation of probability distributions in Haskell.
Functors are a widely-used concept in programming, related to the
map
function used in many languages. They offer a way to apply a function to each element in a certain type of data structure. In Haskell, this is done with the
fmap
function. This function allows the lifting of a function over a structure and its application to values inside the container. For the probability distribution, this means mapping existing values to new values without changing their probabilities.
Here's how it's implemented:
haskell
Copy code
instance Functor Dist where
  fmap f (Dist xs) = Dist $ [(f x, p) | (x, p) <- xs]
The author notes that while this might not seem very useful at first, it actually provides a way to implement Marginalization, or summing over variables we don't care about. This can be done by combining
fmap
with the
squishD
function they defined in the previous section. They show an example of marginalizing a distribution of two variables
(a, b)
into the marginal distribution.
The author then moves on to explain Applicative functors, which are needed for combining distributions. This is typically required when we perform independent events and want to understand the joint distribution of the experiment.
For example, suppose we flip two coins independently and we want to know the joint distribution of this event. We can represent it as a product of probabilities if the two events are independent, using the Chain Rule: P(x,y) = P(x)P(y) for independent x and y.
The author mentions that while functors allow us to apply a simple function to a distribution of values, applicative functors allow us to apply a distribution of functions to a distribution of values. This is done using the
<*>
operator provided by the Applicative typeclass.

Applicative Programming with Effects
Conor McBride and Ross Paterson. in Journal of Functional Programming 18:1 (2008), pages 1-13.

Abstract
In this paper, we introduce Applicative functors--an abstract characterisation of an applicative style of effectful programming, weaker than Monads and hence more widespread. Indeed, it is the ubiquity of this programming pattern that drew us to the abstraction. We retrace our steps in this paper, introducing the applicative pattern by diverse examples, then abstracting it to define the Applicative type class and introducing a bracket notation which interprets the normal application syntax in the idiom of an Applicative functor. Further, we develop the properties of applicative functors and the generic operations they support. We close by identifying the categorical structure of applicative functors and examining their relationship both with Monads and with Arrows.

In this paper by Conor McBride and Ross Paterson, the authors introduce the concept of Applicative functors. These are abstract characterizations of an applicative style of effectful programming that are weaker than Monads and therefore more widespread.
The paper begins by presenting examples of the applicative programming pattern to demonstrate its ubiquity, which was a key motivator for the authors to abstract the pattern. They define the Applicative type class and introduce a bracket notation which interprets the standard application syntax in the idiom of an Applicative functor. This notation enables programmers to write complex effectful computations using familiar, pure function application syntax.
In the following sections, the authors explore the properties of applicative functors and the generic operations they support. They also provide insights into how applicative functors can be combined and how effectful computations can be built using them.
Towards the end of the paper, the authors delve into the categorical structure of applicative functors. They explore their relationship with both Monads and Arrows, other important structures in functional programming. Monads and Arrows are more expressive than Applicative functors, but this expressiveness comes with added complexity. The authors argue that for many applications, Applicative functors offer a sufficient level of expressiveness while being easier to use and understand.
The paper is an important contribution to the field of functional programming. By introducing and formalizing the concept of Applicative functors, the authors provide a useful tool for structuring effectful computations. This tool is widely used in modern functional programming languages, such as Haskell, and has enabled the development of more expressive and readable code.

How is that related to combining distributions? It turns out that this is a special case of what we can do with Applicative. To understand this, it���s best to look at an example. But first we need to implement and instance of Applicative for Distribution just like we did with Functor:

instance Applicative Dist where
  -- pure :: a -> Dist a
  pure x = Dist [(x, 1.0)]

  -- (<*>) :: Dist (a -> b) -> Dist a -> Dist b
  (Dist fs) <*> (Dist xs) = Dist $ do
    (x, px) <- xs
    (f, pf) <- fs
    return (f x, px * pf)
To implement <*> we create a nested loop over both distributions, the one with the functions and the one with the values. For each combination we multiply the probabilities and apply the function to the value. We also need to implement the pure function which is a way to convert any value into a Distribution. Here���s how we can use this:

--- Distribution of rolling a 5-sided die and then rolling a 4-sided die
��> (,) <$> (die 5) <*> (die 4)
(1,1) | 0.0500
(1,2) | 0.0500
(1,3) | 0.0500
(1,4) | 0.0500
(2,1) | 0.0500
(2,2) | 0.0500
(2,3) | 0.0500
(2,4) | 0.0500
(3,1) | 0.0500
(3,2) | 0.0500
(3,3) | 0.0500
(3,4) | 0.0500
(4,1) | 0.0500
(4,2) | 0.0500
(4,3) | 0.0500
(4,4) | 0.0500
(5,1) | 0.0500
(5,2) | 0.0500
(5,3) | 0.0500
(5,4) | 0.0500
To understand (,) <$> (die 5) <*> (die 4), let���s look at it piece by piece:

(,) is the tuple constructor. It takes two arguments. For example, (,) 1 2 evaluates to (1, 2)
(,) <$> (die 5) fmaps the tuple constructor over the (die 5) Distribution. Because the constructor takes two arguments, but we only provide one (each outcome in the die 5 distribution), this creates a Distribution of partially applied functions, where each function is waiting for one more argument to create a tuple.
... <*> (die 4) applies the distribution of partially applied functions from above to the (die 4) distribution and yields a distribution of tuples. This is where we use Applicative.
This pattern is quite common and a nicer way to write the above is liftA2 (,) (die 5) (die 4) where liftA2 is a function provided by the standard Control.Applicative library. Another example is the sum of rolling two dice:

��> liftA2 (+) (die 6) (die 6)
 2 | 0.0278
 3 | 0.0556
 4 | 0.0833
 5 | 0.1111
 6 | 0.1389
 7 | 0.1667
 8 | 0.1389
 9 | 0.1111
10 | 0.0833
11 | 0.0556
12 | 0.0278
We can also implement a Binomial Distribution using this approach. This distribution describes the total number of successes in a series of n independent experiments, e.g. the total number of heads when flipping a coin n times. To do this, we create a list of n coin flip distributions where a success corresponds 1 and failure to 0. Then we fold (reduce) over this list using our Applicative instance and the (+) operator just like we did in the sum of rolling two dice above:

-- | Binomial distribution with n experiments and success probability p
binom :: Int -> Prob -> Dist Int
binom n p = foldl1 (\x y -> squishD (liftA2 (+) x y)) $ replicate n (coin p 1 0)
For efficiency reasons we needed to put a squishD in there. Otherwise the number of values in our final distribution becomes exponential since each step multiplies two distributions.

��> binom 10 0.3
 0 | 0.0282
 1 | 0.1211
 2 | 0.2335
 3 | 0.2668
 4 | 0.2001
 5 | 0.1029
 6 | 0.0368
 7 | 0.0090
 8 | 0.0014
 9 | 0.0001
10 | 0.0000
Of course this is a rather inefficient way to implement a binomial distribution, but it���s simple and intuitive! The code mirrors exactly what a binomial distribution means: Summing up a number of coin flips successes

The concept of Applicative functors, introduced in functional programming, provides an abstract way to handle computations (or functions) with side effects, while maintaining the purity of the programming style. It's particularly useful when you want to apply a function to the values contained within a structure or context, and this function itself is wrapped within the same structure or context.
In the context of probability distributions, an Applicative instance for a distribution allows you to combine two distributions in a specific way. Consider the example you provided where you want to combine the distributions of rolling a 5-sided die and a 4-sided die.
Firstly, the
pure
function in the instance definition lets you lift a value into a Distribution, assigning it a probability of 1.0.
Secondly, the
<*>
function lets you apply a distribution of functions to a distribution of values. Each combination of function and value is considered, with the result being a new distribution where each outcome's probability is the product of the corresponding function and value probabilities.
So,
(,) <$> (die 5) <*> (die 4)
applies the tuple constructor
(,)
(which makes a pair from two arguments) across the distribution of a 5-sided die, resulting in a distribution of functions waiting for an additional argument. The
<*>
operator then applies this distribution of waiting functions to each outcome in the 4-sided die distribution. The result is a new distribution that captures all possible combinations of outcomes from both dice, along with the corresponding joint probabilities.
This is a powerful and elegant way to model combined distributions of independent events in a functional programming style. You can extend this to more complex operations, such as summing the outcomes of rolling two dice, or modelling a Binomial distribution, which describes the total number of 'successes' in a series of independent experiments. All of these examples show how Applicative functors provide a general-purpose tool for working with combined distributions in a flexible and composable way.

Monadic Distributions, finally!#
With our Distribution being a functor and applicative functor, we can now finally make it a Monad. Monads give us some additional power of Applicative and allow us to use Haskell���s do-notation, which we���ll see later. More power you say? Yep. With Applicative there was no way to express dependencies. For example, if we roll two dice, there was no way to make the second die roll a function of the first. That���s the general story with applicative functors and monads for other types as well. Monads allow us to chain computations. In the context of probability distributions this means we can work with dependent distributions, while Applicative only let us work with independent distributions.

To make our distribution a monad, we need to implement the bind operator >>=. This operator applies a function that returns a Distribution to a Distribution and returns another distribution. Another (in my opinion more intuitive) way to think about this operation is as a combination of fmap and join. The canonicial example here is a list. If you map a function that returns a list over a list of values, you get a list of lists, and then you flatten (or join) this nested list get a single list. In some languages, this operation is called flatMap. The bind operator does something very similar, and one can be expressed in terms of the other. The key is that we���re defining how we combine nested distributions so that we get a single ���flat��� distribution in the end.

instance Monad Dist where
  -- (>>=) :: Dist a -> (a -> Dist b) -> Dist b
  (Dist xs) >>= f = Dist $ do
    (x, p) <- xs
    (y, p') <- unpackDist (f x)
    return (y, p * p')
Our instance of Monad looks very similar to what we did with Applicative in that we have a nested loop. But note that we feed the values into the function that returns another Distribution. This is what allows us to create a new distribution that depends on the values of another distribution. With this, we can now express experiments in a generative language. For example, here is an experiment where we roll a die and flip a different coin depending on whether we rolled a 6 or not. Note that we are able to use Haskell���s do-notation because we���ve made our distribution a monad. Under the hood, do-notation is just syntax sugar around the bind operator >>= that we���ve implemented.

conditionalCoin = do
  number <- die 6
  if number == 6
    then coin 0.5 1 0
    else coin 0.1 1 0
    
��> conditionalCoin
0 | 0.8333
1 | 0.1667
Conditioning#
An operation that we haven���t discussed so far is conditioning on an event. Often, we want to create a new conditional probability distribution by introducing some evidence we���ve observed. This operation is also the idea behind Bayes��� rule. We can think of the conditioning operation as two steps:

Remove all outcomes (elements in our distribution) that conflict with the evidence. This gives us a new unnormalized probability space.
Renormalize all probabilities in this new space.
Wikipedia has a nice visualization of this idea.

-- Condition a distribution on an event
condD :: (a -> Bool) -> Dist a -> Dist a
condD f (Dist xs) = Dist . normP $ filter (f . fst) xs
We can express the example from Wikipedia as follows:

Suppose that somebody secretly rolls two fair six-sided dice, and we wish to compute the probability that the face-up value of the first one is 2, given the information that their sum is no greater than 5.

��> evalD ((==2) . fst) $ condD ((<= 5) . uncurry (+)) $ liftA2 (,) (die 6) (die 6)
0.29999999999
Example - Bayes��� Rule#
No probability tutorial would be complete without the medical exam Bayes rule example! You���ve probably seen a variation of this question in a textbook before. It goes something like this:

Jo has took a test for a disease. The result of the test is either positive or negative and the test is 95% reliable: in 95% of cases of people who really have the disease, a positive result is returned, and in 95% of cases of people who do not have the disease, a negative result is obtained. 1% of people of Jo���s age and background have the disease. Jo took the test, and the result is positive. What is the probability that Jo has the disease?

With our Monad abstraction that���s easy to solve now. First we create the join distribution (hasDisease, testPositive) using do-notation, then we condition on a positive test result (second element in the tuple). Finally, we evaluate the probability of the hasDisease event, which the first element in the tuple.

bayesMedicalTest = evalD fst . condD snd $ do
  hasDisease <- coin 0.01 True False
  testPositive <-
    if hasDisease
      then coin 0.95 True False
      else coin 0.05 True False
  return (hasDisease, testPositive)
��> bayesMedicalTest
0.16101694915254236
The probability that Joe has the disease is only ~16% despite the tet being 95% reliable.

You can imagine write much more complex generative processes using do-notation. It works like a mini-DSL that multiplies probabilities behind the scenes.

A side note on list monads#
In Haskell, the List monad is used to express nondeterministic computations without associated probabilities. What we have done here can be seen as nothing more than a small extension of the list Monad by adding probabilities to it. We could remove the probabilities and model our computations as a list of samples that are drawn from the distribution we want. For example, A coin flip with probability of 0.2 coming up heads could be expanded into [True, False, False, False, False] instead of [(True, 0.2), (False, 0.8)]. You could imagine taking this to the limit to model more complex distributions. We could then use the list of samples to perform computations, using exactly the same monadic code we wrote above, and we would get back a new list of samples that we could use to estimate the joint distribution.

Closing thoughts#
We���ve only scratched the surface of the kind of abstractions we can build by modeling probability distributions as monads. Because Haskell provides us with powerful tools and abstractions that work with any monad, we can use them to build significantly more complex models than we���ve done in this post. For example, we could extend our code to model Bayesian Networks or Markov Decision Processes, or use sampling instead of computing full joint distributions

It seems like you're providing a comprehensive overview of using Haskell's Monad abstraction to model probability distributions and perform computations on them. This is indeed a powerful way to express complex, conditional probability computations, such as those found in Bayesian statistics, using a purely functional language.
To sum up what you've mentioned:
Monadic Distributions:
You illustrated how to make
Dist
a Monad to add the capability of expressing dependencies between distributions. This is achieved by implementing the bind operator
(>>=)
, allowing to chain computations or express dependencies between distributions.
Conditioning:
You introduced the concept of conditioning, which is a critical operation in probabilistic reasoning. This operation allows the computation of probabilities in a new distribution, given some observed evidence. The
condD
function removes outcomes conflicting with the evidence and then renormalizes the probabilities.
Example - Bayes' Rule:
You applied these concepts to solve a common example from Bayes' theorem about disease testing. The solution uses the Monad abstraction and conditioning to easily solve the problem in a very clear and concise manner.
List Monads:
You mentioned that the List Monad in Haskell expresses non-deterministic computations without associated probabilities. It's like a simpler version of our probability distribution Monad. One could work with a list of samples instead of precise probabilities to model complex distributions and perform computations.
Overall, by defining the
Dist
datatype as a Monad, it's possible to leverage the power of Haskell's type system and abstract capabilities to model and solve complex problems in probability theory. Notably, the language's strong type safety and expressive syntax offer an elegant way to work with probabilistic computations.
The ability to use monadic notation for these computations offers a strong parallel to how these problems are solved mathematically. By using monads, you have turned Haskell into a domain-specific language for probability. This makes the code easier to reason about and can help prevent errors. It is also a great demonstration of how abstract concepts in functional programming can have concrete applications in other fields.
