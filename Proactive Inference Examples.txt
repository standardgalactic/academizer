GPT-4
Is there a name for the principle where the term to be defined should not be in the definition
ChatGPT
Yes, the principle that a definition should not include the term being defined is called "circular definition," and avoiding such a definition is an aspect of good lexicographic practice. It's also related to the logical fallacy of "begging the question" or "circular reasoning," where an argument's conclusion is implicitly or explicitly assumed in one of the premises.
It's not exactly that, it is when I'm learning flashards I don't want the term in the answer, else I don't read it but skim.


Explaining away


A phenomenon in which the
evidence or observations
that support one hypothesis
diminish or explain away the
support for another hypothesis.
ChatGPT
In the context of learning and flashcards, the principle you're referring to, where you avoid including the term in the definition to ensure that you actually learn the concept rather than just recognizing the term, does not have a specific name. It's a study strategy that ensures deeper processing of the material, which is related to the "testing effect" or "retrieval practice" ��� studying techniques that are shown to improve memory retention.
It's not exactly a circular definition, but it gives away the answer
ChatGPT
Understood. In the context of flashcards and learning, you're describing a principle where the definition or explanation should require the learner to recall the term independently, without giving away the answer. This is part of effective study techniques to reinforce learning and recall, but there isn't a specific established term for this principle. It���s simply a good practice in creating flashcards to avoid "giving away" the term in the definition, thereby encouraging active recall rather than passive recognition.
Yeah I am going to reword the answer to say it is a post hoc rationalization
ChatGPT
Rewording the answer to avoid giving away the term can be effective for learning. Instead of defining "explaining away" directly, you could rephrase it as "a post hoc rationalization where new information diminishes the significance of previous findings or observations." This encourages the learner to actively connect the concept with the term without seeing the term itself in the definition.
Falsification

The process of proving a hypothesis or theory false by providing evidence or observations that contradict it.
ChatGPT
For a flashcard that avoids using the term "falsification," you could reword it as:
"The scientific method whereby a hypothesis or theory is shown to be incorrect through the demonstration of evidence or observations that are inconsistent with it."
This rewording maintains the definition without using the exact term, prompting the learner to retrieve the term actively.
Extended cognition

The idea that cognition
is not confined to the
brain but extends into the
environment or external
tools and artifacts.
ChatGPT
A reworded definition that avoids using the term itself could be:
"The theory that mental processes go beyond the brain, encompassing external objects, devices, and surroundings as integral parts of the thinking process."
These are kind of like tautological definitions, which can be fine since definitions are tautologies, but I guess I am trying to avoid cognition shortcuts
ChatGPT
To avoid cognitive shortcuts and create a more engaging learning process, consider framing the concept in a way that relates to its implications or applications. Here���s a reworded definition for extended cognition:
"The concept that an individual's understanding and thought processes are not solely contained within the skull, but are distributed by incorporating elements of the surrounding environment, such as written notes, calculators, or even other people, into the cognitive process."
This version avoids the direct term and also provides context that requires the learner to think more deeply about the meaning.
Yeah I think the other definition was fine. I was just trying to give a name to this phenomena
ChatGPT
The specific practice of defining terms without using the term itself to encourage active recall doesn't have a widely-recognized special name���it's simply a part of effective flashcard design or good practice in educational material creation. It's related to the concept of "active recall," which is the practice of actively stimulating memory during the learning process. This technique is often recommended for more effective studying because it forces learners to retrieve information from memory rather than passively recognizing it.
Yeah I am using Memrise multiple choice flashcards so if the answer is in the definition I select it automatically without reading the whole definition or considering the alternatives
ChatGPT
In the context of multiple-choice flashcards like those in Memrise, your strategy is indeed to avoid what could be termed "definition giveaways" or "answer cues." By ensuring the term is not in the definition, you are compelled to read through all options and actively engage with the material to make the correct selection. This approach promotes deeper cognitive processing and improves memory retention by reducing the chance of simple pattern recognition or test-taking strategies that don't require genuine understanding.
Here is an example of a correct definition:

Filter
A mechanism or process
that selectively allows certain
information, signals, or
elements to pass through while
blocking or attenuating others.
ChatGPT
That's a well-constructed flashcard definition. It explains the term "filter" without using the word itself, which would compel learners to think about the function and purpose of a filter to arrive at the correct term. This method avoids giving away the answer and requires deeper cognitive engagement, which is beneficial for learning and retention.
It will need some further work to clarify some of the definitions, but the flashcard course is here:

Based on this:
https://coda.io/@active-inference-institute/active-inference-ontology-website
ChatGPT
Creating a Memrise course based on a specialized glossary like the one for active inference is an excellent way to help learners familiarize themselves with complex terminology. As you refine your course:
Ensure that each term is clearly defined without using the term itself to prevent those automatic responses you mentioned.
Use examples or analogies where possible, as they can be especially helpful in understanding abstract concepts.
Regularly revisit and revise your definitions based on feedback and your own learning experience to improve clarity and comprehension.
It's a great initiative, as active inference covers advanced topics where clear and precise definitions can significantly aid understanding. Good luck with your course development!
I divided the course into 10 modules or levels:

Novice
Apprentice
Practitioner
Journeyman
Explorer
Analyst
Specialist
Expert
Master
Guru
ChatGPT
Dividing the course into levels from "Novice" to "Guru" is a smart approach. It can provide learners with a clear sense of progression and accomplishment as they advance through the material. Here are some tips for each level:
Novice
: Focus on the most basic principles and terminology. Keep definitions simple and straightforward.
Apprentice
: Introduce slightly more complex concepts that build on the novice level, perhaps with simple applications of the terms.
Practitioner
: Start to challenge learners with more technical terms and their practical implications.
Journeyman
: Blend the terms with their use in real-world scenarios or studies.
Explorer
: Introduce nuances and subtleties within the concepts, exploring the edges of the field.
Analyst
: Focus on the analysis and interpretation of the terms in context.
Specialist
: Delve into the specific areas within active inference, focusing on in-depth understanding.
Expert
: Expect a high level of detail and complexity, with a focus on how different terms and concepts interrelate.
Master
: Cover advanced applications and theories, challenging learners to apply concepts in novel ways.
Guru
: Aim for full command of the field, including historical development, controversies, and cutting-edge research.
This staged approach helps to scaffold learning, making complex information more digestible by breaking it down into manageable steps.
Alternate titles for the levels
ChatGPT
Certainly, here are alternative titles for the levels that might give a different flavor or thematic approach to the progression:
Initiate
Explorer
Scholar
Craftsman
Strategist
Innovator
Authority
Savant
Philosopher
Visionary
These titles imply a journey not just of increasing knowledge, but also of growing insight and innovation, culminating in a broad, visionary understanding of the field.
Ok I'm not sure if it is better or not
ChatGPT
Choosing the right titles for your course levels is largely a matter of the tone and style you want to convey, as well as the expectations you want to set for your learners. The original set you proposed has a more traditional, craftsmanship-oriented theme, which can be very effective, especially in fields that involve a high degree of skill and precision.
The alternate set I provided leans more towards a journey of intellectual and creative discovery, which could be inspiring in a field that's as dynamic and evolving as active inference.
Consider your audience and the nature of the subject matter: if it's highly technical and skill-based, the original titles might be more appropriate. If it's more about theoretical understanding and innovative thinking, the alternate titles could be a better fit. You could also blend elements from both sets to create a customized progression that uniquely fits your course.
I don't think we should use the word man
ChatGPT
Certainly, avoiding gender-specific terms can make the course feel more inclusive. Here's a revised list with neutral terms:
Beginner
Novice
Apprentice
Intermediate
Advanced
Professional
Specialist
Expert
Scholar
Sage
This progression maintains a sense of traditional academic and professional advancement without implying any gender bias.
Just replace journeyman and master in my original list
ChatGPT
Understood, here's your original list with "Journeyman" and "Master" replaced with neutral alternatives:
Novice
Apprentice
Practitioner
Artisan
(replacing Journeyman)
Explorer

ChatGPT
A situation where data or findings that seem to back one theory simultaneously lessen the credibility of or offer after-the-fact support for an alternative theory.
Just edit the end of the sentence
ChatGPT
A situation where data or findings that seem to back one theory simultaneously lessen the credibility of or reinforce a different theory after the fact.
I settled on A phenomenon in which the evidence or observations that support one hypothesis diminish or provide a post hoc justification for another hypothesis.
ChatGPT
That rephrasing works well. It's clear and maintains the meaning of the phenomenon without using the term itself, which should be effective for your flashcard learning approach.
A summary of the conversation
ChatGPT
You were looking for a term or principle for flashcards where the definition does not give away the term being defined, to prevent automatic recognition rather than actual learning. I explained that there isn't a specific term for this principle; it's just considered a best practice in flashcard creation to encourage active recall. You also shared an example of a flashcard and sought assistance to reword it to avoid "definition giveaways" for your Memrise course on active inference. I provided suggestions on how to reword definitions and offered alternative titles for the progression levels in your course to avoid gender-specific terms and settled on replacing "Journeyman" and "Master" with "Artisan" and "Virtuoso." Finally, you revised a definition related to the concept of one hypothesis providing post hoc justification for another, to which I confirmed the effectiveness of your rewording.

Towards a History of Speech Act Theory1 
Barry Smith 
From A. Burkhardt, ed., Speech Acts, Meanings and Intentions. Critical Approaches to the Philosophy of 
John R. Searle, Berlin/New York: de Gruyter (1990), 29-61. 
1. Introduction 
That uses of language not only can, but even normally do have the character of actions was a fact 
largely unrealised by those engaged in the study of language before the present century, at least 
in the sense that there was lacking any attempt to come to terms systematically with the action- 
theoretic peculiarities of language use. Where the action-character of linguistic phenomena was 
acknowledged, it was normally regarded as a peripheral matter, relating to derivative or non- 
standard aspects of language which could afford to be ignored. 
The reasons for this are largely historical. In the first chapter of his De interpretatione, 
Aristotle writes: 
Every sentence is significant [...], but not every sentence is a statement-making sentence, but only those in 
which there is truth or falsity. There is not truth or falsity in all sentences: a prayer is a sentence but is 
neither true nor false. The present investigation deals with the statement-making sentence; the others we 
can dismiss, since consideration of them belongs rather to the study of rhetoric or poetry. (17 a 1-5, 
Edghill translation) 
Aristotle���s attitude remained authoritative until the end of the nineteenth century. There are, 
certainly, medieval writings on sacramental and other ritual and quasi-legal uses of language, as 
for example in connection with the issue as to what is involved in the constitution of a valid 
baptism or marriage. But such writings contain at best isolated passages capable of being 
interpreted with hindsight as belonging to a theory of speech acts. They exerted no wider 
theoretical influence in their own right, and they did not succeed in bridging the gap opened up 
by Aristotle between logical and other (���poetical���) aspects of language use. 
The first philosopher to have fought consciously and explicitly against the Aristotelian 
conception seems to have been Thomas Reid,2 who saw that there are, in addition to judgments, 
also other types of sentence permitting of a theoretical treatment. The principles of the art of 
language are, he wrote, 
to be found in a just analysis of the various species of sentences. Aristotle and the logicians have analysed 
one species ��� to wit, the proposition. To enumerate and analyse the other species must, I think, be the 
foundation of a just theory of language. (1894, p. 72) 
Reid���s technical term for promisings, warnings, forgivings, etc., is ���social operations���. 
Sometimes he also calls them ���social acts���, and opposes them to ���solitary acts��� such as judgings, 
intendings, deliberatings and desirings, which are characterised by the fact that it is not essential 
to them that they be expressed and by the fact that their performance does not presuppose any 
���intelligent being in the universe��� in addition to the person who performs them (1969, p. 71; 
1969a, p. 437). 
Social acts, as Reid conceives them, are neither modifications nor combinations of solitary 
acts. They form a separate field of investigation, above all because expression belongs to the 
very essence of the social act, and this expression is therefore radically different from that sort of 
accidental expression which we sometimes find in the field of solitary acts. A command is not ���a 
desire expressed by language��� (1969a, p. 61). A promise is not ���some kind of will, consent, or 
intention, which may be expressed, or may not be expressed��� (op. cit., p. 453). Social acts are 
such as to have a necessary directedness towards some other person, and the relevant linguistic 
expression makes sense only where such a directedness obtains. In a promise, for example, ���the 
prestation promised must be understood by both parties��� (op. cit., p. 446). Social acts thereby 
constitute a miniature ���civil society���, a special kind of structured whole, embracing both the one 
who initiates them and the one to whom they are directed. The latter ���acts a part in them��� (op. 
cit., p. 438), and this part is indispensable to the existence of the whole. 
Reid has hereby captured many of the most important elements of the modern theory. 
Unfortunately, his Cartesian (dualist) ontology meant that he was unable to give a clear and 
consistent statement of the relation between observable utterance and underlying intention or act 
of will.3 Reid���s account is incomplete also in that he concerns himself only with the structures of 
what one might call unimpaired social operations. He pays no special attention to cases of 
possible ���infelicity���. Not least important however is the fact that his work on social acts 
remained without any influence in the wider philosophical community, so that it was not until the 
end of the 19th century that the idea of linguistic action began to rear its head once more. 
Pertinent remarks may, again with the benefit of hindsight, be extracted from the writings of 
Peirce, though here, too, one will search in vain for any developed theory of the way uses of 
language may effect ���a general mode of real happening��� 4. It is rather in the work of the Munich 
phenomenologist Adolf Reinach (1883-1917) that there is to be discovered the first systematic 
theory of the phenomena of promising, questioning, requesting, commanding, accusing, etc., 
phenomena which Reinach, like Reid (though almost certainly independently 5), collects together 
under the heading ���social acts���.

...

The notion of basic institutional concept seems, in any case, to be a notion to which both 
Reinach and Searle might conceivably be willing to give the time of day. Where they disagree is 
in relation to the question as to where the line is to be drawn between what we have called purely 
conventional concepts (concepts which can reasonably be held to have been introduced by 
definition), and basic institutional concepts (concepts for which non-circular definitions can be 
ruled out). Promising, in particular, is taken by Searle to be a purely conventional concept, where 
Reinach must insist that it is basic. And surely we must follow Searle in this. For has he not 
given a definition of ���promising��� in terms of other, more basic concepts? The definition reads as 
follows: 
If a speaker S utters a sentence T in the presence of a hearer H, then, in the literal utterance of T, S 
sincerely and non-defectively promises that p to H if and only if 
1. normal input and output conditions obtain (e.g. that hearer and speaker both know how to speak the 
language and both are conscious of what they are doing). 
2. S expresses the proposition that p in the utterance of T. 
3. In expressing that p, S predicates a future act A of S. 
4. H would prefer S���s doing A to his not doing A, and S believes H would prefer his doing A to his not 
doing A. 
5. It is not obvious to both S and H that S will do A in the normal course of events (the act must have 
a point). 
6. S intends to do A. 
7. S intends that the utterance of T will place him under an obligation to do A. 
8. S intends (i) to produce in H the knowledge K that the utterance of T is to count as placing S under 
an obligation to do A. S intends to produce K by means of the recognition of i, and he intends i to be 
recognized in virtue of (by means of) H ���s knowledge of the meaning of T. 
9. The semantical rules of the dialect spoken by S and H are such that T is correctly and sincerely 
uttered if and only if conditions 1-8 obtain.59 
The question is, however, whether we really do have before us a non-circular definition here.60 
Consider first of all the terminology of ���counts as��� that is utilised by Searle e.g. in the locution 
���counts as a greeting���.61 Suppose that, according to the practices of a certain auction house or 
race track lifting one���s finger counts as making a promise. Does this mean that in such 
circumstances lifting a finger is making a promise? Clearly not, though the person who lifts his 
finger unawares may find that he is obligated just as much as if he had truly made a promise. 
(And suppose that in certain special auction houses raising one���s left eyebrow counts as lifting 
one���s finger; would this mean that my lifting my eyebrow unawares might here count as 
counting as making a promise?) What these examples show, is that the phrase ���counts as��� is 
normally used precisely in order to draw attention to the fact that performances may count as 
(say) making a promise even where the conditions necessary to promising fail to be met. One 
might, of course, rule out this connotation by speaking instead of what ���counts correctly as a 
promise���, but this, it seems, could mean nothing other than ���is a promise���, and it is just this 
locution which Searle is out to define. How, then, are we to give meaning to a phrase such as 
���counts as a promise��� or ���counts as a greeting��� in a way which will meet Searle���s requirements? 
How, in general, are we to make sense of talk of what counts as an X in the absence of any prior 
understand of what an X (in itself) might be? How could I ever come to know that such and such 
counts as a promise, unless I was independently familiar with promising itself? And what good 
would this knowledge be, even if it could be achieved? For if I know that something counts as X, 
and yet do not know what this ���X��� signifies, then surely I know nothing at all. Suppose, for 
example, that some Martian visiting Earth had conceived himself the project of realising the 
conjunction of Searle���s conditions 1-9 without any familiarity with the Earthly institution of 
promising. Would he truly succeed in promising, merely as a result of having, in some way, met 
just these conditions as stated by Searle? 
But now look what happens if we examine Searle���s condition 1 in the light of the above. As 
Searle tells us (op. cit., p. 61), this condition is to be construed sufficiently broadly that, together 
with the other conditions, it guarantees that H understands the utterance. But does this not mean 
that H understands the utterance precisely as a promise ? And does not the condition that speaker 
and hearer both ���are conscious of what they are doing��� itself presuppose their knowing that it is 
a promise in which they are involved? Searle must, surely, answer yes to these questions. But 
then his definition is circular. 
Searle might however respond that we are imputing too lofty a purpose to the definition he 
has provided. His definition is not intended to throw light on any putative special ���structure��� of 
promising, any more than it is intend to provide a statement of the constitutive rules that were in 
fact historically involved in the genesis of corresponding institutions. Rather, he is offering 
merely a clarificatory analysis of the sorts of things we say about a certain not absolutely cleanly 
demarcated facet of behaviour.62 If his analysis is to be of value, however, then it must not 
neglect central features of the behaviour in question, and one such feature seems to consist in the 
fact that promising requires that one fit oneself naturally into a structured whole of the relevant 
sort. As Crosby stresses in his paper above, promising is not a composition of other acts, but an 
act in and of itself. Searle comes part way towards meeting this requirement in his thesis that the 
institution of promising, like all other institutions, is a ���system of constitutive rules��� (op. cit., p. 
51). His problem, however, is that he cannot specify what ���system��� here might mean without 
once more casting himself upon the rock of some special Reinachian structure.

ChatGPT
The excerpt from Barry Smith's "Towards a History of Speech Act Theory" outlines the evolution of speech act theory from its overlooked origins to its modern developments. Here are some main points:
Historical Oversight of Language as Action
: Traditionally, the action aspect of language was not systematically explored, with Aristotelian logic focusing primarily on propositional statements that can be deemed true or false, dismissing other forms of sentences relevant to rhetoric or poetry.
Thomas Reid���s Contributions
: Reid challenged the Aristotelian view by recognizing various types of sentences beyond propositions, coining the term "social operations" for actions like promising or warning. He emphasized that these social acts inherently require expression and are directed towards others, establishing a reciprocal relationship between speaker and hearer.
Lack of Development and Influence
: Reid's ideas, though aligned with modern speech act theory, did not significantly influence his contemporaries or successors, resulting in a stagnation of the theory���s development until the late 19th century.
Adolf Reinach���s Systematic Theory
: Reinach provided a systematic theory of speech acts like promising, questioning, and commanding, grouping these under "social acts" independently of Reid. His work began to shape a more structured understanding of speech acts.
Searle���s Institutional Concepts
: John Searle introduced the idea of institutional facts and constitutive rules, arguing for conventional concepts formed through collective agreement, which can be seen in institutions like promising.
Debate over Basic Concepts
: There's a debate between whether certain concepts, like promising, are purely conventional or basic. Searle provided a definition of promising involving conditions that need to be met, suggesting promising is a conventional concept.
Circularity in Definitions
: Smith critiques Searle's definition of promising for potentially being circular. The use of terms like "counts as" might presuppose the understanding of what a promise is, thus not providing a truly foundational definition.
Searle���s Clarificatory Analysis
: Searle's definition may not aim to elucidate the fundamental structure of promising but rather to clarify our discussions about it. However, Smith points out that Searle's analysis must account for the integral features of promising, which is not merely a combination of acts but an act in itself.
This section of Smith's work reveals the intricacies and challenges in developing a comprehensive speech act theory, reflecting on historical perspectives and contemporary debates, particularly between Reinach's and Searle's conceptions of speech acts.
Connections with the essay
ChatGPT
The excerpt from Barry Smith's essay "Towards a History of Speech Act Theory" provides a historical account of how the study of language evolved from viewing sentences merely as statements of truth or falsity, as posited by Aristotle, to recognizing that the use of language also encompasses actions, or "speech acts," which involve intentions and social interactions beyond mere statements of fact.
Smith explores how this transition unfolded by discussing key figures and their contributions:
Thomas Reid
- Reid opposed the Aristotelian view by recognizing that language could perform "social operations" or "social acts," which go beyond solitary acts like judging or desiring. He argued that these acts are not just expressed intentions but have a necessary social dimension, implying a commitment to another person.
Adolf Reinach
- Mentioned later in the text, Reinach developed a systematic theory of social acts, which probably paralleled Reid's ideas, although independently formulated. He considered acts like promising or questioning as foundational social interactions that create obligations or social realities.
John Searle
- Searle's work is presented as a continuation and refinement of this line of thought, particularly in his attempt to provide a clear definition of promising as a speech act. Searle argues that promising involves certain conditions that are not just about uttering words but about creating social obligations and intentions recognizable to both the speaker and the listener.
The essay then scrutinizes Searle's definition of promising, questioning whether it successfully avoids circularity. Searle's analysis attempts to describe the institution of promising as a "system of constitutive rules," but the essay suggests that Searle struggles to define what this system is without falling back on a "special Reinachian structure."
Overall, the connections within the essay involve:
The shift in understanding language from a logical perspective to an action-theoretic one.
The recognition of the social dimension of speech acts.
The challenge of defining speech acts like promising without circularity.
The debate over whether promising and other social acts are purely conventional or have some basic, non-conventional nature.
The essay presents these connections by detailing the historical progression of speech act theory and critically analyzing the arguments made by philosophers who have contributed significantly to this field.
I meant with our earlier discussion.
ChatGPT
The excerpt from Barry Smith's essay relates to our earlier discussion about speech act theory in the following ways:
Historical Perspective
: Just as we discussed Austin and Searle's contributions to speech act theory, the essay offers a historical context that situates their work within a broader tradition, starting with Reid and Reinach.
The Nature of Promising
: Our conversation touched on the conditions that Searle believes are necessary for a successful speech act, like promising. The essay also discusses the notion of promising, examining Searle's effort to define it without circularity, which echoes our exploration of the constitutive rules that define speech acts.
Social Acts
: Both the essay and our discussion acknowledge that speech acts are social in nature, involving commitments to other persons, thus extending beyond mere expression of thoughts or statements of fact.
Philosophical Analysis
: The essay, as well as our earlier discussion, delves into the philosophical scrutiny of speech act theory, questioning the fundamentals of how speech acts function and what they entail within social interactions.
Definitional Challenges
: The essay's critique of Searle's attempt to define promising mirrors the complexities we discussed regarding the definition and identification of different speech acts and the challenges in explaining how they work.
Evolution of Language Study
: Both contexts highlight the evolution from a traditional view of language that focused on truth conditions to a more complex understanding that considers the performative aspects of language use.
Role of Intentions
: The essay and our discussion emphasize the role of speaker intentions in speech acts, a key concept in understanding how language functions within social contexts.
In essence, the essay provides a more in-depth historical and analytical context to the elements of speech act theory we discussed, particularly focusing on the development of the concept and the intricate details of defining a specific speech act like promising.

: Smith���s deeper philosophical investigation into language acts can inspire educational methods that enhance comprehension, as suggested in your essay. This might involve teaching strategies that focus on the philosophical underpinnings of language use and social commitment.
Assessment and Evaluation
: The complexity of defining terms such as "promising" in non-circular ways is analogous to the challenge of designing assessments that test for understanding, not recognition, as your essay aims to explore in its assessment section.
The Role of Active Recall
: The essay you're drafting promotes active recall to encourage deeper understanding, which can be seen as a response to Smith's implicit call for more robust engagement with concepts like speech acts.
Educational Material Development
: Smith's essay implicitly critiques the superficial engagement with important concepts, which resonates with your section on adapting educational materials to foster a deeper understanding of concepts.
Both texts seem to advocate for a more meaningful engagement with material: Smith's through a thorough philosophical analysis of language, and your essay through pedagogical strategies aimed at achieving true understanding rather than surface-level recognition.
Yeah I think you should not automate tasks until they become boring
ChatGPT
It seems you're reflecting on the idea of automation in relation to task engagement. Automation can indeed sometimes lead to a decrease in personal engagement with a task, making it feel less interesting or meaningful. This can happen in educational contexts as well ��� for instance, if students rely too much on automated tools for learning, they might not engage deeply enough with the material to truly understand it. Balancing the convenience of automation with the need for active engagement is an important consideration in both education and work.
Is it significant that the course itself is on active inference?
ChatGPT
Absolutely, it's quite significant. Active inference is a framework from the cognitive sciences that suggests that the brain is constantly predicting sensory inputs and updating its models of the world based on the difference between its predictions and actual inputs (prediction errors). Learning about active inference in the context of education can be particularly relevant and meta, as the course content directly relates to the process by which we learn and understand.
The interplay between the course topic and the learning strategies discussed in the essay is profound. Circular definitions and mnemonic shortcuts can often hinder the active inference process by not allowing the brain to effectively update its model of a concept based on new information, leading to a more rigid and less nuanced understanding. On the other hand, promoting active recall and constructing non-circular definitions are approaches that can complement active inference by encouraging the brain to make and refine predictions about information, thereby deepening comprehension.
Thus, teaching active inference through methods that exemplify the concept not only reinforces the content but also serves as a live demonstration of the brain���s learning and predictive capabilities in action. It encourages students to engage in the same kind of active learning that they're studying about, which could help in consolidating the learning in a practical way.

The research article "A tale of two densities: active inference is enactive inference" by Maxwell JD Ramstead, Michael D Kirchhoff, and Karl J Friston, focuses on the interpretation of key constructs within the free-energy principle (FEP) and its corollary, active inference, in neuroscience and biology. It clarifies the roles of generative models and variational densities in the theory and addresses the misconceptions due to the conflation of FEP with other Bayesian frameworks like predictive coding or prediction error minimization.
The authors discuss two interpretations of these models:
Structural Representationalist Interpretation
: This interpretation, which the authors find lacking, views the models as static structures that represent information about the world.
Enactive Interpretation
: This is the proposed view, which suggests that generative and recognition models should be seen as dynamic processes involved in inference and control, essential for self-organization and action selection based on beliefs, rather than mere representational devices.
The article argues that the enactive interpretation, termed "enactive inference," is more fitting to the roles these constructs play within active inference under the FEP, suggesting that they actively engage with and respond to the environment rather than passively representing it. The authors aim to correct the systemic misrepresentations in the literature and propose a view that aligns with the original intentions of the FEP framework, emphasizing the agency and embodiment of cognitive systems.
1. Introduction
The aim of this article is to clarify how best to interpret some of the central constructs that underwrite the free-energy principle (FEP) ��� and its corollary, active inference ��� in theoretical neuroscience and biology: namely, the role that generative models and recognition densities1 play in this theory, aiming to unify life and mind (Friston, 2013; Kirchhoff, Parr, Palacios, Friston, & Kiverstein, 2018; Ramstead, Badcock, & Friston, 2018). We argue that these central constructs have been systematically misrepresented in the literature, because of the conflation between active inference, on the one hand, and distinct (albeit closely related) Bayesian formulations, centred on the brain ��� variously known as predictive processing (Clark, 2013, 2015; Metzinger & Wiese, 2017), predictive coding (Rao & Ballard, 1999) or the prediction error minimisation (PEM) framework (Kiefer & Hohwy, 2018, 2019).
These latter approaches have much in common with active inference, and together constitute what might be called Bayesian cognitive science. The idea behind these Bayesian approaches is, in a nutshell, that cognitive processes are underwritten by predictions based on inferential models. Central among these models are generative models��� that is, statistical models of how sensory observations are generated, which harness the prior beliefs (i.e., probability densities) of a cognitive system about its environment. In Bayesian cognitive science, these generative models are said to work in tandem with recognition models��� which harness posterior beliefs that represent the system���s observationally informed ���best guess��� about the causes of its sensations. Bayesian schemes treat cognitive activity as inferring a posterior probability distribution (a guess about the causes of sensory states ��� the recognition density) via a process of belief updating ��� essentially, changing prior beliefs (from the generative model) into a posterior belief, by assimilating new observations or sensory evidence.
The question that shall occupy us is how best to understand the function and properties of the generative and recognition models in active inference under the FEP, in light of the active processes involved in orchestrating, maintaining and updating these models. In particular, we examine two contrasting interpretations of these models: a structural representationalist interpretation and an enactive interpretation.
Recent work on the Bayesian approach casts generative models (and associated recognition densities) as structural representations��� that is, as ���iconic representations in which the structure of internal representations in the brain come to replicate the structure of the generative process by which sensory input impinges upon it��� (Williams & Colling, 2017, p. 1962). The most engaging recent defence of structural representationalism, which will be our target, have been provided by Clark (2015), G��adziejewski (2016), G��adziejewski and Mi��kowski (2017), Hohwy (2014, 2016), Kiefer and Hohwy (2018, 2019), Williams (2017) and Williams and Colling (2017). On this view, cognitive processes are seen as irreducibly involving internal, neural structures that carry representational content, and which acquire their contents via inferential processes in the hierarchical generative and recognition models that are instantiated by the brain.
We argue that the structural representationalist interpretation of generative and recognition models ��� while providing an accurate description of these constructs as they figure in some versions of Bayesian cognitive science ��� does not do justice to the generative models and recognition densities that figure in active inference under the FEP. In contrast to these other Bayesian theories, which are, in effect, theories of the structure, function and dynamics of the brain, active inference is a much broader theory of adaptive phenotypes, that centres on the control of adaptive behaviour and that emphasises the tight coupling and circular causality between perception and action.
The enactive interpretation of active inference that we pursue takes seriously the idea that active inference is a self-organising process of action policy selection. When understood as a self-organised policy selection, active inference has the following non-trivial implication. Active inference is not merely a view of the brain as reducing the uncertainty of its sensory observations via perceptual inference. It concerns the active, selective sampling of the world by an embodied agent. From a technical point of view, active inference and perceptual inference are not merely two sides of the same coin. Instead, active inference is the name of the formulation for policy selection. What advocates of the Bayesian brain call ���perceptual inference��� is just one moment of the policy selection process in active inference under the FEP, namely, state estimation. The issue we want to press here is that the active inference framework implies that perception is a form of action, that is, action and perception cannot be pulled apart as they sometimes are in the Bayesian brain framework.
In this sense, the active inference scheme is enactive (Thompson, 2010; Varela, Thompson, & Rosch, 1991), in the enactive sense of being for action (Bruineberg & Rietveld, 2014; Kirchhoff, 2018; Kirchhoff & Froese, 2017; Kirchhoff & Kiverstein, 2019; Ramstead et al., 2018; Ramstead, Kirchhoff, Constant, & Friston, 2019). Our enactive interpretation of active inference ��� what might be called enactive inference��� follows what has been called the pragmatic turn in cognitive science (Engel, Friston, & Kragic, 2016). In cognitive science, this is the move away from a view of cognition as the rule-governed manipulation of internal (often symbolic) representations, to a view of cognition as being essentially action-oriented, and therefore premised on the selection of adequate forms of situationally appropriate action.
We proceed differently from much of the literature discussing this question, in that we base our interpretation of generative and recognition models directly on the mathematical apparatus of active inference. Namely, we examine the FEP and active inference as applied to the selection of adaptive action policies ��� in contrast to other approaches that focus on the Bayesian brain and predictive coding, for example, Clark (2015) and Hohwy (2014). In active inference under the FEP, the generative and recognition models are best cast as realising inference and control��� the belief-guided selection of action policies ��� and do not have the properties ascribed by structural representationalists. We thus provide a philosophical and information-theoretic justification for an enactive view of generative models under the FEP.
The argumentative structure of this article is as follows. In the first section, we present the generative and recognition models, as they figure in Bayesian cognitive science, and examine the claim that these inferential models are structural representations. In the second section, we present the FEP and active inference. In the third section, we examine in some detail the generative models and recognition densities that are featured in active inference under the FEP, emphasising the circular causality between action and perception that is implicit in these formulations. Finally, in the fourth section, we present the argument for enactive inference: generative models are control systems, and they are not structural representations.

The Introduction section of the article "A tale of two densities: active inference is enactive inference" sets the stage for a detailed discussion on how to interpret key constructs of the Free-Energy Principle (FEP) and its corollary, active inference, in theoretical neuroscience and biology. The authors aim to address and correct the systematic misrepresentations in the literature that arise from conflating the FEP and active inference with similar, yet distinct, Bayesian brain theories like predictive processing, predictive coding, and the prediction error minimization framework.
Key Points of the Introduction:
Clarification of Constructs
: The article's primary objective is to clarify the roles of generative models and recognition densities in the theory of active inference and their unifying role for life and mind.
Misrepresentations in Literature
: Misrepresentations are noted due to confusion between the FEP-related active inference and other Bayesian approaches which also consider cognition as underpinned by predictions and inferential models.
Bayesian Cognitive Science
: It's discussed how Bayesian approaches involve generative models (how sensory observations are generated based on prior beliefs) and recognition models (which reflect the system's updated beliefs after new sensory information).
Structural Representationalist vs. Enactive Interpretation
: The structural representationalist interpretation considers generative models as internal neural structures carrying representational content, while the enactive interpretation proposed by the authors views active inference as a dynamic, self-organizing process of action policy selection.
Active Inference as Enactive Process
: The authors emphasize that active inference under the FEP is not just about reducing sensory uncertainty but involves an embodied agent actively sampling the world, making perception a form of action.
Mathematical Justification
: The authors base their interpretation on the mathematical framework of active inference as applied to adaptive action policy selection, differentiating it from other approaches focused on the Bayesian brain.
Philosophical Stance
: Finally, the authors provide a philosophical and information-theoretic justification for an enactive view of generative models under the FEP, aiming to argue that these models are not just structural representations, but control systems involved in the belief-guided selection of action policies.
The article plans to unfold these ideas by examining the generative and recognition models in Bayesian cognitive science, presenting the FEP and active inference framework, exploring the circular causality between action and perception, and arguing for enactive inference ��� where generative models are seen as control systems, not mere representations.
2. Statistical models as representations
2.1. Generative models and recognition models in Bayesian cognitive science
Bayesian cognitive science is an approach to the study of cognitive systems that has gained much momentum in the last few decades (Ballard, Hinton, & Sejnowski, 1983; Friston, 2010; Rao & Ballard, 1999). On this approach, cognitive systems can be described as instantiating a form of Bayesian inference. That is, their physical properties and patterns of behaviour come to match (or infer, in a statistical sense) those of their embedding ecological niche (Bruineberg, Kiverstein, & Rietveld, 2016; Kiefer, 2017). The various flavours of Bayesian cognitive science ��� for example, the Bayesian brain (Knill & Pouget, 2004), predictive coding (Rao & Ballard, 1999) and active inference (Friston, 2010) ��� furnish mathematical tools to model how organisms engage with their worlds (Lee & Mumford, 2003; Mumford, 1992).
This framework is broadly Bayesian because it rests on the idea that, at some level of description, organisms encode expectations or beliefs about their environment, which guide their cognitive processes (Rao & Ballard, 1999). These beliefs have been formalised as Bayesian posteriors and priors. Bayesian priors in this context correspond to probability distributions that are parameterised or shaped by physical states, for example, brain states and patterns of neural activity.2 Bayes��� theorem tells us how to combine optimally what we know about the probability of some unobserved state or hypothesis s, prior to making any observation ��� that is, Bayesian prior beliefs, which is denoted 
��� with what we know, given some data or sensory observation o��� that is, likelihoods, denoted 
. Bayes��� theorem tells us that the posterior probability of some event, given some sensory data, is proportional to the product of the prior and likelihood
 
The Bayesian claim that will concern us can be stated more specifically as follows: cognitive systems act as if they are inferring the causes of their sensations, that is, inferring the most probable event or hypothesis, given the sensory observation.
This kind of anticipatory engagement evinces a role for statistical models (i.e., probability densities), based on which the relevant predictions can be made, and adaptive actions can be selected. If the organism has access to a model of what states are the most expected, statistically speaking, then it can compare its current state to this model, instead of trying to evaluate how surprised it is relative to all its possible states. Indeed, this evaluation, which involves computing the marginal likelihood or evidence 
, often turns out to be an intractable problem (Friston, 2010; Kiefer & Hohwy, 2018). Most Bayesian schemes in cognitive science suggest that organismic dynamics can be described as bounding surprise by ���guessing��� (i.e., approximating) how surprising their sensory states are, based on statistical models of their predicted sensations ��� hence the appeal to approximate Bayesian inference. These schemes are based implicitly or explicitly on optimising an evidence bound called variational free energy (Friston, Parr, & de Vries, 2017). We now briefly rehearse Bayesian inference to unpack these terms.
In Bayesian cognitive science, the generative model (that comprises a likelihood and prior density) is said to be inverted to give the recognition model (that constitutes a posterior density). A generative model is a probabilistic model, denoted 
, of how sensory observations are generated. It is a statistical mapping from hidden causes s, which include external states of ��� or causes in ��� the environment to sensory observations o. Technically, the generative model is a joint probability distribution or density over hidden causes and observations. We work with generative models more easily when they are expressed in a form amenable to Bayesian parameterisation, as the product of likelihood and a prior
The beliefs harnessed in the recognition and generative models need to be updated to allow for adaptive cognitive processes. There are several ways to implement belief updating. In Bayesian approaches such as predictive coding (Rao & Ballard, 1999) and active inference (Friston, 2010), belief updating entails the formation of posterior beliefs about the causes of sensations, using approximate Bayesian inference. Technically, these (Bayesian) beliefs are referred to as approximate posteriors, variational densities or recognition densities. The recognition model is the inverse of a likelihood model: it is a statistical mapping from observable consequences to hidden causes. This explains why forming a posterior belief is often referred to as model inversion, where
In other words, the recognition model is an approximate posterior probability distribution or Bayesian belief that constitutes the organism���s ���best guess��� about what is causing its sensory states (including the consequences of its own actions). It is called a recognition model because the model allows one to determine ��� that is, to recognise ��� the most likely cause of a given observation. In contemporary belief updating schemes, optimising beliefs involve minimising a quantity called variational free energy
 
 
By construction, variational free energy 
 is an upper bound on negative log evidence, which is also called self-information or surprise in information theory. This means that any system that avoids surprising exchanges with the world (i.e., surprising sensory states) will look as if it is predicting, tracking and minimising a quantity called variational free energy, on average and over time. Variational free energy quantifies the difference between what an organism expects to encounter and what it observes, where observations can be about exteroceptive, interoceptive or proprioceptive causes of input. In this sense, it can be thought of as some generalised prediction error. On this view, all the processes involved in cognition, from perception to learning and action, minimise the difference between expected sensory states (given prior beliefs) and observations, which gives them the look and feel of Bayesian inference.
This optimisation can proceed explicitly as in predictive coding (Rao & Ballard, 1999), belief propagation (Pearl, 1982) and (marginal) neuronal message passing (Parr, Markovic, Kiebel, & Friston, 2019) ��� depending upon the form of the general model and optimisation scheme. Some schemes try to learn a mapping from sensory inputs to the recognition density, assuming the parameters of this implicit recognition model do not change with time or context. This effectively converts an inference problem into a learning problem ��� as seen in earlier formulations like the Helmholtz machine (Dayan, Hinton, Neal, & Zemel, 1995). The more general theme ��� that underwrites approximate Bayesian inference ��� is that we can convert a mathematically intractable inference problem into an optimisation problem by extremizing variational free energy (e.g., by minimising prediction error). Once inference is cast as optimisation, one can then associate the dynamics of any sentient system (e.g., creatures like you and me) as implementing inference, via optimisation through a process known as gradient descent (Friston, 2013).

Bayesian cognitive science interprets the processes of the brain through the lens of Bayesian inference, suggesting that cognitive systems estimate or infer the state of the world based on their sensory observations and pre-existing beliefs or expectations. These pre-existing beliefs are encoded as Bayesian priors, while the updates to beliefs in light of new sensory information are captured by Bayesian posteriors. The generative models in this framework describe how sensory data might be generated from the world, and recognition models are the inverse, used by the brain to infer the cause of sensory inputs.
The recognition model helps the brain to recognize the most likely cause of its sensory states. This process of recognition and belief updating is framed as an optimization problem, where the brain tries to minimize the variational free energy, representing a difference or error between what it expects and what it actually observes.
By continuously updating its beliefs to minimize this prediction error (variational free energy), the brain's processes appear to mirror Bayesian inference, thereby framing cognition as an effort to reduce surprise or uncertainty about sensory information from the environment. This approach connects the computational level of understanding the brain to its physiological aspects, suggesting that cognitive processes can be described as statistical inference problems where the brain aims to optimize its interactions with the environment.
2.2. Generative models as structural representations
In this section, we unpack the notion that generative models are structural representations, which is the critical target of this article. We will focus on the most recent, compelling and engaging defence of this claim, provided by Kiefer and Hohwy (2018, 2019), G��adziejewski and Mi��kowski (2017), and G��adziejewski (2016).
Generally speaking, representations are explanatory constructs that are posited in cognitive science to make sense of the capacity of a cognitive system to engage in intelligent action (Williams & Colling, 2017). In this literature, representations are defined as structures and associated dynamics that are internal to an organism ��� typically, states and processes of their nervous systems, especially their brains. What makes these structures special, and useful in explanation, is that they carry representational content, by virtue of which the organism is able to engage its ecological niche through adaptive behaviour (Boone & Piccinini, 2016; Ramsey, 2007). Representational content is what the representation is about ������that is, in virtue of what they represent what they do, or get to be ���about��� what they are about��� (Kiefer & Hohwy, 2018, p. 2390).
An increasingly popular line of argument holds that the relevant neural structures function as iconic or structural representations that carry structural content. More specifically, structural representations operate via exploitable structural similarity (G��adziejewski, 2016; G��adziejewski & Mi��kowski, 2017; Hohwy, 2014; Kiefer & Hohwy, 2018, 2019). On this account, structural representations get their representational contents (1) from their standing in a relation of structural similarity to the target domain, in the sense that the second-order structural features (e.g., statistical properties; O���Brien & Opie, 2004) of the target domain are recapitulated in, or mirrored by, those of the neural representation and (2) from being exploitable by the organism or agent, in the sense that the information about the target domain encoded in the neural states can be leveraged by the cognitive system to guide intelligent, adaptive behaviour. This exploitable similarity relation is weaker than strict isomorphism, and goes beyond mere resemblance in that it requires that the encoded second-level structural resemblance in question must be causally relevant to the behavioural success of the organism (G��adziejewski & Mi��kowski, 2017; Williams & Colling, 2017). Structural representations are also described (3) as detachable, in the sense that they can be used by the agent to perform cognitive tasks ���offline���, and (4) as affording representational error detection��� in a manner analogous to cartographic maps ��� which allows for coupled adaptive action in the world. This last clause specifies what is at stake in (1) and (2): representational error, here, refers to the idea that the user of representation can ���get it wrong���. The structural representation, like the map, does not itself afford representational error ��� its use by the system does.

The concept of generative models as structural representations is central to understanding how cognitive systems can engage in intelligent, adaptive behavior. Structural representations are internal neural structures that carry information about the external world, allowing organisms to interact effectively with their environment. These representations are 'structural' in the sense that they mirror the statistical properties of the world they represent.
Generative models, within the Bayesian framework, are posited as such structural representations because they have a structure that mirrors or recapitulates the statistical structure of the environment. This structural similarity is not a perfect one-to-one correspondence (isomorphism) but is sufficient to guide adaptive behavior. This means that these models are informative about the world in a way that the brain can exploit for making predictions and guiding behavior.
These models are:
Structurally similar
to the world: The representational content of neural states is derived from their structural resemblance to the statistical properties of the external domain they represent.
Exploitable:
This resemblance is not merely coincidental but can be used by the cognitive system to perform tasks and guide behavior effectively.
Detachable:
They can be used in a decoupled mode, which means cognitive tasks can be performed in the absence of immediate sensory input, allowing for mental simulations or planning.
Error-detecting:
The system can recognize when its predictions (based on these representations) do not match sensory input, enabling it to update its models and improve its interactions with the environment.
This perspective emphasizes the functional role of internal neural states, viewing them not just as by-products of sensory processing but as active constructs that the brain uses to navigate and anticipate the world. The capability of these representations to enable error detection is particularly important because it allows cognitive systems to adjust their internal models and respond adaptively to new information, a key feature of intelligent behavior.
Against representationalist interpretations, we emphasise the subtle, often missed point that the generative model is entailed by the dynamics (i.e., the adaptive behaviour) of the organism. The generative model manifests as a control system that uses exploitable structural similarities encoded in the internal states of the organism. It is not itself a representation, or anything like the vehicle of representational content. Conversely, the recognition density can be cast as having properties similar to those of a structural representation ��� in the sense that has been explored in recent literature on active inference and cognitive representations (e.g., G��adziejewski & Mi��kowski, 2017; Kiefer & Hohwy, 2018). However, this only holds given that exploitable structural similarities are generated and maintained by active inference.
The structures that do encode exploitable structural similarities are the internal states of the Markov blanket, which parameterise a recognition density that the organism embodies, not the generative model. So, representationalists about generative models in active inference conflate quantities that should be held distinct ��� at least in the active inference framework. And this is the category error of these interpretations. Structural representationalism is correct in its ascription to organisms a set of internal (e.g., neural) structures that are apt to encode an exploitable structural resemblance, and which is used in the control of action.
The twist here is that this vindication of a representationalist sounding idea is accomplished by mobilising the resources of its traditional adversary, enactivism. Under the FEP, the organism���s internal states do indeed garner and encode exploitable, action-guiding dynamics about environmental states, as the representationalist maintains. However, they are established and maintained through active inference, that is, through patterns of adaptive action. And crucially, the generative model is nothing like these structures. It cannot be interpreted as representational, even in the weak sense of the proponents of structural representations.
The philosophical implication of conflating the generative process and the recognition density, and missing their role under the FEP, is to misunderstand the role of these constructs in the free energy formulation. A proper understanding of generative models under active inference, we have argued, is that they are ���what an organism (normatively) expects��� and that they guide ���what an organism is and does���. The generative model is therefore instantiated by expectations about how the world should be, where the expectations are conditioned on the adaptive preferences of the organism. This means that the generative model is realised by the embodied activity of an organism. It also suggests that the generative model is a control system that uses exploitable structural similarities encoded in the internal states of the organism. If this is correct, it is an outcome that allows us to accommodate key insights of representationalist views of active inference, without having to accept the claim that generative models are structural representations.
6. Concluding remarks
Although we have focused more narrowly on the active inference formulation in this article, our target and conclusions ultimately speak to much wider issues: the status of one of the most central (philosophical) concepts in the cognitive science ���representation. Crucially, we have argued that, contrary to non-enactive, brain-centred Bayesian schemes such as predictive coding, the Bayesian brain and predictive processing, all of which have been articulated as vindicating the notion of structural representation, this particular reading turns out to be unjustified once we consider the mechanics of active inference under the free energy principle. Specifically, we have argued that the attempted vindication of structural representationalism in Bayesian cognitive science rests on a mistaken interpretation of the generative model and recognition density. Representationalists argue that generative models encode exploitable structural information about the world. Our analysis suggests that this is false. Indeed, in this article we sought to underpin the claim that generative models do not encode anything directly; they are rather expressed in embodied activity, and leverage information encoded in the recognition density (which is an approximate posterior belief or ���best guess���). Assuming our conclusion is correct, our enactive inference proposal serves to free us from a standard, but flawed, philosophical assumption about the nature and explanatory basis of cognition and adaptive behaviour.

This passage argues for a nuanced understanding of generative models in the context of active inference and the Free Energy Principle (FEP) in opposition to representationalist views. The key points can be summarized as follows:
Generative Models as Entailed by Dynamics
: The generative model, according to this view, emerges from the organism's adaptive behavior rather than existing as an independent, representational entity. It is part of a control system rather than a bearer of representational content.
Recognition Density vs. Generative Model
: The recognition density, which is the organism's internal state within the Markov blanket, can be likened to a structural representation because it encodes exploitable structural similarities for active inference. This is distinct from the generative model, which should not be conflated with the recognition density.
Error in Representationalism
: The argument posits that representationalists mistake the role of the generative model, treating it as if it encodes information about the world like a representation, which is considered a categorical error within the framework of active inference.
Generative Models as Expectations
: Instead of being representational, generative models are conceptualized as normative expectations���an organism's assumptions about how the world should be, shaped by its adaptive preferences.
Philosophical Implications
: Misunderstanding the generative model as representational leads to a misinterpretation of the role of constructs within the FEP. This article argues for a view that is more aligned with enactivism, which emphasizes the embodied and active aspects of cognition.
Against Structural Representationalism
: By critically analyzing the notion of representationalism in the context of active inference, this argument rejects the idea that generative models are structural representations. Instead, it suggests that cognition and adaptive behavior are explained by the embodied activity of the organism.
The conclusion emphasizes an enactivist perspective, where cognition is not the result of internal representations but is instead an emergent property of the organism's interactions with its environment, guided by embodied activity and normative expectations rather than by representations. This view challenges the conventional representationalist framework in cognitive science, advocating for a different understanding of cognition that is not dependent on the standard representationalist assumptions.

4 The Generative Models of Active Inference


Every thing should be made as simple as pos si ble, but not simpler. 
��� Albert Einstein 
4.1 Introduction 
This chapter complements the preceding chapters��� conceptual treatment 
of Active Inference with a more formal treatment. Specifically, it sets out 
the relationship between free energy and Bayesian inference, the form of 
the generative models typically used in Active Inference, and the dynamics 
obtained from minimizing free energy for these models. A key focus is on 
how time is represented in a generative model. We will see the distinction 
between generative models formulated in continuous time and those that 
treat time as a sequence of events. Fi nally, we set out the idea of inferential 
message passing, which underwrites prominent theories in neurobiology��� 
including predictive coding. 
4.2 From Bayesian Inference to Free Energy 
In the preceding two chapters, we outlined some of the impor tant connec- 
tions between Active Inference and other established paradigms in the neu- 
rosciences. In chapter 2, we focused on the notion of the Bayesian brain (Knill 
and Pouget 2004, Doya 2007)��� one of its closest relatives��� which provides 
a useful way to think about some of the consequences of active inference 
from a more formal perspective. Specifically, it helps us frame the prob lems 
that an agent engaging in Active Inference must solve. Broadly, these are 
the prob lem of inferring states of the world (perception) and inferring a 
course of action (planning). While it is tempting to equate Bayes optimality with exact Bayesian inference, exact inference is generally computation- 
ally intractable or even infeasible. In cognitive psy chol ogy and artificial 
intelligence applications, it is common to consider bounded forms of infer- 
ence and rationality. We highlighted some examples in chapter 3. Under 
a Bayesian framework, this translates into using approximate inference. 
These methods comprise sampling methods and variational methods���on 
which active inference is based. In this section, we recap the basic ele ments 
of Bayesian inference and its variational manifestations (Beal 2003, Wain- 
wright and Jordan 2008). In doing so, we hope to provide some intuition 
for the role of free energy and to emphasize the importance of generative 
models in drawing inferences about the world. 
This chapter is more technical than chapters 1���3, appealing to a little 
linear algebra, differentiation, and the Taylor series expansion. Those read- 
ers interested in the details or in need of a refresher may turn to the appen- 
dices for the requisite background. Those who do not want to delve into the 
theoretical under pinnings may skip this chapter. Throughout, we explain 
the key implications of each equation���so it should be pos si ble to develop 
an understanding of the impor tant conceptual points herein even without 
following the formal argument. 
A good place to start is Bayes��� theorem. Recall from chapter 2 that this 
theorem expresses an equality between the product of a prior and a like- 
lihood and the product of a posterior and a marginal likelihood. This is 
reproduced in equation 4.1: 
P x( )P 
y|x()= P x|y()P y( ) 
P 
y( )=P 
y,x() 
x 
��� =P y|x()P x( ) 
x 
��� 
(4.1) 
The first line of equation 4.1 is Bayes��� theorem. The second line shows 
that the marginal likelihood (or model evidence), P( y), can be computed 
directly from the prior and likelihood.1 This makes the point that the prior 
and likelihood��� which together comprise the generative model��� are suf- 
ficient for us to compute the model evidence and the posterior probability. 
Despite this, it is not always easy to do so. The summation (or integration, 
if dealing with continuous variables) in equation 4.1 can be computation- 
ally or analytically intractable. One way to resolve this��� the starting point 
of variational inference���is to convert this potentially difficult integration 
prob lem into an optimization prob lem. To understand how this works, we 
need to appeal to Jensen���s in equality, which says that ���the log2 of an average is always greater than or equal to the average of a log.��� Figure 4.1 provides 
a graphical intuition for why this is the case. 
To take advantage of this property, we can rewrite equation 4.1 by multi- 
plying the term inside the sum on the second line by an arbitrary function 
(Q ) divided by itself (this is equivalent to multiplying by one, so the equal- 
ity still holds) and taking the log of each side. Mathematically, this changes 
nothing. However, we can now interpret the expression as an expectation 
(E)3 of a ratio between two probabilities and so exploit Jensen���s in equality: 
lnP(y) = lnP(y,x) 
x 
��� 
Q(x) 
Q(x) 
= lnEQ(x) 
P(y,x) 
Q(x) 
��� ��� ��� 
��� ��� ��� ��� EQ(x)ln 
P(y,x) 
Q(x) 
��� ��� ��� 
��� 
��� 
��� ! ���F[Q,y] 
(4.2) 
The second line of this equation uses the fact that we have a log expecta- 
tion and that, by Jensen���s in equality, this must always be greater than or 
equal to the expectation of the log. This move is sometimes referred to as importance sampling. The right- hand side of this in equality is known as the 
(negative) variational free energy:4 the smaller the free energy, the closer it 
is to the negative log model evidence. With this in mind, we can rewrite 
Bayes��� theorem (equation 4.1) in logarithmic form, take its average under 
the posterior distribution, and disclose the relationship between this and 
the quantities of equation 4.2: 
lnP(x,y) = lnP(y) + lnP(x|y) ��� 
EP(x|y)[lnP(x,y)]= lnP(y) + EP(x|y)[lnP(x|y)] 
EQ(x)[lnP(x,y)]= ���F[Q,y]+ EQ(x)[lnQ(x)] 
(4.3) 
The second line follows from the fact that the log probability of y is not 
a function of x, so taking an expectation under the posterior distribution 
does not change this quantity. Equation 4.3 provides some intuition for 
the roles of the free energy and the Q distribution��� the two quantities that 
were difficult to compute without the variational approximation. The for- 
mer plays the role of the negative log model evidence, while the latter acts 
as if it were the posterior probability. More formally, we can rearrange the 
free energy as we did in chapter 2 to quantify the relationship between free 
energy and model evidence: 
F[Q,y]= DKL[Q(x)|| P(x|y)] 
Divergence 
!"###$### ���lnP(y) 
Log model evidence 
!"# $# 
DKL[Q(x)|| P(x|y)]= EQ(x)lnQ(x) ��� 
lnP(x|y)[] 
(4.4) 
The first line of equation 4.4 shows the free energy expressed in terms of a 
KL- Divergence and a negative log evidence. The KL- Divergence is defined 
in the second line as the expected difference between two log probabilities. 
This is often used as a mea sure of how dif fer ent two probability distribu- 
tions are from one another. 
Sometimes, the use of free energy is motivated directly in terms of this 
divergence. The argument goes that if our aim is to perform approximate 
Bayesian inference, we need to find an approximate posterior that best 
matches the exact posterior. As such, we can select a mea sure of the diver- 
gence between the two���of which the KL- Divergence in equation 4.4 is one 
example��� and minimize this. As we do not know the exact posterior, we 
cannot use this divergence directly. One solution is to add the log evidence 
term, which may be combined with the log posterior to form the joint 
probability (which we do know because this is the generative model). The 
result is the free energy.
ChatGPT
The text you've provided gives a deep dive into the theoretical foundations of active inference, a concept from cognitive neuroscience that suggests that organisms (like humans and other animals) infer the state of the world and decide on actions based on minimizing free energy. This idea is an extension of the Bayesian brain hypothesis, which posits that the brain processes information in a probabilistic, Bayesian manner.
The authors are discussing the mathematical underpinnings of how this principle works, and they introduce key terms and concepts such as:
Generative Models
: These are models that an organism uses to predict sensory input based on causes in the world and are crucial for understanding and interacting with the environment.
Bayesian Inference
: The process by which the brain updates its beliefs in light of new evidence, conforming to Bayes' theorem.
Free Energy
: A quantity that organisms are proposed to minimize to achieve efficient and adaptive behavior. It can be thought of as a measure of surprise or prediction error that organisms strive to minimize over time.
Variational Inference
: A method of approximating complex integrals in Bayesian inference, where exact calculation is intractable. It uses a simpler distribution to approximate the posterior distribution of interest.
Equation 4.1 details Bayes' theorem, which relates the prior distribution and likelihood to the posterior distribution and the marginal likelihood or model evidence. The authors suggest that while the generative model comprises the prior and likelihood, computation of the marginal likelihood and posterior may be complex.
The authors then move on to explain how this computation difficulty can be circumvented using variational inference and Jensen's inequality, which allows transforming the integration problem of computing the marginal likelihood into an optimization problem of minimizing free energy (Equation 4.2). This variational free energy serves as a proxy for the negative log model evidence, indicating how well the model predicts the observed data.
The KL-Divergence (Kullback-Leibler Divergence) is introduced as a way to measure the difference between two probability distributions, specifically between the approximate posterior (Q distribution) and the true posterior. The goal in variational inference is to minimize this divergence, thereby making the approximate posterior as close as possible to the true posterior (Equation 4.4).
Ultimately, the chapter aims to provide the mathematical details necessary to understand the formal aspects of active inference while acknowledging that readers without a strong background in mathematics can still grasp the overarching concepts.
An in ter est ing consequence of this perspective is that there is some 
ambiguity over which divergence mea sure to use. If we want to make the 
approximate and exact posterior as close as pos si ble, we could use the other 
KL- Divergence, where Q and P are swapped, or choose from a large family 
of divergences, each of which emphasizes dif fer ent aspects of the difference 
between distributions. However, the ideas set out in chapter 3 highlight 
the importance of self- evidencing for systems engaging in Active Inference. 
Therefore, we are primarily looking for a tractable evidence maximization 
scheme and only secondarily looking to minimize the divergence. From 
this perspective, there is no ambiguity as to which divergence mea sure to 
use. This emerges from the use of Jensen���s in equality. 
4.3 Generative Models 
To calculate the free energy, we need three things: data, a family of varia- 
tional distributions, and a generative model (comprising a prior and a likeli- 
hood). In this section, we outline two very general sorts of generative model 
used for Active Inference and the form the free energy takes in relation to 
each. The first deals with inferences about categorical variables (e.g., object 
identity) and is formulated as a sequence of events. The second deals with 
inferences about continuous variables (e.g., luminance contrast) and is for- 
mulated in continuous time using stochastic differential equations. Before 
specifying the details of these models, we review a graphical formalism that 
expresses the dependencies implied by a generative model. 
Figure 4.2 shows several examples of generative models expressed as 
factor graphs, chosen to provide some intuition for the sorts of things that 
may be articulated in this way. These represent the factors (e.g., prior and 
likelihood) of a generative model as squares and the variables in that model 
(hidden states or data) in circles. Arrows indicate the direction of causal- 
ity between these variables. The upper- left graph shows the simplest form 
these models can take, with a hidden state (x) causing data ( y). The prior 
in this model is shown as factor 1, and the likelihood is factor 2. The other 
graphs extend this idea by introducing additional variables. In the upper 
right, z plays the role of a second hidden state, so that y depends on the 
states of both x and z.
ChatGPT
The excerpt you provided from the book "Active Inference: The Free Energy Principle in Mind, Brain, and Behavior" elaborates on the application of the Free Energy Principle and Active Inference within cognitive neuroscience. It discusses the technical aspects of using generative models to understand perception and action within the brain's framework.
In the passage, the authors highlight the flexibility of the Free Energy Principle as it relates to the selection of a divergence measure, such as the KL-Divergence, when approximating posterior distributions. The choice of divergence measure can influence the way differences between distributions are emphasized, yet the focus on self-evidencing as described in the previous chapters suggests a preference for tractable evidence maximization over divergence minimization alone.
Furthermore, the text explains the need for three elements to calculate free energy: data, a family of variational distributions, and a generative model. It then introduces two types of generative models used in Active Inference: one for categorical variables modeled as sequences of events, and another for continuous variables modeled in continuous time using stochastic differential equations.
The generative models are depicted through factor graphs that visually represent the probabilistic relationships and dependencies within the model. These factor graphs are an essential tool for illustrating the causal links between variables and factors within the generative model, such as priors and likelihoods. By adding complexity through the introduction of additional variables and states, the models can represent more intricate relationships and dependencies, which, in turn, allows for a richer understanding of the cognitive processes being modeled.

Abstract
According to the predictive processing framework, perception is geared to represent the environment in terms of embodied action opportunities as opposed to objective truth. Here, we argue that such an optimisation is reflected by biases in expectations (i.e., prior predictive information) that facilitate 'useful' inferences of external sensory causes. To support this, we highlight a body of literature suggesting that perception is systematically biased away from accurate estimates under conditions where utility and accuracy conflict with one another. We interpret this to reflect the brain's attempt to adjudicate between conflicting sources of prediction error, as external accuracy is sacrificed to facilitate actions that proactively avoid physiologically surprising outcomes. This carries important theoretical implications and offers new insights into psychopathology
ChatGPT
The abstract you've presented discusses a paper by Joshua M. Martin and colleagues that contributes to the predictive processing framework in neuroscience. This framework posits that the brain is constantly making predictions about incoming sensory information and updating its beliefs based on the prediction errors it encounters.
The key point of the paper is that perception is not just about accurately representing the external world, but is also about preparing for action based on the perceived information. It suggests that the brain has evolved to emphasize utility over accuracy in certain situations. That is, the brain's expectations may be biased in ways that are 'useful' for survival and action, even if these biases lead to perceptions that deviate from objective reality.
For example, when faced with ambiguous sensory information, the brain might prioritize interpretations that have proven useful in the past for guiding actions, even if those interpretations are not the most accurate reflections of the current situation. This 'useful misrepresentation' can be advantageous if it leads to actions that avoid harmful or surprising outcomes.
The authors argue that this perspective can explain why perception is systematically biased in some situations and offer a new way of understanding how the brain balances the need for accurate perception with the need to act effectively in the world. Additionally, the paper suggests that these biases in perception can inform our understanding of psychopathology, where the balance between accurate perception and useful action may be disrupted.
I heard that a baseball moves faster then you can see, so a baseball player might be looking at the pitcher's stance and follow through and so begin to swing before they see the ball's actual trajectory, a kind of proactive inference
ChatGPT
Yes, that's correct. The process you're describing is related to the concept of "predictive coding" or "predictive processing" in the brain. In sports like baseball, the ball can move so fast that the time it takes for the visual information to be processed by the brain is too long for the player to react in time if they relied solely on visual input. Professional players often rely on predictive cues ��� such as the pitcher's arm angle, grip on the ball, and body movement ��� to make inferences about where the ball will be and when. This allows them to initiate a swing before they can actually track the ball's trajectory with their eyes.
By the time the ball is released and moving toward the batter, the player's brain is already using these pre-visual cues to predict the ball's flight path and adjust the swing accordingly. It's a complex skill that combines learned experience (the player's prior knowledge and expectations), real-time visual processing, and motor coordination. These anticipatory skills are honed through repeated practice, allowing players to respond more effectively than if they were to rely on raw visual data alone.
Any other examples of proactive inference
ChatGPT
Certainly, proactive inference is a principle that applies to many aspects of human cognition and behavior, extending well beyond sports. Here are a few other examples:
Driving:
When you're driving, you don't just react to what other cars are doing at the moment; you anticipate what they might do next. For example, if you see a ball roll out into the street, you might slow down in anticipation of a child running after it, even before seeing the child.
Social Interaction:
In conversations, people often anticipate what someone is about to say and start forming a response before the other person has finished speaking. This proactive inference is based on context, body language, tone of voice, and past experience with similar conversations.
Chess and Strategic Games:
Expert chess players can anticipate their opponent's moves several turns in advance. They infer potential strategies and plan their moves accordingly, often reacting not to the current state of the board but to the expected positions several moves ahead.
Economic Decisions:
Investors often make decisions based on their expectations of future market trends and economic indicators, not just the current financial data. They proactively infer which investments might be profitable by anticipating future economic conditions.
Emergency Responses:
First responders in emergency situations use proactive inference to anticipate the development of the situation they are addressing, whether it's a fire, a natural disaster, or a medical emergency, to prepare and execute an effective response plan.
Music Performance:
Musicians, especially those playing in ensembles, must anticipate the timing and dynamics of their fellow musicians to coordinate their parts seamlessly. This anticipation allows for a cohesive performance, even during complex or improvisational pieces.
Learning and Education:
Effective teaching often involves anticipating students' misconceptions and questions, and addressing them proactively in the lesson plan.
These examples show that proactive inference is a fundamental aspect of how humans interact with the world, allowing for fluid and effective actions in complex environments.
And how do these relate to active and enactive inference?
ChatGPT
Active and enactive inference are concepts stemming from a broader theoretical framework in cognitive science and neuroscience that focuses on how organisms interact with their environment. Here���s how the examples I provided relate to these concepts:
Driving:
Active Inference:
The driver actively engages with the environment by steering, accelerating, or braking to minimize uncertainty and ensure safety based on predictions.
Enactive Inference:
The driver embodies their predictions by physically manipulating the car and enacting the inferred safe pathway through traffic.
Social Interaction:
Active Inference:
A person might steer the conversation in a certain direction based on predicted outcomes.
Enactive Inference:
Social norms and gestures are enacted to convey non-verbal predictions or expectations.
Chess and Strategic Games:
Active Inference:
Chess players make moves to probe the opponent's strategy and minimize uncertainty about their intentions.
Enactive Inference:
The player's understanding of the game is enacted through their moves, embodying their strategic predictions.
Economic Decisions:
Active Inference:
Investors choose portfolios based on predicted market behaviors to minimize financial risk.
Enactive Inference:
Investment decisions are an enactment of the investor's model of economic dynamics.
Emergency Responses:
Active Inference:
Responders actively seek information and take actions that will reduce uncertainty about the emergency's evolution.
Enactive Inference:
Their training and intuition are enacted in real-time to manage the emergency effectively.
Music Performance:
Active Inference:
Musicians predict the timing and progression of the music, actively adjusting their play to synchronize with others.
Enactive Inference:
The performance is an enactment of the musicians��� internalized rhythm and harmony predictions.
Learning and Education:
Active Inference:
Teachers design lessons to engage students in a way that anticipates and addresses potential misunderstandings.
Enactive Inference:
The act of teaching itself is an enactment of the teacher's educational predictions and intentions.
In all these examples, active inference involves making predictions about the state of the world and then acting to minimize the error between the predicted and the actual states (prediction error). Enactive inference involves the embodiment of cognitive processes���actions are not just responses to the world, but they also constitute a way of knowing the world. Actions are based on embodied knowledge and serve to bring forth a world that is coherent with the organism���s expectations and intentions.
The distinction between active and enactive inference revolves around differing interpretations of the role that generative models and recognition densities play within the Free-Energy Principle (FEP) framework. Both concepts stem from a Bayesian approach to understanding the brain's interpretation of sensory information and subsequent action, but they emphasize different aspects of this process.

**Active Inference**:
- **Focus**: Active inference is centered on the idea that organisms engage with their environment by minimizing their free energy, which is a measure of surprise or uncertainty. It posits that organisms predict sensory inputs and act to minimize the difference between their predictions and actual sensory inputs.
- **Process**: It involves the selection of actions that make predicted sensory states come true, thus minimizing prediction errors. This includes both perception (interpreting sensory data to update the brain's model of the world) and action (executing movements that reduce the discrepancy between expected and observed states of the world).
- **Framework**: It is considered part of a broader Bayesian cognitive science, often associated with predictive coding and the hierarchical processing of sensory information.

**Enactive Inference**:
- **Focus**: Enactive inference is proposed as a more encompassing process that not only includes the minimization of free energy through prediction and action but also emphasizes the role of the agent's embodiment and its interaction with the environment.
- **Process**: It suggests that cognition is not just about internally minimizing prediction errors but also about engaging in a dynamic, reciprocal relationship with the environment where both the organism and the environment co-evolve. Perception and action are deeply intertwined and cannot be separated; cognition is seen as an active, embodied process that is intrinsically linked to the world the organism inhabits.
- **Framework**: It builds upon the principles of the enactive approach in cognitive science, which argues that cognition arises from the dynamic interactions between an organism and its environment.

In summary, while active inference focuses on the internal processes of prediction and action as mechanisms for minimizing uncertainty or surprise, enactive inference expands this view to incorporate the agent's physical and direct engagement with the world. Enactive inference frames cognition as inherently action-oriented, not merely a computational activity within the brain but as an emergent property of the whole organism-environment system.
ChatGPT
Indeed, you've accurately described how active and enactive inference relate within the Free-Energy Principle framework:
Active Inference
concentrates on how actions are chosen to minimize the expected free energy of future states, effectively reducing surprise and enabling the organism to better predict sensory experiences.
Enactive Inference
emphasizes a broader interaction with the environment, where cognition and action are inseparable. It's not just about reducing surprise internally, but also about the organism's ability to adapt, learn from, and shape its environment through reciprocal interactions.
Both concepts are instrumental in explaining how organisms perceive and act in their environments, but they offer different lenses through which to view these processes. Active inference can be seen as a subset of the larger enactive framework, which also includes the active transformation of the environment and the embodiment of cognitive processes.
And how does behavior as the active control of perception relate?
2 / 2
ChatGPT
Behavior as the active control of perception is a key concept in both active and enactive inference frameworks. Here's how it relates to each:
Active Inference
:
In the active inference framework, behavior is directly aimed at minimizing prediction error between the sensory inputs the brain expects and what it actually perceives. This can involve changing sensory inputs by taking actions���essentially, if the world does not match our predictions, we act to make it match rather than changing the prediction. This process is called perceptual control.
The idea is that we do not passively perceive our environment; instead, we actively sample it in a way that confirms our predictions. For example, we move our eyes to catch sight of what we expect to see.
Enactive Inference
:
The enactive approach extends this idea to argue that behavior and perception are fundamentally intertwined. Behavior is not only about controlling perception to confirm predictions but also about exploring and altering the environment to afford new experiences and learning opportunities.
According to this view, organisms don't just control perception to reduce surprise; they also actively participate in a continuous dialogue with the world, which influences their perceptual fields and the actions they choose to perform.
In summary, behavior as the active control of perception suggests that organisms are not just passive receivers of sensory information but are actively engaged in seeking out and interpreting stimuli in a way that aligns with their internal models of the world. This aligns with the Free-Energy Principle's overall goal of maintaining a coherent and predictable exchange with the environment to ensure the organism's survival and well-being.
Connections to perceptual control theory
ChatGPT
Perceptual Control Theory (PCT) aligns closely with the concepts discussed in active and enactive inference, particularly with the idea of behavior as the active control of perception.
Perceptual Control Theory
:
Core Idea
: PCT posits that behavior is the control of perception. Organisms act to keep their perceptions of the world within acceptable bounds, according to internally set reference values or goals.
Mechanisms
: This theory emphasizes that actions are not responses to stimuli but are instead initiated to maintain certain preferred states of perception. It���s not about reacting to the world but rather acting upon it to make the sensory input match the expectations or 'set points'.
Hierarchy
: PCT also proposes a hierarchy of control systems, where higher-level goals control the set points for lower-level systems, which in turn deal with more immediate perceptual inputs.
Connections to Active and Enactive Inference
:
Minimization of Error
: Like PCT, active inference focuses on the minimization of prediction error. In PCT, the error is the difference between the perceived state and the reference value. In active inference, the error is the difference between predicted and actual sensory inputs.
Behavior as Regulation
: Both theories argue that behavior is not simply a response but a regulation process. Actions are taken to change perceptions to fit with internal models or goals.
Hierarchy and Complexity
: Both PCT and active inference frameworks can accommodate a hierarchical organization of goals or predictions, where higher-level predictions guide lower-level ones.
In essence, PCT provides a control-based explanation for behavior that resonates with the action-oriented perspectives of active and enactive inference within the Free-Energy Principle framework. All these approaches view the organism as an active agent that shapes its perception through its actions to maintain a form of internal coherence or homeostasis.
I decided to call the conversation Protective Inference Examples
ChatGPT
That's a fitting title considering the discussion revolves around various instances where inference plays a crucial role in protecting the organism, either through prediction, action, or embodiment. It encapsulates the idea that
Sorry, I meant "proactive inference examples"
ChatGPT
Understood. "Proactive Inference Examples" would be an apt title to encompass the various scenarios where the brain uses past knowledge and contextual clues to make anticipatory adjustments or decisions, actively shaping perception and action before receiving full sensory input. This includes instances like a baseball player anticipating a pitch, or how we might begin stepping out of the way if we see someone running towards us, even before we can fully assess their trajectory.
A final summary
ChatGPT
Proactive inference is a concept where the brain uses prior knowledge and expectations to predict and act upon sensory information before it is fully processed. It is seen in various examples such as a baseball player swinging at a pitch based on the pitcher's movements or a pedestrian navigating a crowd by anticipating others' paths.
Active and enactive inference are related but distinct concepts within the Free-Energy Principle framework. Active inference focuses on the brain's predictions and actions to minimize prediction errors and uncertainty, while enactive inference extends this by incorporating the agent's interaction with the environment, emphasizing embodied cognition.
Behavior as the active control of perception and perceptual control theory connect to these ideas by positing that behavior is guided by the goal of controlling perception���essentially, the organism acts to make its perceptions match its expectations or reference states.
These concepts collectively describe a proactive approach to cognition, where the brain is not passively reacting to the world but actively engaging with it to shape perception and action in a goal-directed manner.
