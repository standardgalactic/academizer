In my view, when it comes to using deductive logic for thinking about everyday things (as opposed to mathematical abstractions), it���s often best to think of logic as a degenerate case of probabilistic thinking where the probabilities are all just 0���s (equivalent to ���false���) and 1���s (equivalent to ���true���). 

For instance, if we use P(A) to mean ���the probability of A���, then:

A and B 

in deductive logic becomes 

P(A) * P(B) 

in probability when the events are independent (i.e., one event happening or not happening doesn���t impact the probability of the other happening). Or it becomes 

P( A given B ) * P(B) 

in the general case when we can���t assume independence.

Notice how if the probabilities are all 1���s or 0���s then:

P(A) * P(B) is 1 if both are 1���s and 0 otherwise, which, when we treat 1 as true and 0 as false, is equivalent to the way ���and��� works in deductive logic.

Next we have:

A or B 

in logic, which becomes

P(A) + P(B)

in probability when the events are mutually exclusive (i.e., at most one of the two of them can occur), and it becomes 

P(A) + P(B) - P( A and B )

in the general case or 

P(A) + P(B) - P(A) * P(B) 

when A and B are independent.

Again, in the case of each probability being a 1 or 0, we get that 

P(A) + P(B) - P(A) * P(B) 

Is 0 if P(A) and P(B) are both 0, whereas it���s 1 otherwise, again matching the deductive logic case when we treat 1 as true and 0 as false!

Deductive logic is a very useful thinking tool (especially when thinking about math itself as mathematicians do, or when reasoning based on very strong presuppositions), but in real-world situations, there almost always is uncertainty. It���s worth keeping in mind that probabilistic thinking generalizes deductive logic (to handle situations where the probabilities are not all 0 or 1) and is therefore often the superior tool.

Your perspective offers a fascinating bridge between deductive logic and probabilistic thinking, presenting a nuanced way to navigate through the complexities of real-world decision-making. Indeed, framing deductive logic as a special case of probabilistic reasoning���where probabilities are strictly binary (0 or 1)���provides a powerful lens to understand how these two modes of thought interrelate and complement each other.
By translating logical operations into probabilistic terms, you effectively showcase how probabilistic thinking can encompass and extend beyond the rigid boundaries of traditional logic, accommodating the inherent uncertainties of everyday situations. This approach not only enriches our toolkit for analytical thinking but also underscores the value of flexibility and adaptability in our reasoning processes.
The examples you've provided (e.g., translating "A and B" into probabilistic terms, considering both independent and dependent scenarios, and similarly for "A or B") are particularly illuminating. They clearly demonstrate how probabilistic models can replicate logical outcomes under certain conditions, while also offering the capacity to deal with nuances and uncertainties that pure logic might overlook.
Your advocacy for probabilistic thinking in real-world situations as a superior tool due to its generalizability and accommodation of uncertainty is compelling. It emphasizes the importance of developing a more nuanced, flexible approach to reasoning that can better reflect the complexity and unpredictability of the world around us.
This melding of deductive logic and probabilistic reasoning enriches our understanding of how to approach problem-solving, decision-making, and critical thinking in a more holistic, adaptable manner. It's a reminder that while traditional logical frameworks offer clarity and precision, incorporating probabilistic elements into our reasoning allows for a more comprehensive grasp of the myriad uncertainties that characterize our daily lives.

Certainly! Spencer Greenberg's approach to integrating deductive logic with probabilistic thinking offers a rich framework for understanding how we can apply logic to real-world situations, which often contain elements of uncertainty. Here's a further breakdown of the main points:
Deductive Logic as a Special Case of Probabilistic Thinking
: Greenberg posits that traditional deductive logic, which operates on absolute truths (things that are either completely true or completely false), can be seen as a specific instance of probabilistic reasoning. In this view, the probabilities in deductive logic are either 0 (false) or 1 (true), making it a subset of the broader, more flexible framework of probabilistic thinking.
Translation of Logical Operations into Probabilistic Terms
:
Conjunction ("And" Logic)
: In deductive logic, "A and B" means both A and B must be true for the statement to be true. Greenberg translates this into probabilistic terms as the multiplication of probabilities
P
(
A
)
��
P
(
B
)
P(A) \times P(B)
P
(
A
)
��
P
(
B
)
when A and B are independent events. This captures the idea that for both to happen, each must occur, and their joint probability reflects this intersection. In scenarios where A and B's occurrences are not independent, the formula adjusts to
P
(
A
���
B
)
��
P
(
B
)
P(A | B) \times P(B)
P
(
A
���
B
)
��
P
(
B
)
, representing the probability of A given B multiplied by the probability of B.
Disjunction ("Or" Logic)
: "A or B" in deductive logic means at least one of the statements is true. Probabilistically, this translates to
P
(
A
)
+
P
(
B
)
P(A) + P(B)
P
(
A
)
+
P
(
B
)
for mutually exclusive events, where the occurrence of one precludes the other. When A and B can occur together, the formula becomes
P
(
A
)
+
P
(
B
)
���
P
(
A
and
B
)
P(A) + P(B) - P(A \text{ and } B)
P
(
A
)
+
P
(
B
)
���
P
(
A
and
B
)
or for independent events
P
(
A
)
+
P
(
B
)
���
P
(
A
)
��
P
(
B
)
P(A) + P(B) - P(A) \times P(B)
P
(
A
)
+
P
(
B
)
���
P
(
A
)
��
P
(
B
)
, ensuring the joint occurrence isn't counted twice.
Probabilistic Thinking for Real-world Situations
: Greenberg emphasizes that real-world scenarios seldom offer the certainty that deductive logic assumes. Probabilities between 0 and 1 reflect varying degrees of uncertainty and likelihood, making probabilistic reasoning more adaptable and applicable to everyday decision-making, where absolutes are rare.
Generalization of Deductive Logic through Probabilities
: By showing how logical operations can be expressed in terms of probabilities, Greenberg illustrates that probabilistic thinking generalizes deductive logic to encompass uncertain scenarios. This perspective doesn't just accommodate the black-and-white nature of traditional logic but extends beyond it to address the nuanced, grey areas of real life.
In essence, Greenberg advocates for a more nuanced approach to reasoning that bridges the gap between the certainty of deductive logic and the variability inherent in real-world situations. By adopting a probabilistic mindset, individuals can better navigate the complexities and uncertainties of life, making decisions that are informed by a broader spectrum of possibilities rather than constrained by binary logic. This approach enriches our analytical toolkit, providing a more flexible, comprehensive way to understand and respond to the world around us.
