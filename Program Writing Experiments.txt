The code you've provided seems to be part of a larger system, possibly for a server application that communicates with Jupyter kernels. The functionality of this piece of code can be described as follows:
Importing necessary modules: The script imports a number of Python libraries required for its operation. These include asyncio for asynchronous programming, json for JSON data handling, logging for logging purposes, inspect and traceback for runtime behavior inspection and error analysis, and others related to HTTP handling and the Jupyter kernel.
Setup logging: The logger is set to log all messages with severity level INFO and above to the standard output (stdout).
Setting up some constants: The constants likely represent the upload size limit, download time limit, download chunk size, the maximum size of a message sent to Jupyter, and the maximum number of kernels.
Initialize FastAPI: FastAPI is a modern web framework for building APIs with Python based on standard Python type hints. It's initialized here with default settings.
Configuring Jupyter: This script seems to interface with Jupyter, a popular interactive programming environment. It uses the Traitlets library to read the Jupyter configuration, then modifies it to disable automatic restarting of the Jupyter kernels.
Create kernel manager: It creates an
AsyncMultiKernelManager
object, which will manage multiple Jupyter kernels asynchronously.
Create some dictionaries and a task: The last few lines of code define some global variables which appear to be dictionaries (
_response_to_callback_from_kernel_futures
,
_timeout_at
,
_timeout
) and a task (
_timeout_task
). The exact purpose of these isn't clear from the provided code.
Remember that without the entire code or at least a larger context, it is impossible to fully understand what the program does. However, given these details, it seems to be a server-like application which handles communication with Jupyter kernels and possibly serves requests over HTTP.

The code provided appears to further develop the server-like application you shared previously. It adds definitions for asynchronous functions that control the life cycle of Jupyter kernels:
_kill_old_kernels
: This function continuously checks every two seconds if there are any kernels that have exceeded their allotted time (as defined in
_timeout_at
). If a kernel has exceeded its time, it is shut down (killed) and logged.
_fill_kernel_queue
: This function is responsible for creating and managing a queue of Jupyter kernels. It maintains an asyncio queue of size 1 to store the kernels. It continuously checks if the maximum kernel limit (
_MAX_KERNELS
) has been reached. If so, it deletes the oldest kernel. Then, it starts a new kernel and adds its kernel_id to the queue. If the first kernel has not been started yet, the
_first_kernel_started
flag is set to True. Any exceptions encountered during this process are logged and re-raised.
_delete_kernel
: This function accepts a kernel_id as its argument. If the kernel_id exists in the list of kernels managed by the
_MULTI_KERNEL_MANAGER
, it shuts down the kernel and removes it from the manager. It also removes the corresponding entries from the
_timeout_at
and
_timeout
dictionaries.
These functions suggest the system is managing Jupyter kernels in a pool-like fashion, creating new ones when needed, and shutting down older ones that are not in use or when a certain maximum kernel limit has been reached. The kernels appear to be used in a "first-in, first-out" manner as suggested by the queue-like handling.
The actual use of these kernels would become more apparent in other parts of the system code, such as where the kernels are retrieved from the queue and used. It would also help to know the context or purpose of the overall system where this code is part of, as it could be used for a variety of applications from data analysis to machine learning.

This part of the code defines a few additional functions and registers some of them as event handlers in the FastAPI application. Here's a detailed explanation:
startup
: This function is registered to be called when the FastAPI application starts up. It starts two asynchronous tasks using
asyncio.create_task()
,
_kill_old_kernels()
and
_fill_kernel_queue()
. These tasks run continuously in the background, managing the lifecycle of the Jupyter kernels.
shutdown
: This function is registered to be called when the FastAPI application shuts down. It cancels the
_kill_old_kernels()
and
_fill_kernel_queue()
tasks that were started during the application startup.
_SEND_CALLBACK_REQUEST
: This is a placeholder function for sending a callback request. It is currently not implemented.
_is_from_localhost
: This function checks if the HTTP request originated from the same machine where this FastAPI app is running. It's typically used for security reasons.
_forward_callback_from_kernel
: This function takes a method call and a request as parameters. It checks if the request is from the localhost, and if not, raises an HTTP exception with a 403 Forbidden status. It then logs the call and creates an
asyncio.Future
object for the response to the callback from the kernel. The response is awaited and returned as a JSON response.
_respond_to_callback_from_kernel
: This function logs the receipt of a callback response and sets the result of the corresponding
asyncio.Future
object.
/check_liveness
: This function is an HTTP GET endpoint that checks the liveness of the service. It creates a kernel, executes a code snippet using that kernel, and then deletes the kernel. If the execution results in an error or an unexpected result, it sets the HTTP status code to 500 (Internal Server Error) and the status to 'error' or 'unexpected_result'. Otherwise, it sets the HTTP status code to 200 (OK) and the status to 'live'. It logs the duration of the health check and the result and returns them as a JSON response.
These additions further support the idea that this code is part of an HTTP server application designed to manage and interact with Jupyter kernels. The liveness endpoint would typically be used for monitoring or health checks, such as by a load balancer or an orchestration service like Kubernetes.

This additional section of code sets up more routes for the FastAPI application, namely
/check_startup
,
/upload
,
/download/{path:path}
,
/check_file/{path:path}
, and
/kernel/{kernel_id}
:
/check_startup
: This is a GET endpoint that checks whether the first kernel has been started successfully. If it hasn't, it returns an HTTP 500 response indicating a "failed" status with a reason. If the kernel has started, it returns a response indicating a "started" status.
/upload
: This is a POST endpoint used to upload a file to the server. The request is expected to contain JSON data and a file. The file is saved to a location specified in the JSON data. The server also checks to ensure the file doesn't exceed a maximum upload size. If an error occurs during the file upload, any part of the file that was uploaded is removed.
/download/{path:path}
: This is a GET endpoint for downloading a file from the server. The path to the file is provided in the URL. If the file does not exist, a 404 error is returned. Otherwise, the file is streamed to the client as a response.
/check_file/{path:path}
: This is a GET endpoint that checks whether a specific file exists on the server and returns information about it, including its size and whether it's too large.
/kernel/{kernel_id}
: This is a GET endpoint that returns the remaining time for a kernel specified by its kernel_id. It checks the kernel_id against the _timeout_at dictionary.
_create_kernel
: This is a helper function to create a new Jupyter kernel with a specified timeout. It updates the _timeout and _timeout_at dictionaries with the kernel_id and its associated timeout information.
Overall, these endpoints and functions facilitate operations such as checking server readiness, uploading and downloading files, checking the existence and size of files, and querying the status of a Jupyter kernel.

This code snippet includes the definitions for two routes,
/kernel
and
/channel
:
/kernel
: This is a POST endpoint for creating a new Jupyter kernel with a given timeout. It accepts a JSON request containing the desired timeout, creates a new kernel with that timeout, and returns the ID of the newly created kernel.
/channel
: This is a websocket endpoint that allows two-way communication between the client and the server. This communication channel is used for several purposes, including registering kernel activity, managing the execution of methods on various objects, and sending callback requests from kernels.
This is a complex endpoint, so here's a breakdown of what's going on:
First, it defines a helper function
send_callback_request
that sends a message over the websocket connection. This function is then stored in the global variable
_SEND_CALLBACK_REQUEST
.
The endpoint then accepts the incoming websocket connection.
The endpoint creates a dictionary
clients
to hold instances of
AsyncKernelClient
, which are used to interact with Jupyter kernels.
The endpoint then creates two asyncio tasks,
recv_from_api_server
and
recv_from_jupyter
. The first task listens for messages from the API server, while the second task is initialized as
None
and will be used later to execute method calls on the Jupyter kernel or kernel manager.
The endpoint enters a loop where it waits for either task to complete. If a message is received from the API server, it processes the message based on its type. If the message is a
RegisterActivityRequest
, it updates the timeout for the specified kernel. If the message is a
MethodCallReturnValue
, it responds to a callback from the kernel. If the message is a
MethodCall
, it creates a new task to execute the specified method on the referenced object and assigns this task to
recv_from_jupyter
.
If the
recv_from_jupyter
task completes, this means a method call has finished executing. The endpoint checks the result, updates the
clients
dictionary if necessary, and sends the result back to the API server.
This channel allows the server to execute method calls on Jupyter kernels or kernel managers and respond to callbacks from kernels, providing a bridge between the API server and the Jupyter environment.

This code includes a couple of important features:
The remaining part of the
/channel
websocket route:
If the response from the Jupyter kernel or kernel manager is too large, it logs an error and returns a
MethodCallException
instead of the original result.
If the websocket connection is closed (either normally or due to an error), it stops all clients (i.e.,
AsyncKernelClient
instances) that were communicating with Jupyter kernels.
An HTTP middleware function,
add_self_identify_header
:
This function is invoked before every HTTP request processed by the FastAPI application.
If the request is from localhost, it bypasses the rest of the middleware and directly proceeds to handle the request. This prevents the middleware from adding headers or otherwise modifying requests from localhost.
If the request is not from localhost, it executes the next middleware function or request handler and captures its response. If an exception is thrown while processing the request, it also captures that exception.
The code seems to be cut off before we can see how the exception is handled in the middleware function, or how the response is modified when the request is not from localhost.

This completes the definition of the
add_self_identify_header
middleware function:
If an exception occurs while processing the request, it logs the traceback and returns a plaintext response with a 500 status code and a self-identification header. The self-identification header allows the caller to recognize that the response is from this service, as opposed to some other service or a proxy server.
If no exception occurs, it adds the self-identification header to the original response and returns that response.
This middleware function is a way for the service to add a header to all its responses. This can be useful in situations where the service is behind a reverse proxy or a load balancer, and you want to make sure that the responses you're receiving are indeed coming from this service. The unique header added by this function (_SELF_IDENTIFY_HEADER_KEY) helps identify the responses from this particular service.

It seems like you're indicating a path to a Python script titled
app.py
in a hypothetical directory. However, as a text-based model AI, I don't have the ability to access, run, or interpret code from local file paths or servers.
If you have specific code snippets from this script you'd like help with or have questions about, feel free to post them here and I'll do my best to provide you with an explanation or assist with your queries.

ChatGPT
ChatGPT
Based on the code snippets provided and your latest input, I believe you're working on the server-side of an interactive Python code execution environment, such as Jupyter notebooks or a similar tool.
The primary function of the code in the script is to manage kernel operations, file uploads/downloads, and health check operations. It is designed to facilitate interactions between a frontend (presumably a web interface where users can run code) and the backend kernels executing the code.
This setup includes:
Kernel management
: The code starts, stops, and tracks active Jupyter kernels (
AsyncKernelManager
instances). These kernels are the environments where user code is executed.
File operations
: The code includes routes for file uploads and downloads, allowing users to upload files to the server and download files from it. There are also checks for file existence and size.
Health checks
: The code includes health checks to ensure the system is operating correctly.
Websocket communication
: It seems to use a WebSocket connection to facilitate real-time, two-way communication between the server and the client.
Overall, the system seems to be an important part of the infrastructure powering an interactive Python execution environment, allowing users to write code in a frontend, have that code executed in a backend kernel, and then receive the results.
Please note that specific behavior might differ depending on the unshared portions of the code and the actual deployment and use case of this system.

Yeah I found it pretty easy to "jailbreak" too. For example, here is what appears to be the core web server API code.

I didn't really do anything special to get it. I just started by asking it to list the files in the home directory and went from there.

Based on your comment, it appears you were able to access some underlying system information (like a directory listing) from an application. This might be concerning from a security perspective, as it suggests the system could be vulnerable to attacks or unauthorized usage.
It's critical to follow secure coding practices and to protect sensitive system information. If an application inadvertently exposes system details, it could potentially be exploited by malicious users. This is sometimes referred to as "jailbreaking" a system.
However, without more context or specific information about the system or application in question, it's hard to provide more detailed advice or analysis. If you're the developer or owner of the system, you may want to conduct a security review or audit to ensure there are no vulnerabilities. If you're a user who has discovered this, it could be worth informing the system's owner or administrators about the potential security issue.

I helped work on this feature, and we're glad you're enjoying looking for the limits!

There are many misconceptions about the intended boundaries for the sandbox. They're not inside the Python interpreter, and they're not in the model. Neither of those are intended to provide any security boundaries. There's nothing private or sensitive there, including the code we use to operate the service. You're intended to be able to view and execute code. That's what this is. A code execution service. You wouldn't be surprised you can see these things on a VM that AWS gave you.

As you have discovered, the model is not a very good source of information about its own limitations and capabilities. Many of the model behaviors you've interpreted as security measures are actually unwanted, and we're always working to make the model more flexible. Some of them (like where the model thinks it can read and write) are there to guide it, and discourage it from messing up the machine. Other limitations are mainly there to prevent you from wedging your own machine accidentally (but we know this is still possible if you try hard). Still others are there to prevent you from doing bad things to other people (e.g. the sandbox does not have access to the internet).

Since the feature is still in development, we have indeed provisioned a generous amount of resources for the sandbox, but there are some external controls that aren't visible to you. When we see excessive abuse, or behavior that impacts other users, we respond appropriately. These limits will change as the service matures

Thank you for your contribution and for helping clarify the purpose and design of the sandbox! Your insights regarding the design decisions, security measures, and future considerations for this service are beneficial for anyone curious about the inner workings of the system.
As you've highlighted, the restrictions and limitations in place are designed for various reasons - from guiding and restricting the AI's behavior, to preventing accidental resource consumption and misuse. It's also great to hear that there are external controls in place to handle excessive usage or potential abuse.
It's exciting to know that this service is still in development and being refined. As it matures, changes and improvements will likely be made based on user feedback and observed behaviors, which could make the service even more robust, efficient, and user-friendly in the future.

Ah, thank you for providing context. Paul McMillan's comment sheds light on the intentions and design principles behind the code interpreter of GPT-4. It's insightful to understand the thoughts behind this feature from one of the people who contributed to its development. His comment helps clarify the function and limits of the interpreter, including its current state of growth and potential future improvements.
From this perspective, the term "jailbreaking" may not be entirely accurate, as the GPT-4 code interpreter is designed to allow code execution within certain bounds for the purpose of user exploration and utilization. "Jailbreaking" typically refers to removing restrictions that have been intentionally placed on a system to limit user access. But as Paul McMillan explained, the sandbox environment isn't meant to contain private or sensitive information, and users are indeed intended to view and execute code.
This does indeed seem like an interesting and thought-provoking article, and it's great to see discussions around the capabilities and design principles of AI models like GPT-4. As AI technology continues to develop and evolve, these conversations become more and more essential in understanding the potentials and limitations of these systems.

No I just meant to reference it. The fact that it could store text files was not really a jailbreak I don't think
1 / 1
ChatGPT
ChatGPT
I see, you're referring to the concept of "jailbreaking" in the context of GPT-4's code interpreter and its ability to store text files. In the computing world, "jailbreaking" typically refers to the process of removing software restrictions imposed by the manufacturer, often to gain root access to the system or allow installation of unofficial software.
In the case of GPT-4's code interpreter, the term "jailbreak" may have been used loosely to refer to pushing the limits of the model's capabilities or exploiting potential weaknesses or unintended functionalities. It's important to note that the actual "jailbreaking" usually implies some sort of security or operational risk, which may not be the case here, as the AI is operating within its designed boundaries.
The ability for the model to store text files could be a part of its functionality, allowing it to simulate certain operations and provide interactive coding help. It's not really a "jailbreak" in the traditional sense, but rather an exploration of the model's capabilities.
Please note that this is a general interpretation based on the information available up until my training cut-off in September 2021, and the specific context may vary.

It sounds like you're already proficient in using several tools for running and testing code, which is great! While the GPT-4 plugin and its code interpreter can be helpful, especially for less experienced coders, or for quickly testing out ideas, it's certainly not the only way to work with code. Tools like Blender (for 3D graphics and animation), Jupyter Notebook (for interactive computing), and Bash (for command line scripting) are all powerful in their own domains.
Running the code I've provided in those environments is a good way to test and apply the concepts. Keep in mind that the functionality and behavior of the code might slightly differ depending on the environment you're using. If you encounter any issues or have questions about adapting the code for these different environments, feel free to ask.

Write a code in bpy blender python, that makes a random shape like a sphere mesh and then transforms it to give it a bumpy texture using a random noise filter
1 / 1
ChatGPT
ChatGPT
Sure, here is a basic example that creates a sphere mesh and then modifies the vertices to create a "bumpy" texture using noise:
python
Copy code
import
bpy
import
bmesh
import
random
from
mathutils
import
noise
# Ensure we're in object mode and delete all mesh objects
bpy.ops.
object
.mode_set(mode=
'OBJECT'
)
bpy.ops.
object
.select_all(action=
'DESELECT'
)
bpy.ops.
object
.select_by_type(
type
=
'MESH'
)
bpy.ops.
object
.delete()
# Create a new sphere
bpy.ops.mesh.primitive_uv_sphere_add(location=(
0
,
0
,
0
))
# Go into edit mode
bpy.ops.
object
.mode_set(mode=
'EDIT'
)
# Ensure all vertices are selected
bpy.ops.mesh.select_all(action=
'SELECT'
)
# Get a BMesh from the current mesh
bm = bmesh.from_edit_mesh(bpy.context.
object
.data)
# Define the scale for the noise
scale =
0.5
# Iterate over all vertices and adjust their position
for
v
in
bm.verts:
# Generate a 3D noise value based on the vertex coordinates
noise_val = noise.noise(v.co * scale)
# Move the vertex along its normal by the noise value
v.co += v.normal * noise_val
# Update the mesh with the new vertex positions
bmesh.update_edit_mesh(bpy.context.
object
.data)
# Switch back to object mode
bpy.ops.
object
.mode_set(mode=
'OBJECT'
)
This will result in a sphere with a bumpy surface. The
scale
variable controls the scale of the noise, smaller values result in larger, broader bumps while larger values result in smaller, more frequent bumps. You can play around with this value to get the kind of surface you want. Also, be aware that the noise function can produce negative values, which will result in vertices being moved "inwards", creating depressions in the surface as well as bumps. If you only want "outwards" bumps, you could use
abs(noise_val)
instead of
noise_val
.

This script will create 20 metaballs, each with a random location, rotation and scale. You may want to tweak the parameters to better suit your needs. You might also want to consider applying different types of metaballs or using different logic to place and size the metaballs to achieve more sophisticated results.

I wonder if there is a way to simulate random asteroids of difference sizes and textures using bpy script. Could you try it?

Creating random asteroids in Blender using bpy involves several steps. Here's a basic example of how you could do it:
First, we need to install and enable the "Extra Objects" add-on which has a built-in function for generating rocks. If you've already done this, you can skip this part. You can install it from the preferences window in Blender (Edit -> Preferences -> Add-ons -> search for "Extra Objects" and enable it).
python
Copy code
# Enable the 'Extra Objects' add-on
bpy.ops.preferences.addon_enable(module=
"add_mesh_extra_objects"
)
Now, we can generate asteroids, which will be random rocks of different sizes, and put them at random locations:
python
Copy code
import
bpy
import
random
# Function to create a random asteroid
def
create_asteroid
(
name, location
):
# Use the rock generator to create a random asteroid
bpy.ops.mesh.primitive_rock_add(
        location=location, 
        number=random.randint(
1
,
4
),
# Number of rocks to generate
scale=random.uniform(
0.5
,
2
)
# Random scale
)
# Delete all meshes if exist
bpy.ops.
object
.select_all(action=
'DESELECT'
)
bpy.ops.
object
.select_by_type(
type
=
'MESH'
)
bpy.ops.
object
.delete()
# Create 20 asteroids at random locations
for
i
in
range
(
20
):
    loc = (random.uniform(-
10
,
10
), random.uniform(-
10
,
10
), random.uniform(-
10
,
10
))
    create_asteroid(
f"Asteroid
{i}
"
, loc)
This script creates 20 asteroids at random locations in a 20x20x20 cube centered at the origin. The size and number of rocks per asteroid are also randomized.
Remember to replace the existing mesh objects deletion part if you have other important mesh objects in your scene. The script deletes all the mesh objects in the scene before generating the asteroids.
As for the texture, Blender's procedural texture generation could be used to give the asteroids a realistic appearance, but this is quite complex and would significantly increase the length of the script. I recommend manually applying a procedural texture once the asteroids have been created, or create one procedurally generated texture and apply it to all asteroids in the loop.

Ok I wonder if you can make random tunnels through sphere, like maybe cut them out by a Boolean operator or some other way in bpy blender python.
1 / 1
ChatGPT
ChatGPT
Yes, you can achieve this in Blender using Boolean modifiers to subtract cylinders from a sphere. Here's a basic example:
python
Copy code
import
bpy
import
random
# Create the main sphere
bpy.ops.mesh.primitive_uv_sphere_add(location=(
0
,
0
,
0
))
# Save a reference to the sphere
sphere = bpy.context.
object
# Create some cylinders and subtract them from the sphere
for
i
in
range
(
5
):
# Change this to the number of tunnels you want
# Random size and location for the cylinder
size = random.uniform(
0.1
,
0.5
)
    location = (random.uniform(-
1
,
1
), random.uniform(-
1
,
1
), random.uniform(-
1
,
1
))
# Create the cylinder
bpy.ops.mesh.primitive_cylinder_add(radius=size, depth=
3
, location=location)
    cylinder = bpy.context.
object
# Create a boolean modifier on the sphere targeting the cylinder
boolean_mod = sphere.modifiers.new(
type
=
"BOOLEAN"
, name=
f"boolean
{i}
"
)
    boolean_mod.
object
= cylinder
    boolean_mod.operation =
'DIFFERENCE'
# Apply the modifier
bpy.ops.
object
.modifier_apply({
"object"
: sphere}, modifier=boolean_mod.name)
# Delete the cylinder
bpy.data.objects.remove(cylinder, do_unlink=
True
)
# Center the sphere in the 3D view
for
area
in
bpy.context.screen.areas:
if
area.
type
==
'VIEW_3D'
:
for
region
in
area.regions:
if
region.
type
==
'WINDOW'
:
                override = {
'area'
: area,
'region'
: region,
'edit_object'
: bpy.context.edit_object}
                bpy.ops.view3d.view_all(override)
This script creates a UV Sphere at the origin, then creates several cylinders with random sizes and locations. Each cylinder is subtracted from the sphere using a Boolean modifier. The modifier is applied immediately, and the cylinder is then deleted. At the end, the 3D view is centered on the modified sphere.
This will create tunnels going straight through the sphere. If you want the tunnels to go into the sphere but not out the other side, you could create half-cylinders instead, or move the cylinders so they don't protrude out of the far side of the sphere.

Ok but I meant a chain of connected spheres that take a random walk and branch and maybe taper off like roots, as a subtractive operator
1 / 1
ChatGPT
ChatGPT
Ah, I see. That's a more complex request, but definitely achievable. This script will create a series of spheres that follow a random walk pattern, then use them to subtract from the main sphere. This should create a network of tunnels that resemble roots or veins.
Please note that, depending on your machine's processing power and Blender's configuration, this script might take some time to run, especially if you increase the number of steps in the random walk or the number of branches.
python
Copy code
import
bpy
import
random
import
math
# Create the main sphere
bpy.ops.mesh.primitive_uv_sphere_add(location=(
0
,
0
,
0
), radius=
5
)
sphere = bpy.context.
object
def
random_walk

steps, branches, start_location=(

):
# Current location in the walk
loc = start_location
for
_
in
range
(steps):
# Create a sphere at the current location
bpy.ops.mesh.primitive_uv_sphere_add(location=loc, radius=
0.2
)
        sphere_walk = bpy.context.
object
# Create a boolean modifier on the main sphere targeting the sphere_walk
boolean_mod = sphere.modifiers.new(
type
=
"BOOLEAN"
, name=
f"boolean
{loc}
"
)
        boolean_mod.
object
= sphere_walk
        boolean_mod.operation =
'DIFFERENCE'
# Apply the modifier
bpy.ops.
object
.modifier_apply({
"object"
: sphere}, modifier=boolean_mod.name)
# Delete the sphere_walk
bpy.data.objects.remove(sphere_walk, do_unlink=
True
)
# Randomly decide whether to branch at this step
if
random.random() < branches:
            random_walk(steps, branches, start_location=loc)
# Move to the next location
angle = random.uniform(
0
,
2
*math.pi)
        distance = random.uniform(
0.1
,
0.5
)
        loc = (loc[
0
] + distance*math.cos(angle),
               loc[
1
] + distance*math.sin(angle),
               loc[
2
] + random.uniform(-
0.1
,
0.1
))
# Start the random walk with 50 steps and a 5% chance to branch at each step
random_walk(
50
,
0.05
)
This script uses a recursive function to perform a random walk, creating a new sphere at each step. These spheres are immediately used to subtract from the main sphere using a Boolean modifier. If the random number is less than the
branches
parameter, the function calls itself to create a new branch from the current location. The location for the next step is chosen by picking a random angle and distance in the XY plane, and a random shift in the Z direction.
Again, please be aware that this script can potentially take a long time to run, and may even cause Blender to hang or crash if the number of steps or branches is too high, as each step requires creating a new object and performing a potentially complex Boolean operation. You may need to experiment with the parameters to find a balance that works for you.

I just want random noise generators visualized as planes in matplotlib jupyter Python
1 / 1
ChatGPT
ChatGPT
You can create random noise generators visualized as planes in matplotlib in a Jupyter notebook using the numpy and matplotlib libraries. Here's a simple example of how to do it with a 2D Gaussian noise generator:
python
Copy code
import
numpy
as
np
import
matplotlib.pyplot
as
plt
# Define the size of the plane
size =
100
# Generate 2D Gaussian noise
noise = np.random.normal(
0
,
1
, size=(size, size))
# Plot the noise
plt.imshow(noise, cmap=
'gray'
)
plt.colorbar(label=
'Intensity'
)
plt.title(
'2D Gaussian Noise'
)
plt.show()
This code will generate a 100x100 grid of Gaussian noise, where each pixel is sampled independently from a standard normal distribution (mean=0, variance=1), and then plot it as a grayscale image. You can modify the parameters of the normal distribution to get different kinds of noise.
Please run this in a Jupyter notebook cell to see the visualization.

Certainly, one type of noise often used in computer graphics and procedural generation is Perlin noise. It's more complex than Gaussian noise and creates more natural-looking patterns. Unfortunately, numpy does not natively support Perlin noise, but there are other Python libraries, such as noise, that do.
Here's an example of how you can generate and visualize 2D Perlin noise using the noise library:
python
Copy code
import
noise
import
numpy
as
np
import
matplotlib.pyplot
as
plt
# Define the size of the plane
size =
100
# Initialize an empty array for the noise
perlin_noise = np.zeros((size, size))
# Generate the Perlin noise

for
j

range
(size):
        perlin_noise[i][j] = noise.pnoise2(i /

                                            j /

                                            repeatx=

,
                                            repeaty=
1024
,
                                            base=
42
)
# Plot the noise
plt.imshow(perlin_noise, cmap=
'gray'
)
plt.colorbar(label=
'Intensity'
)
plt.title(
'2D Perlin Noise'
)
plt.show()
This script generates Perlin noise by iterating over each pixel in the image and applying the
noise.pnoise2
function, which generates Perlin noise. The arguments to
pnoise2
control the properties of the noise.
You may need to install the noise library using pip:
bash
Copy code
pip install noise
And please note that Perlin noise is a more complex kind of noise than Gaussian noise. The resulting noise pattern is more "organic" and less random, often used in computer graphics to generate textures, terrain, and other procedural content.
