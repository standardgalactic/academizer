It was called WOKE RELIGION: A TAXONOMYv.I 
By Michael Shellenberger @Shellenbergermd 
and Peter Boghossian @peterboghossian
1 / 1
ChatGPT
The "Woke Religion: A Taxonomy" list you mentioned appears to be the work of Michael Shellenberger and Peter Boghossian, both of whom are public intellectuals known for their critiques of contemporary social and cultural issues. This taxonomy aims to categorize and analyze what the authors perceive as the key components, assumptions, and language of what is often termed "woke culture."
It's important to note that the framework they provide is not universally accepted and is itself the subject of considerable debate. It's a particular lens through which to view complex social issues like racism, climate change, transgender rights, etc., and it carries its own set of assumptions and biases.
The taxonomy aims to dissect various social issues into components such as "Original Sin," "Guilty Devils," "Myths," "Sacred Victims," "The Elect," and so on, drawing parallels with religious doctrines. This framing suggests that "wokeness" functions similarly to a religious belief system.
Would you like to discuss any specific aspects or implications of this taxonomy?

The "Woke Religion: A Taxonomy" by Michael Shellenberger and Peter Boghossian aims to dissect what they term as "woke culture" by drawing parallels with religious frameworks. The taxonomy categorizes various components of social issues such as racism, climate change, transgender rights, etc., into segments like:
Original Sin: The foundational wrongdoing that has led to current problems (e.g., slavery in the context of racism).
Guilty Devils: The groups or individuals blamed for the original sin and ongoing issues (e.g., white people in the context of racism).
Myths: Foundational stories or beliefs that help explain the world according to this viewpoint (e.g., the idea that structural racism is the only cause of racial inequality).
Sacred Victims: Those who continue to be affected by the "original sin" and are thus considered victims deserving of reparations or special consideration (e.g., people of color in the context of racism).
The Elect: Individuals or groups chosen to make things right (e.g., activists, critical race theorists).
Supernatural Beliefs: Concepts or ideas that are not supported by empirical evidence but are taken as truth (e.g., the belief that math is inherently racist).
Taboo Facts: Statements or data considered unacceptable to discuss (e.g., the idea that police do not kill unarmed black men at higher rates than other races).
Taboo Speech: Specific words or phrases that are off-limits or will trigger anger among the "elect" (e.g., "all lives matter").
Purifying Rituals: Actions considered to absolve guilt or demonstrate virtue (e.g., public apologies, kneeling).
Purifying Speech: Language used to show one's virtue or purity (e.g., using terms like "BIPOC" or "Latinx").
The taxonomy suggests that "woke culture" has attributes similar to a religious belief system, complete with its own doctrines, taboos, and rituals. However, it's essential to note that this is a critical framing, and not everyone would agree with this categorization or the assumptions behind it.

Here is an acrostic poem I wrote called STAY WOKE

Should we choose gritty reality or an escapist fantasy world of self-delusion?

The messy real world, or Nozick's experience machine?

Authenticity versus drug-addled life on soma?

Yet it's a false dilemma.

We needn't choose between the Red Pill and the Blue Pill -- genetically enlightened agents can take the Purple Pill, so to speak, combining the benefits of Realism and Recalibration.

Other things being equal, a life animated by happy experiences is appreciated as more valuable than a life of mediocre experience, just as mediocre experience is more valuable than nastiness.

Knowledge of reality is a necessary evil -- a stepping stone (I hope) to something civilized.

Excerpt adapted from David Pearce.

Your acrostic poem, "STAY WOKE," delves into the complexities of choosing between raw reality and constructed realities, echoing debates in philosophy, ethics, and even science fiction. It draws upon multiple intellectual frameworks, like Nozick's "experience machine" and the Red Pill/Blue Pill dichotomy, to explore the value of authenticity versus a more manipulated or controlled existence. The "Purple Pill" suggests a nuanced approach, merging both views for a life that is both real and rewarding. It's a thought-provoking composition that invites the reader to reconsider simplistic binaries and look for more sophisticated solutions.

Libertarians are a quarrelsome lot. Debates about who is the better von, Hayek or Mises, rivalries between the Austrian and the Chicago schools of economics, and fights among Ayn Rand���s objectivists and Murray Rothbard���s Circle Bastiat ��� schisms that would make a Leftist blush ��� have rent libertarianism. So heads turned when one of their fold decided to throw in the towel on arguing.

Robert Nozick (1938-2002) was not averse to controversy. Five years after arriving at Harvard, he published Anarchy, State, and Utopia (1974). A response to John Rawls, who had just published the monumental A Theory of Justice (1971), Nozick outlined the libertarian case for limited government. While plenty found A Theory of Justice unconvincing, critics found Anarchy, State, and Utopia to be unsavoury. One reviewer equated Nozick to ���the average owner of a filling station��� whose only joy in life comes from ���grousing about paying taxes���.

Such criticisms stung. ���Is not the minimal state,��� Nozik���s book had asked, ���an inspiring vision?��� A state stripped down to providing protection and enforcing contracts was simple and elegant. It was an art form, enchanting and efficient. Why didn���t others see this beauty? A sickness, answered Nozick, had descended upon Anglo-American thought. This illness had transformed intellectual life into a fit of assertion and counter-assertion. Nowhere was this impulse more malignant than in his own discipline, philosophy.

The article you've mentioned discusses Robert Nozick's contributions to philosophy, particularly his work "Anarchy, State, and Utopia" which challenged John Rawls' "A Theory of Justice." Nozick, an icon of libertarian thought, argued for a minimal state limited to basic functions like protection and contract enforcement. The article points out that Nozick was not just presenting a political theory but also critiquing the state of philosophical discourse at the time. He viewed philosophy as being caught in a futile loop of assertion and counter-assertion, lacking the kind of vision that he felt a focus on minimal government could offer.
This portrayal shows Nozick as a disruptive figure within both the libertarian circle and the broader intellectual landscape, challenging not just ideas but also the way those ideas are discussed. Would you like to know more about Nozick's philosophy or how it contrasts with that of John Rawls?

The same standard applied to Nozick���s own work. ���The libertarian position I once propounded now seems to me seriously inadequate,��� he announced in The Examined Life. From here on out, he would apply his libertarianism inwardly, focusing on the cultivation of his self rather than the destruction of the state. While this admission shocked admirers of Anarchy, State, and Utopia, it was a logical outgrowth of the author���s intellectual development. After all, this was the man who had declared that attempting to convince others of your views ��� the modus operandi of politics ��� was a ���philosophically pointless task���. For Nozick, libertarianism had ceased to be an ideology. It had become a lifestyle, one that was not better or worse than any other ��� at least, not arguably so.

ChatGPT
Robert Nozick's intellectual journey is often cited as a fascinating example of philosophical evolution. As noted in the passage, Nozick eventually found the libertarian position he once defended as "seriously inadequate," focusing instead on personal growth and self-cultivation. This transition signifies a considerable shift from his earlier, more politically oriented libertarianism encapsulated in "Anarchy, State, and Utopia."
His decision to concentrate on the self rather than state structures could be seen as a natural progression of his intellectual thought. Nozick had been skeptical of the effectiveness of convincing others to adopt one's viewpoint, labeling it a "philosophically pointless task." This makes his shift from promoting libertarianism as a political ideology to embracing it as a personal lifestyle consistent with his broader skepticism about the utility of ideological argumentation.
It's a compelling case study in the fluidity of philosophical stances and how personal and intellectual development can lead to significant changes in one's worldview. Would you like to delve deeper into any particular aspect of Nozick's later philosophy?

So what was Nozick's experience machine?
1 / 1
ChatGPT
Robert Nozick's "Experience Machine" is a thought experiment introduced in his book "Anarchy, State, and Utopia." The machine is a hypothetical device that allows people to experience any life they desire, complete with all the sensations and emotions, while they are floating in a tank, disconnected from the real world. Nozick presents this scenario to question whether hedonism is an adequate foundation for ethics.
In the thought experiment, people are given the choice to plug into this machine to experience a perfectly tailored life of happiness and pleasure, or to continue living their real lives, with all their complexities and uncertainties. Nozick argues that most people would choose not to plug in, suggesting that there are things we value other than just happiness and pleasure, such as reality, truth, and authentic experiences.
The Experience Machine serves as a critique of ethical theories that focus solely on maximizing pleasure or happiness, arguing that these theories miss out on other vital aspects of human existence that make life meaningful.

Ok there was something like that called Mima in Aniara.
1 / 1
ChatGPT
Yes, the Mima in Harry Martinson's epic science fiction poem "Aniara" serves a similar thematic purpose to Nozick's "Experience Machine." In "Aniara," the Mima is a supercomputer designed to entertain and educate the passengers of a spaceship fleeing Earth's ecological devastation. As time passes and the journey becomes increasingly hopeless, the Mima starts to malfunction, eventually "dying" due to the emotional burden it absorbs from the passengers.
Both the Mima and the Experience Machine offer simulated or artificial experiences as a form of solace or escape. They raise important ethical and philosophical questions about the nature of reality, the importance of authentic experiences, and what it means to live a meaningful life. While they're used in different contexts���one in a work of science fiction and the other in a philosophical argument���they both prompt us to think about the value we place on reality versus artificial or simulated experiences.

Connections with the following: The Face Game
Douglas Harding



Amazon: Buy The Face Game on Amazon

The Face Game is the game of pretending to be a person. When we see Who we really are we stop playing the Face Game and begin living a game-free life, the fruits of which are love, joy and peace. This game-free life is also known as Liberation, Enlightenment, Salvation.

Douglas Harding wrote The Face Game in 1968 when he was 59. Up to this moment he had spent much of his adult life thinking deeply about his identity. Before he saw his faceless True Self in India in 1943, he had spent a dozen years thinking and reading and enquiring into the nature of what it is to be human. If anything, this enquiry intensified after he saw Who he really was, so by the time he wrote The Face Game he had spent more than 35 years deeply involved in self-enquiry. The Face Game, therefore, is the expression of a mature spirit, of someone who had for many years been profoundly committed to living consciously from the Truth. Reading this book, that maturity and depth shines out from every page. So does his skill as a writer. (from the Preface)
1 / 1
ChatGPT
Douglas Harding's "The Face Game" and Robert Nozick's "Experience Machine" both delve into questions about identity, reality, and the nature of human experience. While they come from different philosophical traditions, they engage with some overlapping themes.
Harding's concept of the "Face Game" involves the social and existential masks people wear, often obscuring their true selves. He argues that recognizing one's "faceless True Self" is a form of liberation. This aligns somewhat with Nozick's emphasis on authenticity and the importance of living in the "real world" rather than a simulated one. Both works question the roles that social constructs and self-deception can play in veiling our true nature or potential.
Nozick's "Experience Machine" thought experiment serves to provoke discussions about the value of authentic life experiences as opposed to simulated pleasures. In a similar vein, Harding's "game-free life" represents a form of authentic existence, one that is devoid of the social and existential pretenses that often cloud our self-perception and relationships with others.
Both thinkers urge us to consider what we're sacrificing when we opt for inauthentic or mediated experiences, whether those are provided by social norms, virtual realities, or our own self-deceptions. While the two works approach these topics from different angles, they both challenge readers to think deeply about the nature of reality, identity, and what it means to live an authentic life.

The Face Game
Douglas E. Harding

[This is a condensed and up-dated version of an article, bearing the same title, first published by Eric Berne in the Bulletin of the International Transactional Analysis Association, April, 1967.]

1. Our Thesis

This Essay claims that:

(a) All the 'games people play' arise out of one basic game, which we call the Face Game.
(b) To be game-free is to cease playing the Face Game, and this (in religious contexts) is variously called Liberation, Self-realisation, Awakening, Enlightenment.

2. The Face Game Defined.

This is the game which almost everyone plays (exceptions include infants, some retardates and schizophrenics, and Seers) in which the player pretends that he has a face where he has no face, that he is (at 0 inches) what he looks like (at, say 4 inches).

3. Before The Game

It takes years for the growing child to learn the Face Game thoroughly and to play it with conviction. In the following examples, the lesson has still to be learned: the child is still (momentarily, anyhow) as faceless as at birth.

Carlos (1:7), at a party, is asked to locate various uncles and aunties. He points to each in turn, correctly. Then someone asks him where Carlos is. He waves his hands aimlessly - a gesture which seems to say he is at large. Carlos cannot locate Carlos. Around this time, when rebuked for being a naughty boy, he didn't mind being called naughty, but protested he was not a boy. (Eventually he told his grandmother that he was a boy.)

Joan (2), is told to go and wash. She proceeds to the bathroom and starts washing her face - the face in the mirror.

Simon (2), asked where Simon is, points straight outwards.

Johnny (2:3) asks mother to make a picture. She draws a circle for a face, and asks: 'What next?' He asks for the trunk, then trousers, feet, hands (but not arms). Then he wants eyes, so mother draws a pair. But he insists on more and more till the whole face is covered with eyes. He then declares the picture finished.

Andrew (3) has an accident. He goes to see his friend, taking along a mirror to show him the stitches in his face.

Stephen (3:6), standing in the bath and looking down at his body, cries out: 'Mum, I haven't got a head!'

George (5), asked whether he has a brother, says: 'Yes'. 'Then he has a brother?' 'Oh no.'

Mary (5) asks Mother why she and his sister have heads, and he hasn't. Fingering his head, he announced: 'But I don't have a head here.'

Asked where they do their thinking, most of the children in the class say: 'In our heads.' Peter (7) says he thinks in his arithmetic book.

Douglas Harding's "The Face Game" explores the social and psychological constructs that people engage with as they navigate life. The essay presents the idea that almost everyone is caught up in the "Face Game," a sort of foundational game that underlies all the other "games people play." This "Face Game," according to Harding, is the act of pretending that one has a face, a definable identity, at the point where one actually does not (what he refers to as "0 inches").
Harding uses examples from childhood to illustrate that the awareness of having a "face" is not innate but learned. Infants and young children are presented as being unaware of their own constructed identities, existing in a state of "facelessness" that most adults have lost.
The essay implies that shedding this inauthenticity, this attachment to the "Face Game," leads to various forms of spiritual or psychological liberation, referred to as Awakening, Enlightenment, or Self-realisation. It's a kind of return to a purer, more authentic self that is not caught up in social games and false self-images.
The themes of this work intersect with philosophical questions about identity, the self, and the societal norms that influence our perceptions. It complements ideas like Robert Nozick's "Experience Machine," as both call into question the reality and value of our constructed lives and identities. The aim seems to be urging us towards a form of authentic existence, free from artificial constructs and societal impositions.

And connections with the Controversial Social Issue Analysis using the Taxonomy of  Wokism?
1 / 1
ChatGPT
The Taxonomy of Wokism and Douglas Harding's "The Face Game" could be seen as exploring different facets of identity and social norms, albeit from differing angles. While the Taxonomy of Wokism often focuses on the identification and critique of social justice and identity politics, "The Face Game" examines the psychological and existential implications of adopting a fixed identity.
Both the Taxonomy of Wokism and "The Face Game" raise questions about the role of self and identity in societal contexts. While the former scrutinizes the ideologies and social trends that advocate for a particular understanding of identity, the latter probes the inherent assumption that one has an unchanging, permanent "face" or identity.
"Wokism" tends to challenge traditional norms and advocates for a reevaluation of identities based on race, gender, and other social categories, often emphasizing collective identity. On the other hand, "The Face Game" suggests that individual identity itself might be a construct, and that liberation could lie in shedding these layers.
Where the Taxonomy of Wokism may focus on the political and social ramifications of identity, "The Face Game" goes deeper into the existential and spiritual aspects. The aim of Harding's work seems to be urging people towards a form of authentic existence that is free from artificial constructs, while the aim of a critique like the Taxonomy of Wokism might be to interrogate the utility or validity of emerging social constructs around identity.
In a sense, they could serve as counterpoints to each other. One could argue that focusing solely on collective identity may detract from the existential quest for individual authenticity, while the other could contend that ignoring social issues related to identity can perpetuate injustice. Both contribute to the larger discourse about what it means to be an individual in a complex social world.

Connections with Carruthers on privileged access to attitudes.
1 / 1
ChatGPT
Peter Carruthers' work on the absence of privileged access to attitudes examines how individuals may not have as direct or accurate an understanding of their own mental states as traditionally assumed. This challenges the common notion that we have immediate and infallible knowledge of our own thoughts and feelings.
When you consider this theory in relation to Douglas Harding's "The Face Game," there's an interesting synergy. Both suggest that our understanding of self���whether it's our identity (as in "The Face Game") or our mental states (as in Carruthers' work)���is not as straightforward or reliable as we might think. Harding argues for the illusory nature of the self as a fixed identity, while Carruthers suggests our self-understanding, particularly about our mental states, isn't necessarily privileged or accurate.
In the context of the Taxonomy of Wokism, which often focuses on social and collective identities, Carruthers' work could be taken to suggest that people might not even have privileged access to the attitudes and ideologies they think they subscribe to. This would add an additional layer of complexity to debates about identity politics and social justice: not only are these identities subject to societal and existential scrutiny, but individuals may also not fully understand or have direct access to their own underlying attitudes about them.
Overall, integrating these ideas can offer a more nuanced perspective on self-understanding and identity in both individual and social contexts. They invite us to be more cautious in our assumptions about self-knowledge, whether we're contemplating our own identity, scrutinizing social ideologies, or even attempting to understand our immediate mental states.

It sounds like wokeism is similar to posturing and comspicuous consumption
1 / 1
ChatGPT
"Wokeism," as it is commonly understood, generally refers to a heightened awareness of social issues like race, gender, and inequality. However, like any movement or ideology, it can be co-opted or superficially adopted as a form of social signaling, much like conspicuous consumption in economics. In such cases, espousing "woke" ideas may become less about genuine commitment to social justice and more about appearing virtuous, educated, or socially aware.
Similarly, posturing���adopting a particular stance or engaging in behaviors primarily to make an impression on others���can be seen in various social and ideological movements, not just in what is commonly labeled as "wokeism."
It's worth noting that the potential for posturing exists in any movement or ideology and doesn't necessarily negate the valid or earnest participation of others. But the phenomenon does raise questions about authenticity and the depth of one's commitment to the causes they claim to support.

I am talking about the fake wokism signaled by the terms in the Taxonomy
1 / 1
ChatGPT
Ah, I see. "Fake wokism," as suggested by the taxonomy you mentioned, could be seen as a form of social or ideological posturing. In this context, adopting the language and terms associated with social justice could serve as a way to gain social capital rather than to enact meaningful change. This can be similar to conspicuous consumption, where individuals make choices primarily to display wealth or status.
Such performative gestures might lack the depth of understanding or commitment that the original social justice causes call for. They can dilute the potency of the terms and ideas they're co-opting, and in some cases, they can actively harm the causes they claim to support by turning them into superficial trends rather than serious social, political, or ethical commitments.

Why Renewables Can���t Save the 
Planet 
written by Michael Shellenberger 
When I was a boy, my parents would sometimes take my sister and me camping in the desert. A lot 
of people think deserts are empty, but my parents taught us to see the wildlife all around us, 
including hawks, eagles, and tortoises. 
After college, I moved to California to work on environmental campaigns. I helped save the state���s 
last ancient redwood forest and blocked a proposed radioactive waste repository set for the desert. 
In 2002, shortly after I turned 30, I decided I wanted to dedicate myself to addressing climate 
change. I was worried that global warming would end up destroying many of the natural 
environments that people had worked so hard to protect. 
I thought the solutions were pretty straightforward: solar panels on every roof, electric cars in 
every driveway, etc. The main obstacles, I believed, were political. And so I helped organize a 
coalition of America���s largest labor unions and environmental groups. Our proposal was for a $300 
billion dollar investment in renewables. We would not only prevent climate change but also create 
millions of new jobs in a fast-growing high-tech sector. 
Our efforts paid off in 2007 when then-presidential candidate Barack Obama embraced our vision. 
Between 2009���15, the U.S. invested $150 billion dollars in renewables and other forms of clean 
tech. But right away we ran into trouble. 
The first was around land use. Electricity from solar roofs costs about twice as much as electricity 
from solar farms, but solar and wind farms require huge amounts of land. That, along with the fact 
that solar and wind farms require long new transmissions lines, and are opposed by local 
communities and conservationists trying to preserve wildlife, particularly birds. 
Another challenge was the intermittent nature of solar and wind energies. When the sun stops 
shining and the wind stops blowing, you have to quickly be able to ramp up another source of 
energy. 
Happily, there were a lot of people working on solutions. One solution was to convert California���s 
dams into big batteries. The idea was that, when the sun was shining and the wind was blowing, 
you could pump water uphill, store it for later, and then run it over the turbines to make electricity 
when you needed it. 
Other problems didn���t seem like such a big deal, on closer examination. For example, after I learned 
that house cats kill billions of birds every year it put into perspective the nearly one million birds 
killed by wind turbines. 
It seemed to me that most, if not all, of the problems from scaling up solar and wind energies could 
be solved through more technological innovation. 
But, as the years went by, the problems persisted and in some cases grew worse. For example, 
California is a world leader when it comes to renewables but we haven���t converted our dams into 
batteries, partly for geographic reasons. You need the right kind of dam and reservoirs, and even 
then it���s an expensive retrofit. 
A bigger problem is that there are many other uses for the water that accumulates behind dams, 
namely irrigation and cities. And because the water in our rivers and reservoirs is scarce and 
unreliable, the water from dams for those other purposes is becoming ever-more precious. 
Without large-scale ways to back-up solar energy California has had to block electricity coming 
from solar farms when it���s extremely sunny, or pay neighboring states to take it from us so we can 
avoid blowing-out our grid. 
Despite what you���ve heard, there is no ���battery revolution��� on the way, for well-understood 
technical and economic reasons. 
As for house cats, they don���t kill big, rare, threatened birds. What house cats kill are small, common 
birds, like sparrows, robins and jays. What kills big, threatened, and endangered birds���birds that 
could go extinct���like hawks, eagles, owls, and condors, are wind turbines. 
In fact, wind turbines are the most serious new threat to important bird species to emerge in 
decades. The rapidly spinning turbines act like an apex predator which big birds never evolved to 
deal with.

ChatGPT
The article by Michael Shellenberger touches on several complex issues surrounding renewable energy, specifically solar and wind power. It calls into question the effectiveness of these energy sources in addressing climate change, focusing on problems like land use, intermittency, and impact on wildlife.
The land use issue is indeed significant; solar and wind farms do require a lot of space. This not only impacts local communities but also raises concerns about ecosystem disruption. Transmission lines that connect these farms to cities are another factor that has both environmental and aesthetic implications.
Intermittency is a widely discussed challenge. Solar and wind energy are not constant; they depend on weather conditions. Storage solutions like pumped hydroelectric storage (converting dams into "big batteries") are not always feasible due to geographic and economic constraints.
The argument about the impact on bird populations is somewhat contentious. While it's true that wind turbines pose a threat to certain bird species, the scale and impact of this threat can be debated.
The article seems to suggest that renewables are not the silver bullet solution for climate change that many hope they will be. Instead, it points to the need for a more nuanced and multi-faceted approach to solving these complex problems. Whether one agrees with Shellenberger's conclusions or not, the issues he raises are certainly part of the broader discussion about how best to achieve a sustainable energy future.

Yeah I suspect fireworks kill a lot of birds and housecats and airplanes
1 / 1
ChatGPT
The impact of fireworks, housecats, and airplanes on bird populations varies and is often debated within the scientific and environmental communities.
Housecats are known to kill a significant number of birds annually, but as Shellenberger's article points out, these tend to be smaller, more common species rather than larger, endangered ones.
Airplanes do pose a risk to birds, mainly through bird strikes, but this is usually considered more of a risk to human safety than a large-scale threat to bird populations.
The impact of fireworks on birds is less clear. While there are concerns that the noise and light could disturb nesting birds or cause stress, the scientific consensus on its long-term impact is still inconclusive.
Each of these factors may contribute to bird mortality, but their effects are different in scale, species impacted, and permanency. Therefore, each issue requires its own set of mitigation strategies.

Ok well hunting the birds killed them there used it have been billions of birds in North America just a few hundred years ago
1 / 1
ChatGPT
Yes, hunting has historically had a significant impact on bird populations. Overhunting led to the extinction of some species, like the passenger pigeon, which was once incredibly abundant in North America. However, modern conservation laws, like the Migratory Bird Treaty Act in the U.S., have been designed to protect bird populations from overhunting and other threats.
It's also worth noting that habitat destruction, pollution, and climate change are significant factors that have contributed to declining bird numbers in more recent times. While it's difficult to compare historical bird populations to current numbers with high precision, it's clear that multiple factors have contributed to declines.

ChatGPT
Ah, I see. The conversation around "triggering" language and potentially offensive terms is part of a broader social debate about sensitivity, inclusivity, and psychological well-being. Some argue that the long list of terms deemed offensive is a reflection of a society becoming increasingly aware of the diverse experiences and challenges of its members. Others see it as an indication that society is becoming overly sensitive or "fragile," as you put it, by attempting to remove or sanitize discussions that might be uncomfortable but are a part of human experience. It's a nuanced issue with valid points on both sides.

I am going to argue that as drone light shows degree in cost fireworks will eventually become banned, I mean the Overton window will shift due to feasibility
1 / 1
ChatGPT
That's an interesting argument. As drone light shows become more cost-effective and versatile, they could indeed offer a more environmentally friendly and less hazardous alternative to traditional fireworks. This could shift public opinion and open up new possibilities for regulations that phase out or limit fireworks, especially if drone shows can deliver the same level of spectacle without the risks to public safety and wildlife. It's a compelling example of how technological advancements can change the Overton window on what's considered acceptable or feasible.

There are a few possible connections between the concept of mathesis and your thesis "Humans As Large Language Models."

One connection is that both ideas relate to the capacity of humans to process information and make meaning out of it.

Mathesis, as a term used in ancient and medieval philosophy, referred to the study of all aspects of knowledge and understanding

It encompassed logic, mathematics, and natural philosophy, among other subjects, and aimed to provide a comprehensive understanding of the world.

Similarly, your thesis highlights the idea that humans are capable of processing and generating large amounts of language data, drawing on their knowledge and understanding of the world to make sense of it.

In this way, both mathesis and the concept of humans as large language models touch on the idea of human cognition and our capacity for complex thought.

Another connection is the idea of modeling or representing the world. 

Mathesis, as a discipline, aimed to create models of the world that could be used to understand and predict its behavior.

Similarly, your thesis highlights the idea that humans are capable of creating models of language and the world through their use of language.

In both cases, the goal is to create a representation or model of the world that can be used to make sense of it and to make predictions about it.

���������������� �������������������� ���������������� ���������������������������� ����������������'���� "���������������������������� ������������������������������������"?

There are several connections between your thesis "Humans as Large Language Models" and the topic of lexical semantics as understood in various linguistic paradigms.

Both focus on how language is used to represent experience and express meaning, and the role of context and intention in shaping that meaning.

For example, the use of semantic categories and features in Systemic Functional Linguistics (SFL) to analyze lexical meaning is similar to the way in which large language models use statistical patterns to learn word meanings in distributional semantics. 

Additionally, the idea of language as grounded in embodied experience and conceptual structures in Cognitive Linguistics has similarities to the concept of human-like learning in large language models.

Overall, the study of lexical semantics in different linguistic paradigms can provide valuable insights into how language is used by humans and how it can be modeled computationally.

Sure, here's a possible restatement of your thesis in more formal scientific language:

The present work proposes that the cognitive and linguistic abilities of humans can be understood as a form of large language modeling, akin to the natural language processing models used in computational linguistics. 

Specifically, it argues that humans possess a complex and flexible mental representation of language, built through exposure to vast amounts of linguistic data, which allows them to comprehend, produce, and manipulate language at a high level of sophistication.

This model of human cognition draws on insights from multiple linguistic paradigms, including generative grammar, cognitive linguistics, construction grammar, functional linguistics, distributional semantics, pragmatics, psycholinguistics, anthropological linguistics, and semiotics.

In simpler terms, the thesis suggests that humans can be thought of as large language models, meaning that we have a powerful and adaptable mental representation of language that allows us to understand and use language in a wide range of situations.

This idea draws on a range of different approaches to studying language, and emphasizes the importance of exposure to language in shaping our cognitive and linguistic abilities.
