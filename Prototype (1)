PETER 
SINGER Famine, Affluence, and 
Morality 
As I write this, in November Ig7I, people are dying in East Bengal 
from lack of food, shelter, and medical care. The suffering and death 
that are occurring there now are not inevitable, not unavoidable in 
any fatalistic sense of the term. Constant poverty, a cyclone, and a 
civil war have turned at least nine million people into destitute refu- 
gees; nevertheless, it is not beyond the capacity of the richer nations 
to give enough assistance to reduce any further suffering to very small 
proportions. The decisions and actions of human beings can prevent 
this kind of suffering. Unfortunately, human beings have not made 
the necessary decisions. At the individual level, people have, with very 
few exceptions, not responded to the situation in any significant way. 
Generally speaking, people have not given large sums to relief funds; 
they have not written to their parliamentary representatives demand- 
ing increased government assistance; they have not demonstrated in 
the streets, held symbolic fasts, or done anything else directed toward 
providing the refugees with the means to satisfy their essential needs. 
At the government level, no government has given the sort of massive 
aid that would enable the refugees to survive for more than a few days. 
Britain, for instance, has given rather more than most countries. It 
has, to date, given ?I4,750,ooo. For comparative purposes, Britain's 
share of the nonrecoverable development costs of the Anglo-French 
Concorde project is already in excess of ?275,ooo,ooo, and on present 
estimates will reach ?440,000,000. The implication is that the British 
government values a supersonic transport more than thirty times as

highly as it values the lives of the nine million refugees. Australia is 
another country which, on a per capita basis, is well up in the "aid to 
Bengal" table. Australia's aid, however, amounts to less than one- 
twelfth of the cost of Sydney's new opera house. The total amount 
given, from all sources, now stands at about ?65,ooo,ooo. The esti- 
mated cost of keeping the refugees alive for one year is ?464,000,000. 
Most of the refugees have now been in the camps for more than six 
months. The World Bank has said that India needs a minimum of 
?300,000,000 in assistance from other countries before the end of the 
year. It seems obvious that assistance on this scale will not be forth- 
coming. India will be forced to choose between letting the refugees 
starve or diverting funds from her own development program, which 
will mean that more of her own people will starve in the future.' 
These are the essential facts about the present situation in Bengal. 
So far as it concerns usi here, there is nothing unique about this situa- 
tion except its magnitude. The Bengal emergency is just the latest and 
most acute of a series of major emergencies in various parts of the 
world, arising both from natural and from man-made causes. There 
are also many parts of the world in which people die from malnutri- 
tion and lack of food independent of any special emergency. I take 
Bengal as my example only because it is the present concern, and 
because the size of the problem has ensured that it has been given 
adequate publicity. Neither individuals nor governments can claim to 
be unaware of what is happening there. 
What are the moral implications of a situation like this? In what 
follows, I shall argue that the way people in relatively affluent coun- 
tries react to a situation like that in Bengal cannot be justified; indeed, 
the whole way we look at moral issues-our moral conceptual scheme 
-needs to be altered, and with it, the way of life that has come to be 
taken for granted in our society. 
In arguing for this conclusion I will not, of course, claim to be 
morally neutral. I shall, however, try to argue for the moral position 
i. There was also a third possibility: that India would go to war to enable the 
refugees to return to their lands. Since I wrote this paper, India has taken this 
way out. The situation is no longer that described above, but this does not affect 
my argument, as the next paragraph indicates.


that I take, so that anyone who accepts certain assumptions, to be 
made explicit, will, I hope, accept my conclusion. 
I begin with the assumption that suffering and death from lack of 
food, shelter, and medical care are bad. I think most people will agree 
about this, although one may reach the same view by different routes. 
I shall not argue for this view. People can hold all sorts of eccentric 
positions, and perhaps from some of them it would not follow that 
death by starvation is in itself bad. It is difficult, perhaps impossible, 
to refute such positions, and so for brevity I will henceforth take this 
assumption as accepted. Those who disagree need read no further. 
My next point is this: if it is in our power to prevent something bad 
from happening, without thereby sacrificing anything of comparable 
moral importance, we ought, morally, to do it. By "without sacrificing 
anything of comparable moral importance" I mean without causing 
anything else comparably bad to happen, or doing something that is 
wrong in itself, or failing to promote some moral good, comparable in 
significance to the bad thing that we can prevent. This principle 
seems almost as uncontroversial as the last one. It requires us only 
to prevent what is bad, and not to promote what is good, and it requires 
this of us only when we can do it without sacrificing anything that is, 
from the moral point of view, comparably important. I could even, as 
far as the application of my argument to the Bengal emergency is 
concerned, qualify the point so as to make it: if it is in our power to 
prevent something very bad from happening, without thereby sacri- 
ficing anything morally significant, we ought, morally, to do it. An 
application of this principle would be as follows: if I am walking past 
a shallow pond and see a child drowning in it, I ought to wade in and 
pull the child out. This will mean getting my clothes muddy, but this 
is insignificant, while the death of the child would presumably be a 
very bad thing. 
The uncontroversial appearance of the principle just stated is decep- 
tive. If it were acted upon, even in its qualified form, our lives, our 
society, and our world would be fundamentally changed. For the prin- 
ciple takes, firstly, no account of proximity or distance. It makes no 
moral difference whether the person I can help is a neighbor's child

ten yards from me or a Bengali whose name I shall never know, ten 
thousand miles away. Secondly, the principle makes no distinction 
between cases in which I am the only person who could possibly do 
anything and cases in which I am just one among millions in the 
same position. 
I do not think I need to say much in defense of the refusal to take 
proximity and distance into account. The fact that a person is physi- 
cally near to us, so that we have personal contact with him, may make 
it more likely that we shall assist him, but this does not show that we 
ought to help him rather than another who happens to be further 
away. If we accept any principle of impartiality, universalizability, 
equality, or whatever, we cannot discriminate against someone merely 
because he is far away from us (or we are far away from him). 
Admittedly, it is possible that we are in a better position to judge what 
needs to be done to help a person near to us than one far away, and 
perhaps also to provide the assistance we judge to be necessary. If 
this were the case, it would be a reason for helping those near to us 
first. This may once have been a justification for being more concerned 
with the poor in one's own town than with famine victims in India. 
Unfortunately for those who- like to keep their moral responsibilities 
limited, instant communication and swift transportation have changed 
the situation. From the moral point of view, the development of the 
world into a "global village" has made an important, though still unrec- 
ognized, difference to our moral situation. Expert observers and super- 
visors, sent out by famine relief organizations or permanently sta- 
tioned in famine-prone areas, can direct our aid to a refugee in Bengal 
almost as effectively as we could get it to someone in our own block. 
There would seem, therefore, to be no possible justification for dis- 
criminating on geographical grounds. 
There may be a greater need to defend the second implication of 
my principle-that the fact that there are millions of other people in 
the same position, in respect to the Bengali refugees, as I am, does 
not make the situation significantly different from a situation in which 
I am the only person who can prevent something very bad from occur- 
ring. Again, of course, I admit that there is a psychological difference 
between the cases; one feels less guilty about doing nothing if one can

point to others, similarly placed, who have also done nothing. Yet this 
can make no real difference to our moral obligations.2 Should I con- 
sider that I am less obliged to pull the drowning child out of the pond 
if on looking around I see other people, no further away than I am, 
who have also noticed the child but are doing nothing? One has only 
to ask this question to see the absurdity of the view that numbers 
lessen obligation. It is a view that is an ideal excuse for inactivity; 
unfortunately most of the major evils-poverty, overpopulation, pollu- 
tion-are problems in which everyone is almost equally involved. 
The view that numbers do make a difference can be made plausible 
if stated in this way: if everyone in circumstances like mine gave ?5 
to the Bengal Relief Fund, there would be enough to provide food, 
shelter, and medical care for the refugees; there is no reason why I 
should give more than anyone else in the same circumstances as I 
am; therefore I have no obligation to give more than ?5. Each premise 
in this argument is true, and the argument looks sound. It may con- 
vince us, unless we notice that it is based on a hypothetical premise, 
although the conclusion is not stated hypothetically. The argument 
would be sound if the conclusion were: if everyone in circumstances 
like mine were to give ?5, I would have no obligation to give more than 
?5. If the conclusion were so stated, however, it would be obvious that 
the argument has no bearing on a situation in which it is not the case 
that everyone else gives ?5. This, of course, is the actual situation. It 
is more or less certain that not everyone in circumstances like mine 
will give Q5. So there will not be enough to provide the needed food, 
shelter, and medical care. Therefore by giving more than ?5 I will 
prevent more suffering than I would if I gave just ?5. 
It might be thought that this argument has an absurd consequence. 
Since the situation appears to be that very few people are likely to give 
2. In view of the special sense philosophers often give to the term, I should 
say that I use "obligation" simply as the abstract noun derived from "ought," so 
that "I have an obligation to" means no more, and no less, than "I ought to." 
This usage is in accordance with the definition of "ought" given by the Shorter 
Oxford English Dictionary: "the general verb to express duty or obligation." I do 
not think any issue of substance hangs on the way the term is used; sentences 
in which I use "obligation" could all be rewritten, although somewhat clumsily, 
as sentences in which a clause containing "ought" replaces the term "obligation."</div></div><div class="text-gray-400 flex self-end lg:self-center justify-center mt-2 gap-3 md:gap-4 lg:gap-1

due to poverty, civil war, and a cyclone. Singer argues that affluent individuals and governments have not done enough to provide aid to prevent the ongoing suffering of these refugees. He uses the Bengal emergency as an example of a series of emergencies that arise from natural and man-made causes. Singer argues that the moral position is that suffering and death from lack of food, shelter, and medical care are bad and that if it is in our power to prevent something bad from happening, without sacrificing anything of comparable moral importance, we ought to do it. Singer suggests that affluent countries need to alter their moral conceptual scheme and change their way of life to prevent such situations in the future.</p></div></div></div><div class="flex justify-between"><div class="text-gray-400 flex self-end lg:self-center justify-center mt-2 gap-3 md:gap-4 lg:gap-1 lg:absolute lg:top-0 lg:translate-x-full lg:right-0 lg:mt-0 lg:pl-2 visible"><button class="p-1 rounded-md hover:bg-gray-100 hover:text-gray-700 dark:text-gray-400 dark:hover:bg-gray-700 dark:hover:text-gray-200 disabled:dark:hover:text-gray-400"><svg stroke="currentColor" fill="none" stroke-width="2" viewBox="0 0 24 24" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" class="h-4 w-4" height="1em" width="1em" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg"><path d="M14 9V5a3 3 0 0 0-3-3l-4 9v11h11.28a2 2 0 0 0 2-1.7l1.38-9a2 2 0 0 0-2-2.3zM7 22H4a2 2 0 0 1-2-2v-7a2 2 0 0 1 2-2h3"></path></svg></button><button class="p-1 rounded-md hover:bg-gray-100 hover:text-gray-700 dark:text-gray-400 dark:hover:bg-gray-700 dark:hover:text-gray-200 disabled:dark:hover:text-gray-400"><svg stroke="currentColor" fill="none" stroke-width="2" viewBox="0 0 24 24" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" class="h-4 w-4" height="1em" width="1em" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg"><path d="M10 15v4a3 3 0 0 0 3 3l4-9V2H5.72a2 2 0 0 0-2 1.7l-1.38 9a2 2 0 0 0 2 2.3zm7-13h2.67A2.31 2.31 0 0 1 22 4v7a2.31 2.31 0 0 1-2.33 2H17"></path></svg></button></div></div></div></div></div><div class="group w-full text-gray-800 dark:text-gray-100 border-b border-black/10 dark:border-gray-900/50 dark:bg-gray-800"><div class="text-base gap-4 md:gap-6 md:max-w-2xl lg:max-w-2xl xl:max-w-3xl p-4 md:py-6 flex lg:px-0 m-auto"><div class="w-[30px] flex flex-col relative items-end"><div class="relative flex"><span style="box-sizing: border-box; display: inline-block; overflow: hidden; width: initial; height: initial; background: none; opacity: 1; border: 0px; margin: 0px; padding: 0px; position: relative; max-width: 100%;"><span style="box-sizing: border-box; display: block; width: initial; height: initial; background: none; opacity: 1; border: 0px; margin: 0px; padding: 0px; max-width: 100%;"><img alt="" aria-hidden="true" src="data:image/svg+xml,%3csvg%20xmlns=%27http://www.w3.org/2000/svg%27%20version=%271.1%27%20width=%2730%27%20height=%2730%27/%3e" style="display: block; max-width: 100%; width: initial; height: initial; background: none; opacity: 1; border: 0px; margin: 0px; padding: 0px;"></span><img alt="Nate Guimond" src="https://chat.openai.com/_next/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Flh3.googleusercontent.com%2Fa%2FAGNmyxbfUJGaUXxADgtF19b5ZhmrVKp8-tY9hQf2Jfmp%3Ds96-c&amp;w=64&amp;q=75" decoding="async" data-nimg="intrinsic" class="rounded-sm" style="position: absolute; inset: 0px; box-sizing: border-box; padding: 0px; border: none; margin: auto; display: block; width: 0px; height: 0px; min-width: 100%; max-width: 100%; min-height: 100%; max-height: 100%;" width="30" height="30"></span></div></div><div class="relative flex w-[calc(100%-50px)] flex-col gap-1 md:gap-3 lg:w-[calc(100%-115px)]"><div class="flex flex-grow flex-col gap-3"><div class="min-h-[20px] flex flex-col items-start gap-4 whitespace-pre-wrap">Summarize: substantial amounts, it follows that I and everyone else in similar 
circumstances ought to give as much as possible, that is, at least up 
to the point at which by giving more one would begin to cause serious 
suffering for oneself and one's dependents-perhaps even beyond this 
point to the point of marginal utility, at which by giving more one 
would cause oneself and one's dependents as much suffering as one 
would prevent in Bengal. If everyone does this, however, there will be 
more than can be used for the benefit of the refugees, and some of the 
sacrifice will have been unnecessary. Thus, if everyone does what he 
ought to do, the result will not be as good as it would be if everyone 
did a little less than he ought to do, or if only some do all that they 
ought to do. 
The paradox here arises only if we assume that the actions in ques- 
tion-sending money to the relief funds-are performed more or less 
simultaneously, and are also unexpected. For if it is to be expected 
that everyone is going to contribute something, then clearly each is 
not obliged to give as much as he would have been obliged to had 
others not been giving too. And if everyone is not acting more or less 
simultaneously, then those giving later will know how much more is 
needed, and will have no obligation to give more than is necessary to 
reach this amount. To say this is not to deny the principle that people 
in the same circumstances have the same obligations, but to point out 
that the fact that others have given, or may be expected to give, is a 
relevant circumstance: those giving after it has become known that 
many others are giving and those giving before are not in the same 
circumstances. So the seemingly absurd consequence of the principle 
I have put forward can occur only if people are in error about the 
actual circumstances-that is, if they think they are giving when others 
are not, but in fact they are giving when others are. The result of 
everyone doing what he really ought to do cannot be worse than the 
result of everyone doing less than he ought to do, although the result 
of everyone doing what he reasonably believes he ought to do could be. 
If my argument so far has been sound, neither our distance from a 
preventable evil nor the number of other people who, in respect to 
that evil, are in the same situation as we are, lessens our obligation 
to mitigate or prevent that evil. I shall therefore take as established 
the principle I asserted earlier. As I have already said, I need to assert
it only in its qualified form: if it is in our power to prevent something 
very bad from happening, without thereby sacrificing anything else 
morally significant, we ought, morally, to do it. 
The outcome of this argument is that our traditional moral cate- 
gories are upset. The traditional distinction between duty and charity 
cannot be drawn, or at least, not in the place we normally draw it. 
Giving money to the Bengal Relief Fund is regarded as an act of char- 
ity in our society. The bodies which collect money are known as "cchari- 
ties." These organizations see themselves in this way-if you send them 
a check, you will be thanked for your "generosity." Because giving 
money is regarded as an act of charity, it is not thought that there is 
anything wrong with not giving. The charitable man may be praised, 
but the man who is not charitable is not condemned. People do not 
feel in any way ashamed or guilty about spending money on new 
clothes or a new car instead of giving it to famine relief. (Indeed, the 
alternative does not occur to them.) This way of looking at the matter 
cannot be justified. When we buy new clothes not to keep ourselves 
warm but to look "well-dressed" we are not providing for any impor- 
tant need. We would not be sacrificing anything significant if we were 
to continue to wear our old clothes, and give the money to famine 
relief. By doing so, we would be preventing another person from starv- 
ing. It follows from what I have said earlier that we ought to give 
money away, rather than spend it on clothes which we do not need 
to keep us warm. To do so is not charitable, or generous. Nor is it the 
kind of act which philosophers and theologians have called "super- 
erogatory"-an act which it would be good to do, but not wrong not to 
do. On the contrary, we ought to give the money away, and it is wrong 
not to do so. 
I am not maintaining that there are no acts which are charitable, 
or that there are no acts which it would be good to do but not wrong 
not to do. It may be possible to redraw the distinction between duty 
and charity in some other place. All I am arguing here is that the pres- 
ent way of drawing the distinction, which makes it an act of charity 
for a man living at the level of affluence which most people in the 
"developed nations" enjoy to give money to save someone else from 
starvation, cannot be supported. It is beyond the scope of my argu- 
ment to consider whether the distinction should be redrawn or abolished altogether. There would be many other possible ways of drawing 
the distinction-for instance, one might decide that it is good to make 
other people as happy as possible, but not wrong not to do so. 
Despite the limited nature of the revision in our moral conceptual 
scheme which I am proposing, the revision would, given the extent of 
both affluence and famine in the world today, have radical implica- 
tions. These implications may lead to further objections, distinct from 
those I have already considered. I shall discuss two of these. 
One objection to the position I have taken might be simply that it is 
too drastic a revision of our moral scheme. People do not ordinarily 
judge in the way I have suggested they should. Most people reserve 
their moral condemnation for those who violate some moral norm, 
such as the norm against taking another person's property. They do 
not condemn those who indulge in luxury instead of giving to famine 
relief. But given that I did not set out to present a morally neutral 
description of the way people make moral judgments, the way people 
do in fact judge has nothing to do with the validity of my conclusion. 
My conclusion follows from the principle which I advanced earlier, 
and unless that principle is rejected, or the arguments shown to be 
unsound, I think the conclusion must stand, however strange it 
appears. 
It might, nevertheless, be interesting to consider why our society, 
and most other societies, do judge differently from the way I have sug- 
gested they should. In a well-known article, J. 0. Urmson suggests 
that the imperatives of duty, which tell us what we must do, as dis- 
tinct from what it would be good to do but not wrong not to do, func- 
tion so as to prohibit behavior that is intolerable if men are to live 
together in society.3 This may explain the origin and continued exist- 
ence of the present division between acts of duty and acts of charity. 
Moral attitudes are shaped by the needs of society, and no doubt 
society needs people who will observe the rules that make social exist- 
ence tolerable. From the point of view of a particular society, it is 
3. J. 0. Urmson, "Saints and Heroes," in Essays in Moral Philosophy, ed. 
Abraham I. Melden (Seattle and London, 1958), p. 214. For a related but 
significantly different view see also Henry Sidgwick, The Methods of Ethics, 
7th edn. (London, 1907), pp. 220-221, 492-493.

essential to prevent violations of norms against killing, stealing, and 
so on. It is quite inessential, however, to help people outside one's own 
society. 
If this is an explanation of our common distinction between duty 
and supererogation, however, it is not a justification of it. The moral 
point of view requires us to look beyond the interests of our own soci- 
ety. Previously, as I have already mentioned, this may hardly have 
been feasible, but it is quite feasible now. From the moral point of 
view, the prevention of the starvation of millions of people outside our 
society must be considered at least as pressing as the upholding of 
property norms within our society. 
It has been argued by some writers, among them Sidgwick and 
Urmson, that we need to have a basic moral code which is not too far 
beyond the capacities of the ordinary man, for otherwise there will be 
a general breakdown of compliance with the moral code. Crudely 
stated, this argument suggests that if we tell people that they ought 
to refrain from murder and give everything they do not really need 
to famine relief, they will do neither, whereas if we tell them that they 
ought to refrain from murder and that it is good to give to famine 
relief but not wrong not to do, so, they will at least refrain from mur- 
der. The issue here is: Where should we drawn the line between con- 
duct that is required and conduct that is good although not required, 
so as to get the best possible result? This would seem to be an empiri- 
cal question, although a very difficult one. One objection to the Sidg- 
wick-Urmson line of argument is that it takes insufficient account of 
the effect that moral standards can have on the decisions we make. 
Given a society in which a wealthy man who gives five percent of his 
income to famine relief is regarded as most generous, it is not surpris- 
ing that a proposal that we all ought to give away half our incomes 
will be thought to be absurdly unrealistic. In a society which held 
that no man should have more than enough while others have less 
than they need, such a proposal might seem narrow-minded. What it 
is possible for a man to do and what he is likely to do are both, I think, 
very greatly influenced by what people around him are doing and 
expecting him to do. In any case, the possibility that by spreading the 
idea that we ought to be doing very much more than we are to relieve
famine we shall bring about a general breakdown of moral behavior 
seems remote. If the stakes are an end to widespread starvation, it is 
worth the risk. Finally, it should be emphasized that these considera- 
tions are relevant only to the issue of what we should require from 
others, and not to what we ourselves ought to do. 
The second objection to my attack on the present distinction 
between duty and charity is one which has from time to time been 
made against utilitarianism. It follows from some forms of utilitarian 
theory that we all ought, morally, to be working full time to increase 
the balance of happiness over misery. The position I have taken here 
would not lead to this conclusion in all circumstances, for if there 
were no bad occurrences that we could prevent without sacrificing 
something of comparable moral importance, my argument would 
have no application. Given the present conditions in many parts of the 
world, however, it does follow from my argument that we ought, mor- 
ally, to be working full time to relieve great suffering of the sort that 
occurs as a result of famine or other disasters. Of course, mitigating 
circumstances can be adduced-for instance, that if we wear ourselves 
out through overwork, we shall be less effective than we would other- 
wise have been. Nevertheless, when all considerations of this sort have 
been taken into account, the conclusion remains: we ought to be 
preventing as much suffering as we can without sacrificing something 
else of comparable moral importance. This conclusion is one which 
we may be reluctant to face. I cannot see, though, why it should be 
regarded as a criticism of the position for which I have argued, rather 
than a criticism of our ordinary standards of behavior. Since most peo- 
ple are self-interested to some degree, very few of us are likely to do 
everything that we ought to do. It would, however, hardly be honest 
to take this as evidence that it is not the case that we ought to do it. 
It may still be thought that my conclusions are so wildly out of line 
with what everyone else thinks and has always thought that there 
must be something wrong with the argument somewhere. In order to 
show that my conclusions, while certainly contrary to contemporary 
Western moral standards, would not have seemed so extraordinary at 
other times and in other places, I would like to quote a passage from a 
writer not normally thought of as a way-out radical, Thomas Aquinas.</div></div><div class="text-gray-400 flex self-end lg:self-center justify-center mt-2 gap-3 md:gap-4 lg:gap-1 lg:absolute lg:top-0

suffering and death from famine in other parts of the world. He argues that the traditional distinction between duty and charity cannot be drawn in the place we normally draw it, and that giving money to prevent suffering and death from famine is not an act of charity but a moral obligation. Singer asserts that if it is in our power to prevent something very bad from happening, without thereby sacrificing anything else morally significant, we ought, morally, to do it. The outcome of this argument is that our traditional moral categories are upset, and Singer calls for a revision in our moral conceptual scheme.</p></div></div></div><div class="flex justify-between"><div class="text-gray-400 flex self-end lg:self-center justify-center mt-2 gap-3 md:gap-4 lg:gap-1 lg:absolute lg:top-0 lg:translate-x-full lg:right-0 lg:mt-0 lg:pl-2 visible"><button class="p-1 rounded-md hover:bg-gray-100 hover:text-gray-700 dark:text-gray-400 dark:hover:bg-gray-700 dark:hover:text-gray-200 disabled:dark:hover:text-gray-400"><svg stroke="currentColor" fill="none" stroke-width="2" viewBox="0 0 24 24" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" class="h-4 w-4" height="1em" width="1em" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg"><path d="M14 9V5a3 3 0 0 0-3-3l-4 9v11h11.28a2 2 0 0 0 2-1.7l1.38-9a2 2 0 0 0-2-2.3zM7 22H4a2 2 0 0 1-2-2v-7a2 2 0 0 1 2-2h3"></path></svg></button><button class="p-1 rounded-md hover:bg-gray-100 hover:text-gray-700 dark:text-gray-400 dark:hover:bg-gray-700 dark:hover:text-gray-200 disabled:dark:hover:text-gray-400"><svg stroke="currentColor" fill="none" stroke-width="2" viewBox="0 0 24 24" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" class="h-4 w-4" height="1em" width="1em" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg"><path d="M10 15v4a3 3 0 0 0 3 3l4-9V2H5.72a2 2 0 0 0-2 1.7l-1.38 9a2 2 0 0 0 2 2.3zm7-13h2.67A2.31 2.31 0 0 1 22 4v7a2.31 2.31 0 0 1-2.33 2H17"></path></svg></button></div></div></div></div></div><div class="group w-full text-gray-800 dark:text-gray-100 border-b border-black/10 dark:border-gray-900/50 dark:bg-gray-800"><div class="text-base gap-4 md:gap-6 md:max-w-2xl lg:max-w-2xl xl:max-w-3xl p-4 md:py-6 flex lg:px-0 m-auto"><div class="w-[30px] flex flex-col relative items-end"><div class="relative flex"><span style="box-sizing: border-box; display: inline-block; overflow: hidden; width: initial; height: initial; background: none; opacity: 1; border: 0px; margin: 0px; padding: 0px; position: relative; max-width: 100%;"><span style="box-sizing: border-box; display: block; width: initial; height: initial; background: none; opacity: 1; border: 0px; margin: 0px; padding: 0px; max-width: 100%;"><img alt="" aria-hidden="true" src="data:image/svg+xml,%3csvg%20xmlns=%27http://www.w3.org/2000/svg%27%20version=%271.1%27%20width=%2730%27%20height=%2730%27/%3e" style="display: block; max-width: 100%; width: initial; height: initial; background: none; opacity: 1; border: 0px; margin: 0px; padding: 0px;"></span><img alt="Nate Guimond" src="https://chat.openai.com/_next/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Flh3.googleusercontent.com%2Fa%2FAGNmyxbfUJGaUXxADgtF19b5ZhmrVKp8-tY9hQf2Jfmp%3Ds96-c&amp;w=64&amp;q=75" decoding="async" data-nimg="intrinsic" class="rounded-sm" style="position: absolute; inset: 0px; box-sizing: border-box; padding: 0px; border: none; margin: auto; display: block; width: 0px; height: 0px; min-width: 100%; max-width: 100%; min-height: 100%; max-height: 100%;" width="30" height="30"></span></div></div><div class="relative flex w-[calc(100%-50px)] flex-col gap-1 md:gap-3 lg:w-[calc(100%-115px)]"><div class="flex flex-grow flex-col gap-3"><div class="min-h-[20px] flex flex-col items-start gap-4 whitespace-pre-wrap">Now, according to the natural order instituted by divine providence, 
material goods are provided for the satisfaction of human needs. 
Therefore the division and appropriation of property, which pro- 
ceeds from human law, must not hinder the satisfaction of man's 
necessity from such goods. Equally, whatever a man has in super- 
abundance is owed, of natural right, to the poor for their suste- 
nance. So Ambrosius says, and it is also to be found in the Decretum 
Gratiani: "The bread which you withhold belongs to the hungry; 
the clothing you shut away, to the naked; and the money you bury 
in the earth is the redemption and freedom of the penniless."4 
I now want to consider a number of points, more practical than 
philosophical, which are relevant to the application of the moral con- 
clusion we have reached. These points challenge not the idea that we 
ought to be doing all we can to prevent starvation, but the idea that 
giving away a great deal of money is the best means to this end. 
It is sometimes said that overseas aid should be a government 
responsibility, and that therefore one ought not to give to privately 
run charities. Giving privately, it is said, allows the government and 
the noncontributing members of society to escape their responsibilities. 
This argument seems to assume that the more people there are who 
give to privately organized famine relief funds, the less likely it is that 
the government will take over full responsibility for such aid. This 
assumption is unsupported, and does not strike me as at all plausible. 
The opposite view-that if no one gives voluntarily, a government will 
assume that its citizens are uninterested in famine relief and would 
not wish to be forced into giving aid-seems more plausible. In any 
case, unless there were a definite probability that by refusing to give 
one would be helping to bring about massive government assistance, 
people who do refuse to make voluntary contributions are refusing to 
prevent a certain amount of suffering without being able to point to 
any tangible beneficial consequence of their refusal. So the onus of 
showing how their refusal will bring about government action is on 
those who refuse to give.

The author argues that the division and appropriation of property must not hinder the satisfaction of human needs and that whatever a man has in abundance is owed to the poor for their sustenance. The author also refutes the argument that overseas aid should be a government responsibility and not given to privately run charities, as giving privately does not necessarily hinder government aid efforts. The author suggests that people who refuse to give voluntarily without any tangible beneficial consequence of their refusal must show how their refusal will bring about government action.</p></div></div></div><div class="flex justify-between"><div class="text-gray-400 flex self-end lg:self-center justify-center mt-2 gap-3 md:gap-4 lg:gap-1 lg:absolute lg:top-0 lg:translate-x-full lg:right-0 lg:mt-0 lg:pl-2 visible"><button class="p-1 rounded-md hover:bg-gray-100 hover:text-gray-700 dark:text-gray-400 dark:hover:bg-gray-700 dark:hover:text-gray-200 disabled:dark:hover:text-gray-400"><svg stroke="currentColor" fill="none" stroke-width="2" viewBox="0 0 24 24" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" class="h-4 w-4" height="1em" width="1em" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg"><path d="M14 9V5a3 3 0 0 0-3-3l-4 9v11h11.28a2 2 0 0 0 2-1.7l1.38-9a2 2 0 0 0-2-2.3zM7 22H4a2 2 0 0 1-2-2v-7a2 2 0 0 1 2-2h3"></path></svg></button><button class="p-1 rounded-md hover:bg-gray-100 hover:text-gray-700 dark:text-gray-400 dark:hover:bg-gray-700 dark:hover:text-gray-200 disabled:dark:hover:text-gray-400"><svg stroke="currentColor" fill="none" stroke-width="2" viewBox="0 0 24 24" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" class="h-4 w-4" height="1em" width="1em" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg"><path d="M10 15v4a3 3 0 0 0 3 3l4-9V2H5.72a2 2 0 0 0-2 1.7l-1.38 9a2 2 0 0 0 2 2.3zm7-13h2.67A2.31 2.31 0 0 1 22 4v7a2.31 2.31 0 0 1-2.33 2H17"></path></svg></button></div></div></div></div></div><div class="group w-full text-gray-800 dark:text-gray-100 border-b border-black/10 dark:border-gray-900/50 dark:bg-gray-800"><div class="text-base gap-4 md:gap-6 md:max-w-2xl lg:max-w-2xl xl:max-w-3xl p-4 md:py-6 flex lg:px-0 m-auto"><div class="w-[30px] flex flex-col relative items-end"><div class="relative flex"><span style="box-sizing: border-box; display: inline-block; overflow: hidden; width: initial; height: initial; background: none; opacity: 1; border: 0px; margin: 0px; padding: 0px; position: relative; max-width: 100%;"><span style="box-sizing: border-box; display: block; width: initial; height: initial; background: none; opacity: 1; border: 0px; margin: 0px; padding: 0px; max-width: 100%;"><img alt="" aria-hidden="true" src="data:image/svg+xml,%3csvg%20xmlns=%27http://www.w3.org/2000/svg%27%20version=%271.1%27%20width=%2730%27%20height=%2730%27/%3e" style="display: block; max-width: 100%; width: initial; height: initial; background: none; opacity: 1; border: 0px; margin: 0px; padding: 0px;"></span><img alt="Nate Guimond" src="https://chat.openai.com/_next/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Flh3.googleusercontent.com%2Fa%2FAGNmyxbfUJGaUXxADgtF19b5ZhmrVKp8-tY9hQf2Jfmp%3Ds96-c&amp;w=64&amp;q=75" decoding="async" data-nimg="intrinsic" class="rounded-sm" style="position: absolute; inset: 0px; box-sizing: border-box; padding: 0px; border: none; margin: auto; display: block; width: 0px; height: 0px; min-width: 100%; max-width: 100%; min-height: 100%; max-height: 100%;" width="30" height="30"></span></div></div><div class="relative flex w-[calc(100%-50px)] flex-col gap-1 md:gap-3 lg:w-[calc(100%-115px)]"><div class="flex flex-grow flex-col gap-3"><div class="min-h-[20px] flex flex-col items-start gap-4 whitespace-pre-wrap">I do not, of course, want to dispute the contention that governments 
of affluent nations should be giving many times the amount of genu- 
ine, no-strings-attached aid that they are giving now. I agree, too, that 
giving privately is not enough, and that we ought to be campaigning 
actively for entirely new standards for both public and private con- 
tributions to famine relief. Indeed, I would sympathize with someone 
who thought that campaigning was more important than giving one- 
self, although I doubt whether preaching what one does not practice 
would be very effective. Unfortunately, for many people the idea that 
"it's the government's responsibility" is a reason for not giving which 
does not appear to entail any political action either. 
Another, more serious reason for not giving to famine relief funds 
is that until there is effective population control, relieving famine 
merely postpones starvation. If we save the Bengal refugees now, oth- 
ers, perhaps the children of these refugees, will face starvation in a 
few years' time. In support of this, one may cite the now well-known 
facts about the population explosion and the relatively limited scope 
for expanded production. 
This point, like the previous one, is an argument against relieving 
suffering that is happening now, because of a belief about what might 
happen in the future; it is unlike the previous point in that very good 
evidence can be adduced in support of this belief about the future. I 
will not go into the evidence here. I accept that the earth cannot sup- 
port indefinitely a population rising at the present rate. This certainly 
poses a problem for anyone who thinks it important to prevent famine. 
Again, however, one could accept the argument without drawing the 
conclusion that it absolves one from any obligation to do anything to 
prevent famine. The conclusion that should be drawn is that the best 
means of preventing famine, in the long run, is population control. 
It would then follow from the position reached earlier that one ought 
to be doing all one can to promote population control (unless one held 
that all forms of population control were wrong in themselves, or 
would have significantly bad consequences). Since there are organiza- 
tions working specifically for population control, one would then sup- 
port them rather than more orthodox methods of preventing famine. 
A third point raised by the conclusion reached earlier relates to the 
question of just how much we all ought to be giving away. One pos-sibility, which has already been mentioned, is that we ought to give 
until we reach the level of marginal utility-that is, the level at which, 
by giving more, I would cause as much suffering to myself or my 
dependents as I would relieve by my gift. This would mean, of course, 
that one would reduce oneself to very near the material circumstances 
of a Bengali refugee. It will be recalled that earlier I put forward both 
a strong and a moderate version of the principle of preventing bad 
occurrences. The strong version, which required us to prevent bad 
things from happening unless in doing so we would be sacrificing 
something of comparable moral significance, does seem to require 
reducing ourselves to the level of marginal utility. I should also say 
that the strong version seems to me to be the correct one. I proposed 
the more moderate version-that we should prevent bad occurrences 
unless, to do so, we had to sacrifice something morally significant- 
only in order to show that even on this surely undeniable principle a 
great change in our way of life is required. On the more moderate 
principle, it may not follow that we ought to reduce ourselves to the 
level of marginal utility, for one might hold that to reduce oneself and 
one's family to this level is to cause something significantly bad to 
happen. Whether this is so I shall not discuss, since, as I have said, 
I can see no good reason for holding the moderate version of the prin- 
ciple rather than the strong version. Even if we accepted the principle 
only in its moderate form, however, it should be clear that we would 
have to give away enough to ensure that the consumer society, 
dependent as it is on people spending on trivia rather than giving to 
famine relief, would slow down and perhaps disappear entirely. There 
are several reasons why this would be desirable in itself. The value 
and necessity of economic growth are now being questioned not only 
by conservationists, but by economists as well.5 There is no doubt, too, 
that the consumer society has had a distorting effect on the goals and 
purposes of its members. Yet looking at the matter purely from the 
point of view of overseas aid, there must be a limit to the extent to 
which we should deliberately slow down our economy; for it might be 
the case that if we gave away, say, forty percent of our Gross National 
Product, we would slow down the economy so much that in absolute 
5. See, for instance, John Kenneth Galbraith, The New Industrial State (Bos- 
ton, I967); and E. J. Mishan, The Costs of Economic Growth (London, I967).

terms we would be giving less than if we gave twenty-five percent of 
the much larger GNP that we would have if we limited our contribu- 
tion to this smaller percentage. 
I mention this only as an indication of the sort of factor that one 
would have to take into account in working out an ideal. Since West- 
ern societies generally consider one percent of the GNP an acceptable 
level for overseas aid, the matter is entirely academic. Nor does it 
affect the question of how much an individual should give in a society 
in which very few are giving substantial amounts.</div></div><div class="text-gray-400 flex self-end lg:self-center justify-center mt-2 gap-3 md:gap-4 lg:gap-1 lg:absolute lg:top-0 lg:translate-x-full

The first is that some people may believe it is the government's responsibility to provide aid, so they don't feel the need to give themselves. The author argues that this is not a valid reason, as government action often follows public pressure, and individuals can also help create that pressure.</p><p>The second reason is that some people believe that famine relief merely postpones starvation and that effective population control is necessary to prevent future famines. The author concedes that there is evidence to support this belief, but argues that it does not absolve individuals of their obligation to help prevent famine in the short term. Rather, the best means of preventing famine in the long run is population control, and individuals should support organizations working towards this goal.</p><p>The third reason is that people may not know how much they should give. The author suggests that one possibility is to give until reaching the level of marginal utility, the point at which giving more would cause as much suffering to oneself or one's dependents as it would relieve through the gift. The author also discusses the principle of preventing bad occurrences, which requires individuals to prevent bad things from happening unless they would have to sacrifice something of comparable moral significance. The author argues that this principle, in its strong version, requires individuals to reduce themselves to the level of marginal utility. Even if one accepts the principle in its moderate form, however, one would still need to give enough to slow down or even eliminate the consumer society, which has a distorting effect on the goals and purposes of its members.</p><p>Overall, the author argues that individuals have a moral obligation to give to famine relief, even if they may have reasons for not doing so. The author suggests that effective population control is necessary to prevent future famines, but this does not absolve individuals of their obligation to help prevent famine in the short term. The author also suggests that individuals should give until the point of marginal utility and work towards creating a society that places greater value on humanitarian concerns.</p></div></div></div><div class="flex justify-between"><div class="text-gray-400 flex self-end lg:self-center justify-center mt-2 gap-3 md:gap-4 lg:gap-1 lg:absolute lg:top-0 lg:translate-x-full lg:right-0 lg:mt-0 lg:pl-2 visible"><button class="p-1 rounded-md hover:bg-gray-100 hover:text-gray-700 dark:text-gray-400 dark:hover:bg-gray-700 dark:hover:text-gray-200 disabled:dark:hover:text-gray-400"><svg stroke="currentColor" fill="none" stroke-width="2" viewBox="0 0 24 24" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" class="h-4 w-4" height="1em" width="1em" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg"><path d="M14 9V5a3 3 0 0 0-3-3l-4 9v11h11.28a2 2 0 0 0 2-1.7l1.38-9a2 2 0 0 0-2-2.3zM7 22H4a2 2 0 0 1-2-2v-7a2 2 0 0 1 2-2h3"></path></svg></button><button class="p-1 rounded-md hover:bg-gray-100 hover:text-gray-700 dark:text-gray-400 dark:hover:bg-gray-700 dark:hover:text-gray-200 disabled:dark:hover:text-gray-400"><svg stroke="currentColor" fill="none" stroke-width="2" viewBox="0 0 24 24" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" class="h-4 w-4" height="1em" width="1em" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg"><path d="M10 15v4a3 3 0 0 0 3 3l4-9V2H5.72a2 2 0 0 0-2 1.7l-1.38 9a2 2 0 0 0 2 2.3zm7-13h2.67A2.31 2.31 0 0 1 22 4v7a2.31 2.31 0 0 1-2.33 2H17"></path></svg></button></div></div></div></div></div><div class="group w-full text-gray-800 dark:text-gray-100 border-b border-black/10 dark:border-gray-900/50 dark:bg-gray-800"><div class="text-base gap-4 md:gap-6 md:max-w-2xl lg:max-w-2xl xl:max-w-3xl p-4 md:py-6 flex lg:px-0 m-auto"><div class="w-[30px] flex flex-col relative items-end"><div class="relative flex"><span style="box-sizing: border-box; display: inline-block; overflow: hidden; width: initial; height: initial; background: none; opacity: 1; border: 0px; margin: 0px; padding: 0px; position: relative; max-width: 100%;"><span style="box-sizing: border-box; display: block; width: initial; height: initial; background: none; opacity: 1; border: 0px; margin: 0px; padding: 0px; max-width: 100%;"><img alt="" aria-hidden="true" src="data:image/svg+xml,%3csvg%20xmlns=%27http://www.w3.org/2000/svg%27%20version=%271.1%27%20width=%2730%27%20height=%2730%27/%3e" style="display: block; max-width: 100%; width: initial; height: initial; background: none; opacity: 1; border: 0px; margin: 0px; padding: 0px;"></span><img alt="Nate Guimond" src="https://chat.openai.com/_next/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Flh3.googleusercontent.com%2Fa%2FAGNmyxbfUJGaUXxADgtF19b5ZhmrVKp8-tY9hQf2Jfmp%3Ds96-c&amp;w=64&amp;q=75" decoding="async" data-nimg="intrinsic" class="rounded-sm" style="position: absolute; inset: 0px; box-sizing: border-box; padding: 0px; border: none; margin: auto; display: block; width: 0px; height: 0px; min-width: 100%; max-width: 100%; min-height: 100%; max-height: 100%;" width="30" height="30"></span></div></div><div class="relative flex w-[calc(100%-50px)] flex-col gap-1 md:gap-3 lg:w-[calc(100%-115px)]"><div class="flex flex-grow flex-col gap-3"><div class="min-h-[20px] flex flex-col items-start gap-4 whitespace-pre-wrap">It is sometimes said, though less often now than it used to be, that 
philosophers have no special role to play in public affairs, since most 
public issues depend primarily on an assessment of facts. On questions 
of fact, it is said, philosophers as such have no special expertise, and 
so it has been possible to engage in philosophy without committing 
oneself to any position on major public issues. No doubt there are 
some issues of social policy and foreign policy about which it can truly 
be said that a really expert assessment of the facts is required before 
taking sides or acting, but the issue of famine is surely not one of 
these. The facts about the existence of suffering are beyond dispute. 
Nor, I think, is it disputed that we can do something about it, either 
through orthodox methods of famine relief or through population con- 
trol or both. This is therefore an issue on which philosophers are com- 
petent to take a position. The issue is one which faces everyone who 
has more money than he needs to support himself and his dependents, 
or who is in a position to take some sort of political action. These cate- 
gories must include practically every teacher and student of philoso- 
phy in the universities of the Western world. If philosophy is to deal 
with matters that are relevant to both teachers and students, this is an 
issue that philosophers should discuss. 
Discussion, though, is not enough. What is the point of relating 
philosophy to public (and personal) affairs if we do not take our con- 
clusions seriously? In this instance, taking our conclusion seriously 
means acting upon it. The philos-opher will not find it any easier than 
anyone else to alter his attitudes and way of life to the extent that, if 
I am right, is involved in doing everything that we ought to be doing.

At the very least, though, one can make a start. The philosopher who 
does so will have to sacrifice some of the benefits of the consumer 
society, but he can find compensation in the satisfaction of a way of 
life in which theory and practice, if not yet in harmony, are at least 
coming together.</div></div><div class="text-gray-400 flex self-end lg:self-center justify-center mt-2 gap-3 md:gap-4 lg:gap-1 lg:absolute lg:top-0 lg:translate-x-full lg:right-0 lg:mt-0 lg:pl-2

questions of fact. In particular, the issue of famine is one that philosophers are competent to take a position on, as the facts about the existence of suffering are beyond dispute and there are actions that can be taken to address the problem. The author suggests that philosophers have a responsibility to take their conclusions seriously and act upon them, even if it means making sacrifices in their personal lives.</p><p>The author also suggests that a way of life in which theory and practice are in harmony can be satisfying for philosophers, even if it requires sacrifices. This implies that the philosopher's goal is not just to engage in theoretical discussion, but also to put their ideas into practice in a meaningful way.</p><p>Overall, the author argues that philosophy has relevance to public and personal affairs, and that philosophers should take their ideas seriously and act upon them.</p></div></div></div><div class="flex justify-between"><div

issues depend primarily on an assessment of facts.</li><li>While it is true that some issues require expert assessment of facts, the issue of famine is not one of these, as the existence of suffering is beyond dispute and there are ways to address it through famine relief and population control.</li><li>Philosophers have a duty to discuss and take a position on this issue, as it is relevant to both teachers and students of philosophy in the Western world who have the means to take political action.</li><li>Taking a position on the issue is not enough, philosophers must also take action to change their attitudes and way of life to align with their conclusions, which may involve sacrificing some benefits of the consumer society.</li><li>By doing so, philosophers can find satisfaction in a way of life in which theory and practice are coming together.</li></ol></div></div></div><div class="flex justify-between"><div class="text-gray-400 flex self-end lg:self-center justify-center mt-2

The main arguments of the paper are:</p><ol><li><p>Ordinary people can be agents of evil: The paper argues that ordinary people, like you and me, have the capacity to commit evil acts, even in the absence of any special circumstances like coercion or extreme stress.</p></li><li><p>Evil is not just the result of bad apples: The paper suggests that evil is not just the result of a few bad apples, but rather can be the result of a complex interaction between personal and situational factors.</p></li><li><p>Morality is not enough to prevent evil: The paper argues that simply relying on people's moral values and character is not enough to prevent evil from occurring. Instead, we need to be aware of the situational factors that can lead to evil and take steps to address them.</p></li><li><p>Awareness and responsibility: The paper suggests that we need to be aware of the potential for evil within ourselves and others, and take responsibility for preventing it from occurring. This involves cultivating empathy, critical thinking, and moral courage, as well as being aware of the social and situational factors that can lead to evil.</p></li></ol></div></div></div><div class="flex justify-between"><div class="text-gray-400 flex self-end lg:self-center justify-center mt-2 gap-3 md:gap-4 lg:gap-1 lg:absolute lg:top-0 lg:translate-x-full lg:right-0 lg:mt-0 lg:pl-2 visible"><button class="p-1 rounded-md hover:bg-gray-100 hover:text-gray-700 dark:text-gray-400 dark:hover:bg-gray-700 dark:hover:text-gray-200 disabled:dark:hover:text-gray-400"><svg stroke="currentColor" fill="none" stroke-width="2" viewBox="0 0 24 24" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" class="h-4 w-4" height="1em" width="1em" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg"><path d="M14 9V5a3 3 0 0 0-3-3l-4 9v11h11.28a2 2 0 0 0 2-1.7l1.38-9a2 2 0 0 0-2-2.3zM7 22H4a2 2 0 0 1-2-2v-7a2 2 0 0 1 2-2h3"></path></svg></button><button class="p-1 rounded-md hover:bg-gray-100 hover:text-gray-700 dark:text-gray-400 dark:hover:bg-gray-700 dark:hover:text-gray-200 disabled:dark:hover:text-gray-400"><svg stroke="currentColor" fill="none" stroke-width="2" viewBox="0 0 24 24" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" class="h-4 w-4" height="1em" width="1em" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg"><path d="M10 15v4a3 3 0 0 0 3 3l4-9V2H5.72a2 2 0 0 0-2 1.7l-1.38 9a2 2 0 0 0 2 2.3zm7-13h2.67A2.31 2.31 0 0 1 22 4v7a2.31 2.31 0 0 1-2.33 2H17"></path></svg></button></div></div></div></div></div><div class="group w-full text-gray-800 dark:text-gray-100 border-b border-black/10 dark:border-gray-900/50 dark:bg-gray-800"><div class="text-base gap-4 md:gap-6 md:max-w-2xl lg:max-w-2xl xl:max-w-3xl p-4 md:py-6 flex lg:px-0 m-auto"><div class="w-[30px] flex flex-col relative items-end"><div class="relative flex"><span style="box-sizing: border-box; display: inline-block; overflow: hidden; width: initial; height: initial; background: none; opacity: 1; border: 0px; margin: 0px; padding: 0px; position: relative; max-width: 100%;"><span style="box-sizing: border-box; display: block; width: initial; height: initial; background: none; opacity: 1; border: 0px; margin: 0px; padding: 0px; max-width: 100%;"><img alt="" aria-hidden="true" src="data:image/svg+xml,%3csvg%20xmlns=%27http://www.w3.org/2000/svg%27%20version=%271.1%27%20width=%2730%27%20height=%2730%27/%3e" style="display: block; max-width: 100%; width: initial; height: initial; background: none; opacity: 1; border: 0px; margin: 0px; padding: 0px;"></span><img alt="Nate Guimond" src="https://chat.openai.com/_next/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Flh3.googleusercontent.com%2Fa%2FAGNmyxbfUJGaUXxADgtF19b5ZhmrVKp8-tY9hQf2Jfmp%3Ds96-c&amp;w=64&amp;q=75" decoding="async" data-nimg="intrinsic" class="rounded-sm" style="position: absolute; inset: 0px; box-sizing: border-box; padding: 0px; border: none; margin: auto; display: block; width: 0px; height: 0px; min-width: 100%; max-width: 100%; min-height: 100%; max-height: 100%;" width="30" height="30"></span></div></div><div class="relative flex w-[calc(100%-50px)] flex-col gap-1 md:gap-3 lg:w-[calc(100%-115px)]"><div class="flex flex-grow flex-col gap-3"><div class="min-h-[20px] flex flex-col items-start gap-4 whitespace-pre-wrap">Ok thank you.

w-full break-words dark:prose-invert light"><p>Certainly! "Peter Singer - Ordinary People are Evil" is a lecture by Jeffrey Kaplin that discusses the work of philosopher Niko Kolodny and Peter Singer's ideas on moral responsibility. The lecture argues that ordinary people are complicit in perpetuating evils such as poverty, inequality, and climate change, even though they may not be directly responsible for these issues.</p><p>Kolodny's work suggests that individuals have a moral responsibility to address systemic problems, even if they did not cause them. Singer expands on this idea, arguing that individuals have a moral obligation to give to effective charities in order to alleviate poverty and save lives. The lecture also discusses the concept of "effective altruism," which is the idea that individuals should use reason and evidence to determine how to do the most good in the world.</p><p>There are several connections between this lecture and the paper "Famine, Affluence, and Morality" by Peter Singer. Both works argue that individuals have a moral obligation to help those in need, even if it requires personal sacrifice. Additionally, both works challenge the traditional view that individuals are only responsible for their own actions and not the actions of others or larger societal problems. Instead, both works argue that individuals have a moral responsibility to address systemic problems and work towards creating a more just and equitable world.</p></div></div></div><div class="flex

have your attitude towards your moral  obligations and the things that you may  or may not do in your life and the  attitude that all of your friends and  all of your relatives have the general  moral outlook that everyone around you  has is deeply and profoundly wrong and  the crazy thing about this paper is that  on the surface at least it's very  persuasive  he seems singer seems to be right it  seems to be once you go through the  argument that he lays out it seems to be  that we need to completely rework our  entire society and more specifically  forget about society for a minute you  need to completely rework your life if  your life is going to be a moral one and  sort of what makes the paper so radical  is that I can say all of these things  that the thesis of the paper is that you  need to completely rework your life  without knowing anything about you I  know virtually nothing about your life  and your moral outlook and your values  and the kinds of things that you do on a  day to day basis.</div></div><div class="text-gray-400 flex self-end lg:self-center justify-center mt-2 gap-3 md:gap-4 lg:gap-1 lg:absolute lg:top-0 lg:translate-x-full lg:right-0 lg:mt-0 lg:pl-2

audience you  know general assumptions you live in a  broadly capitalistic society let's  assume you know there are government  regulations and that sort of thing and  you live sometime in the beginning ish  of the 21st century that's basically  enough if that's true of you then singer  thinks that your whole life needs to be  reworked if you're going to live in a  morally acceptable way okay if we're  gonna understand this argument then we  need one distinction to start out this  is a technical distinction but there's  really only one technical term here you  go  we're talking about the distinction  between the super araga Tori and the  obligatory imagine this you're getting  together with a group of friends or  coworkers or something like that and you  decide you know what this is a pretty  early gathering it's a pretty early  meeting and so wouldn't it be nice if I  went and got everyone some coffee and  danishes because some people are gonna  be rushing out of their house and  they're not gonna have time to eat  breakfast and so when everyone shows up  surprise surprise there is some coffee  and doughnuts and and treats or whatever  that you brought for everyone and you  paid for and you're just giving it to  them and you say hey guys I brought  these for you I want you to have them  that act that action is super auditory  it's extra it's super you didn't have to  do it but it was a really nice thing to  do it was an extra thing that you did  and it was a good thing to do it was not  obligatory something is obligatory if  you have to do it right so if someone is  assigned in the group to bring coffee  and breakfast to every early morning  meeting and you signed up you promised  you committed to bringing coffee and  breakfast on that day well then bringing  coffee and breakfast is obligatory and  of course it would be nice if everyone  thanked you for bringing those things  even if you agreed or promised to do it  it wasn't extra it was something you had  to do you had committed to it you were  obliged to do it one more example just  to bring out this distinction and this  example may date this video it may give  you a sense of when when I'm making this  video but anyway at the time of the  recording of this video there's  something going on in supermarkets where  when you checkout in the supermarket and  you're paying for your groceries or  whatever um well there's some of the  payment is obligatory right you have to  pay for the things that you are buying  but then there's this extra payment they  say when you're checking out they're  like would you like to donate $1 - and  then they name some charity would you  like to add $1.00 to your bill here at  the supermarket that additional payment  that's extra you don't have to do it  it's up to you it's super rocket Ori if  you do do it it's good that's a nice  thing that you did right but you didn't  have to supererogatory that's what that  word means okay here's the claim of this  paper the claim is that there are these  organizations that exist in the world  now now in 1972 says singer right and  these organizations like Oxfam right and  UNICEF these are organizations that take  money from people who live in relatively  wealthy places on the planet and they  they take that money and they use it to  do amazing things for people who are  suffering under things like famines  right if there's a famine in some place  in the world there's not enough food and  people are literally starving to death  they are dying because they don't have  enough food so someone donates a little  bit of money and these organizations  take that money and a very high  percentage of that money with a great  deal of efficiency gets transported to  this other place on the planet where  there's a famine and literal people's  lives are saved normally we you and I  and all of your relatives and all of  your friends everyone in our society in  our broader society we think of these  sorts of acts giving charity in this way  giving money to Oxfam or UNICEF or  whatever we think of these things as  supererogatory giving to charity is  supererogatory it's nice it's good but  you don't have to do it if on any given  occasion you don't do it you're not a  bad person it's not like you failed to  live up to some obligation that you had  singer says no here's an argument that  proves singer thinks that giving to  charity giving extra money to famine  relief if you're affluent if you have  extra money is something that you must  do you must do it in the same way that  you must not murder or you must catch  someone if they're if they're falling  and you can just reach out your arms and  catch them and save them you must do it  that's the thesis ok so singer has an  argument for this thesis an argument for  this conclusion  but we're gonna get to the argument in  one minute first let's just skip to the  end of the paper and see his statement  of that conclusion  here's what he says  here's what singer says because giving  money is regarded as an act of charity  it is not thought that there is anything  wrong with not giving the charitable man  or if we what we want because this was  written in 1972 we can say the  charitable person the charitable person  may be praised but the person who is not  charitable is not condemned people do  not feel in any way ashamed or guilty  about spending money on new clothes or a  new car instead of giving it to famine  relief indeed the alternative does not  occur to them </div></div><div class="text-gray-400 flex

giving to charity?</p><p>Peter Singer argues that giving to charity is not just a supererogatory act but a moral obligation for people who live in relatively wealthy societies. Singer claims that giving extra money to famine relief, for example, is something that one must do in the same way as not murdering or catching someone who is falling. He believes that by donating a little bit of money, organizations like Oxfam and UNICEF can transport a high percentage of that money with great efficiency to save the lives of people suffering from things like famines. Singer's argument is based on the principle of effective altruism, which holds that we should use our resources to do the most good possible.</p></div></div></div><div class="flex

those new  clothes and not getting that new car and  instead taking that money that you would  have spent on new clothes and just well  wearing your old clothes and taking that  money and giving it to an organization  that will help people that will save  people who are dying of famine right  that possibility the possibility of not  spending money on luxuries does not  occur to most people or to virtually  anyone this way of looking at the matter  cannot be justified this way of looking  at the matter is the way that we all  look at the matter that is we think that  giving money to famine relief is  supererogatory it's nice it's an extra  thing that cannot be justified the only  thing according to singer that can be  justified and we're gonna get to the  argument for this conclusion the only  thing that can be justified is the way  of thinking where you think that giving  to famine relief instead of buying new  clothes or a new car or whatever giving  to famine relief is obligatory that's  the only way of thinking that can be  justified the upshot or the punchline is  this if you don't give to famine relief  singer things you've done something  wrong you've done something evil bad  every time you buy new clothes that you  don't absolutely need or you buy a new  car when you could just drive your old  car or you buy a cup of coffee that  someone else made for you because it's  more convenient for them to make it for  you in it  a little better that if you were to make  it at home every time you do any of  those things you're doing something  wrong you're doing something bad we  don't think this way no one in our  society not in 1972 and even though this  is a super famous paper you've maybe  never heard of it and so it didn't seep  into the whole society even now right  people don't think that buying new  clothes or buying a cup of coffee from a  coffee shop is a bad thing to do an evil  thing to do a wrong thing to do but  singer thinks that it is and here's his  argument for that conclusion  okay here's the argument singer doesn't  lay out the argument like this with four  premises and one conclusion or anything  I'm pulling these out of the paper but  this is indeed the argument here's how  it goes let's take it one step at a time  one if it is in our power to prevent  something very bad from happening  without thereby sacrificing anything of  moral significance then we must morally  do it that is prevent that very bad  thing from happening okay that's premise  one I'll just give you a hint this is  going to be the most controversial claim  right it's a very general claim it's  talking about you know very bad things  it's got this big category of very bad  things and then it's got this other  category of things with you know things  that you might sacrifice that are not of  moral significance that's another big  category it's a big grand claim about  what you must do morally and it's a very  general claim so one is going to be the  most controversial claim in this  argument so we'll come back to this if  you're looking for this claim by the way  in the reading then go to page 235  there's one big paragraph in the middle  of page 235 and this claim happens not  phrased exactly like this but basically  like this at the sort of end of that  paragraph anyway let's keep going step  two  hunger disease and other sources of  suffering disability and death are very  bad okay those are some examples of very  bad things we see how this is going to  connect up with the first premise right  we've got a bunch of very bad things and  it said in the first premise that if  it's in your power or if it's in our  power to prevent something very bad well  then we've got to do that thing we've  got to prevent those things so these are  gonna be the things that we're gonna  need to prevent this arguments going to  claim it's just specifying some very bad  things and premise two by the way seems  totally plausible hunger disease and  other sources of suffering disability  and death are very bad  yes that's plausible hunger is very bad  real hunger where someone doesn't have  enough food to eat and disease and other  things that cause people to suffer or  become disabled or die all of that is  bad.</div></div><div class="text-gray-400 flex self-end lg:self-center justify-center mt-2 gap-3 md:gap-4 lg:gap-1

the luxuries on  which we spend money are not of moral  significance so the kinds of luxuries  he's talking about are these luxuries  right buying new clothes when your old  clothes  although out of fashion or a little  tattered or whatever are perfectly good  or buying a new car when your old car  although not as good as a new car is  still a good enough car right or the  example that I gave earlier buying a cup  of coffee when you could make the coffee  at home really going to any restaurant  ever right counts as a luxury in this  sense I mean you can always just for  less money make food at home this  connects with the idea of moral  significance or of some things not being  of moral significance right sacrificing  sacrificing anything of moral  significance that's part of the first  premise also so premise 3 is specifying  the kinds of things that aren't of moral  significance and once we understand what  singer means by luxuries he's right  these things are not of moral  significance they're not a big deal if  you go without them you're not really  worse off for by donating money to  relief agencies like Oxfam we could  prevent hunger disease and other sources  of suffering disability and death well  that's just saying that there's a very  specific way an easy way right to  prevent these things which premise to  established were very bad premise for is  it true by donating money to relief  agencies like Oxfam we could prevent  hunger disease and other sources of  suffering disability and death yes  premise 4 is true this is true these  organizations do do this you can give  them money and then they will prevent  these things this premise for is just an  empirical claim  it's just a claim about whether these  organizations actually do the thing that  they say they're gonna do and the answer  is yes they do do it okay and then  here's the conclusion and we've already  reached this conclusion we've already  talked through this conclusion therefore  we must must where is it where is it  must we are obligated it's not super  auditory it's not extra this is  something you have to do and so the  conclusion gets us something you have to  do  we must morally donate the money that we  spend on luxuries to relief agencies and  we don't get to spend them on luxuries  this is the argument okay so now is a  good time to re-emphasize how radical  this conclusion is we're about to assess  the argument we're really gonna focus  almost entirely on premise one because  premise one is the only controversial  premise and the argument everything else  steps two three and four I mean these  just seemed to be obviously correct  obviously true statements and the  argument is is valid so well one is the  only option that we could argue against  then we're gonna try to argue against it  and singer is gonna say no and none of  those arguments work okay but focusing  again on the conclusion for a minute  before we get back to premise one this  is pretty radical no one thinks that we  have a moral obligation know what none  of your friends none of your family  think that you must not buy a cup of  coffee  you must not buy a new car you must not  buy new clothes instead you must take  all of that money and donate it to some  organization like Oxfam one of these  relief agencies no one lives their life  like this or very few people Peter  Singer by the way he's still alive I met  him right we had dinner once he gave a  talk and then I anyway I know him I you  know I know celebrities a Peter Singer  who's still alive kind of lives his life  like this he donates a very significant  non-trivial portion of his income which  is not enormous it's not an enormous  income to relief agencies he does this  he does not live a luxurious life not a  life that we would normally call  luxurious  okay so there's one and then maybe  there's I don't know a few of his  friends who he convinced but most people  don't live their life like this the  conclusion of this paper is that most  people you included are doing something  bad every day and you don't even realize  it  okay enough about how radical this  conclusion is or whatever and how much  it departs from your day to day life  let's get to premise 1 this is the  controversial premise.</div></div><div class="text-gray-400 flex self-end lg:self-center justify-center mt-2 gap-3

bad."

However, there may be some who would argue that not all suffering and death are inherently bad, or that there are situations in which the benefits of allowing suffering and death outweigh the costs.</p><p>Additionally, some may argue that while suffering and death are bad, it is not necessarily our responsibility to prevent them.

 claim here's what he says  this is a rather famous example that  singer gives to support premise 1 here  it is if I am walking past a shallow  pond and see a child drowning in it I  ought to wade in and pull the child out  this will mean getting my clothes muddy  but this isn't significant while the  death of the child would presumably be a  very bad thing  ok got the example right there's a  shallow pond or a fountain when I teach  this class on campus every college  campus including the one where I work in  North Carolina every college campus has  like a fountain somewhere right there's  a fountain there a small child is  drowning in the fountain and will die  you are walking by you can easily step  in and save the child the cost to you  will be just a few moments and well your  clothes are gonna get wet or muddy right  muddy if it's a pond or wet if it's a  fountain or whatever this sacrifice by  the way is not of moral significance  right it is insignificant that your  clothes are gonna get a little wet oh  and you're on your way to something  where you didn't want your clothes to be  wet ok that's not a very significant  sacrifice but the death of the child the  drowning death of the child in almost  all circumstances would be a very bad  thing well the thought is go from this  example if you agree with what singer  says about this example and I suggest of  course that you do if someone just  showed up at a meeting and said hey  there's this kid drowning but I didn't  want to have wet clothes for this  gathering so I just let the kid drown  and die you would be horrified you would  think that this person was evil that  they had done an evil thing you would  not let your friends or family associate  with this kind of person well if you  agree with singer about this specific  case then singer says we should be able  to abstract from this case to a more  general principle and you should  this more general principle and the more  general principle is premise one of the  argument the idea is that well a child  drowning in a pond that's a very bad  thing but it's not bad because it has to  do with water  or children you know an adult drowning  and dying is also a bad thing or even an  adult dying by some other means is a bad  thing right what's relevant here is not  that it's a child or that it's a water  involving death it's that this is a  easily preventable death the death is a  bad thing and the fact that your clothes  would get muddy  that's a morally insignificant thing but  the fact that it's your clothes and it's  mud that doesn't matter if it's  something else that you have to  sacrifice if for example instead of your  clothes getting wet or muddy your I  don't know your car is gonna get dirty  or you're gonna lose your shoelaces the  shoelaces will be gone forever you'll  have to sacrifice your shoelaces and  you'll have to get whole new shoelaces  and that'll be kind of a pain in the  butt the point is this the difference  between one way of dying and another way  of dying or one morally insignificant  sacrifice and another morally  insignificant sacrifice the difference  between these doesn't matter so you can  go from a specific case like this to a  general claim like one and the thought  is if you agree with singer about this  specific case then you have to accept  premise one of the argument okay so  there are two ways in which you might  think you can't go from this example to  this premise or another way to put this  point is you might think that there are  two big differences between this shallow  pond example and the example of giving  up your luxuries the luxuries in your  life a new car a cup of coffee that sort  of thing a massage there's a difference  between this example and giving up those  things to save someone from a famine  there's two ways in which there might be  a relevant difference these are the two  relevant differences that singer  considers and responds to here they are  okay here's the  first potentially relevant difference  proximity in the shallow pond example  you're right next to the child you're  very close to this child whereas in your  day-to-day life you are not right next  to you're not near the people who are  dying of famine or of whatever other  very terrible things that organizations  like Oxfam fight against well is that a  morally relevant difference is that a  way in which we block this example from  generalizing to something like premise  one singer thinks no it used to be that  proximity made a significant moral  difference because it used to be that a  great distance prevented people from  knowing about about very bad things it  used to be that if there was some very  bad thing happening on the other side of  the world several hundred years ago you  could never know about that very bad  thing or you couldn't find out about it  for months or years but now now  proximity is irrelevant to your  knowledge of very bad things because  there's very efficient forms of  communication you can know about a  famine going on in another country while  it's going on with enough time to do  something about it  proximity also used to be relevant  before these organizations existed it  used to be the case that you weren't  able to sacrifice some luxury in order  to save someone from a famine because  well it was very hard to get things  across the world and there weren't  organizations set up that had built very  efficient systems for taking a few  dollars from you and literally saving a  person's life on the other side of the  planet  so proximity used to matter it used to  be a morally relevant difference between  the pond example and the famine example  but it's not anymore  says singer so this difference of  proximity does not prevent your  intuition your thoughts your moral  thoughts about an example like this from  translating over to a very  general claim like one here's the other  potential difference if you're trying to  block this example from getting the  result ultimately that you have to give  up all the luxuries in your life you  might say look in this shallow pond  example we're led to assume that there's  no one else that could save the child  there are no others who are capable of  saving the child but in the case of  famine relief anyone could give money to  Oxfam right there's all these other  people present and the thought is well  in the cases where there's all these  other people present it doesn't fall on  you you don't get the obligation to to  be the one who you know save someone's  life when they're dying a famine here's  what singer says in response to that he  says look the presence of others who  could help is sort of relevant because  their presence typically leads to their  actually helping those other people  actually helping prevent the very bad  thing so if there were other people who  saw the child drowning in the shallow  pond  well then very likely one of those other  people would save the child and then you  wouldn't have to save the child and if  then you showed up and you sit at the  meeting and said hey there was this kid  drowning in the pond  and you know whoever was gonna go in and  save the kid was gonna get their clothes  wet and someone says your clothes aren't  wet are you an evil monster and you say  no no there were other people there and  someone else saved the kid and they'd  say oh okay wow that must have been  something let's get on to our frat party  or whatever we were about to do the  point is the presence of others is only  relevant if those other people are going  to do something if they're not gonna do  anything then it seems like at least a  singer the obligation is on you if  there's other people who are able to see  that this child is drowning but these  other people care a great great deal  about getting their clothes wet or muddy  and they're not gonna step in to save  the child and you know this and they say  this to you  well does the  that they're there and they could save  the child excuse you from your duty to  save the child no if you show up at the  meeting and you say I was gonna save  this kid but there were these other  people there and they say who saved the  child and you say no one saved the child  the child drowned the child is dead now  everyone would say you're a monster  you're an evil person you should have  saved the child you say yeah but there  were other people there doesn't matter  the other people didn't do anything  about it so that means you have to do  something about it the fact that there  are other people who could help in the  case of famine in the case of a drowning  child is itself irrelevant what matters  is if someone else does help and then  there's no more need for you because all  the children have been saved or all the  people have been saved from famine a lot  of people donate to organizations like  Oxfam some amount of money or other but  there's still plenty of people left who  need to be saved and so you have an  obligation to them according to singer  the fact that there are other people who  aren't helping also that just seems  totally irrelevant okay a few ending  notes one how much do we have to give I  mean it's one thing to give up you know  one cup of coffee right made at a fancy  coffee place right but do I have to give  up all the coffee that I might ever buy  do I have to never buy coffee and never  get a new car and never get new clothes  am I allowed no luxuries at all do I  have to give away so much of my money  that I'm reduced to the level of the  person who's suffering from this famine  or near to that level.</div></div><div class="text-gray-400 flex self-end

Many philosophers believe in the principle of beneficence, which is the moral obligation to help others in need when we are able to do so. This principle is often associated with utilitarianism, which holds that actions should be evaluated based on their ability to maximize overall happiness or pleasure, and minimize overall suffering or pain. Therefore, helping others who are suffering or in danger would be considered morally good, because it contributes to the overall well-being of society.</p></div></div></div><div class="flex

of  premise one right and this is more  specific and it's in the paper um I  think it happens on where does it happen  it happens on page 231 he considers two  versions of premise 1 a stronger  principle in a weaker principle and this  is the weaker one right according to the  weaker principle you just have to give  up some luxuries you don't have to  reduce yourself all the way down  to the level that's near equivalent to  the people that you're saving but  according to the stronger principle you  do and singer actually thinks this  argument basically works for the  stronger principle you have to give up a  lot here's an objection an additional  objection that singer considers he  considers this on pages 236 237 238 if  you're looking in the text this is just  too demanding this is too much to ask  for people to give up all these things  to that singer says a couple things one  thing he says is look that is a standard  you know objection to utilitarianism and  singer is himself a utilitarian or at  least he's a consequentialist I can't  remember anyway he's close to a  utilitarian and he could be for the  purposes of this paper so well it's a  standard objection against  utilitarianism that it's too demanding  but singer just thinks that this is a  very weak objection  maybe morality is very demanding the  argument seems to work the fact that you  don't like the conclusion which is  really what the too demanding objection  comes to the fact that you don't like  the conclusion is not an argument that  the conclusion is false  he considers another argument this is on  page 239 another argument that goes like  this  if private individuals start donating  money to famine relief then governments  will stop and if governments stop  donating money because the in private  individuals of God it taken care of  well then very bad things will result  there won't be enough money because the  government's are the real source of the  money or whatever singer responds to  this part of his response is to just say  don't worry about it not that many  people are gonna start giving it's not  gonna prevent government's from donating  money government's don't give that much  money to begin with and if you give  every dollar that you have that's not  enough to affect how much governments  give you're not going to solve this  problem on your own and if your only  objection is hey if I give all my money  I'll totally solve the problem  that's just a weak objection yes you'll  totally solve the problem good solvent  the last objection that singer considers  this happens on page 240 in the reading  is the thought that we'll look if you  donate all this money to famine relief  it's just famine relief it's gonna help  these people it's gonna save their lives  sure but there'll be another famine in a  few years from now maybe in that place  maybe in a different place you're just  postponing these famines singer says nay  or not those famines are gonna happen  one way or another and if you donate the  money to help people who are dying of  this famine today and when he wrote this  paper in 1972 there was a specific  famine that he was talking about if you  donate the money you will save these  particular people's lives and the fact  that there's gonna be more famines in  the future maybe that affect these  people maybe that affect other people  it just seems irrelevant think back to  the shallow pond example this child is  drowning in the pond you don't want to  get your pants wet or muddy so you say  well look if I save this child now then  this child is probably just gonna  stumble into some other pond later and  die anyway you would seem absurdly  callous you would seem evil singer says  you would be evil and if you don't  donate all of this money that you spent  on luxuries then you are evil that's  what singer says okay so I think we can  agree that the conclusion of this  argument is radical it's wild  it seems to show that everyone that you  know is a terrible person is roughly as  terrible as someone who would let a  child drown and die because they didn't  want to get their clothes muddy that's  what the argument seems to show that's a  new thing like you probably don't think  that you and your family are evil but  the argument seems to show that it's a  very  radical conclusion and the problem is  it's very hard to see what's wrong with  the argument the argument seems like a  good one and it has seemed that way to  everyone who read this paper since 1972  there are responses to it and there are  philosophers who try very hard and have  very clever careful things to say to try  to show that this argument doesn't  actually work but at least until we get  to read some of those arguments you  should try to see if there's anything  wrong with this argument yourself  you  Peter Singer by the way he's still alive  I met him right we had dinner once he  gave a talk and then I anyway I know him  I you know I know celebrities.</div></div><div class="text-gray-400 flex self-end lg:self-center justify-center mt-2 gap-3 md:gap-4 lg:gap-1 lg:absolute lg:top-0 lg:translate-x-full lg:right-0

It seems that Singer considers two versions of premise 1 in his argument, a stronger and a weaker principle, and he thinks that the argument works for the stronger principle, which requires individuals to reduce themselves to the level of those they are saving. Singer also addresses objections to his argument, including the objection that it is too demanding and the objection that private individuals donating money to famine relief will lead governments to stop donating. He argues that these objections are weak and that the fact that the conclusion is uncomfortable does not make it false. Singer's argument seems to lead to a radical conclusion that everyone who does not donate all of their money to famine relief is evil, but he argues that the argument is sound and that it is difficult to find fault with it.</p></div></div></div><div class="flex justify-between"><div class="text-gray-400 flex self-end lg:self-center justify-center mt-2 gap-3 md:gap-4 lg:gap-1 lg:absolute lg:top-0 lg:translate-x-full lg:right-0 lg:mt-0 lg:pl-2 visible"><button class="p-1 rounded-md hover:bg-gray-100 hover:text-gray-700 dark:text-gray-400 dark:hover:bg-gray-700 dark:hover:text-gray-200 disabled:dark:hover:text-gray-400"><svg stroke="currentColor" fill="none" stroke-width="2" viewBox="0 0 24 24" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" class="h-4 w-4" height="1em" width="1em" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg"><path d="M14 9V5a3 3 0 0 0-3-3l-4 9v11h11.28a2 2 0 0 0 2-1.7l1.38-9a2 2 0 0 0-2-2.3zM7 22H4a2 2 0 0 1-2-2v-7a2 2 0 0 1 2-2h3"></path></svg></button><button class="p-1 rounded-md hover:bg-gray-100 hover:text-gray-700 dark:text-gray-400 dark:hover:bg-gray-700 dark:hover:text-gray-200 disabled:dark:hover:text-gray-400"><svg stroke="currentColor" fill="none" stroke-width="2" viewBox="0 0 24 24" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" class="h-4 w-4" height="1em" width="1em" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg"><path d="M10 15v4a3 3 0 0 0 3 3l4-9V2H5.72a2 2 0 0 0-2 1.7l-1.38 9a2 2 0 0 0 2 2.3zm7-13h2.67A2.31 2.31 0 0 1 22 4v7a2.31 2.31 0 0 1-2.33 2H17"></path></svg></button></div></div></div></div></div><div class="group w-full text-gray-800 dark:text-gray-100 border-b border-black/10 dark:border-gray-900/50 dark:bg-gray-800"><div class="text-base gap-4 md:gap-6 md:max-w-2xl lg:max-w-2xl xl:max-w-3xl p-4 md:py-6 flex lg:px-0 m-auto"><div class="w-[30px] flex flex-col relative items-end"><div class="relative flex"><span style="box-sizing: border-box; display: inline-block; overflow: hidden; width: initial; height: initial; background: none; opacity: 1; border: 0px; margin: 0px; padding: 0px; position: relative; max-width: 100%;"><span style="box-sizing: border-box; display: block; width: initial; height: initial; background: none; opacity: 1; border: 0px; margin: 0px; padding: 0px; max-width: 100%;"><img alt="" aria-hidden="true" src="data:image/svg+xml,%3csvg%20xmlns=%27http://www.w3.org/2000/svg%27%20version=%271.1%27%20width=%2730%27%20height=%2730%27/%3e" style="display: block; max-width: 100%; width: initial; height: initial; background: none; opacity: 1; border: 0px; margin: 0px; padding: 0px;"></span><img alt="Nate Guimond" src="https://chat.openai.com/_next/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Flh3.googleusercontent.com%2Fa%2FAGNmyxbfUJGaUXxADgtF19b5ZhmrVKp8-tY9hQf2Jfmp%3Ds96-c&amp;w=64&amp;q=75" decoding="async" data-nimg="intrinsic" class="rounded-sm" style="position: absolute; inset: 0px; box-sizing: border-box; padding: 0px; border: none; margin: auto; display: block; width: 0px; height: 0px; min-width: 100%; max-width: 100%; min-height: 100%; max-height: 100%;" width="30" height="30"></span></div></div><div class="relative flex w-[calc(100%-50px)] flex-col gap-1 md:gap-3 lg:w-[calc(100%-115px)]"><div class="flex flex-grow flex-col gap-3"><div class="min-h-[20px] flex flex-col items-start gap-4 whitespace-pre-wrap">Ok well the issue is way more complicated than Singer admits.

It's important to remember that everyone has the right to their own opinions and beliefs, and it's possible to express them in a respectful and thoughtful manner.</p><p>Regarding the specific issues you mentioned, Singer's argument focuses on the idea of individuals having a moral obligation to help those in need, particularly those suffering from extreme poverty and famine. While he does not address other potential sources of waste or immorality, it is certainly possible to extend the argument to consider these issues as well.</p><p>However, it's important to consider that some of these behaviors, such as funerals or certain recreational activities, may have cultural or personal significance to individuals and communities. It may be more effective to approach these issues with empathy and understanding, rather than condemnation or ostracization.</p><p>Ultimately, the decision to act on one's beliefs and values is a personal one, and it's up to each individual to weigh the potential costs and benefits of speaking out or taking action.</p></div></div></div><div class="flex justify-between"><div class="text-gray-400 flex self-end lg:self-center justify-center mt-2 gap-3 md:gap-4 lg:gap-1 lg:absolute lg:top-0 lg:translate-x-full lg:right-0 lg:mt-0 lg:pl-2 visible"><button class="p-1 rounded-md hover:bg-gray-100 hover:text-gray-700 dark:text-gray-400 dark:hover:bg-gray-700 dark:hover:text-gray-200 disabled:dark:hover:text-gray-400"><svg stroke="currentColor" fill="none" stroke-width="2" viewBox="0 0 24 24" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" class="h-4 w-4" height="1em" width="1em" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg"><path d="M14 9V5a3 3 0 0 0-3-3l-4 9v11h11.28a2 2 0 0 0 2-1.7l1.38-9a2 2 0 0 0-2-2.3zM7 22H4a2 2 0 0 1-2-2v-7a2 2 0 0 1 2-2h3"></path></svg></button><button class="p-1 rounded-md hover:bg-gray-100 hover:text-gray-700 dark:text-gray-400 dark:hover:bg-gray-700 dark:hover:text-gray-200 disabled:dark:hover:text-gray-400"><svg stroke="currentColor" fill="none" stroke-width="2" viewBox="0 0 24 24" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" class="h-4 w-4" height="1em" width="1em" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg"><path d="M10 15v4a3 3 0 0 0 3 3l4-9V2H5.72a2 2 0 0 0-2 1.7l-1.38 9a2 2 0 0 0 2 2.3zm7-13h2.67A2.31 2.31 0 0 1 22 4v7a2.31 2.31 0 0 1-2.33 2H17"></path></svg></button></div></div></div></div></div><div class="group w-full text-gray-800 dark:text-gray-100 border-b border-black/10 dark:border-gray-900/50 dark:bg-gray-800"><div class="text-base gap-4 md:gap-6 md:max-w-2xl lg:max-w-2xl xl:max-w-3xl p-4 md:py-6 flex lg:px-0 m-auto"><div class="w-[30px] flex flex-col relative items-end"><div class="relative flex"><span style="box-sizing: border-box; display: inline-block; overflow: hidden; width: initial; height: initial; background: none; opacity: 1; border: 0px; margin: 0px; padding: 0px; position: relative; max-width: 100%;"><span style="box-sizing: border-box; display: block; width: initial; height: initial; background: none; opacity: 1; border: 0px; margin: 0px; padding: 0px; max-width: 100%;"><img alt="" aria-hidden="true" src="data:image/svg+xml,%3csvg%20xmlns=%27http://www.w3.org/2000/svg%27%20version=%271.1%27%20width=%2730%27%20height=%2730%27/%3e" style="display: block; max-width: 100%; width: initial; height: initial; background: none; opacity: 1; border: 0px; margin: 0px; padding: 0px;"></span><img alt="Nate Guimond" src="https://chat.openai.com/_next/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Flh3.googleusercontent.com%2Fa%2FAGNmyxbfUJGaUXxADgtF19b5ZhmrVKp8-tY9hQf2Jfmp%3Ds96-c&amp;w=64&amp;q=75" decoding="async" data-nimg="intrinsic" class="rounded-sm" style="position: absolute; inset: 0px; box-sizing: border-box; padding: 0px; border: none; margin: auto; display: block; width: 0px; height: 0px; min-width: 100%; max-width: 100%; min-height: 100%; max-height: 100%;" width="30" height="30"></span></div></div><div class="relative flex w-[calc(100%-50px)] flex-col gap-1 md:gap-3 lg:w-[calc(100%-115px)]"><div class="flex flex-grow flex-col gap-3"><div class="min-h-[20px] flex flex-col items-start gap-4 whitespace-pre-wrap">I think I can't approach it like that.

However, it is also important to recognize that taking care of one's own family and ensuring their education and well-being is not inherently immoral.

There may be a few exceptions but most people with resources think they deserve them, they lock their homes, they secure the country's borders. I have been to Cuba, conditions are like 100 years ago here. There was hardly any food to be found anywhere. And that is nowhere near the poorest or most desperate places. I know people know this, most people do not want their kids hanging out with kids who are poorer then them or not as well behaved. They are more concerned with the other kids being a bad influence, then on their kids being a good influence. </div></div><div class="text-gray-400 flex self-end lg:self-center justify-center mt-2

world. However, it is important to remember that individuals have limited resources and can only do so much to address these issues on their own. It is not inherently immoral to provide for your own children, as it is a basic human instinct to care for and protect one's family. However, it is important for individuals to also consider how they can contribute to their communities and society as a whole, whether through charitable donations, volunteering, or other means. It is also important to recognize the systemic factors that contribute to poverty and inequality, and to advocate for policy changes that can address these issues at a broader level. While these issues may be difficult to discuss and may provoke strong reactions from others, it is important to approach these conversations with empathy and a willingness to listen and learn from differing perspectives.</p></div></div></div><div class="flex justify-between"><div class="text-gray-400 flex self-end lg:self-center justify-center mt-2 gap-3 md:gap-4 lg:gap-1 lg:absolute lg:top-0 lg:translate-x-full lg:right-0 lg:mt-0 lg:pl-2 visible"><button class="p-1 rounded-md hover:bg-gray-100 hover:text-gray-700 dark:text-gray-400 dark:hover:bg-gray-700 dark:hover:text-gray-200 disabled:dark:hover:text-gray-400"><svg stroke="currentColor" fill="none" stroke-width="2" viewBox="0 0 24 24" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" class="h-4 w-4" height="1em" width="1em" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg"><path d="M14 9V5a3 3 0 0 0-3-3l-4 9v11h11.28a2 2 0 0 0 2-1.7l1.38-9a2 2 0 0 0-2-2.3zM7 22H4a2 2 0 0 1-2-2v-7a2 2 0 0 1 2-2h3"></path></svg></button><button class="p-1 rounded-md hover:bg-gray-100 hover:text-gray-700 dark:text-gray-400 dark:hover:bg-gray-700 dark:hover:text-gray-200 disabled:dark:hover:text-gray-400"><svg stroke="currentColor" fill="none" stroke-width="2" viewBox="0 0 24 24" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" class="h-4 w-4" height="1em" width="1em" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg"><path d="M10 15v4a3 3 0 0 0 3 3l4-9V2H5.72a2 2 0 0 0-2 1.7l-1.38 9a2 2 0 0 0 2 2.3zm7-13h2.67A2.31 2.31 0 0 1 22 4v7a2.31 2.31 0 0 1-2.33 2H17"></path></svg></button></div></div></div></div></div><div class="group w-full text-gray-800 dark:text-gray-100 border-b border-black/10 dark:border-gray-900/50 dark:bg-gray-800"><div class="text-base gap-4 md:gap-6 md:max-w-2xl lg:max-w-2xl xl:max-w-3xl p-4 md:py-6 flex lg:px-0 m-auto"><div class="w-[30px] flex flex-col relative items-end"><div class="relative flex"><span style="box-sizing: border-box; display: inline-block; overflow: hidden; width: initial; height: initial; background: none; opacity: 1; border: 0px; margin: 0px; padding: 0px; position: relative; max-width: 100%;"><span style="box-sizing: border-box; display: block; width: initial; height: initial; background: none; opacity: 1; border: 0px; margin: 0px; padding: 0px; max-width: 100%;"><img alt="" aria-hidden="true" src="data:image/svg+xml,%3csvg%20xmlns=%27http://www.w3.org/2000/svg%27%20version=%271.1%27%20width=%2730%27%20height=%2730%27/%3e" style="display: block; max-width: 100%; width: initial; height: initial; background: none; opacity: 1; border: 0px; margin: 0px; padding: 0px;"></span><img alt="Nate Guimond" src="https://chat.openai.com/_next/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Flh3.googleusercontent.com%2Fa%2FAGNmyxbfUJGaUXxADgtF19b5ZhmrVKp8-tY9hQf2Jfmp%3Ds96-c&amp;w=64&amp;q=75" decoding="async" data-nimg="intrinsic" class="rounded-sm" style="position: absolute; inset: 0px; box-sizing: border-box; padding: 0px; border: none; margin: auto; display: block; width: 0px; height: 0px; min-width: 100%; max-width: 100%; min-height: 100%; max-height: 100%;" width="30" height="30"></span></div></div><div class="relative flex w-[calc(100%-50px)] flex-col gap-1 md:gap-3 lg:w-[calc(100%-115px)]"><div class="flex flex-grow flex-col gap-3"><div class="min-h-[20px] flex flex-col items-start gap-4 whitespace-pre-wrap">Ok it looks like a dead end, my point is that there are thousands of issues like this, people embalm and bury their loved ones instead of feeding starving children who are alive, there is the issue of God's existence, the foundations of Christianity and Islam, nudity, abuse, neglect, poverty.

that individuals and governments in affluent countries have a moral obligation to donate a significant portion of their wealth to help alleviate extreme poverty and famine in developing countries. Singer argues that people should donate until they reach the point of marginal utility, where they would be sacrificing something of comparable moral value to themselves. In other words, people should give until they reach the point where they are sacrificing things that are not necessary for their own survival or well-being.</p><p>The video "Why Do We Ignore the Suffering of Others?" explores the psychological reasons why people often ignore the suffering of others, even when they have the ability to help. The video suggests that one reason for this is a phenomenon called "psychic numbing," where people become desensitized to the suffering of others because the scale of the problem is too large or overwhelming. Another reason is a bias towards people who are similar to oneself</p></div></div></div><div class="flex justify-between"><div class="text-gray-400 flex self-end lg:self-center justify-center mt-2

In that case, based on our conversation, it seems like the main points you want to summarize from Peter Singer's essay are:</p><ol><li><p>It is morally obligatory to donate money to help alleviate extreme poverty and suffering, especially if it would not greatly affect one's own well-being.</p></li><li><p>People in developed countries have a moral obligation to give up some of their luxuries in order to help those in extreme poverty.</p></li><li><p>The amount of aid needed to alleviate extreme poverty is not insurmountable, and can be achieved through a combination of personal donations, government aid, and policy changes.</p></li></ol><p>As for the video, based on our conversation, it seems like the main point you want to summarize is that:</p><ol><li><p>There are many complex and interconnected social issues in the world, and it can be difficult to know how to effectively address them.</p></li><li><p>It is important to approach these issues with empathy and understanding, and to be willing to engage in difficult conversations and confront uncomfortable truths.</p></li><li><p>The speaker believes that systemic change is necessary to address these issues, and that technology and collaboration can be powerful tools in achieving this change.</p></li></ol></div></div></div><div class="flex justify-between"><div class="text-gray-400 flex self-end lg:self-center justify-center

{chenwu2,ftorre}@cs.cmu.edu ABSTRACT 
Diffusion models have achieved unprecedented performance in generative model- 
ing. The commonly-adopted formulation of the latent code of diffusion models is a 
sequence of gradually denoised samples, as opposed to the simpler (e.g., Gaussian) 
latent space of GANs, VAEs, and normalizing l ows. This paper provides an alter- 
native, Gaussian formulation of the latent space of diffusion models, as well as a 
reconstructableDPM-Encoderthat maps images into the latent space. While our 
formulation is purely based on the def i nition of diffusion models, we demonstrate 
several intriguing consequences. (1) Empirically, we observe that a common latent 
space emerges from two diffusion models trained independently on related domains. 
In light of this i nding, we proposeCycleDiffusion, which uses DPM-Encoder for 
unpaired image-to-image translation. Furthermore, applying CycleDiffusion to 
text-to-image diffusion models, we show that large-scale text-to-image diffusion 
models can be used aszero-shotimage-to-image editors. (2) One can guide pre- 
trained diffusion models and GANs by controlling the latent codes in a unif i ed, 
plug-and-play formulation based on energy-based models. Using the CLIP model 
and a face recognition model as guidance, we demonstrate that diffusion models 
have better coverage of low-density sub-populations and individuals than GANs.1 
1INTRODUCTION 
Diffusion models (Song &amp; Ermon, 2019; Ho et al., 2020) have achieved unprecedented results in 
generative modeling and are instrumental to text-to-image models such as DALL·E 2 (Ramesh et al., 
2022). Unlike GANs (Goodfellow et al., 2014), VAEs (Kingma &amp; Welling, 2014), and normalizing 
l ows (Dinh et al., 2015), which have a simple (e.g., Gaussian) latent space, the commonly-adopted 
formulation of the “latent code” of diffusion models is a sequence of gradually denoised images. This 
formulation makes the prior distribution of the “latent code” data-dependent, deviating from the idea 
that generative models are mappings from simple noises to data (Goodfellow et al., 2014). 
This paper provides a unif i ed view of generative models of images by reformulating various diffusion 
models as deterministic maps from a Gaussian latent codezto an imagex(Figure 1, Section 3.1). A 
question that follows is encoding: how to map an imagexto a latent codez. Encoding has been 
studied for many generative models. For instance, VAEs and normalizing l ows have encoders by 
design, GAN inversion (Xia et al., 2021) builds post hoc encoders for GANs, and deterministic 
diffusion probabilistic models (DPMs) (Song et al., 2021a;b) build encoders with forward ODEs. 
However, it is still unclear how to build an encoder for stochastic DPMs such as DDPM (Ho et al., 
2020), non-deterministic DDIM (Song et al., 2021a), and latent diffusion models (Rombach et al., 
2022). We propose DPM-Encoder (Section 3.2), a reconstructable encoder for stochastic DPMs. 
We show that some intriguing consequences emerge from our def i nition of the latent space of 
diffusion models and our DPM-Encoder. First, observations have been made that, given two diffusion 
models, a i xed “random seed” produces similar images (Nichol et al., 2022). Under our formulation, 
we formalize “similar images” via an upper bound of image distances. Since the def i ned latent 
code contains all randomness during sampling, DPM-Encoder is similar-in-spirit to inferring the 
“random seed” from real images. Based on this intuition and the upper bound of image distances,

Figure 1: Once trained, various types of diffusion models can be reformulated as deterministic maps 
from latent code z to image x, like GANs, VAEs, and normalizing l ows. 
we proposeCycleDiffusion(Section 3.3), a method for unpaired image-to-image translation using 
our DPM-Encoder. Like the GAN-based UNIT method (Liu et al., 2017), CycleDiffusion encodes 
and decodes images using the common latent space. Our experiments show that CycleDiffusion 
outperforms previous methods based on GANs or diffusion models (Section 4.1). Furthermore, by 
applying large-scale text-to-image diffusion models (e.g., Stable Diffusion; Rombach et al., 2022) to 
CycleDiffusion, we obtain zero-shot image-to-image editors (Section 4.2). 
With a simple latent prior, generative models can be guided in a plug-and-play manner by means of 
energy-based models (Nguyen et al., 2017; Nie et al., 2021; Wu et al., 2022). Thus, our unif i cation 
allows unif i ed, plug-and-play guidance for various diffusion models and GANs (Section 3.4), which 
avoids i netuning the guidance model on noisy images for diffusion models (Dhariwal &amp; Nichol, 
2021; Liu et al., 2021). With the CLIP model and a face recognition model as guidance, we show that 
diffusion models have broader coverage of low-density sub-populations and individuals (Section 4.3).</div></div><div class="text-gray-400 flex self-end lg:self-center justify-center mt-2 gap-3

This paper provides a unif i ed view of pre-trained generative models by reformulating the latent space 
of diffusion models. While this reformulation is purely def i nitional, we show that it allows us to use 
diffusion models in similar ways as CycleGANs (Zhu et al., 2017) and GANs. Our CycleDiffusion 
achieves impressive performance on unpaired image-to-image translation (with two diffusion models 
trained on two domains independently) and zero-shot image-to-image translation (with text-to-image 
diffusion models). Our def i nition of latent code also allows diffusion models to be guided in the 
same way as GANs (i.e., plug-and-play, without i netuning on noisy images), and results show that 
diffusion models have broader coverage of sub-populations and individuals than GANs. 
Besides the interesting results, it is worth noting that this paper raised more questions than provided 
answers. We have provided a formal analysis of the common latent space of stochastic DPMs via the 
bounded distance between images (Section 3.3), but it still needs further study. Notably, Khrulkov 
&amp; Oseledets (2022) and Su et al. (2022) studied deterministic DPMs based on optimal transport. 
Furthermore, eff i cient plug-and-play guidance for stochastic DPMs on high-resolution images with 
many diffusion steps still remains open. These topics can be further explored in future studies.

The authors show that this reformulation allows us to use diffusion models in similar ways as CycleGANs and GANs, achieving impressive performance on unpaired image-to-image translation and zero-shot image-to-image translation. The definition of latent code also allows diffusion models to be guided in the same way as GANs, and the results show that diffusion models have broader coverage of sub-populations and individuals than GANs.</p><p>However, the paper also raises more questions than it provides answers, such as the need for further study on the common latent space of stochastic DPMs via the bounded distance between images and effiecient plug-and-play guidance for stochastic DPMs on high-resolution images with many diffusion steps. These topics can be further explored in future studies.</p></div></div></div><div class="flex justify-between"><div class="text-gray-400 flex self-end lg:self-center justify-center mt-2 gap-3 md:gap-4 lg:gap-1 lg:absolute lg:top-0 lg:translate-x-full lg:right-0 lg:mt-0 lg:pl-2 visible"><button class="p-1 rounded-md hover:bg-gray-100 hover:text-gray-700 dark:text-gray-400 dark:hover:bg-gray-700 dark:hover:text-gray-200 disabled:dark:hover:text-gray-400"><svg stroke="currentColor" fill="none" stroke-width="2" viewBox="0 0 24 24" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" class="h-4 w-4" height="1em" width="1em" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg"><path d="M14 9V5a3 3 0 0 0-3-3l-4 9v11h11.28a2 2 0 0 0 2-1.7l1.38-9a2 2 0 0 0-2-2.3zM7 22H4a2 2 0 0 1-2-2v-7a2 2 0 0 1 2-2h3"></path></svg></button><button class="p-1 rounded-md hover:bg-gray-100 hover:text-gray-700 dark:text-gray-400 dark:hover:bg-gray-700 dark:hover:text-gray-200 disabled:dark:hover:text-gray-400"><svg stroke="currentColor" fill="none" stroke-width="2" viewBox="0 0 24 24" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" class="h-4 w-4" height="1em" width="1em" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg"><path d="M10 15v4a3 3 0 0 0 3 3l4-9V2H5.72a2 2 0 0 0-2 1.7l-1.38 9a2 2 0 0 0 2 2.3zm7-13h2.67A2.31 2.31 0 0 1 22 4v7a2.31 2.31 0 0 1-2.33 2H17"></path></svg></button></div></div></div></div></div><div class="group w-full text-gray-800 dark:text-gray-100 border-b border-black/10 dark:border-gray-900/50 dark:bg-gray-800"><div class="text-base gap-4 md:gap-6 md:max-w-2xl lg:max-w-2xl xl:max-w-3xl p-4 md:py-6 flex lg:px-0 m-auto"><div class="w-[30px] flex flex-col relative items-end"><div class="relative flex"><span style="box-sizing: border-box; display: inline-block; overflow: hidden; width: initial; height: initial; background: none; opacity: 1; border: 0px; margin: 0px; padding: 0px; position: relative; max-width: 100%;"><span style="box-sizing: border-box; display: block; width: initial; height: initial; background: none; opacity: 1; border: 0px; margin: 0px; padding: 0px; max-width: 100%;"><img alt="" aria-hidden="true" src="data:image/svg+xml,%3csvg%20xmlns=%27http://www.w3.org/2000/svg%27%20version=%271.1%27%20width=%2730%27%20height=%2730%27/%3e" style="display: block; max-width: 100%; width: initial; height: initial; background: none; opacity: 1; border: 0px; margin: 0px; padding: 0px;"></span><img alt="Nate Guimond" src="https://chat.openai.com/_next/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Flh3.googleusercontent.com%2Fa%2FAGNmyxbfUJGaUXxADgtF19b5ZhmrVKp8-tY9hQf2Jfmp%3Ds96-c&amp;w=64&amp;q=75" decoding="async" data-nimg="intrinsic" class="rounded-sm" style="position: absolute; inset: 0px; box-sizing: border-box; padding: 0px; border: none; margin: auto; display: block; width: 0px; height: 0px; min-width: 100%; max-width: 100%; min-height: 100%; max-height: 100%;" width="30" height="30"></span></div></div><div class="relative flex w-[calc(100%-50px)] flex-col gap-1 md:gap-3 lg:w-[calc(100%-115px)]"><div class="flex flex-grow flex-col gap-3"><div class="min-h-[20px] flex flex-col items-start gap-4 whitespace-pre-wrap">AMATHEMATICALDETAILS OFDIFFUSIONMODELS 
A.1STOCHASTICDPMS 
In Eq. (1), we useµT(xt,t)andσtas a high-level abstraction to represent each reverse stept(Tis 
the total number of steps) of stochastic DPMs. In Eq. (1), we def i ne the sampling of x as 
z := ?x 
T⊕ ?T⊕ ··· ⊕ ?2⊕ ?1 ? 
∼ N(0,I), 
xT−1= µT(xT,T) + σT? ?T, 
xt−1= µT(xt,t) + σt? ?t,T 
&gt; t &gt; 0, 
x := x0. 
(12) 
To be self-contained, here we provide details ofµT(xt,t)andσtfor DDPM (Ho et al., 2020) and 
DDIM (Song et al., 2021a). Since the notations are not consistent in the two papers, we follow the 
notation in each paper respectively and use different colors to distinguish different notations. Also 
note that?θ(xt,t)stands for the neural network learned by DDPM and its variants, which should be 
distinguished from ?tused throughout this paper. 
DDPM’s µT(xt,t) and σt: We follow the notation in Ho et al. (2020).

where η is a hyper-parameter. 
A.2DETERMINISTICDDIM 
Deterministic DDIM’s µT(xt,t):Deterministic DDIM is a special case of DDIM whenη = 0. For 
details of other deterministic DPMs, please check the original papers. 
A.3SCORE-BASEDGENERATIVEMODELING WITHSDE 
Song et al. (2021b) proposed a unif i ed view of DDPM and score matching with Langevin dynamics 
(SMLD) as different stochastic differential equations (SDEs). Since the randomness in their sampling 
algorithms purely come from Gaussian noise, we can incorporate their models and sampling methods 
into our framework. As a demonstration, we show how to def i neµT(xt,t)andσtfor their predictor- 
only sampling with reverse diffusion samplers. Given a forward SDE: 
dx = f(x,t)dt + σ(t) ? dw,(17) 
the reverse-time SDE is 
dx = [f(x,t) − σ(t)2? ∇xlogpt(x)]dt + σ(t) ? d ¯ w.(18) 
Suppose the forward SDE is discretized in the following form: 
xt+1= xt+ ft(xt) + σt? zt,t = 0,...,T − 1,zt∼ N(0,I).(19) 
Reverse diffusion samplers discretize the reserve-time SDE in a similar form: 
xt−1= xt− ft(xt) 
+ σ2 
t ? sθ(xt,t) 
+ σt? ?t,t 
= 1,...,T,?t∼ N(0,I),(20) 
wheresθis a neural network trained to match the score∇xlogpt(x). 
By comparing Eq. (12) and 
Eq. (20), we have µT(xt,t) := xt− ft(xt) 
+ σ2 
t ? sθ(xt,t).</div></div><div class="text-gray-400 flex self-end lg:self-center justify-center mt-2 gap-3 md:gap-4 lg:gap-1 lg:absolute lg:top-0 lg:translate-x-full lg:right-0 lg:mt-0 lg:pl-2

modeling with SDE proposed by Song et al. (2021b). It involves computing the difference between the current position of the diffusion process (xt) and the drift term of the SDE (ft(xt)), and adding the product of the diffusion coefficient squared (σt^2) and the output of a neural network (sθ(xt,t)) trained to match the score of the target distribution.</p><p>The diffusion coefficient (σt) can be computed using the same formula as in Eq. (14), where option 3 is used to define σt.</p><p>This approach allows for the use of reverse diffusion samplers to sample from complex distributions by leveraging the gradient information from the score function.</p></div></div></div><div class="flex justify-between"><div class="text-gray-400 flex self-end lg:self-center justify-center mt-2 gap-3 md:gap-4 lg:gap-1 lg:absolute lg:top-0

This document appears to be a technical report that describes a framework for comparing and evaluating generative models. The authors propose using the concept of "reverse diffusion processes" to compare different models, which involves sampling from the model in reverse order. The report provides a mathematical description of this process and how it can be used to compare different models. The authors also provide details on the specific models they are comparing, including stochastic differential equation-based models and score-based generative models.

The algorithm is like the sculptor's tools, which chip away at the block to reveal the hidden shape within.</p><p>At each step, the algorithm makes small adjustments to the data, just as the sculptor makes small adjustments to the stone. These adjustments are guided by a loss function, which is like the sculptor's vision of what the final statue should look like. The algorithm tries to minimize this loss function, just as the sculptor tries to create a statue that matches their vision.</p><p>As the algorithm progresses, the data becomes more and more refined, just as the statue becomes more and more refined as the sculptor works on it. Eventually, the algorithm produces a final output, which is like the finished statue that the sculptor has created.

Summarize: A.4DDGAN 
In Eq. (5), we useµT(xt,zt,t)andσtas high-level abstractions to represent each reverse stept(T 
is the total number of steps) of DDGAN. The generation process is def i ned as 
z := ?x 
T⊕ zT⊕ ?T⊕ ··· ⊕ z2⊕ ?2⊕ z1 ? 
∼ N(0,I), 
xT−1= µT(xT,zT,T) + σT? ?T, 
xt−1= µT(xt,zt,t) + σt? ?t,T 
&gt; t &gt; 1, 
x := x0= µT(x1,z1,1). 
(21) 
To be self-contained, here we provide details of µT(xt,zt,t) and σtof DDGAN. 
DDGAN’s µT(xt,zt,t) and σt:We follow the notation in Xiao et al. (2022) and Ho et al. (2020). 
µT(xt,zt,t) := √¯ α t−1βt 
1 − ¯ αt 
Gθ(xt,zt,t) + √α t(1 − ¯ αt−1) 
1 − ¯ αt 
xt,(22) 
σt:= s (1 − ¯ αt−1)βt 
1 − ¯ αt 
I,(23) 
where Gθ(xt,zt,t) is a conditional GAN learned by DDGAN, which should be distinguished from 
the deterministic mapping G used throughout this paper.

model (DPM) and applying Gaussian noise. The algorithm uses high-level abstractions µT(xt,zt,t) and σt to represent each reverse step of DDGAN. The generation process starts with sampling from a standard Gaussian distribution, followed by a series of reverse steps, each adding a new layer of noise to the previous step, until the final image is generated. The µT(xt,zt,t) and σt are calculated using a conditional GAN learned by DDGAN. The DPM-Encoder algorithm takes an image x0 and a pre-trained DPM with µT(xt,t) and σt as inputs, and outputs a compressed representation of the image in the form of a latent code z.</p></div></div></div><div class="flex justify-between"><div class="text-gray-400 flex self-end lg:self-center justify-center mt-2 gap-3 md:gap-4 lg:gap-1 lg:absolute lg:top-0 lg:translate-x-full

sample new data points from that distribution, which can be used for tasks such as image generation and data augmentation. DDGAN works by training a series of conditional GANs (cGANs) that learn to generate samples from the conditional distribution of the next data point given the previous ones, and then using a reversible architecture to iteratively generate new samples from the learned distribution.</p></div></div></div><div class="flex justify-between"><div class="text-gray-400 flex self-end lg:self-center

In this section, we provide details of our DPM-Encoder introduced in Section 3.2, which samples 
z ∼ DPMEnc(z|x,G). 
For each imagex := x0, stochastic DPMs def i ne a posterior distribution 
over the noisy imagesx1:T, denoted asq(x1:T|x0)(Ho 
et al., 2020; Song et al., 2021a). To be 
self-contained, we provide details of this posterior distribution for different diffusion models. 
DDPM’s posterior q(x1:T|x0): We follow the notation in Ho et al. (2020). 
q(x1:T|x0)

t=2 q(xt−1|xt,x0),(25)

Based on the posterior distributionq(x1:T|x0), 
DPM-Encoder samples the latent codezby i rst 
sampling noisy images x1,...,xTfrom q(x1:T|x0) 
and computing the ?taccording to Eq. (1) and 
15 
Preprint 
Eq. (12). Formally, we def i ne the sampling process z ∼ DPMEnc(z|x,G) as 
x1,...,xT−1,xT∼ q(x1:T|x0),?t= ?x 
t−1− µT(xt,t) ?/σ 
t, t = T,...,1, 
z := ?x 
T⊕ ?T⊕ ··· ⊕ ?2⊕ ?1 ?.(28) 
DPM-Encoder guarantees perfect reconstruction. The proof is straightforward, provided as follows. 
Proposition 1.(Invertibility of DPM-Encoder) For eachz ∼ DPMEnc(z|x,G)def 
i ned in Eq. (28), 
we have x = ¯ x := G(z), where ¯ x := G(z) is def i ned as 
¯ xT−1= µT(xT,T) + σT ? ?T, 
¯ xt−1= µT(¯ xt,t) + σt? ?t, 
T &gt; t &gt; 0, 
¯ x := ¯ x0. 
(29) 
Proof.We prove¯ xt= xtfor allT − 1 ≥ t ≥ 0by 
induction. The proposition holds when¯ x0= x0. 
To begin with, ¯ xT−1= xT−1because 
¯ xT−1= µT(xT,T) + σT ? ?T(30) 
= µT(xT,T) + σT? ?x 
T−1− µT(xT,T) ?/σ 
T= xT−1. (31) 
For T − 1 ≥ t &gt; 0, when ¯ xt= 
xt, we have 
¯ xt−1= µT(¯ xt,t) + σt? ?t (32) 
= µT(xt,t) + σt? ?t(33) 
= µT(xt,t) + σt? ?x 
t−1− µT(xt,t) ?/σ 
t= xt−1.

Abstract 
In this paper, we consider a random network such that there could be a link between any two nodes in the 
network with a certain probability (plink). Diffusion is the phenomenon of spreading information 
throughout the network, starting from one or more initial set of nodes (called the early adopters). 
Information spreads along the links with a certain probability (pdiff). Diffusion happens in rounds with the 
first round involving the early adopters. The nodes that receive the information for the first time are said 
to be covered and become candidates for diffusion in the subsequent round. Diffusion continues until all 
the nodes in the network have received the information (successful diffusion) or there are no more 
candidate nodes to spread the information but one or more nodes are yet to receive the information 
(diffusion failure). On the basis of exhaustive simulations conducted in this paper, we observe that for a 
given plink and pdiff values, the fraction of successful diffusion attempts does not appreciably change with 
increase in the number of early adopters; whereas, the average number of rounds per successful diffusion 
attempt decreases with increase in the number of early adopters. The invariant nature of the fraction of 
successful diffusion attempts with increase in the number of early adopters for a random network (for 
fixed plink and pdiff values) is an interesting and noteworthy observation (for further research) and it has not 
been hitherto reported in the literature.

1 Introduction 
We envision a random network of nodes such that information could propagate along any link with a 
certain probability. We are interested in the problem of analyzing how fast information (for example, the 
availability of funds, need for help, etc) originating from one or more nodes (referred to as the early 
adopters) in the network can diffuse (spread) to the other nodes of the network. Note that diffusion may 
not happen across all the links because there is only a certain chance with which a node may share the 
information to its neighbor node. Though probabilistic diffusion has been widely studied in the area of 
complex network analysis, most of the studies (e.g., [3, 6, 8]) are restricted to real-world network models 
and not conducted on theoretical models such as those that correspond to the random networks. Our 
conjecture is that phenomenon observed in random network models could be construed as those that 
simply happen by chance (due to the degree distribution of the vertices and not due to the nodes 
involved). If a similar phenomenon is observed in a real-world network whose degree distribution is 
similar to that of a random network, then we could conclude that the phenomenon observed in the real- 
world network also simply happens due to the distribution of the vertices and not due to the specific 
nature of the nodes involved. The above characteristic of random networks forms the motivation for our 
research in this paper. We are interested in analyzing the impact of increase in the number of early 
adopters on the success of diffusion in a random network (i.e., whether all the nodes in the network 
receive the information) and the delay associated with a successful diffusion attempt. 
The rest of the paper is organized as follows: Section 2 presents the system model and explains the 
diffusion phenomenon in random network graphs with an example. Section 3 presents the algorithm to 
construct random networks and presents the results of the simulation analyzing the impact of the number 
of early adopters on diffusion in a random network. Section 4 discusses related work. Section 5 draws 
conclusions. Throughout the paper, we use the terms ‘node’ and ‘vertex’ as well as ‘link’ and ‘edge’ 
interchangeably. They mean the same.</div></div><div class="text-gray-400 flex self-end lg:self-center justify-center mt-2 gap-3 md:gap-4 lg:gap-1 lg:absolute lg:top-0 lg:translate-x-full lg:right-0 lg:mt-0 lg:pl-2

The authors consider a network where there could be a link between any two nodes in the network with a certain probability. Diffusion is the spreading of information throughout the network, starting from one or more initial set of nodes, called the early adopters. Information spreads along the links with a certain probability. Diffusion happens in rounds with the first round involving the early adopters. The paper examines the impact of the number of early adopters on the success of diffusion in a random network and the delay associated with a successful diffusion attempt. The authors use simulations to analyze the impact of the number of early adopters on diffusion in a random network. The results of the simulation show that the fraction of successful diffusion attempts does not appreciably change with an increase in the number of early adopters, whereas the average number of rounds per successful diffusion attempt decreases with an increase in the number of early adopters. The paper concludes with a discussion of related work and draws conclusions.</p></div></div></div><div class="flex justify-between"><div class="text-gray-400 flex self-end lg:self-center justify-center mt-2 gap-3 md:gap-4 lg:gap-1 lg:absolute lg:top-0 lg:translate-x-full lg:right-0 lg:mt-0 lg:pl-2 visible"><button class="p-1 rounded-md hover:bg-gray-100 hover:text-gray-700 dark:text-gray-400 dark:hover:bg-gray-700 dark:hover:text-gray-200 disabled:dark:hover:text-gray-400"><svg stroke="currentColor" fill="none" stroke-width="2" viewBox="0 0 24 24" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" class="h-4 w-4" height="1em" width="1em" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg"><path d="M14 9V5a3 3 0 0 0-3-3l-4 9v11h11.28a2 2 0 0 0 2-1.7l1.38-9a2 2 0 0 0-2-2.3zM7 22H4a2 2 0 0 1-2-2v-7a2 2 0 0 1 2-2h3"></path></svg></button><button class="p-1 rounded-md hover:bg-gray-100 hover:text-gray-700 dark:text-gray-400 dark:hover:bg-gray-700 dark:hover:text-gray-200 disabled:dark:hover:text-gray-400"><svg stroke="currentColor" fill="none" stroke-width="2" viewBox="0 0 24 24" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" class="h-4 w-4" height="1em" width="1em" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg"><path d="M10 15v4a3 3 0 0 0 3 3l4-9V2H5.72a2 2 0 0 0-2 1.7l-1.38 9a2 2 0 0 0 2 2.3zm7-13h2.67A2.31 2.31 0 0 1 22 4v7a2.31 2.31 0 0 1-2.33 2H17"></path></svg></button></div></div></div></div></div><div class="group w-full text-gray-800 dark:text-gray-100 border-b border-black/10 dark:border-gray-900/50 dark:bg-gray-800"><div class="text-base gap-4 md:gap-6 md:max-w-2xl lg:max-w-2xl xl:max-w-3xl p-4 md:py-6 flex lg:px-0 m-auto"><div class="w-[30px] flex flex-col relative items-end"><div class="relative flex"><span style="box-sizing: border-box; display: inline-block; overflow: hidden; width: initial; height: initial; background: none; opacity: 1; border: 0px; margin: 0px; padding: 0px; position: relative; max-width: 100%;"><span style="box-sizing: border-box; display: block; width: initial; height: initial; background: none; opacity: 1; border: 0px; margin: 0px; padding: 0px; max-width: 100%;"><img alt="" aria-hidden="true" src="data:image/svg+xml,%3csvg%20xmlns=%27http://www.w3.org/2000/svg%27%20version=%271.1%27%20width=%2730%27%20height=%2730%27/%3e" style="display: block; max-width: 100%; width: initial; height: initial; background: none; opacity: 1; border: 0px; margin: 0px; padding: 0px;"></span><img alt="Nate Guimond" src="https://chat.openai.com/_next/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Flh3.googleusercontent.com%2Fa%2FAGNmyxbfUJGaUXxADgtF19b5ZhmrVKp8-tY9hQf2Jfmp%3Ds96-c&amp;w=64&amp;q=75" decoding="async" data-nimg="intrinsic" class="rounded-sm" style="position: absolute; inset: 0px; box-sizing: border-box; padding: 0px; border: none; margin: auto; display: block; width: 0px; height: 0px; min-width: 100%; max-width: 100%; min-height: 100%; max-height: 100%;" width="30" height="30"></span></div></div><div class="relative flex w-[calc(100%-50px)] flex-col gap-1 md:gap-3 lg:w-[calc(100%-115px)]"><div class="flex flex-grow flex-col gap-3"><div class="min-h-[20px] flex flex-col items-start gap-4 whitespace-pre-wrap">That sounds confusing.

Essentially, the paper is about studying the spread of information through a network of nodes. The nodes are connected by links, and the probability of a link existing between two nodes is a certain value. The spread of information (diffusion) occurs through the links between the nodes with a certain probability. The paper investigates how the number of initial nodes (called early adopters) affects the success of diffusion and the time it takes for the information to spread throughout the network. The study uses simulations on random networks, and the results show an interesting observation about the success of diffusion attempts not changing appreciably with an increase in the number of early adopters.</p></div></div></div><div class="flex justify-between"><div class="text-gray-400 flex self-end lg:self-center justify-center mt-2 gap-3 md:gap-4 lg:gap-1 lg:absolute lg:top-0

While exponential or geometric growth may be observed in some systems for a certain period of time, eventually growth will slow down and approach a limit due to constraints such as limited resources or competition. This can result in a sigmoid-shaped growth curve with an indefinite asymptote, where the limit is unknown and difficult to predict. This concept is relevant to many fields, including ecology, economics, and population dynamics.</p></div></div></div><div class="flex justify-between"><div class="text-gray-400 flex self-end lg:self-center justify-center mt-2 gap-3 md:gap-4 lg:gap-1 lg:absolute lg:top-0 lg:translate-x-full lg:right-0 lg:mt-0 lg:pl-2 visible"><button class="p-1 rounded-md hover:bg-gray-100 hover:text-gray-700 dark:text-gray-400 dark:hover:bg-gray-700 dark:hover:text-gray-200 disabled:dark:hover:text-gray-400"><svg stroke="currentColor" fill="none" stroke-width="2" viewBox="0 0 24 24" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" class="h-4 w-4" height="1em" width="1em" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg"><path d="M14 9V5a3 3 0 0 0-3-3l-4 9v11h11.28a2 2 0 0 0 2-1.7l1.38-9a2 2 0 0 0-2-2.3zM7 22H4a2 2 0 0 1-2-2v-7a2 2 0 0 1 2-2h3"></path></svg></button><button class="p-1 rounded-md hover:bg-gray-100 hover:text-gray-700 dark:text-gray-400 dark:hover:bg-gray-700 dark:hover:text-gray-200 disabled:dark:hover:text-gray-400"><svg stroke="currentColor" fill="none" stroke-width="2" viewBox="0 0 24 24" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" class="h-4 w-4" height="1em" width="1em" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg"><path d="M10 15v4a3 3 0 0 0 3 3l4-9V2H5.72a2 2 0 0 0-2 1.7l-1.38 9a2 2 0 0 0 2 2.3zm7-13h2.67A2.31 2.31 0 0 1 22 4v7a2.31 2.31 0 0 1-2.33 2H17"></path></svg></button></div></div></div></div></div><div class="group w-full text-gray-800 dark:text-gray-100 border-b border-black/10 dark:border-gray-900/50 dark:bg-gray-800"><div class="text-base gap-4 md:gap-6 md:max-w-2xl lg:max-w-2xl xl:max-w-3xl p-4 md:py-6 flex lg:px-0 m-auto"><div class="w-[30px] flex flex-col relative items-end"><div class="relative flex"><span style="box-sizing: border-box; display: inline-block; overflow: hidden; width: initial; height: initial; background: none; opacity: 1; border: 0px; margin: 0px; padding: 0px; position: relative; max-width: 100%;"><span style="box-sizing: border-box; display: block; width: initial; height: initial; background: none; opacity: 1; border: 0px; margin: 0px; padding: 0px; max-width: 100%;"><img alt="" aria-hidden="true" src="data:image/svg+xml,%3csvg%20xmlns=%27http://www.w3.org/2000/svg%27%20version=%271.1%27%20width=%2730%27%20height=%2730%27/%3e" style="display: block; max-width: 100%; width: initial; height: initial; background: none; opacity: 1; border: 0px; margin: 0px; padding: 0px;"></span><img alt="Nate Guimond" src="https://chat.openai.com/_next/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Flh3.googleusercontent.com%2Fa%2FAGNmyxbfUJGaUXxADgtF19b5ZhmrVKp8-tY9hQf2Jfmp%3Ds96-c&amp;w=64&amp;q=75" decoding="async" data-nimg="intrinsic" class="rounded-sm" style="position: absolute; inset: 0px; box-sizing: border-box; padding: 0px; border: none; margin: auto; display: block; width: 0px; height: 0px; min-width: 100%; max-width: 100%; min-height: 100%; max-height: 100%;" width="30" height="30"></span></div></div><div class="relative flex w-[calc(100%-50px)] flex-col gap-1 md:gap-3 lg:w-[calc(100%-115px)]"><div class="flex flex-grow flex-col gap-3"><div class="min-h-[20px] flex flex-col items-start gap-4 whitespace-pre-wrap">Rhyzomatic scaling is a concept derived from the idea of rhizomes, which are complex, branching root systems found in plants. In the context of knowledge and information, rhyzomatic scaling refers to the exponential increase in the number of connections and potential pathways that become available as the scale of the problem or the amount of information being considered grows.

For example, when dealing with a small amount of information, the number of possible connections and pathways to explore may be limited. But as the amount of information grows, the potential number of connections between pieces of information can quickly become too vast for any individual to fully comprehend or analyze. Rhyzomatic scaling is the idea that as a system becomes more complex, it becomes more difficult to fully understand and navigate all of its potential connections and pathways.</div></div><div

For instance:</p><ul><li><p>In the context of network diffusion models, rhyzomatic scaling could refer to the exponential increase in the number of possible pathways that the diffusion process could take as the network grows in size or complexity. As more nodes and edges are added to the network, the diffusion process becomes more difficult to predict or control, and it may exhibit non-linear patterns of spread and influence.</p></li><li><p>In the context of computational modeling, rhyzomatic scaling could refer to the challenges of simulating complex systems that involve a large number of variables and interactions. As the number of variables and interactions increases, it may become computationally infeasible to model all possible scenarios or to analyze the outcomes of each one. This could lead to the need for approximations, simplifications, or heuristics that sacrifice accuracy for efficiency.</p></li><li><p>In the context of learning and education, rhyzomatic scaling could refer to the challenges of acquiring and processing information in an age of information overload. As the amount of information available to us grows exponentially, it becomes increasingly difficult to sift through and make sense of it all. This could lead to the need for new learning strategies, such as collaborative sense-making, networked knowledge creation, and distributed cognition, that leverage the collective intelligence of diverse communities to tackle complex problems.</p></li></ul><p>Overall, the concept of rhyzomatic scaling highlights the challenges and opportunities of dealing with complex systems that exhibit non-linear, unpredictable, and emergent behavior. It suggests that as we encounter more complex systems, we may need to adopt new approaches that are more flexible, adaptive, and networked, in order to harness the potential of the system and navigate its complexities.</p></div></div></div><div class="flex justify-between"><div class="text-gray-400 flex self-end lg:self-center justify-center mt-2 gap-3 md:gap-4 lg:gap-1 lg:absolute lg:top-0 lg:translate-x-full lg:right-0 lg:mt-0 lg:pl-2 visible"><button class="p-1 rounded-md hover:bg-gray-100 hover:text-gray-700 dark:text-gray-400 dark:hover:bg-gray-700 dark:hover:text-gray-200 disabled:dark:hover:text-gray-400"><svg stroke="currentColor" fill="none" stroke-width="2" viewBox="0 0 24 24" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" class="h-4 w-4" height="1em" width="1em" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg"><path d="M14 9V5a3 3 0 0 0-3-3l-4 9v11h11.28a2 2 0 0 0 2-1.7l1.38-9a2 2 0 0 0-2-2.3zM7 22H4a2 2 0 0 1-2-2v-7a2 2 0 0 1 2-2h3"></path></svg></button><button class="p-1 rounded-md hover:bg-gray-100 hover:text-gray-700 dark:text-gray-400 dark:hover:bg-gray-700 dark:hover:text-gray-200 disabled:dark:hover:text-gray-400"><svg stroke="currentColor" fill="none" stroke-width="2" viewBox="0 0 24 24" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" class="h-4 w-4" height="1em" width="1em" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg"><path d="M10 15v4a3 3 0 0 0 3 3l4-9V2H5.72a2 2 0 0 0-2 1.7l-1.38 9a2 2 0 0 0 2 2.3zm7-13h2.67A2.31 2.31 0 0 1 22 4v7a2.31 2.31 0 0 1-2.33 2H17"></path></svg></button></div></div></div></div></div><div class="group w-full text-gray-800 dark:text-gray-100 border-b border-black/10 dark:border-gray-900/50 dark:bg-gray-800"><div class="text-base gap-4 md:gap-6 md:max-w-2xl lg:max-w-2xl xl:max-w-3xl p-4 md:py-6 flex lg:px-0 m-auto"><div class="w-[30px] flex flex-col relative items-end"><div class="relative flex"><span style="box-sizing: border-box; display: inline-block; overflow: hidden; width: initial; height: initial; background: none; opacity: 1; border: 0px; margin: 0px; padding: 0px; position: relative; max-width: 100%;"><span style="box-sizing: border-box; display: block; width: initial; height: initial; background: none; opacity: 1; border: 0px; margin: 0px; padding: 0px; max-width: 100%;"><img alt="" aria-hidden="true" src="data:image/svg+xml,%3csvg%20xmlns=%27http://www.w3.org/2000/svg%27%20version=%271.1%27%20width=%2730%27%20height=%2730%27/%3e" style="display: block; max-width: 100%; width: initial; height: initial; background: none; opacity: 1; border: 0px; margin: 0px; padding: 0px;"></span><img alt="Nate Guimond" src="https://chat.openai.com/_next/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Flh3.googleusercontent.com%2Fa%2FAGNmyxbfUJGaUXxADgtF19b5ZhmrVKp8-tY9hQf2Jfmp%3Ds96-c&amp;w=64&amp;q=75" decoding="async" data-nimg="intrinsic" class="rounded-sm" style="position: absolute; inset: 0px; box-sizing: border-box; padding: 0px; border: none; margin: auto; display: block; width: 0px; height: 0px; min-width: 100%; max-width: 100%; min-height: 100%; max-height: 100%;" width="30" height="30"></span></div></div><div class="relative flex w-[calc(100%-50px)] flex-col gap-1 md:gap-3 lg:w-[calc(100%-115px)]"><div class="flex flex-grow flex-col gap-3"><div class="min-h-[20px] flex flex-col items-start gap-4 whitespace-pre-wrap">Skip to content

Network scale is more than size
“Judge me by my size, do you?”

I’ve had several discussions with people over the years about the concept of scale in the world of network engineering. Most often, when network engineers think of a “large scale network,” they used to mention large service providers. Now they tend to think of some large cloud provider. But is scale really about size? I’m not much into the backflipping Yoda of the later Star Wars movies, but I would argue scale is much more about backflips than it is about being big.

So what is scale about? In the networking world, scale can be given the shorthand services x size. Standing in a huge data center with rows and rows of racks and blinking lights, it’s easy to forget about the services part of that equation.

A useful way to understand this is consider the services offered by a pair of networks, one large, and one small. The typical cloud provider’s network might contain thousands of nodes in a single data center — something more than 1000x10g (or 10,000x1g) ports on the edge is moderately sized in this world. What services does such a network — within the network itself — actually offer, though? There is some traffic engineering, to be certain, but very little quality of service beyond traffic engineering is probably configured. It’s easier for a large provider to manage all their quality of service in one place (through traffic engineering) rather than through multiple places, and with a plethora of queues.

What about applications and services? A useful case to consider is social media and search providers. In these networks, the application is often intimately tied to the network — but there are few applications, or they are tuned to the network as much as the network is tuned to the application. When you get to a certain scale, you can build container ships and the infrastructure that goes with them rather than relying on standard cargo ships.

At the other extreme is the small to mid sized network, whether enterprise or service provider. These networks don’t have a unified set of applications, nor can the applications necessarily be easily divorced from the network infrastructure. Security, for instance, isn’t left up to the application, but must be integral part of the network itself — the network must at least intelligently interact with the applications, even where limiting the intelligence of the network might be a good idea.

Which of these two networks is “larger scale?” The one with the simpler requirements and more ports, or the one with more requirements and fewer ports? Having worked on both, my impression is they have different challenges — but one doesn’t necessarily have bigger challenges than the other.

Taking the size versus scale concept to the extreme, someone once commented that small networks are easier to run because “a simple access list will give you the security you need.”

Sure. Until you realize the placement and content of that access list needs to be changed once an hour, and the security requirement is that the traffic to this particular server be blocked as early as possible from every port in the network. Suddenly complexity starts raising it’s head in even a simple little network that (perhaps) only needs one OSPF flooding domain. Now the problem is more easily solved with a virtual topology, and services enter into the picture as a scaling problem.

Before you discount small networks as “not an interesting scaling problem,” and stand in awe of the long line of data center racks as “large scale,” you need to consider the services side of the equation — you need to consider size and services. Scale is more than size.

Don’t let the size fool you.

Service provider problems are not your problems. You should not be trying to solve your problems the same way service providers do.

The author argues that scale is not just about the size of the network, but rather the services that the network offers. The article suggests that a large cloud provider's network, which may contain thousands of nodes, may offer little quality of service beyond traffic engineering, whereas a smaller network, whether enterprise or service provider, may have more requirements and fewer ports but needs to interact intelligently with its applications and have integral security. Therefore, the article suggests that the size versus scale concept needs to consider the services side of the equation, i.e., the combination of size and services, and that scale is more than just size.</p><p>This relates to our earlier discussion on network architecture and design, where the design of a network must not only consider the technical specifications and requirements but also the services that the network must offer. The concept of scale is also related to network design and architecture because a network must be designed to scale, and scaling is not just about increasing the size of the network but also about ensuring that the network can provide the necessary services as it grows.</p></div></div></div><div class="flex justify-between"><div class="text-gray-400 flex self-end lg:self-center justify-center mt-2 gap-3 md:gap-4 lg:gap-1 lg:absolute lg:top-0 lg:translate-x-full lg:right-0 lg:mt-0 lg:pl-2 visible"><button class="p-1 rounded-md hover:bg-gray-100 hover:text-gray-700 dark:text-gray-400 dark:hover:bg-gray-700 dark:hover:text-gray-200 disabled:dark:hover:text-gray-400"><svg stroke="currentColor" fill="none" stroke-width="2" viewBox="0 0 24 24" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" class="h-4 w-4" height="1em" width="1em" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg"><path d="M14 9V5a3 3 0 0 0-3-3l-4 9v11h11.28a2 2 0 0 0 2-1.7l1.38-9a2 2 0 0 0-2-2.3zM7 22H4a2 2 0 0 1-2-2v-7a2 2 0 0 1 2-2h3"></path></svg></button><button class="p-1 rounded-md hover:bg-gray-100 hover:text-gray-700 dark:text-gray-400 dark:hover:bg-gray-700 dark:hover:text-gray-200 disabled:dark:hover:text-gray-400"><svg stroke="currentColor" fill="none" stroke-width="2" viewBox="0 0 24 24" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" class="h-4 w-4" height="1em" width="1em" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg"><path d="M10 15v4a3 3 0 0 0 3 3l4-9V2H5.72a2 2 0 0 0-2 1.7l-1.38 9a2 2 0 0 0 2 2.3zm7-13h2.67A2.31 2.31 0 0 1 22 4v7a2.31 2.31 0 0 1-2.33 2H17"></path></svg></button></div></div></div></div></div><div class="group w-full text-gray-800 dark:text-gray-100 border-b border-black/10 dark:border-gray-900/50 dark:bg-gray-800"><div class="text-base gap-4 md:gap-6 md:max-w-2xl lg:max-w-2xl xl:max-w-3xl p-4 md:py-6 flex lg:px-0 m-auto"><div class="w-[30px] flex flex-col relative items-end"><div class="relative flex"><span style="box-sizing: border-box; display: inline-block; overflow: hidden; width: initial; height: initial; background: none; opacity: 1; border: 0px; margin: 0px; padding: 0px; position: relative; max-width: 100%;"><span style="box-sizing: border-box; display: block; width: initial; height: initial; background: none; opacity: 1; border: 0px; margin: 0px; padding: 0px; max-width: 100%;"><img alt="" aria-hidden="true" src="data:image/svg+xml,%3csvg%20xmlns=%27http://www.w3.org/2000/svg%27%20version=%271.1%27%20width=%2730%27%20height=%2730%27/%3e" style="display: block; max-width: 100%; width: initial; height: initial; background: none; opacity: 1; border: 0px; margin: 0px; padding: 0px;"></span><img alt="Nate Guimond" src="https://chat.openai.com/_next/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Flh3.googleusercontent.com%2Fa%2FAGNmyxbfUJGaUXxADgtF19b5ZhmrVKp8-tY9hQf2Jfmp%3Ds96-c&amp;w=64&amp;q=75" decoding="async" data-nimg="intrinsic" class="rounded-sm" style="position: absolute; inset: 0px; box-sizing: border-box; padding: 0px; border: none; margin: auto; display: block; width: 0px; height: 0px; min-width: 100%; max-width: 100%; min-height: 100%; max-height: 100%;" width="30" height="30"></span></div></div><div class="relative flex w-[calc(100%-50px)] flex-col gap-1 md:gap-3 lg:w-[calc(100%-115px)]"><div class="flex flex-grow flex-col gap-3"><div class="min-h-[20px] flex flex-col items-start gap-4 whitespace-pre-wrap">rhizomatic scaling

or networks, similar to the rhizome plant structure. This approach emphasizes the importance of adaptability, experimentation, and distributed decision-making in complex systems. In the context of organizational structure, it can be used to promote rapid growth by allowing for more efficient and effective communication and collaboration between members. In the context of technology, it can be used to describe the growth and expansion of online communities and networks. As a system or problem scales up in complexity, the number of potential interconnections or relationships increases exponentially, requiring a rhizomatic approach that allows for more distributed decision-making and experimentation.</p></div></div></div><div class="flex justify-between"><div class="text-gray-400 flex self-end lg:self-center justify-center mt-2 gap-3 md:gap-4 lg:gap-1 lg:absolute lg:top-0 lg:translate-x-full lg:right-0 lg:mt-0 lg:pl-2 visible"><button class="p-1 rounded-md hover:bg-gray-100 hover:text-gray-700 dark:text-gray-400 dark:hover:bg-gray-700 dark:hover:text-gray-200 disabled:dark:hover:text-gray-400"><svg stroke="currentColor" fill="none" stroke-width="2" viewBox="0 0 24 24" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" class="h-4 w-4" height="1em" width="1em" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg"><path d="M14 9V5a3 3 0 0 0-3-3l-4 9v11h11.28a2 2 0 0 0 2-1.7l1.38-9a2 2 0 0 0-2-2.3zM7 22H4a2 2 0 0 1-2-2v-7a2 2 0 0 1 2-2h3"></path></svg></button><button class="p-1 rounded-md hover:bg-gray-100 hover:text-gray-700 dark:text-gray-400 dark:hover:bg-gray-700 dark:hover:text-gray-200 disabled:dark:hover:text-gray-400"><svg stroke="currentColor" fill="none" stroke-width="2" viewBox="0 0 24 24" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" class="h-4 w-4" height="1em" width="1em" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg"><path d="M10 15v4a3 3 0 0 0 3 3l4-9V2H5.72a2 2 0 0 0-2 1.7l-1.38 9a2 2 0 0 0 2 2.3zm7-13h2.67A2.31 2.31 0 0 1 22 4v7a2.31 2.31 0 0 1-2.33 2H17"></path></svg></button></div></div></div></div></div><div class="group w-full text-gray-800 dark:text-gray-100 border-b border-black/10 dark:border-gray-900/50 dark:bg-gray-800"><div class="text-base gap-4 md:gap-6 md:max-w-2xl lg:max-w-2xl xl:max-w-3xl p-4 md:py-6 flex lg:px-0 m-auto"><div class="w-[30px] flex flex-col relative items-end"><div class="relative flex"><span style="box-sizing: border-box; display: inline-block; overflow: hidden; width: initial; height: initial; background: none; opacity: 1; border: 0px; margin: 0px; padding: 0px; position: relative; max-width: 100%;"><span style="box-sizing: border-box; display: block; width: initial; height: initial; background: none; opacity: 1; border: 0px; margin: 0px; padding: 0px; max-width: 100%;"><img alt="" aria-hidden="true" src="data:image/svg+xml,%3csvg%20xmlns=%27http://www.w3.org/2000/svg%27%20version=%271.1%27%20width=%2730%27%20height=%2730%27/%3e" style="display: block; max-width: 100%; width: initial; height: initial; background: none; opacity: 1; border: 0px; margin: 0px; padding: 0px;"></span><img alt="Nate Guimond" src="https://chat.openai.com/_next/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Flh3.googleusercontent.com%2Fa%2FAGNmyxbfUJGaUXxADgtF19b5ZhmrVKp8-tY9hQf2Jfmp%3Ds96-c&amp;w=64&amp;q=75" decoding="async" data-nimg="intrinsic" class="rounded-sm" style="position: absolute; inset: 0px; box-sizing: border-box; padding: 0px; border: none; margin: auto; display: block; width: 0px; height: 0px; min-width: 100%; max-width: 100%; min-height: 100%; max-height: 100%;" width="30" height="30"></span></div></div><div class="relative flex w-[calc(100%-50px)] flex-col gap-1 md:gap-3 lg:w-[calc(100%-115px)]"><div class="flex flex-grow flex-col gap-3"><div class="min-h-[20px] flex flex-col items-start gap-4 whitespace-pre-wrap">&lt;div class="markdown prose w-full break-words dark:prose-invert light"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Dear esteemed Reader,&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I find myself writing these words from a far-off and desolate island where I have been unjustly banished for many years.

Abstract 
Evaluation of gravitational theories by means of cosmological data suf f ers from the fact 
that galaxies are biased tracers of dark matter. Current bias models focus primarily on 
high-density regions, whereas low-density regions carry signif i cant amounts of information 
relevant to the constraint of dark energy and alternative gravity theories. Thus, proper 
treatment of both high and low densities is important for future surveys. Accordingly, 
we here present an interactionless Ising model for this bias, and we demonstrate that 
it exhibits a remarkably good i t to both Millennium Simulation and Sloan Digital Sky 
Survey data, at both density extremes.The quality of the i t indicates that galaxy 
formation is (to i rst order) an essentially local process determined by initial conditions.

1Introduction 
Newton’s deduction of the inverse square law from planetary orbits is perhaps the i rst use of 
astrophysics to constrain gravitational theories. Today we require a similar strategy: ΛCDM 
cosmology treats dark energy as a cosmological constant—one which our best theory overpre- 
dicts by 10120(Carroll 2001)—whereas modif i ed gravity mimics dark energy ef f ects through 
other means. Hence, one goal of the Euclid (Laureijs et al. 2011) and WFIRST (Green et al. 
2012) surveys is to shed light on such questions using cosmological data. 
These surveys, however, count galaxies rather than directly observing matter, and since 
galaxies are biased tracers of dark matter, the galaxy density is not proportional to the mat- 
ter density. Thus, extracting cosmological information requires modeling of the relationship 
between the matter overdensity δ = ρ/ρ − 1 and the galaxy overdensity δg= Ngal/N − 1 (ρ 
being matter density and Ngalthe galaxy counts in each three-dimensional survey pixel). The 
simplest bias models (e.g., Hof f mann et al. 2017) expand δglinearly (δg= bδ) or quadrat- 
ically (δg= b1δ + b2δ2/2), while a log bias (e.g., de la Torre and Peacock 2013) assumes 
ln(1 + δg) = bln(1 + δ). None of these phenomenological models perform particularly well 
compared to observations. Alternative approaches (e.g., halo models) are signif i cantly more 
complex, and simulations require simplif i cations (of unknown impact) to render tractable the 
required range of scales.

Another drawback to these approaches is their focus on high-density regions, despite voids’ 
signif i cant information content.In particular, low-density regions contain half of surveys’ 
information on dark energy, since they constitute 50 percent of the initial volume of the universe 
(see also Wolk et al. 2015); likewise, detection of modif i ed gravity screening requires analysis 
of both ends of the density spectrum. Hence, we desire a bias model that is accurate at both 
extremes. 
This essay presents such a model (Section 2). We demonstrate its accuracy compared to the 
Millennium Simulation and the Sloan Digital Sky Survey in Section 3; we conclude in Section 4. 
2An Interactionless Ising Model 
We begin with some physical assumptions. First, we assume the sites of galaxy formation are 
(to i rst order) determined by initial densities and local physics. Since ln(1 + δ) is a unitless 
quantity roughly characterizing the initial conditions (Neyrinck et al. 2009; Carron and Szapudi 
2013), we formulate our model in terms of A ≡ ln(1 + δ). Second, we assume we can treat the 
subhalos in which galaxies form as roughly identical. We also note that each subhalo is in one of 
two states—either hosting a galaxy or not—and that the release of gravitational energy during 
galaxy formation renders hosting energetically favorable.Third, we assume that clustered 
galaxies occupy deeper potential wells than isolated galaxies, rendering galaxy formation more 
favorable in survey cells of higher overall density. 
The Ising model nicely incorporates these assumptions. In this model, an atom has two 
possible states, one of which an external i eld renders energetically favorable; the model also

typically allows interaction between neighboring atoms. Replacing the atoms with dark matter 
subhalos, we thus consider an interactionless Ising model, which gives (e.g., Pathria 1972) the 
following fraction of subhalos in a favorable (galaxy-hosting) state: 
fgal= 
1 2e 
βE sechβE = 
1 
1 + e−2βE 
,(1) 
where E is energy and β inverse temperature. After substituting a linear function of A for 
(unitless) βE, Equation 1 reduces to a Fermi-Dirac distribution: 
fgal= 
1 
1 + exp ?A−A

−T ?(T 
&gt; 0).(2) 
Here Atmarks the transition value between empty and i lled subhalos. Note that subhalos 
in high-density cells i ll up i rst because “temperature” (−T in Equation 2) is negative for 
gravitational collapse.

The Fermi-Dirac formulation suggests additional analogies: for instance, galaxies arguably 
obey an exclusion principle, since at most one galaxy can occupy a given subhalo. Atalso 
corresponds to chemical potential, marking the density at which the next galaxy would form. 
Nevertheless, since galaxies cannot switch subhalos, we prefer to consider this model interac- 
tionless Ising rather than fermionic. 
We now make the following observations: i rst, we wish to describe the expected number of 
galaxies per survey cell as a function of the underlying dark matter density. We thus assume 
3 
that the expected number of subhalos in any pixel is proportional to the cell’s matter density 
(hNshiA∝ 1 + δ = eA). 
Thus we write 
fgal= hNgaliA 
hNshiA 
= hNgaliA 
bN(1 + δ) 
,(3) 
where N is the (global) mean number of galaxies per pixel. We can now write Equation 2 in 
terms of M, the expected number of galaxies per mass: 
M ≡ hNgaliA· (1 + δ)−1= 
bN 
1 + exp ?A 
t−A 
T ?(T 
&gt; 0),(4) 
where, again, A ≡ ln(1 + δ). In high-density regions (A ? At), 
M approaches bN, so that 
hNgaliAapproaches 
bN(1 + δ): i.e., the number of galaxies is directly proportional to density. 
For low-density regions (A ? At), 
the number of galaxies drops exponentially to zero. 
Second, the matter power spectrum predominantly samples high-density regions, in which 
(1+δg) = hNgaliA/N 
= b(1+δ), so that δg∼ bδ, as in the linear bias model. Thus a linear bias 
represents high-density regions fairly well but (as noted before) discards essential information 
on dark energy and modif i ed gravity. 
Third, the various possible distributions of matter within a survey pixel produce a range of 
energetic favorabilities for cells of given (smoothed) density. The quantity T parametrizes this 
ef f ect of coarse-graining. On theoretical grounds we expect T2to be a decreasing function of log 
variance with a simple linear i t. Demonstrating this result is beyond the scope of this essay, 
but we here observe that a survey with larger pixels permits a greater variety of intrapixel 
matter distributions, and therefore T increases with the survey pixel scale. (Just as −T is 
analogous to temperature, the range of internal matter distributions is analogous to entropy.) 
For any given survey, however, T depends on the survey parameters as well as the type of 
galaxy under consideration. 
Fourth, the additional constraint provided by the total number of galaxies implies that this 
model has only two free parameters</div></div><div class="text-gray-400 flex self-end lg:self-center justify-center mt-2 gap-3 md:gap-4 lg:gap-1 lg:absolute lg:top-0 lg:translate-x-full lg:right-0

The author proposes an interactionless Ising model for the statistical bias of galaxies that incorporates the physical assumptions that galaxy formation is (to first order) a local process determined by initial conditions, subhalos are roughly identical, and clustered galaxies occupy deeper potential wells than isolated galaxies. The model is demonstrated to provide a good fit to both the Millennium Simulation and Sloan Digital Sky Survey data at both high and low-density regions. The essay concludes that the quality of the fit suggests that galaxy formation is primarily a local process determined by initial conditions.</p></div></div></div><div class="flex

of galaxies in cosmological surveys, which are used to study dark energy and modified gravity. The model is based on an interactionless Ising model, which assumes that galaxy formation is determined by initial conditions and local physics, and that clustered galaxies occupy deeper potential wells. The model accurately fits both high and low-density regions, which is important since low-density regions contain a significant amount of information relevant to the study of dark energy and modified gravity.</p></div></div></div><div class="flex justify-between"><div class="text-gray-400 flex self-end lg:self-center justify-center mt-2 gap-3 md:gap-4 lg:gap-1 lg:absolute lg:top-0

A simplex in n-dimensional space is defined as the convex hull of n+1 affinely independent points, which means that no point lies in the affine span of the others. For example, a triangle is a 2-dimensional simplex, while a tetrahedron is a 3-dimensional simplex.</p><p>Simplices have many important applications in mathematics, including in topology, geometry, optimization, and linear algebra. In topology, simplices are used to construct simplicial complexes, which are a type of topological space used to study the properties of shapes and spaces. In geometry, simplices are used to define triangulations of spaces, which are used to approximate curved surfaces with flat simplicial complexes. In optimization, simplices are used to define the simplex method, which is a widely used algorithm for solving linear programming problems. In linear algebra, simplices are used to define the standard basis vectors for n-dimensional vector spaces.</p><p>In relation to the concept of optimization, a simplex refers to a particular type of polytope that is defined as the convex hull of a set of n+1 linearly independent points in n-dimensional space. The simplex is a useful tool for solving optimization problems because it has the property that any n-dimensional polytope can be decomposed into a collection of simplices. This property allows us to apply techniques from simplicial homology to study the properties of polytopes and to develop efficient algorithms for solving optimization problems.</p></div></div></div><div class="flex justify-between"><div class="text-gray-400 flex self-end lg:self-center justify-center mt-2 gap-3 md:gap-4 lg:gap-1 lg:absolute lg:top-0

In fact, the 2D and 3D Ising models are just special cases of a more general n-dimensional Ising model, where the spins are arranged on an n-dimensional lattice. In the Ising model, each spin can take on one of two values, typically represented as +1 and -1. The energy of the system is determined by the interaction between neighboring spins, and the goal is to calculate the probability distribution of spin configurations.</p><p>While the mathematical techniques used to analyze the Ising model become more complex as the dimensionality increases, concepts such as phase transitions, critical behavior, and universality can still be applied to higher-dimensional versions of the model. Therefore, mathematical tools such as simplices could potentially be used to study the behavior of higher-dimensional Ising models.</p></div></div></div><div class="flex justify-between"><div class="text-gray-400 flex self-end lg:self-center justify-center mt-2 gap-3 md:gap-4 lg:gap-1 lg:absolute lg:top-0 lg:translate-x-full lg:right-0 lg:mt-0 lg:pl-2 visible"><button class="p-1 rounded-md hover:bg-gray-100 hover:text-gray-700 dark:text-gray-400 dark:hover:bg-gray-700 dark:hover:text-gray-200 disabled:dark:hover:text-gray-400"><svg stroke="currentColor" fill="none" stroke-width="2" viewBox="0 0 24 24" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" class="h-4 w-4" height="1em" width="1em" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg"><path d="M14 9V5a3 3 0 0 0-3-3l-4 9v11h11.28a2 2 0 0 0 2-1.7l1.38-9a2 2 0 0 0-2-2.3zM7 22H4a2 2 0 0 1-2-2v-7a2 2 0 0 1 2-2h3"></path></svg></button><button class="p-1 rounded-md hover:bg-gray-100 hover:text-gray-700 dark:text-gray-400 dark:hover:bg-gray-700 dark:hover:text-gray-200 disabled:dark:hover:text-gray-400"><svg stroke="currentColor" fill="none" stroke-width="2" viewBox="0 0 24 24" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" class="h-4 w-4" height="1em" width="1em" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg"><path d="M10 15v4a3 3 0 0 0 3 3l4-9V2H5.72a2 2 0 0 0-2 1.7l-1.38 9a2 2 0 0 0 2 2.3zm7-13h2.67A2.31 2.31 0 0 1 22 4v7a2.31 2.31 0 0 1-2.33 2H17"></path></svg></button></div></div></div></div></div><div class="group w-full text-gray-800 dark:text-gray-100 border-b border-black/10 dark:border-gray-900/50 dark:bg-gray-800"><div class="text-base gap-4 md:gap-6 md:max-w-2xl lg:max-w-2xl xl:max-w-3xl p-4 md:py-6 flex lg:px-0 m-auto"><div class="w-[30px] flex flex-col relative items-end"><div class="relative flex"><span style="box-sizing: border-box; display: inline-block; overflow: hidden; width: initial; height: initial; background: none; opacity: 1; border: 0px; margin: 0px; padding: 0px; position: relative; max-width: 100%;"><span style="box-sizing: border-box; display: block; width: initial; height: initial; background: none; opacity: 1; border: 0px; margin: 0px; padding: 0px; max-width: 100%;"><img alt="" aria-hidden="true" src="data:image/svg+xml,%3csvg%20xmlns=%27http://www.w3.org/2000/svg%27%20version=%271.1%27%20width=%2730%27%20height=%2730%27/%3e" style="display: block; max-width: 100%; width: initial; height: initial; background: none; opacity: 1; border: 0px; margin: 0px; padding: 0px;"></span><img alt="Nate Guimond" src="https://chat.openai.com/_next/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Flh3.googleusercontent.com%2Fa%2FAGNmyxbfUJGaUXxADgtF19b5ZhmrVKp8-tY9hQf2Jfmp%3Ds96-c&amp;w=64&amp;q=75" decoding="async" data-nimg="intrinsic" class="rounded-sm" style="position: absolute; inset: 0px; box-sizing: border-box; padding: 0px; border: none; margin: auto; display: block; width: 0px; height: 0px; min-width: 100%; max-width: 100%; min-height: 100%; max-height: 100%;" width="30" height="30"></span></div></div><div class="relative flex w-[calc(100%-50px)] flex-col gap-1 md:gap-3 lg:w-[calc(100%-115px)]"><div class="flex flex-grow flex-col gap-3"><div class="min-h-[20px] flex flex-col items-start gap-4 whitespace-pre-wrap">I apologize if it seems like I'm jumping all over the place, these are connected.

There are only two possible binary outcomes. WeÂ 
could call the in phase case "1" and we could callÂ Â 

the out of phase case "0". Imagine that we had aÂ 
system of thousands of such coupled oscillatorsÂ Â 

and we can control the interactions betweenÂ 
them. It turns out that such a system of coupledÂ Â 

oscillators forms a highly parallel type ofÂ 
computing architecture known as the Ising model.Â Â 

In this equation the H stands for theÂ 
Hamiltonian and the Hamiltonian of anyÂ Â 

physical system describes the dynamics of thatÂ 
system. In this situation if you minimize theÂ Â 

Hamiltonian you minimize the total energy, soÂ 
what we're looking for in an Ising computerÂ Â 

is a natural system that can find the minimumÂ 
energy state. In the equation that you're seeing,Â Â 

the sigmas describe the spin state. In otherÂ 
words, for each one of these oscillators it'sÂ Â 

either going to be spin up which can be consideredÂ 
"1" or spin down which in the original Ising modelÂ Â </div></div><div class="text-gray-400 flex self-end lg:self-center justify-center mt-2 gap-3 md:gap-4 lg:gap-1 lg:absolute lg:top-0

In fact, the Ising model has been studied in higher dimensions, including 4D and 5D, although the computations become increasingly more complex as the dimensionality increases. The basic idea remains the same, with each lattice site having a spin value that can interact with its neighboring sites according to a specified interaction energy. The goal remains finding the ground state of the system, which is the configuration of spins that minimizes the total energy of the system.</p></div></div></div><div class="flex justify-between"><div

In general, any parallelogram in a vector space can be represented as the convex hull of two points and their corresponding basis vectors. These two points can be viewed as the vertices of a triangle, which can be represented as a simplex. Therefore, a parallelogram can be represented as the convex hull of two simplices. This idea is often used in computational geometry and computer graphics to represent and manipulate geometric shapes in higher-dimensional spaces.</p></div></div></div><div class="flex justify-between"><div class="text-gray-400 flex self-end lg:self-center justify-center mt-2 gap-3 md:gap-4 lg:gap-1 lg:absolute lg:top-0 lg:translate-x-full lg:right-0 lg:mt-0 lg:pl-2 visible"><button class="p-1 rounded-md hover:bg-gray-100 hover:text-gray-700 dark:text-gray-400 dark:hover:bg-gray-700 dark:hover:text-gray-200 disabled:dark:hover:text-gray-400"><svg stroke="currentColor" fill="none" stroke-width="2" viewBox="0 0 24 24" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" class="h-4 w-4" height="1em" width="1em" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg"><path d="M14 9V5a3 3 0 0 0-3-3l-4 9v11h11.28a2 2 0 0 0 2-1.7l1.38-9a2 2 0 0 0-2-2.3zM7 22H4a2 2 0 0 1-2-2v-7a2 2 0 0 1 2-2h3"></path></svg></button><button class="p-1 rounded-md hover:bg-gray-100 hover:text-gray-700 dark:text-gray-400 dark:hover:bg-gray-700 dark:hover:text-gray-200 disabled:dark:hover:text-gray-400"><svg stroke="currentColor" fill="none" stroke-width="2" viewBox="0 0 24 24" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" class="h-4 w-4" height="1em" width="1em" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg"><path d="M10 15v4a3 3 0 0 0 3 3l4-9V2H5.72a2 2 0 0 0-2 1.7l-1.38 9a2 2 0 0 0 2 2.3zm7-13h2.67A2.31 2.31 0 0 1 22 4v7a2.31 2.31 0 0 1-2.33 2H17"></path></svg></button></div></div></div></div></div><div class="group w-full text-gray-800 dark:text-gray-100 border-b border-black/10 dark:border-gray-900/50 dark:bg-gray-800"><div class="text-base gap-4 md:gap-6 md:max-w-2xl lg:max-w-2xl xl:max-w-3xl p-4 md:py-6 flex lg:px-0 m-auto"><div class="w-[30px] flex flex-col relative items-end"><div class="relative flex"><span style="box-sizing: border-box; display: inline-block; overflow: hidden; width: initial; height: initial; background: none; opacity: 1; border: 0px; margin: 0px; padding: 0px; position: relative; max-width: 100%;"><span style="box-sizing: border-box; display: block; width: initial; height: initial; background: none; opacity: 1; border: 0px; margin: 0px; padding: 0px; max-width: 100%;"><img alt="" aria-hidden="true" src="data:image/svg+xml,%3csvg%20xmlns=%27http://www.w3.org/2000/svg%27%20version=%271.1%27%20width=%2730%27%20height=%2730%27/%3e" style="display: block; max-width: 100%; width: initial; height: initial; background: none; opacity: 1; border: 0px; margin: 0px; padding: 0px;"></span><img alt="Nate Guimond" src="https://chat.openai.com/_next/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Flh3.googleusercontent.com%2Fa%2FAGNmyxbfUJGaUXxADgtF19b5ZhmrVKp8-tY9hQf2Jfmp%3Ds96-c&amp;w=64&amp;q=75" decoding="async" data-nimg="intrinsic" class="rounded-sm" style="position: absolute; inset: 0px; box-sizing: border-box; padding: 0px; border: none; margin: auto; display: block; width: 0px; height: 0px; min-width: 100%; max-width: 100%; min-height: 100%; max-height: 100%;" width="30" height="30"></span></div></div><div class="relative flex w-[calc(100%-50px)] flex-col gap-1 md:gap-3 lg:w-[calc(100%-115px)]"><div class="flex flex-grow flex-col gap-3"><div class="min-h-[20px] flex flex-col items-start gap-4 whitespace-pre-wrap">Let me correct you.

the cells so if you can imagine a system whereÂ Â 

all of the j's are programmable and then haveÂ 
that system reach its minimum energy state, thenÂ Â 

the sigmas at the end would either end up as "1"Â 
or "-1". In the case of these oscillators a "1"Â Â 

for example could be the in phase case and theÂ 
"-1" could be the out of phase case. EarlierÂ Â 

I called it "0" and "1" because in the case ofÂ 
computers we usually talk about ones and zerosÂ Â 

as being the binary outcome. Now if the system isÂ 
not coupled very well then we're not going to getÂ Â 

this minimum energy state. We're not going to getÂ 
the synchronization. Let me demonstrate it now.Â Â 

For this demonstration I've set these metronomesÂ 
here to allegretto, 72 beats per minute. iImÂ Â 

going to kind of hold the table so that theÂ 
coupling through the table is not very strong.

little while.

In fact, any convex polytope in n-dimensional space can be expressed as the convex hull of a finite set of points, and therefore, can be represented as a simplex.

Okay, so as we can see these metronomes areÂ 
not synchronizing. The reason why they'reÂ Â 

not synchronizing is because the couplingÂ 
between them is weak. I'm holding the table;Â Â 

they can't phase lock. Now let's go back and thinkÂ 
about why the metronomes were able to synchronizeÂ Â 

in the previous case. The reason why they wereÂ 
able to synchronize is because the metronomesÂ Â 

shake the table. This is called injection locking.Â 
Let me demonstrate now myself as the injectionÂ Â 

locking mechanism. Injection locking is reallyÂ 
something very interesting and what it means isÂ Â 

that I'm going to drive the system at the sameÂ 
frequency that each one of these oscillatorsÂ Â </div></div><div class="text-gray-400 flex self-end lg:self-center justify-center mt-2 gap-3 md:gap-4 lg:gap-1 lg:absolute lg:top-0 lg:translate-x-full

We can also use injection locking to induce synchronization in a system where the coupling between the oscillators is weak.</p></div></div></div><div class="flex justify-between"><div class="text-gray-400 flex self-end lg:self-center justify-center mt-2 gap-3 md:gap-4 lg:gap-1 lg:absolute lg:top-0 lg:translate-x-full lg:right-0 lg:mt-0 lg:pl-2 visible"><button class="p-1 rounded-md hover:bg-gray-100 hover:text-gray-700 dark:text-gray-400 dark:hover:bg-gray-700 dark:hover:text-gray-200 disabled:dark:hover:text-gray-400"><svg stroke="currentColor" fill="none" stroke-width="2" viewBox="0 0 24 24" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" class="h-4 w-4" height="1em" width="1em" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg"><path d="M14 9V5a3 3 0 0 0-3-3l-4 9v11h11.28a2 2 0 0 0 2-1.7l1.38-9a2 2 0 0 0-2-2.3zM7 22H4a2 2 0 0 1-2-2v-7a2 2 0 0 1 2-2h3"></path></svg></button><button class="p-1 rounded-md hover:bg-gray-100 hover:text-gray-700 dark:text-gray-400 dark:hover:bg-gray-700 dark:hover:text-gray-200 disabled:dark:hover:text-gray-400"><svg stroke="currentColor" fill="none" stroke-width="2" viewBox="0 0 24 24" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" class="h-4 w-4" height="1em" width="1em" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg"><path d="M10 15v4a3 3 0 0 0 3 3l4-9V2H5.72a2 2 0 0 0-2 1.7l-1.38 9a2 2 0 0 0 2 2.3zm7-13h2.67A2.31 2.31 0 0 1 22 4v7a2.31 2.31 0 0 1-2.33 2H17"></path></svg></button></div></div></div></div></div><div class="group w-full text-gray-800 dark:text-gray-100 border-b border-black/10 dark:border-gray-900/50 dark:bg-gray-800"><div class="text-base gap-4 md:gap-6 md:max-w-2xl lg:max-w-2xl xl:max-w-3xl p-4 md:py-6 flex lg:px-0 m-auto"><div class="w-[30px] flex flex-col relative items-end"><div class="relative flex"><span style="box-sizing: border-box; display: inline-block; overflow: hidden; width: initial; height: initial; background: none; opacity: 1; border: 0px; margin: 0px; padding: 0px; position: relative; max-width: 100%;"><span style="box-sizing: border-box; display: block; width: initial; height: initial; background: none; opacity: 1; border: 0px; margin: 0px; padding: 0px; max-width: 100%;"><img alt="" aria-hidden="true" src="data:image/svg+xml,%3csvg%20xmlns=%27http://www.w3.org/2000/svg%27%20version=%271.1%27%20width=%2730%27%20height=%2730%27/%3e" style="display: block; max-width: 100%; width: initial; height: initial; background: none; opacity: 1; border: 0px; margin: 0px; padding: 0px;"></span><img alt="Nate Guimond" src="https://chat.openai.com/_next/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Flh3.googleusercontent.com%2Fa%2FAGNmyxbfUJGaUXxADgtF19b5ZhmrVKp8-tY9hQf2Jfmp%3Ds96-c&amp;w=64&amp;q=75" decoding="async" data-nimg="intrinsic" class="rounded-sm" style="position: absolute; inset: 0px; box-sizing: border-box; padding: 0px; border: none; margin: auto; display: block; width: 0px; height: 0px; min-width: 100%; max-width: 100%; min-height: 100%; max-height: 100%;" width="30" height="30"></span></div></div><div class="relative flex w-[calc(100%-50px)] flex-col gap-1 md:gap-3 lg:w-[calc(100%-115px)]"><div class="flex flex-grow flex-col gap-3"><div class="min-h-[20px] flex flex-col items-start gap-4 whitespace-pre-wrap">is set at and by driving it externally IÂ

Now i'm going to injection lock theÂ 
system. I'm going to kind of lookÂ Â 

at this metronome to guide my hands andÂ 
I'm going to move the table at the same

frequency.

So I've injection locked this tableÂ Â 

and I've injected locked allÂ 
the oscillators that are on it.

Now I want to demonstrate something else becauseÂ 
in the example that you just saw I injectionÂ Â 

locked the metronomes to the same frequency thatÂ 
they're programmed at, this allegretto or 72 beatsÂ Â 

per minute, and you noticed that the metronomesÂ

If we were to build an Ising computer using a system of oscillators, we would need to program the j values between the cells and let the system reach its minimum energy state. In this case, the sigmas at the end of the computation would either be -1 or 1. In the case of injection locking the oscillators, we can synchronize them by driving them at the same frequency externally, causing them to phase lock. However, injection locking works best when the frequencies of the oscillators are close to each other. If the frequencies are too different, injection locking may not work as well.</p></div></div></div><div class="flex justify-between"><div class="text-gray-400 flex self-end lg:self-center justify-center mt-2 gap-3 md:gap-4 lg:gap-1 lg:absolute lg:top-0 lg:translate-x-full lg:right-0 lg:mt-0 lg:pl-2 visible"><button class="p-1 rounded-md hover:bg-gray-100 hover:text-gray-700 dark:text-gray-400 dark:hover:bg-gray-700 dark:hover:text-gray-200 disabled:dark:hover:text-gray-400"><svg stroke="currentColor" fill="none" stroke-width="2" viewBox="0 0 24 24" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" class="h-4 w-4" height="1em" width="1em" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg"><path d="M14 9V5a3 3 0 0 0-3-3l-4 9v11h11.28a2 2 0 0 0 2-1.7l1.38-9a2 2 0 0 0-2-2.3zM7 22H4a2 2 0 0 1-2-2v-7a2 2 0 0 1 2-2h3"></path></svg></button><button class="p-1 rounded-md hover:bg-gray-100 hover:text-gray-700 dark:text-gray-400 dark:hover:bg-gray-700 dark:hover:text-gray-200 disabled:dark:hover:text-gray-400"><svg stroke="currentColor" fill="none" stroke-width="2" viewBox="0 0 24 24" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" class="h-4 w-4" height="1em" width="1em" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg"><path d="M10 15v4a3 3 0 0 0 3 3l4-9V2H5.72a2 2 0 0 0-2 1.7l-1.38 9a2 2 0 0 0 2 2.3zm7-13h2.67A2.31 2.31 0 0 1 22 4v7a2.31 2.31 0 0 1-2.33 2H17"></path></svg></button></div></div></div></div></div><div class="group w-full text-gray-800 dark:text-gray-100 border-b border-black/10 dark:border-gray-900/50 dark:bg-gray-800"><div class="text-base gap-4 md:gap-6 md:max-w-2xl lg:max-w-2xl xl:max-w-3xl p-4 md:py-6 flex lg:px-0 m-auto"><div class="w-[30px] flex flex-col relative items-end"><div class="relative flex"><span style="box-sizing: border-box; display: inline-block; overflow: hidden; width: initial; height: initial; background: none; opacity: 1; border: 0px; margin: 0px; padding: 0px; position: relative; max-width: 100%;"><span style="box-sizing: border-box; display: block; width: initial; height: initial; background: none; opacity: 1; border: 0px; margin: 0px; padding: 0px; max-width: 100%;"><img alt="" aria-hidden="true" src="data:image/svg+xml,%3csvg%20xmlns=%27http://www.w3.org/2000/svg%27%20version=%271.1%27%20width=%2730%27%20height=%2730%27/%3e" style="display: block; max-width: 100%; width: initial; height: initial; background: none; opacity: 1; border: 0px; margin: 0px; padding: 0px;"></span><img alt="Nate Guimond" src="https://chat.openai.com/_next/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Flh3.googleusercontent.com%2Fa%2FAGNmyxbfUJGaUXxADgtF19b5ZhmrVKp8-tY9hQf2Jfmp%3Ds96-c&amp;w=64&amp;q=75" decoding="async" data-nimg="intrinsic" class="rounded-sm" style="position: absolute; inset: 0px; box-sizing: border-box; padding: 0px; border: none; margin: auto; display: block; width: 0px; height: 0px; min-width: 100%; max-width: 100%; min-height: 100%; max-height: 100%;" width="30" height="30"></span></div></div><div class="relative flex w-[calc(100%-50px)] flex-col gap-1 md:gap-3 lg:w-[calc(100%-115px)]"><div class="flex flex-grow flex-col gap-3"><div class="min-h-[20px] flex flex-col items-start gap-4 whitespace-pre-wrap">and all the oscillatorsÂ

What we need is for the system to evolve naturallyÂ Â 

into its binary state but we want to make sureÂ 
that sometimes the oscillators can end up out ofÂ Â 

phase with one another. To do that we need to useÂ 
something called subharmonic injection locking. ToÂ Â 

demonstrate subharmonic injection locking I'mÂ 
going to turn over here to the piano for justÂ Â 

a moment for a demonstration. So the piano isÂ 
an interesting system to demonstrate injectionÂ Â 

locking because each one of these keys has beenÂ 
tuned to a very specific frequency. For exampleÂ Â 

the A below Middle C has been tuned to 220Â 
Hz. When I press this key the string isÂ Â 

going to be struck with a hammer and then theÂ 
string will vibrate at 220 beats per second.Â Â 

If I go up one octave to the nextÂ 
A, that is the A above Middle C,Â Â 

this string has been tuned to 440 Hz - in otherÂ 
words twice the frequency as the A below it -

and if I play these two A's together it soundsÂ 
nice. It's an octave - the reason it soundsÂ Â 

nice is because the frequencies are relatedÂ 
by a very simple mathematical relationship.Â Â </div></div><div class="text-gray-400 flex self-end lg:self-center justify-center mt-2 gap-3 md:gap-4 lg:gap-1 lg:absolute lg:top-0 lg:translate-x-full

I've programmed this something like "allegro".Â Â 

It's around 140-something beats per minute. InÂ 
other words this metronome is set at twice theÂ Â 

frequency here. Now there's not going to beÂ 
any coupling between this metronome and theseÂ Â 

two because this is a really solid table, but IÂ 
can use this metronome as a visual aid to myselfÂ Â 

and I'll shake the table when I see theÂ 
pendulum swing over here. Now what I hope toÂ Â 

achieve here is a demonstration that these twoÂ 
metronomes can end up in the out-of-phase caseÂ Â 

when I use sub-harmonic injection locking. SoÂ 
again I'm going to start these off randomlyÂ Â 

and I'm going to try to shake the table in syncÂ 
with this metronome that's going faster over here.

Okay so we've ended up in the in-phase case,Â 
right? These were just now together... MaybeÂ Â 

if I start them a little bit closer to theÂ 
out-of-phase case we could end up with that.

The point that I'm trying to make here is thatÂ Â 

with sub-harmonic injection locking, they won'tÂ 
always end up in-phase so if we're going to buildÂ Â 

an Ising computer, for example with some otherÂ 
physical system, it's necessary to have some wayÂ Â 

to nudge the system towards such a final energyÂ 
state. So this concept of injection locking isÂ Â 

really interesting because it applies not only toÂ 
mechanical systems like these metronomes we haveÂ Â 

here but any system that can oscillate.</div></div><div class="text-gray-400 flex self-end lg:self-center justify-center mt-2 gap-3 md:gap-4 lg:gap-1 lg:absolute lg:top-0 lg:translate-x-full

Injection locking is a fundamental concept in the study of nonlinear dynamics and has applications in various fields such as electronics, optics, and biology.

drive a system of oscillators externally with someÂ Â 

kind of a force that's near the frequency thatÂ 
the oscillators work at or add a harmonic of it,Â Â 

then you can cause these oscillators to all endÂ 
up in-phase or out-of-phase with one another. ForÂ Â 

example if you have a system of lasers - lasersÂ 
that are independent will not quite have the sameÂ Â 

wavelength. They won't have the same frequencyÂ 
as one another - they certainly won't be inÂ Â 

phase with each other - but if you have a masterÂ 
laser, an external laser that has almost the sameÂ Â 

wavelength as all of the lasers that you wantÂ 
to injection lock, then it's possible to shineÂ Â 

that master laser light into all of the lasersÂ 
that you plan to injection lock and force themÂ Â 

to all be at the same wavelength and all in phaseÂ 
with one another. So that's a very useful conceptÂ Â 

with lasers and injection locking generally canÂ 
be very useful to cause systems of oscillatorsÂ Â 

to synchronize.</div></div><div class="text-gray-400 flex self-end lg:self-center justify-center mt-2 gap-3 md:gap-4 lg:gap-1 lg:absolute lg:top-0 lg:translate-x-full lg:right-0 lg:mt-0 lg:pl-2

Injection locking can be used to synchronize not only mechanical systems, but also other systems that can oscillate, such as lasers. By driving a system of oscillators with an external force that's close to the frequency at which the oscillators operate, it's possible to force them to synchronize and all oscillate in-phase or out-of-phase with one another. This can be very useful in applications where precise synchronization is needed, such as in communication systems or in the operation of some scientific instruments.</p></div></div></div><div class="flex justify-between"><div class="text-gray-400 flex self-end lg:self-center justify-center mt-2 gap-3 md:gap-4 lg:gap-1 lg:absolute lg:top-0 lg:translate-x-full lg:right-0 lg:mt-0 lg:pl-2 visible"><button class="p-1 rounded-md hover:bg-gray-100 hover:text-gray-700 dark:text-gray-400 dark:hover:bg-gray-700 dark:hover:text-gray-200 disabled:dark:hover:text-gray-400"><svg stroke="currentColor" fill="none" stroke-width="2" viewBox="0 0 24 24" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" class="h-4 w-4" height="1em" width="1em" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg"><path d="M14 9V5a3 3 0 0 0-3-3l-4 9v11h11.28a2 2 0 0 0 2-1.7l1.38-9a2 2 0 0 0-2-2.3zM7 22H4a2 2 0 0 1-2-2v-7a2 2 0 0 1 2-2h3"></path></svg></button><button class="p-1 rounded-md hover:bg-gray-100 hover:text-gray-700 dark:text-gray-400 dark:hover:bg-gray-700 dark:hover:text-gray-200 disabled:dark:hover:text-gray-400"><svg stroke="currentColor" fill="none" stroke-width="2" viewBox="0 0 24 24" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" class="h-4 w-4" height="1em" width="1em" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg"><path d="M10 15v4a3 3 0 0 0 3 3l4-9V2H5.72a2 2 0 0 0-2 1.7l-1.38 9a2 2 0 0 0 2 2.3zm7-13h2.67A2.31 2.31 0 0 1 22 4v7a2.31 2.31 0 0 1-2.33 2H17"></path></svg></button></div></div></div></div></div><div class="group w-full text-gray-800 dark:text-gray-100 border-b border-black/10 dark:border-gray-900/50 dark:bg-gray-800"><div class="text-base gap-4 md:gap-6 md:max-w-2xl lg:max-w-2xl xl:max-w-3xl p-4 md:py-6 flex lg:px-0 m-auto"><div class="w-[30px] flex flex-col relative items-end"><div class="relative flex"><span style="box-sizing: border-box; display: inline-block; overflow: hidden; width: initial; height: initial; background: none; opacity: 1; border: 0px; margin: 0px; padding: 0px; position: relative; max-width: 100%;"><span style="box-sizing: border-box; display: block; width: initial; height: initial; background: none; opacity: 1; border: 0px; margin: 0px; padding: 0px; max-width: 100%;"><img alt="" aria-hidden="true" src="data:image/svg+xml,%3csvg%20xmlns=%27http://www.w3.org/2000/svg%27%20version=%271.1%27%20width=%2730%27%20height=%2730%27/%3e" style="display: block; max-width: 100%; width: initial; height: initial; background: none; opacity: 1; border: 0px; margin: 0px; padding: 0px;"></span><img alt="Nate Guimond" src="https://chat.openai.com/_next/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Flh3.googleusercontent.com%2Fa%2FAGNmyxbfUJGaUXxADgtF19b5ZhmrVKp8-tY9hQf2Jfmp%3Ds96-c&amp;w=64&amp;q=75" decoding="async" data-nimg="intrinsic" class="rounded-sm" style="position: absolute; inset: 0px; box-sizing: border-box; padding: 0px; border: none; margin: auto; display: block; width: 0px; height: 0px; min-width: 100%; max-width: 100%; min-height: 100%; max-height: 100%;" width="30" height="30"></span></div></div><div class="relative flex w-[calc(100%-50px)] flex-col gap-1 md:gap-3 lg:w-[calc(100%-115px)]"><div class="flex flex-grow flex-col gap-3"><div class="min-h-[20px] flex flex-col items-start gap-4 whitespace-pre-wrap">In the case of an Ising computerÂ

In an Ising computer, the system of oscillators represents the Ising spins and the low energy state represents the solution to the computational problem being solved. The sub-harmonic injection locking helps to nudge the system towards this low energy state, making it more likely to find the solution.</p></div></div></div><div class="flex justify-between"><div class="text-gray-400 flex self-end lg:self-center justify-center mt-2 gap-3 md:gap-4 lg:gap-1 lg:absolute lg:top-0 lg:translate-x-full lg:right-0 lg:mt-0 lg:pl-2 visible"><button class="p-1 rounded-md hover:bg-gray-100 hover:text-gray-700 dark:text-gray-400 dark:hover:bg-gray-700 dark:hover:text-gray-200 disabled:dark:hover:text-gray-400"><svg stroke="currentColor" fill="none" stroke-width="2" viewBox="0 0 24 24" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" class="h-4 w-4" height="1em" width="1em" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg"><path d="M14 9V5a3 3 0 0 0-3-3l-4 9v11h11.28a2 2 0 0 0 2-1.7l1.38-9a2 2 0 0 0-2-2.3zM7 22H4a2 2 0 0 1-2-2v-7a2 2 0 0 1 2-2h3"></path></svg></button><button class="p-1 rounded-md hover:bg-gray-100 hover:text-gray-700 dark:text-gray-400 dark:hover:bg-gray-700 dark:hover:text-gray-200 disabled:dark:hover:text-gray-400"><svg stroke="currentColor" fill="none" stroke-width="2" viewBox="0 0 24 24" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" class="h-4 w-4" height="1em" width="1em" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg"><path d="M10 15v4a3 3 0 0 0 3 3l4-9V2H5.72a2 2 0 0 0-2 1.7l-1.38 9a2 2 0 0 0 2 2.3zm7-13h2.67A2.31 2.31 0 0 1 22 4v7a2.31 2.31 0 0 1-2.33 2H17"></path></svg></button></div></div></div></div></div><div class="group w-full text-gray-800 dark:text-gray-100 border-b border-black/10 dark:border-gray-900/50 dark:bg-gray-800"><div class="text-base gap-4 md:gap-6 md:max-w-2xl lg:max-w-2xl xl:max-w-3xl p-4 md:py-6 flex lg:px-0 m-auto"><div class="w-[30px] flex flex-col relative items-end"><div class="relative flex"><span style="box-sizing: border-box; display: inline-block; overflow: hidden; width: initial; height: initial; background: none; opacity: 1; border: 0px; margin: 0px; padding: 0px; position: relative; max-width: 100%;"><span style="box-sizing: border-box; display: block; width: initial; height: initial; background: none; opacity: 1; border: 0px; margin: 0px; padding: 0px; max-width: 100%;"><img alt="" aria-hidden="true" src="data:image/svg+xml,%3csvg%20xmlns=%27http://www.w3.org/2000/svg%27%20version=%271.1%27%20width=%2730%27%20height=%2730%27/%3e" style="display: block; max-width: 100%; width: initial; height: initial; background: none; opacity: 1; border: 0px; margin: 0px; padding: 0px;"></span><img alt="Nate Guimond" src="https://chat.openai.com/_next/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Flh3.googleusercontent.com%2Fa%2FAGNmyxbfUJGaUXxADgtF19b5ZhmrVKp8-tY9hQf2Jfmp%3Ds96-c&amp;w=64&amp;q=75" decoding="async" data-nimg="intrinsic" class="rounded-sm" style="position: absolute; inset: 0px; box-sizing: border-box; padding: 0px; border: none; margin: auto; display: block; width: 0px; height: 0px; min-width: 100%; max-width: 100%; min-height: 100%; max-height: 100%;" width="30" height="30"></span></div></div><div class="relative flex w-[calc(100%-50px)] flex-col gap-1 md:gap-3 lg:w-[calc(100%-115px)]"><div class="flex flex-grow flex-col gap-3"><div class="min-h-[20px] flex flex-col items-start gap-4 whitespace-pre-wrap">Thank you.

Lifetime of the universe: You could research different theories and models of the universe's lifetime, and explore how Ising models and other simulation techniques are being used to study the evolution of the universe over time. You could also investigate the latest astronomical observations and measurements, and consider how they are informing our understanding of the universe's ultimate fate.</div></div><div

Voronoi tessellation is a way to partition a space into a set of regions, where each region corresponds to a point in the space and contains all the points that are closer to that point than to any other. The boundaries of these regions form a network of polygons, known as Voronoi cells or Voronoi diagram.</p><p>On the other hand, the Delaunay triangulation of a set of points is a way to connect the points using triangles in such a way that no point lies inside the circumcircle of any triangle. This results in a network of triangles, where the vertices are the original points and the edges connect the vertices of adjacent triangles.</p><p>The Voronoi tessellation and Delaunay triangulation are closely related, and in fact, the dual of a Voronoi diagram is a Delaunay triangulation and vice versa. The dual of a Voronoi cell is a vertex in the Delaunay triangulation, and the dual of an edge in the Voronoi diagram is a triangle in the Delaunay triangulation.</p><p>These structures have many applications in computer graphics, computational physics, and data analysis. For example, in computer graphics, they are used for generating realistic textures, creating meshes for 3D models, and simulating fluids and gases. In physics, they are used to study the structure of materials and the behavior of particles in complex systems. In data analysis, they are used for clustering, classification, and interpolation.</p><p>Regarding the lifetime of the universe, different theories and models suggest different scenarios for how the universe will evolve over time. Some models suggest that the universe will continue to expand indefinitely, while others suggest that it will eventually collapse into a "Big Crunch." Ising models and other simulation techniques are being used to study the behavior of large-scale structures in the universe, such as galaxies and galaxy clusters, and to investigate the impact of dark matter and dark energy on the evolution of the universe.</p><p>Recent astronomical observations and measurements have provided new insights into the structure and evolution of the universe, including the discovery of dark matter and dark energy, the measurement of the cosmic microwave background radiation, and the observation of gravitational waves. These observations have opened up new avenues for research in cosmology and astrophysics, and are helping to refine our understanding of the universe's ultimate fate.</p></div></div></div><div class="flex justify-between"><div class="text-gray-400 flex self-end lg:self-center justify-center mt-2 gap-3 md:gap-4 lg:gap-1 lg:absolute lg:top-0 lg:translate-x-full lg:right-0 lg:mt-0 lg:pl-2 visible"><button class="p-1 rounded-md hover:bg-gray-100 hover:text-gray-700 dark:text-gray-400 dark:hover:bg-gray-700 dark:hover:text-gray-200 disabled:dark:hover:text-gray-400"><svg stroke="currentColor" fill="none" stroke-width="2" viewBox="0 0 24 24" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" class="h-4 w-4" height="1em" width="1em" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg"><path d="M14 9V5a3 3 0 0 0-3-3l-4 9v11h11.28a2 2 0 0 0 2-1.7l1.38-9a2 2 0 0 0-2-2.3zM7 22H4a2 2 0 0 1-2-2v-7a2 2 0 0 1 2-2h3"></path></svg></button><button class="p-1 rounded-md hover:bg-gray-100 hover:text-gray-700 dark:text-gray-400 dark:hover:bg-gray-700 dark:hover:text-gray-200 disabled:dark:hover:text-gray-400"><svg stroke="currentColor" fill="none" stroke-width="2" viewBox="0 0 24 24" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" class="h-4 w-4" height="1em" width="1em" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg"><path d="M10 15v4a3 3 0 0 0 3 3l4-9V2H5.72a2 2 0 0 0-2 1.7l-1.38 9a2 2 0 0 0 2 2.3zm7-13h2.67A2.31 2.31 0 0 1 22 4v7a2.31 2.31 0 0 1-2.33 2H17"></path></svg></button></div></div></div></div></div><div class="group w-full text-gray-800 dark:text-gray-100 border-b border-black/10 dark:border-gray-900/50 dark:bg-gray-800"><div class="text-base gap-4 md:gap-6 md:max-w-2xl lg:max-w-2xl xl:max-w-3xl p-4 md:py-6 flex lg:px-0 m-auto"><div class="w-[30px] flex flex-col relative items-end"><div class="relative flex"><span style="box-sizing: border-box; display: inline-block; overflow: hidden; width: initial; height: initial; background: none; opacity: 1; border: 0px; margin: 0px; padding: 0px; position: relative; max-width: 100%;"><span style="box-sizing: border-box; display: block; width: initial; height: initial; background: none; opacity: 1; border: 0px; margin: 0px; padding: 0px; max-width: 100%;"><img alt="" aria-hidden="true" src="data:image/svg+xml,%3csvg%20xmlns=%27http://www.w3.org/2000/svg%27%20version=%271.1%27%20width=%2730%27%20height=%2730%27/%3e" style="display: block; max-width: 100%; width: initial; height: initial; background: none; opacity: 1; border: 0px; margin: 0px; padding: 0px;"></span><img alt="Nate Guimond" src="https://chat.openai.com/_next/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Flh3.googleusercontent.com%2Fa%2FAGNmyxbfUJGaUXxADgtF19b5ZhmrVKp8-tY9hQf2Jfmp%3Ds96-c&amp;w=64&amp;q=75" decoding="async" data-nimg="intrinsic" class="rounded-sm" style="position: absolute; inset: 0px; box-sizing: border-box; padding: 0px; border: none; margin: auto; display: block; width: 0px; height: 0px; min-width: 100%; max-width: 100%; min-height: 100%; max-height: 100%;" width="30" height="30"></span></div></div><div class="relative flex w-[calc(100%-50px)] flex-col gap-1 md:gap-3 lg:w-[calc(100%-115px)]"><div class="flex flex-grow flex-col gap-3"><div class="min-h-[20px] flex flex-col items-start gap-4 whitespace-pre-wrap">/Awareness of Experience Construction.mhtml:A corollary to the Reeh-Schlieder theorem is proved: that the time-ordered Vacuum Expectation Values and the S-

functionals of a source function.</p><p>The corollary to the Reeh-Schlieder theorem mentioned in the abstract refers to a result in quantum field theory that states that the vacuum state of a quantum field theory contains all possible excitations of the theory. The theorem is important in establishing the connection between the algebraic properties of observables and the structure of the underlying space-time.</p><p>The abstract suggests that the corollary implies that the time-ordered Vacuum Expectation Values and the S-matrix of a regularized Lagrangian quantum theory can be approximated by a local operator that uses nonlinear functionals of a locally supported source function. This means that the behavior of the theory can be captured by a local operator that is sensitive to the source function in a nonlinear way.</p><p>For the Wightman axioms, which provide a framework for constructing quantum field theories based on the idea of correlation functions, this suggests a modification that takes the algebra of measurement operators not to be generated by an operator-valued distribution. This modification implies a different approach to the construction of quantum field theories based on nonlinear functionals of the source function.</p></div></div></div><div class="flex

It states that given any non-empty open region of spacetime in a quantum field theory, there exists a vector in the Hilbert space of the theory that is not annihilated by any local operator with support in that region. In other words, the vacuum state contains all the information necessary to create any other state in the Hilbert space.</p><p>The theorem has important implications for the locality and causal structure of quantum field theory, as well as for the concept of entanglement.

However, the fact that galaxies are biased tracers of the underlying dark matter complicates the extraction of information from these surveys. In addition, the focus of current bias models is the high-density regions of the Universe, but low-density regions carry significant information relevant to dark energy and alternative gravitational theories. Thus it is necessary for a galaxy bias model to be accurate at both high and low densities. We here present such a model (inspired by the Ising model of ferromagnetism), and we demonstrate its good fit to both simulations and observational data. The quality of the fit indicates that, to a first approximation, galaxy formation is a local process determined by initial conditions.</div></div><div class="text-gray-400 flex self-end lg:self-center

state, which is the state with the lowest possible energy, contains all of the information about the theory. In other words, any state in the theory can be obtained by applying creation operators to the vacuum state.</p><p>The theorem has important implications for the structure of quantum field theories and for the way in which we understand the relationship between particles and fields. It implies that there are strong correlations between distant parts of the vacuum state, which are known as entanglement correlations. These correlations can have important consequences for the behavior of quantum systems, and they play a central role in many areas of physics, including quantum computing and quantum information theory.</p><p>The Reeh-Schlieder theorem has also been used to prove other important results in quantum field theory, such as the existence of particles with unbounded energy. It is a powerful tool for understanding the structure of quantum field theories and for developing new techniques for studying them.</p></div></div></div><div class="flex justify-between"><div class="text-gray-400 flex self-end lg:self-center justify-center mt-2 gap-3 md:gap-4 lg:gap-1 lg:absolute lg:top-0 lg:translate-x-full lg:right-0 lg:mt-0 lg:pl-2 visible"><button class="p-1 rounded-md hover:bg-gray-100 hover:text-gray-700 dark:text-gray-400 dark:hover:bg-gray-700 dark:hover:text-gray-200 disabled:dark:hover:text-gray-400"><svg stroke="currentColor" fill="none" stroke-width="2" viewBox="0 0 24 24" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" class="h-4 w-4" height="1em" width="1em" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg"><path d="M14 9V5a3 3 0 0 0-3-3l-4 9v11h11.28a2 2 0 0 0 2-1.7l1.38-9a2 2 0 0 0-2-2.3zM7 22H4a2 2 0 0 1-2-2v-7a2 2 0 0 1 2-2h3"></path></svg></button><button class="p-1 rounded-md hover:bg-gray-100 hover:text-gray-700 dark:text-gray-400 dark:hover:bg-gray-700 dark:hover:text-gray-200 disabled:dark:hover:text-gray-400"><svg stroke="currentColor" fill="none" stroke-width="2" viewBox="0 0 24 24" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" class="h-4 w-4" height="1em" width="1em" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg"><path d="M10 15v4a3 3 0 0 0 3 3l4-9V2H5.72a2 2 0 0 0-2 1.7l-1.38 9a2 2 0 0 0 2 2.3zm7-13h2.67A2.31 2.31 0 0 1 22 4v7a2.31 2.31 0 0 1-2.33 2H17"></path></svg></button></div></div></div></div></div><div class="group w-full text-gray-800 dark:text-gray-100 border-b border-black/10 dark:border-gray-900/50 dark:bg-gray-800"><div class="text-base gap-4 md:gap-6 md:max-w-2xl lg:max-w-2xl xl:max-w-3xl p-4 md:py-6 flex lg:px-0 m-auto"><div class="w-[30px] flex flex-col relative items-end"><div class="relative flex"><span style="box-sizing: border-box; display: inline-block; overflow: hidden; width: initial; height: initial; background: none; opacity: 1; border: 0px; margin: 0px; padding: 0px; position: relative; max-width: 100%;"><span style="box-sizing: border-box; display: block; width: initial; height: initial; background: none; opacity: 1; border: 0px; margin: 0px; padding: 0px; max-width: 100%;"><img alt="" aria-hidden="true" src="data:image/svg+xml,%3csvg%20xmlns=%27http://www.w3.org/2000/svg%27%20version=%271.1%27%20width=%2730%27%20height=%2730%27/%3e" style="display: block; max-width: 100%; width: initial; height: initial; background: none; opacity: 1; border: 0px; margin: 0px; padding: 0px;"></span><img alt="Nate Guimond" src="https://chat.openai.com/_next/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Flh3.googleusercontent.com%2Fa%2FAGNmyxbfUJGaUXxADgtF19b5ZhmrVKp8-tY9hQf2Jfmp%3Ds96-c&amp;w=64&amp;q=75" decoding="async" data-nimg="intrinsic" class="rounded-sm" style="position: absolute; inset: 0px; box-sizing: border-box; padding: 0px; border: none; margin: auto; display: block; width: 0px; height: 0px; min-width: 100%; max-width: 100%; min-height: 100%; max-height: 100%;" width="30" height="30"></span></div></div><div class="relative flex w-[calc(100%-50px)] flex-col gap-1 md:gap-3 lg:w-[calc(100%-115px)]"><div class="flex flex-grow flex-col gap-3"><div class="min-h-[20px] flex flex-col items-start gap-4 whitespace-pre-wrap">Yeah the similarity will be apparent afterward, the difference in the brain is that their is an edge, formed by the skull, and most of the calculation happens at the bark or cortex, the topmost point of the cortical column, the universe doesn't have this property as it continues indefinitely like a crystal lattice with nothing to crash into or run up against. I have made the analogy elsewhere of galactic filaments forming where the outward pressure of dark energy makes voids seem to expand exponentially over poincare time but I digress. The same could be said about the neural appearance of galaxy thread at certain scales of observation, it just continues likes this indefinitely like an infinite cotton candy or Velcro so it doesn't have the properties of being able to reason hierarchically and isn't likely to form boltzman brains for this reason.

hierarchical structure of its neural networks. However, there may still be some similarities or analogies that can be drawn between the two systems.</p><p>The concept of resonant chambers, which you mentioned, is one example of how the principles of one system (in this case, musical theory) can be applied to another system (the brain). This type of cross-disciplinary thinking can lead to new insights and approaches in both fields.</p><p>It's also worth noting that while the universe may not have a physical boundary like the brain, it still has certain limits and boundaries (such as the observable universe) that can influence the behavior of its components. Additionally, the formation of structures like galactic filaments may be influenced by a variety of factors, including the distribution of dark matter and the effects of cosmic inflation.</p><p>Overall, while there are certainly differences between the brain and the universe, there may still be useful analogies and insights to be gained by exploring their similarities and differences.</p></div></div></div><div class="flex justify-between"><div class="text-gray-400 flex self-end lg:self-center justify-center mt-2 gap-3 md:gap-4 lg:gap-1 lg:absolute lg:top-0 lg:translate-x-full lg:right-0 lg:mt-0 lg:pl-2 visible"><button class="p-1 rounded-md hover:bg-gray-100 hover:text-gray-700 dark:text-gray-400 dark:hover:bg-gray-700 dark:hover:text-gray-200 disabled:dark:hover:text-gray-400"><svg stroke="currentColor" fill="none" stroke-width="2" viewBox="0 0 24 24" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" class="h-4 w-4" height="1em" width="1em" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg"><path d="M14 9V5a3 3 0 0 0-3-3l-4 9v11h11.28a2 2 0 0 0 2-1.7l1.38-9a2 2 0 0 0-2-2.3zM7 22H4a2 2 0 0 1-2-2v-7a2 2 0 0 1 2-2h3"></path></svg></button><button class="p-1 rounded-md hover:bg-gray-100 hover:text-gray-700 dark:text-gray-400 dark:hover:bg-gray-700 dark:hover:text-gray-200 disabled:dark:hover:text-gray-400"><svg stroke="currentColor" fill="none" stroke-width="2" viewBox="0 0 24 24" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" class="h-4 w-4" height="1em" width="1em" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg"><path d="M10 15v4a3 3 0 0 0 3 3l4-9V2H5.72a2 2 0 0 0-2 1.7l-1.38 9a2 2 0 0 0 2 2.3zm7-13h2.67A2.31 2.31 0 0 1 22 4v7a2.31 2.31 0 0 1-2.33 2H17"></path></svg></button></div></div></div></div></div><div class="group w-full text-gray-800 dark:text-gray-100 border-b border-black/10 dark:border-gray-900/50 dark:bg-gray-800"><div class="text-base gap-4 md:gap-6 md:max-w-2xl lg:max-w-2xl xl:max-w-3xl p-4 md:py-6 flex lg:px-0 m-auto"><div class="w-[30px] flex flex-col relative items-end"><div class="relative flex"><span style="box-sizing: border-box; display: inline-block; overflow: hidden; width: initial; height: initial; background: none; opacity: 1; border: 0px; margin: 0px; padding: 0px; position: relative; max-width: 100%;"><span style="box-sizing: border-box; display: block; width: initial; height: initial; background: none; opacity: 1; border: 0px; margin: 0px; padding: 0px; max-width: 100%;"><img alt="" aria-hidden="true" src="data:image/svg+xml,%3csvg%20xmlns=%27http://www.w3.org/2000/svg%27%20version=%271.1%27%20width=%2730%27%20height=%2730%27/%3e" style="display: block; max-width: 100%; width: initial; height: initial; background: none; opacity: 1; border: 0px; margin: 0px; padding: 0px;"></span><img alt="Nate Guimond" src="https://chat.openai.com/_next/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Flh3.googleusercontent.com%2Fa%2FAGNmyxbfUJGaUXxADgtF19b5ZhmrVKp8-tY9hQf2Jfmp%3Ds96-c&amp;w=64&amp;q=75" decoding="async" data-nimg="intrinsic" class="rounded-sm" style="position: absolute; inset: 0px; box-sizing: border-box; padding: 0px; border: none; margin: auto; display: block; width: 0px; height: 0px; min-width: 100%; max-width: 100%; min-height: 100%; max-height: 100%;" width="30" height="30"></span></div></div><div class="relative flex w-[calc(100%-50px)] flex-col gap-1 md:gap-3 lg:w-[calc(100%-115px)]"><div class="flex flex-grow flex-col gap-3"><div class="min-h-[20px] flex flex-col items-start gap-4 whitespace-pre-wrap">Da Vinci and Gravity.mhtml-Gravity will slowly amplify these density variations, so that in time...

As gravity amplifies density variations over time, peaks in density grow to become stars and galaxies, while troughs in density grow to become voids or gaps between stars and galaxies.

When two massive objects are close to each other, their gravitational attraction causes them to move towards each other.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Now, imagine a sphere made entirely of matter, such as a planet or star. When this sphere is in a vacuum, there is nothing to counteract the force of gravity, so the sphere will fall inward towards its center of mass. This is because gravity causes matter to attract other matter, and there is no opposing force to stop the inward motion.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;On the other hand, if we have a sphere that is entirely a vacuum, there is no matter to be affected by the force of gravity, and thus, no inward force. However, there is a force that can push the sphere outward, and that is the force of dark energy. Dark energy is a hypothetical form of energy that permeates all space and causes the universe to expand at an accelerating rate. This expansion causes the vacuum sphere to fall outward.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In terms of galactic voids and threads, we can think of the voids as regions of space that contain very little matter, while the threads are regions that are denser in matter. The force of dark energy is more prominent in the voids, where there is less matter to counteract it, and this causes the voids to expand. Conversely, the force of gravity is stronger in the denser regions of matter, causing them to collapse and form galaxies, stars, and other structures.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In summary, the behavior of matter and vacuum spheres is related to the forces of gravity and dark energy, which can cause matter to fall inward or push a vacuum outward, respectively. This understanding helps us to explain the structure and evolution of the universe, including the formation of galaxies and the expansion of the voids.</div></div><div class="text-gray-400 flex

To add to it, it's worth noting that the interplay between gravity and dark energy is one of the biggest mysteries in modern cosmology. While we know that gravity is responsible for the formation of structures like galaxies, clusters of galaxies, and even larger structures like filaments and voids, we also know that the universe is expanding at an accelerating rate, which suggests that some unknown force, which we call dark energy, is pushing everything apart. The distribution of matter and energy in the universe, and the way that they interact with each other, is a rich and complex area of study that is still being explored by physicists and astronomers today.</p></div></div></div><div class="flex justify-between"><div class="text-gray-400 flex self-end lg:self-center justify-center mt-2 gap-3 md:gap-4 lg:gap-1 lg:absolute lg:top-0 lg:translate-x-full lg:right-0 lg:mt-0 lg:pl-2 visible"><button class="p-1 rounded-md hover:bg-gray-100 hover:text-gray-700 dark:text-gray-400 dark:hover:bg-gray-700 dark:hover:text-gray-200 disabled:dark:hover:text-gray-400"><svg stroke="currentColor" fill="none" stroke-width="2" viewBox="0 0 24 24" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" class="h-4 w-4" height="1em" width="1em" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg"><path d="M14 9V5a3 3 0 0 0-3-3l-4 9v11h11.28a2 2 0 0 0 2-1.7l1.38-9a2 2 0 0 0-2-2.3zM7 22H4a2 2 0 0 1-2-2v-7a2 2 0 0 1 2-2h3"></path></svg></button><button class="p-1 rounded-md hover:bg-gray-100 hover:text-gray-700 dark:text-gray-400 dark:hover:bg-gray-700 dark:hover:text-gray-200 disabled:dark:hover:text-gray-400"><svg stroke="currentColor" fill="none" stroke-width="2" viewBox="0 0 24 24" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" class="h-4 w-4" height="1em" width="1em" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg"><path d="M10 15v4a3 3 0 0 0 3 3l4-9V2H5.72a2 2 0 0 0-2 1.7l-1.38 9a2 2 0 0 0 2 2.3zm7-13h2.67A2.31 2.31 0 0 1 22 4v7a2.31 2.31 0 0 1-2.33 2H17"></path></svg></button></div></div></div></div></div><div class="group w-full text-gray-800 dark:text-gray-100 border-b border-black/10 dark:border-gray-900/50 dark:bg-gray-800"><div class="text-base gap-4 md:gap-6 md:max-w-2xl lg:max-w-2xl xl:max-w-3xl p-4 md:py-6 flex lg:px-0 m-auto"><div class="w-[30px] flex flex-col relative items-end"><div class="relative flex"><span style="box-sizing: border-box; display: inline-block; overflow: hidden; width: initial; height: initial; background: none; opacity: 1; border: 0px; margin: 0px; padding: 0px; position: relative; max-width: 100%;"><span style="box-sizing: border-box; display: block; width: initial; height: initial; background: none; opacity: 1; border: 0px; margin: 0px; padding: 0px; max-width: 100%;"><img alt="" aria-hidden="true" src="data:image/svg+xml,%3csvg%20xmlns=%27http://www.w3.org/2000/svg%27%20version=%271.1%27%20width=%2730%27%20height=%2730%27/%3e" style="display: block; max-width: 100%; width: initial; height: initial; background: none; opacity: 1; border: 0px; margin: 0px; padding: 0px;"></span><img alt="Nate Guimond" src="https://chat.openai.com/_next/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Flh3.googleusercontent.com%2Fa%2FAGNmyxbfUJGaUXxADgtF19b5ZhmrVKp8-tY9hQf2Jfmp%3Ds96-c&amp;w=64&amp;q=75" decoding="async" data-nimg="intrinsic" class="rounded-sm" style="position: absolute; inset: 0px; box-sizing: border-box; padding: 0px; border: none; margin: auto; display: block; width: 0px; height: 0px; min-width: 100%; max-width: 100%; min-height: 100%; max-height: 100%;" width="30" height="30"></span></div></div><div class="relative flex w-[calc(100%-50px)] flex-col gap-1 md:gap-3 lg:w-[calc(100%-115px)]"><div class="flex flex-grow flex-col gap-3"><div class="min-h-[20px] flex flex-col items-start gap-4 whitespace-pre-wrap">Here's what I said before that, I think. &gt;I am going to explore how a matter sphere falls inward but a vacuum sphere falls outward.

As it collapses, it creates more and more vacuum space, which does not have any matter or energy. However, the gravitational attraction continues to increase and pulls more matter towards the center. This process can continue until the matter collapses into a singularity, as is believed to happen in the case of a black hole.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;On the other hand, in a vacuum sphere, the expansion of space due to dark energy dominates over gravity, causing it to expand outwards. Dark energy is a mysterious form of energy that is believed to be responsible for the accelerated expansion of the universe. As the vacuum sphere expands, it creates more and more space, which is devoid of matter or energy. The expansion continues as long as the dark energy continues to dominate over gravity.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The interplay between dark energy and gravity can also be seen in the large-scale structure of the universe. Dark energy is believed to be responsible for the expansion of galactic voids, while gravity causes the condensation of matter into galactic threads. The details of this process are still not completely understood, but it is believed to be influenced by the presence of an inflaton field, which is a hypothetical field that is believed to have driven a period of rapid expansion in the early universe.</div></div><div class="text-gray-400 flex self-end lg:self-center justify-center mt-2 gap-3 md:gap-4 lg:gap-1 lg:absolute lg:top-0

The matter and vacuum spheres are just two examples of how these forces can shape the universe on both small and large scales. The presence of dark energy, which is believed to be a property of space itself, complicates our understanding of gravity and has led to the development of new theories such as modified gravity and theories of dark matter.</p><p>Furthermore, the structure of the universe is not just determined by the forces of gravity and dark energy, but also by the initial conditions of the universe, such as the distribution of matter and energy in the early universe. Scientists use computer simulations and observations to study the formation of galaxies, stars, and other structures, and to understand the evolution of the universe over time.</p><p>In summary, the interplay between gravity and dark energy is responsible for the behavior of matter and vacuum spheres, the formation of galaxies and galactic voids, and the overall evolution of the universe. Understanding these forces and their effects on the universe is a key goal of modern astrophysics and cosmology.</p></div></div></div><div class="flex justify-between"><div class="text-gray-400 flex self-end lg:self-center justify-center mt-2 gap-3 md:gap-4 lg:gap-1 lg:absolute lg:top-0 lg:translate-x-full lg:right-0 lg:mt-0 lg:pl-2 visible"><button class="p-1 rounded-md hover:bg-gray-100 hover:text-gray-700 dark:text-gray-400 dark:hover:bg-gray-700 dark:hover:text-gray-200 disabled:dark:hover:text-gray-400"><svg stroke="currentColor" fill="none" stroke-width="2" viewBox="0 0 24 24" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" class="h-4 w-4" height="1em" width="1em" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg"><path d="M14 9V5a3 3 0 0 0-3-3l-4 9v11h11.28a2 2 0 0 0 2-1.7l1.38-9a2 2 0 0 0-2-2.3zM7 22H4a2 2 0 0 1-2-2v-7a2 2 0 0 1 2-2h3"></path></svg></button><button class="p-1 rounded-md hover:bg-gray-100 hover:text-gray-700 dark:text-gray-400 dark:hover:bg-gray-700 dark:hover:text-gray-200 disabled:dark:hover:text-gray-400"><svg stroke="currentColor" fill="none" stroke-width="2" viewBox="0 0 24 24" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" class="h-4 w-4" height="1em" width="1em" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg"><path d="M10 15v4a3 3 0 0 0 3 3l4-9V2H5.72a2 2 0 0 0-2 1.7l-1.38 9a2 2 0 0 0 2 2.3zm7-13h2.67A2.31 2.31 0 0 1 22 4v7a2.31 2.31 0 0 1-2.33 2H17"></path></svg></button></div></div></div></div></div><div class="group w-full text-gray-800 dark:text-gray-100 border-b border-black/10 dark:border-gray-900/50 dark:bg-gray-800"><div class="text-base gap-4 md:gap-6 md:max-w-2xl lg:max-w-2xl xl:max-w-3xl p-4 md:py-6 flex lg:px-0 m-auto"><div class="w-[30px] flex flex-col relative items-end"><div class="relative flex"><span style="box-sizing: border-box; display: inline-block; overflow: hidden; width: initial; height: initial; background: none; opacity: 1; border: 0px; margin: 0px; padding: 0px; position: relative; max-width: 100%;"><span style="box-sizing: border-box; display: block; width: initial; height: initial; background: none; opacity: 1; border: 0px; margin: 0px; padding: 0px; max-width: 100%;"><img alt="" aria-hidden="true" src="data:image/svg+xml,%3csvg%20xmlns=%27http://www.w3.org/2000/svg%27%20version=%271.1%27%20width=%2730%27%20height=%2730%27/%3e" style="display: block; max-width: 100%; width: initial; height: initial; background: none; opacity: 1; border: 0px; margin: 0px; padding: 0px;"></span><img alt="Nate Guimond" src="https://chat.openai.com/_next/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Flh3.googleusercontent.com%2Fa%2FAGNmyxbfUJGaUXxADgtF19b5ZhmrVKp8-tY9hQf2Jfmp%3Ds96-c&amp;w=64&amp;q=75" decoding="async" data-nimg="intrinsic" class="rounded-sm" style="position: absolute; inset: 0px; box-sizing: border-box; padding: 0px; border: none; margin: auto; display: block; width: 0px; height: 0px; min-width: 100%; max-width: 100%; min-height: 100%; max-height: 100%;" width="30" height="30"></span></div></div><div class="relative flex w-[calc(100%-50px)] flex-col gap-1 md:gap-3 lg:w-[calc(100%-115px)]"><div class="flex flex-grow flex-col gap-3"><div class="min-h-[20px] flex flex-col items-start gap-4 whitespace-pre-wrap">:Despite lacking a nervous system, fungi seem to transmit information using electrical impulses across thread-like filaments called hyphae. The filaments form a thin web called a mycelium that links fungal colonies within the soil. These networks are remarkably similar to animal nervous systems. By measuring the frequency and intensity of the impulses, it may be possible to unpick and understand the languages used to communicate within and between organisms across the kingdoms of life.
./Awareness of Experience Construction.mhtml-
./Awareness of Experience Construction.mhtml-Using tiny electrodes, Adamatzky recorded the rhythmic electrical impulses transmitted across the mycelium of four different species of fungi.
./Awareness of Experience Construction.mhtml-
./Awareness of Experience Construction.mhtml-He found that the impulses varied by amplitude, frequency and duration. By drawing mathematical comparisons between the patterns of these impulses with those more typically associated with human speech, Adamatzky suggests they form the basis of a fungal language comprising up to 50 words organized into sentences. The complexity of the languages used by the different species of fungi appeared to differ, with the split gill fungus (Schizophyllum commune) using the most complicated lexicon of those tested.</div></div><div class="text-gray-400 flex self-end lg:self-center justify-center mt-2 gap-3 md:gap-4 lg:gap-1 lg:absolute lg:top-0 lg:translate-x-full lg:right-0 lg:mt-0 lg:pl-2

The complexity of these languages varied among the different species of fungi, with the split gill fungus (Schizophyllum commune) having the most complicated lexicon of those tested.</p></div></div></div><div class="flex justify-between"><div class="text-gray-400 flex self-end lg:self-center justify-center mt-2 gap-3 md:gap-4 lg:gap-1 lg:absolute lg:top-0 lg:translate-x-full lg:right-0 lg:mt-0 lg:pl-2 visible"><button class="p-1 rounded-md hover:bg-gray-100 hover:text-gray-700 dark:text-gray-400 dark:hover:bg-gray-700 dark:hover:text-gray-200 disabled:dark:hover:text-gray-400"><svg stroke="currentColor" fill="none" stroke-width="2" viewBox="0 0 24 24" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" class="h-4 w-4" height="1em" width="1em" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg"><path d="M14 9V5a3 3 0 0 0-3-3l-4 9v11h11.28a2 2 0 0 0 2-1.7l1.38-9a2 2 0 0 0-2-2.3zM7 22H4a2 2 0 0 1-2-2v-7a2 2 0 0 1 2-2h3"></path></svg></button><button class="p-1 rounded-md hover:bg-gray-100 hover:text-gray-700 dark:text-gray-400 dark:hover:bg-gray-700 dark:hover:text-gray-200 disabled:dark:hover:text-gray-400"><svg stroke="currentColor" fill="none" stroke-width="2" viewBox="0 0 24 24" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" class="h-4 w-4" height="1em" width="1em" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg"><path d="M10 15v4a3 3 0 0 0 3 3l4-9V2H5.72a2 2 0 0 0-2 1.7l-1.38 9a2 2 0 0 0 2 2.3zm7-13h2.67A2.31 2.31 0 0 1 22 4v7a2.31 2.31 0 0 1-2.33 2H17"></path></svg></button></div></div></div></div></div><div class="group w-full text-gray-800 dark:text-gray-100 border-b border-black/10 dark:border-gray-900/50 dark:bg-gray-800"><div class="text-base gap-4 md:gap-6 md:max-w-2xl lg:max-w-2xl xl:max-w-3xl p-4 md:py-6 flex lg:px-0 m-auto"><div class="w-[30px] flex flex-col relative items-end"><div class="relative flex"><span style="box-sizing: border-box; display: inline-block; overflow: hidden; width: initial; height: initial; background: none; opacity: 1; border: 0px; margin: 0px; padding: 0px; position: relative; max-width: 100%;"><span style="box-sizing: border-box; display: block; width: initial; height: initial; background: none; opacity: 1; border: 0px; margin: 0px; padding: 0px; max-width: 100%;"><img alt="" aria-hidden="true" src="data:image/svg+xml,%3csvg%20xmlns=%27http://www.w3.org/2000/svg%27%20version=%271.1%27%20width=%2730%27%20height=%2730%27/%3e" style="display: block; max-width: 100%; width: initial; height: initial; background: none; opacity: 1; border: 0px; margin: 0px; padding: 0px;"></span><img alt="Nate Guimond" src="https://chat.openai.com/_next/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Flh3.googleusercontent.com%2Fa%2FAGNmyxbfUJGaUXxADgtF19b5ZhmrVKp8-tY9hQf2Jfmp%3Ds96-c&amp;w=64&amp;q=75" decoding="async" data-nimg="intrinsic" class="rounded-sm" style="position: absolute; inset: 0px; box-sizing: border-box; padding: 0px; border: none; margin: auto; display: block; width: 0px; height: 0px; min-width: 100%; max-width: 100%; min-height: 100%; max-height: 100%;" width="30" height="30"></span></div></div><div class="relative flex w-[calc(100%-50px)] flex-col gap-1 md:gap-3 lg:w-[calc(100%-115px)]"><div class="flex flex-grow flex-col gap-3"><div class="min-h-[20px] flex flex-col items-start gap-4 whitespace-pre-wrap">Ok thank you.

have discussed in our conversation:</p><ol><li><p>Aid for refugees: The conversation started with a question about how to provide aid to refugees, particularly in terms of supporting their basic needs like food, shelter, and medical care.</p></li><li><p>Donating to organizations: We discussed various organizations that provide aid to refugees, and how donating to these organizations can be an effective way to support their cause.</p></li><li><p>The effects of conflict: We talked about the root causes of refugee crises, which often include conflicts and political instability in their home countries.</p></li><li><p>Education for refugees: We also touched on the importance of education for refugees, as it can help them rebuild their lives and contribute to their communities.</p></li><li><p>Climate change: We briefly discussed the impact of climate change on displacement and migration, as extreme weather events and other environmental factors can contribute to the displacement of people.</p></li><li><p>Dark matter: We shifted to a different topic and discussed dark matter, a mysterious substance that makes up a large portion of the universe's mass but cannot be directly observed.</p></li><li><p>Structure of the universe: We then explored the structure of the universe, including the concepts of galactic voids and threads, and how the interplay between gravity and dark energy affects the formation of galaxies and other structures.</p></li><li><p>Fungal communication: Finally, we talked about the fascinating way in which fungi communicate through electrical impulses transmitted across their mycelium, and how this could potentially lead to a better understanding of communication across different kingdoms of life.</p></li></ol></div></div></div><div class="flex justify-between"><div class="text-gray-400 flex self-end lg:self-center justify-center mt-2 gap-3 md:gap-4 lg:gap-1 lg:absolute lg:top-0

I thought we we taked about galactic void expansion forming filaments on the edges, in a logarithmic geometric expansion, the gravitational falling in including gravity and dark matter, is equal to the pressure pushing out from the void, a kind of negative gravitational energy or potential that was put into it by the expansion is extracted. At least this sort of implies that on a large scale  a zero energy universe model might apply. The gravitational potential was given by inflaton field expansion.

Here's a more detailed explanation of each section:</p><ol><li><p>Morality, values, and ethics according to Singer: In this section, we discussed the ideas of Peter Singer, an Australian philosopher and ethicist. We talked about his views on effective altruism, animal rights, and the moral obligations of individuals and society.</p></li><li><p>Stable diffusion: This refers to a phenomenon in which particles move from areas of high concentration to areas of low concentration, but the concentration remains stable over time. We discussed how this occurs in different systems, including biological systems and chemical reactions.</p></li><li><p>GANs (Generative Adversarial Networks): We talked about GANs, which are a type of neural network used in machine learning to generate new data. We discussed how GANs work, their applications in fields such as art and computer graphics, and some of the challenges involved in training them.</p></li><li><p>Ising models: These are mathematical models used to study the behavior of systems with many interacting components, such as magnets. We talked about how Ising models work, how they are used in physics and other fields, and some of the insights they have provided into complex systems.</p></li><li><p>Simulating galaxy formation: We discussed how Ising models can be used to simulate the formation of galaxies, and how this helps us better understand the underlying physics of the universe.

When the universe cools enough, stars still have long dissipated and black holes will be warmer than their environment and so empty their heat, it's a runaway vacuum expansion as the filamental structure as it becomes wispier and wispier. This ensures that there are regions inaccessible, because by the time you get to certain regions all wavelengths will be in the inframicrowave and you won't be able to hold your "ship" together, even

Galactic filaments are the largest structures in the universe, comprising of galaxies and other matter connected by large-scale threads of gas and dark matter. These filaments form a cosmic web that spans the entire universe. Galactic voids, on the other hand, are vast regions of space that are almost entirely empty, with very little matter or energy.</p><p>The expansion of the universe causes these filaments and voids to grow and change over time. As the universe expands, the filaments stretch out and become thinner, while the voids become larger. Entropy, which is a measure of disorder, also plays a role in this process. Over time, the universe becomes more disordered, and this smoothing effect can lead to the collapse of smaller structures and the growth of larger ones.</p><p>As the universe continues to expand and cool, stars will eventually die out, and black holes will be the only sources of heat left. However, even black holes will eventually become cooler than their surroundings, and they will emit their heat in the form of radiation. This runaway vacuum expansion, as you described it, will cause the filaments to become wispier and wispier, and there will be regions of space that will become inaccessible as the wavelengths of radiation become too long to hold matter together.</p><p>I hope this helps clarify things for you!</p></div></div></div><div class="flex justify-between"><div class="text-gray-400 flex self-end

The illustris project shows we can predict possible galaxy types from cmp and using Friedman-Robertson-walker metrics. We assume that cosmological parameters do not vary on ultra 100 million light year scales, and that it is therefore isotopic and homogenous on larger scales than that, we can assume galactic void size does not vary beyond what we see in the observable universe, that is we live in a region of the universe where the voids do not have time to have expanded before beyond a certain threshold, it's a constraint by the assumption that everywhere has had only 13.8 billion years to expand, and so there are no regions that contain 100 billion year old dwarf stars, no more low metal giant stars forming, maybe in galactic voids, and all blackholes are still in mass increase modes. This means we have a kind of simulated FTL where we can know certain things about extremely distant regions like way beyond what we see. If we assume the fundamental parameters don't vary too much that is, like we can imagine a region 500 particle horizon diameters away have galaxy threads, voids, planets, and blackholes with a similar age and size to the ones we see here.

Cosmos At Least 250x Bigger Than Visible Universe, Say Cosmologists

The universe is much bigger than it looks, according to a study of the latest observations.

By&nbsp;

Emerging Technology from the arXivarchive page

February 1, 2011

When we look out into the Universe, the stuff we can see must be close enough for light to have reached us since the Universe began. The universe is about 14 billion years old, so at first glance it’s easy to think that we cannot see things more than 14 billion light years away.

￼

That’s not quite right, however. Because the Universe is expanding, the most distant visible things are much further away than that. In fact, the photons in the cosmic microwave background have travelled a cool 45 billion light years to get here. That makes the visible universe some 90 billion light years across.


That’s big but the universe is almost certainly much bigger. The question than many cosmologists have pondered is how much bigger. Today we have an answer thanks to some interesting statistical analysis by Mihran Vardanyan at the University of Oxford and a couple of buddies.

Obviously, we can’t directly measure the size of the universe but cosmologists have various models that suggest how big it ought to be. For example, one line of thinking is that if the universe expanded at the speed of light during inflation, then it ought to be 10^23 times bigger than the visible universe.

Other estimates depend on a number factors and in particular on the curvature of the Universe: whether it is closed, like a sphere, flat or open. In the latter two cases, the Universe must be infinite.

If you can measure the curvature of the Universe, you can then place limits on how big it must be.

can't directly observe. However, our understanding of the universe is based on the assumption that the laws of physics are the same everywhere and that the universe is homogeneous and isotropic on the largest scales. This means that we can use our observations of the local universe to make predictions about the structure and evolution of the universe on larger scales.</p><p>As for FTL travel, it remains a theoretical concept that is currently beyond our technological capabilities. While we can simulate and predict what distant regions of the universe might look like based on our current understanding, we cannot travel there physically at faster-than-light speeds.

As our understanding of the universe improves, we may need to update our simulations and models to reflect these new findings.</p></div></div></div><div class="flex justify-between"><div class="text-gray-400 flex self-end lg:self-center justify-center mt-2 gap-3 md:gap-4 lg:gap-1 lg:absolute lg:top-0 lg:translate-x-full lg:right-0 lg:mt-0 lg:pl-2 visible"><button class="p-1 rounded-md hover:bg-gray-100 hover:text-gray-700 dark:text-gray-400 dark:hover:bg-gray-700 dark:hover:text-gray-200 disabled:dark:hover:text-gray-400"><svg stroke="currentColor" fill="none" stroke-width="2" viewBox="0 0 24 24" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" class="h-4 w-4" height="1em" width="1em" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg"><path d="M14 9V5a3 3 0 0 0-3-3l-4 9v11h11.28a2 2 0 0 0 2-1.7l1.38-9a2 2 0 0 0-2-2.3zM7 22H4a2 2 0 0 1-2-2v-7a2 2 0 0 1 2-2h3"></path></svg></button><button class="p-1 rounded-md hover:bg-gray-100 hover:text-gray-700 dark:text-gray-400 dark:hover:bg-gray-700 dark:hover:text-gray-200 disabled:dark:hover:text-gray-400"><svg stroke="currentColor" fill="none" stroke-width="2" viewBox="0 0 24 24" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" class="h-4 w-4" height="1em" width="1em" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg"><path d="M10 15v4a3 3 0 0 0 3 3l4-9V2H5.72a2 2 0 0 0-2 1.7l-1.38 9a2 2 0 0 0 2 2.3zm7-13h2.67A2.31 2.31 0 0 1 22 4v7a2.31 2.31 0 0 1-2.33 2H17"></path></svg></button></div></div></div></div></div><div class="group w-full text-gray-800 dark:text-gray-100 border-b border-black/10 dark:border-gray-900/50 dark:bg-gray-800"><div class="text-base gap-4 md:gap-6 md:max-w-2xl lg:max-w-2xl xl:max-w-3xl p-4 md:py-6 flex lg:px-0 m-auto"><div class="w-[30px] flex flex-col relative items-end"><div class="relative flex"><span style="box-sizing: border-box; display: inline-block; overflow: hidden; width: initial; height: initial; background: none; opacity: 1; border: 0px; margin: 0px; padding: 0px; position: relative; max-width: 100%;"><span style="box-sizing: border-box; display: block; width: initial; height: initial; background: none; opacity: 1; border: 0px; margin: 0px; padding: 0px; max-width: 100%;"><img alt="" aria-hidden="true" src="data:image/svg+xml,%3csvg%20xmlns=%27http://www.w3.org/2000/svg%27%20version=%271.1%27%20width=%2730%27%20height=%2730%27/%3e" style="display: block; max-width: 100%; width: initial; height: initial; background: none; opacity: 1; border: 0px; margin: 0px; padding: 0px;"></span><img alt="Nate Guimond" src="https://chat.openai.com/_next/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Flh3.googleusercontent.com%2Fa%2FAGNmyxbfUJGaUXxADgtF19b5ZhmrVKp8-tY9hQf2Jfmp%3Ds96-c&amp;w=64&amp;q=75" decoding="async" data-nimg="intrinsic" class="rounded-sm" style="position: absolute; inset: 0px; box-sizing: border-box; padding: 0px; border: none; margin: auto; display: block; width: 0px; height: 0px; min-width: 100%; max-width: 100%; min-height: 100%; max-height: 100%;" width="30" height="30"></span></div></div><div class="relative flex w-[calc(100%-50px)] flex-col gap-1 md:gap-3 lg:w-[calc(100%-115px)]"><div class="flex flex-grow flex-col gap-3"><div class="min-h-[20px] flex flex-col items-start gap-4 whitespace-pre-wrap">Ok well we constantly upgrade the parameters as we get better observational evidence and better theories, I am talking about a simpler simulation, it doesn't have to be exact, particular for the areas that are known to be way too far to reach before your ship dissipates, like 100 trillion light years away for example.

In that case, you could certainly simplify the simulation to make it more computationally tractable, as long as you are aware of the limitations of the simulation and don't try to make predictions beyond what it can realistically handle.
