This book provides a new model to explore discoverability and enhance the meaning of information. The authors have coined the term epidata, which includes items and circumstances that impact the expression of the data in a document, but are not part of the ordinary process of retrieval systems.  Epidata affords pathways and points to details that cast light on proximities that might otherwise go unknown.  In addition, epidata are clues to mis-and dis-information discernment.  There are many ways to find needed information; however, finding the most useable information is not an easy task.  The book explores the uses of proximity and the concept of epidata that increases the probability of  finding functional information.  The authors sketch a constellation of proximities, present examples of attempts to accomplish proximity, and provoke a discussion of the role of proximity in the field. In addition, the authors suggest that proximity is a thread between retrieval constructs based on known topics, predictable relations, and types of information seeking that lie outside constructs such as browsing, stumbling, encountering, detective work, art making, and translation

"Proximity and Epidata: Attributes and Meaning Modification" is a book by Laurie J. Bonnici and Brian C. O'Connor that introduces a novel model for improving the discoverability and meaning of information through the concept of "epidata". These are elements and situations that influence the representation of data in a document, yet are often overlooked by conventional retrieval systems. The authors assert that epidata can reveal unseen connections and aid in discerning inaccurate or misleading information. The book discusses the role of proximity and epidata in enhancing the chances of locating useful information, promoting a deeper understanding of their implications in information seeking. The authors posit that proximity is a link between known topics, predictable relationships, and unique modes of information seeking, such as browsing, encountering, and detective work.

1.1 Introduction
Our interest in proximity began two decades ago when a mutual friend introduced us because of our common passion for kayaking. As we chatted about types of kayaks and paddles, our conversation drifted to our work. We each began to think about some of the other���s comments: ���I���ve heard this before.��� The simple question ���Who was your major professor?��� yielded our first discussion of proximity. Brian had studied under Patrick Wilson, Laurie had studied under Elfreda Chatman, who had studied under Wilson at the same time Brian had���we had a close intellectual relationship, a proximity that had been unknown until that moment.

Over the years, physical proximity has been irregular and less than frequent, yet we have engaged in various projects and critiqued each other���s work based on our conceptual proximity, aided by the tele-proximity of email, telephone, Skype, and Zoom. Recently, we had the opportunity to spend some time together to work out a presentation for the Document Academy (DOCAM) on professors as dynamic documents. Our close but differing ties to Wilson surfaced in our discussions, largely in terms of the continuity of that dynamic quality through students and students of students���the roles of memory and critical consideration through generations. Kayaks also came into play. Kayaks have little or nothing to do with Patrick Wilson, but our passion for kayaking was the thread that brought us together. Would we have met and had a conversation that brought up the same point? It is possible, but not necessarily the likely case. This led to our thinking about the role of unexpected, unknown, unpredicted threads of proximity���the kayaks might be seen as simple catalysts in retrospect, yet they were a strong incentive to have the first meeting and provided an affordance for both conversations and metaphors for our thinking and doing. Such unexpected connections are worth examining as components of information seeking and retrospective analysis.

We set out to sketch a constellation of proximities, present examples of attempts to accomplish proximity, and provoke a discussion of the role of proximity in our field. We suggest that proximity is a thread between retrieval constructs based on known topics and predictable relations and the sorts of information seeking that lie outside those constructs���browsing, stumbling, encountering, detective work, art making, translation, understanding documents in hand.

We see our work here more as a set of provocations than as a single, complete model���a meandering which ���[may seem] to be a slower process than the straight line of progress, [but is only so] for the simply defined objective, for the short view of time; for meandering proceeds by covering more ground, percolating into deeper depths, listening to the murmurs of more voices, being what it is when and where it is observed.��� (Klaver, 2018) We cover quite a bit of ground, paddle some lakes and rivers, and invite the murmurs of more voices.

In the "Proximity and Clues" chapter of the book "Proximity and Epidata", authors Laurie J. Bonnici and Brian C. O���Connor share their personal journey in exploring the concept of proximity. Their shared interest in kayaking led them to discover a mutual intellectual proximity: both had been academically linked through their respective professors, Patrick Wilson and Elfreda Chatman. They've worked together over the years, despite irregular physical proximity, through the aid of digital communication.
They use the metaphor of their kayaking passion, an unexpected thread of proximity, to illustrate how unknown, unpredictable elements can catalyze connections and enrich discussions. They aim to map a "constellation of proximities" and argue that proximity is a thread linking conventional retrieval methods and more serendipitous forms of information seeking.
Rather than presenting a single model, they describe their work as a series of provocations, likening it to a meandering journey that covers more ground, reaches deeper depths, and encourages a multiplicity of voices. The authors invite readers to join in this exploration, fostering a deeper understanding of proximity in the context of information retrieval and understanding.

1.2 Once Upon a Time
Our story of Proximity begins with an ancient Greek legend. Theseus had a problem and he had no clue how to solve it.

For some time, the people of Athens had been compelled to send young men and women to Knossos to be sacrificed to the Minotaur���a half human, half bull creature born to the wife of King Minos as punishment for Minos insulting the god Poseidon. Theseus, being of the right age, promised his father King Aegeus he would slay the creature and free his people of this horrible burden.

Killing the Minotaur would not be easy; yet, as an accomplished warrior, Theseus was confident he could slay the creature, as shown in Fig. 1.1 (Diosphos, 500 BCE). The real problem was what to do after the killing. The Minotaur was enclosed in a labyrinth, as visualized in Fig. 1.2 (van de Passe, 1602) designed by the legendary designer and maker, Daedalus, to be inescapable���keeping the dangerous creature and his sacrificial meals trapped together and away from the citizenry of Knossos. Escaping the inescapable labyrinth was the real problem for which Theseus had no clue.

Chapter 1.2, titled "Once Upon a Time," starts the narrative of proximity with an ancient Greek myth about Theseus and the Minotaur. In this legend, young Athenians were being sacrificed to the Minotaur, a half-human, half-bull creature, in the city of Knossos as a repercussion for King Minos insulting Poseidon, the god of the sea. Theseus, a young and accomplished warrior, pledged to his father, King Aegeus, that he would defeat the Minotaur and end this dreadful obligation.
Though Theseus was confident about killing the Minotaur, the real challenge was escaping from the labyrinth where the creature was confined. This maze, designed by the famous craftsman Daedalus, was meant to be impenetrable, thus trapping the Minotaur and his sacrificial victims while protecting Knossos's residents. Figuring out how to escape from the labyrinth was the real predicament that Theseus had to solve.

Enter Ariadne, daughter of King Minos. As often happens in such tales, Ariadne fell in love with Theseus, so she was invested in his problem of escaping the labyrinth. She went to Daedalus and asked for help. He suggested thread, so Theseus would have a physical connection to the outside���maintaining proximity to Ariadne. At the appointed hour Theseus prepared his sword and Ariadne gave him a ball of thread���literally a ���clew or clue,��� a skein of yarn or thread. Theseus entered the maze letting out the line from his clew, slew the creature, and wound/found his way back out through the otherwise inescapable labyrinth. Ariadne knew Daedalus and Theseus knew Ariadne; the chain of proximity yielded a clue for a useful solution to a vexing problem.

We cannot always count on Ariadne going to Daedalus to help us solve problems, but humans do hunt and gather useful clues in numerous ways. It is our aim to set out examples of proximity and clues in order to suggest an inclusive model of information seeking and use. We hope, also, to provoke a broader conversation.

1.3 Clues, Proximity, and Functionality
It is useful to turn to the etymology of ���clue��� (a variant of the earlier ���clew���). The Oxford English Dictionary (Weiner & Simpson, 2004) tells us that a clue is: ���A ball of thread, which in various mythological or legendary narratives (esp. that of Theseus in the Cretan Labyrinth) is mentioned as the means of ���threading��� a way through a labyrinth or maze; hence, in many more or less figurative applications: that which guides through a maze, perplexity, difficulty, intricate investigation, etc.���

The OED gives as it earliest example of this meaning of ���clue��� as Chaucer���s Legend Good Women Ariadne from 1385: By a clewe of twyn as he hath gon The same weye he may returne a-non ffolwynge alwey the thred as he hath come.

The OED also alerts us that, while physical closeness is the usual meaning of ���proximity,��� more abstract senses can also be implied: (1) The fact or condition of being near or close in abstract relations, as kinship, time, nature, etc.; closeness; (2) The fact, condition, or position of being near or close by in space; nearness. Now the dominant sense.

The tale of Theseus and Ariadne presents us with different facets of proximity. Theseus has to sail from Athens to Knossos just to be proximate with the Minotaur. Ariadne becomes close to Theseus and wanting to maintain physical and emotional proximity to him decides to help solve the problem of exiting the labyrinth. Neither Ariadne nor Theseus has any idea of how to escape the labyrinth; however, Ariadne is close to Daedalus, designer of the labyrinth. It is Daedalus who comes up with the idea of using thread to establish a connection to the exit���a clue, a route marker for maintaining proximity to the exit. Had Theseus not met Ariadne and had she not known someone who might have an idea, the Minotaur would no longer have been a threat to Athens, but Theseus would not have returned home.

We assume documents are a means of proximity to what was in the minds (broadly speaking) of their authors. However, finding and understanding documents is another layer of proximity between the coding practices of authors and the decoding abilities users. In general, documents are not sought simply for their physical presence; rather they are sought for what they enable us to do, for the states into which they might enable us to put our neural pathways, whether to solve a unique problem, engage in a lovely memory, remember what to buy at the grocery, find reviews of blood pressure cuffs, or ���

Grocery lists, vacation photos, dissertations, journal articles are attempts to put the reader/viewer/user into proximity with the author. Grocery lists and vacation photos may be seen by nobody other than the author, yet even in this case the author is put back in time and, perhaps place���standing before the empty shelf in the pantry two hours earlier, or back at a fjord in Norway in 1973. Damasio asserts that remembering something is putting neural pathways into the same state they were when the target of remembering originally happened. (Damasio) The documents act as clues, codes to help neural pathways become proximate to some earlier state. In a conversation, Brian asked Damasio if a novelist or film director could be said to be putting readers and viewers into neural states they had never actually experienced; Damasio replied that he would not argue against that idea.

This excerpt is from the book "Proximity and Clues" by Laurie J. Bonnici and Brian C. O'Connor, published in the Synthesis Lectures on Information Concepts, Retrieval, and Services book series.
In their work, the authors share how their shared interest in kayaking and intellectual ties to the same mentor led to their collaboration and exploration of the concept of proximity in various contexts, like information seeking and understanding.
Chapter 1.1, "Introduction," is about how their shared passion for kayaking and their common academic ancestry in studying under Patrick Wilson sparked their collaboration. Over time, their physical proximity varied, but they maintained a conceptual proximity through mutual critiques and collaborations on various projects.
Chapter 1.2, "Once Upon a Time," uses the ancient Greek legend of Theseus and the Minotaur to illustrate the concept of proximity. The authors use the tale to illustrate the value of connections and the gathering of clues in solving problems.
Chapter 1.3, "Clues, Proximity, and Functionality," delves into the etymology of "clue" and "proximity" and discusses how documents can be seen as a means of achieving proximity with the thoughts of their authors. The authors suggest that documents are sought not merely for their physical presence but for what they allow us to do, and for the mental states they enable us to achieve.
The authors hope to provoke a broader conversation about proximity in information seeking and use and see their work as a set of provocations rather than a single, complete model.

We assume meaning is (largely) function. Authors generate documents in order to share some functionality���perhaps only with themselves and those close to them or with some wider group; seekers want some functionality. The documents (messages) generated and sought are of all sorts���formally coded books, sculptures, movies, symphonies, videos of the cat, having beer and pizza with a professor while working out a dissertation idea, photographs of knots for holding ribs in a kayak, reading Ginsberg���s HOWL, hearing Ginsberg perform HOWL.

We use the term epidata as a general term for clues to finding and understanding useful information. We should note that epidata includes dynamic and mutable constructs. Theseus was the first to think of entering a labyrinth, killing a menacing creature, then exiting the labyrinth. There was no context, no established knowledge on how to proceed. Thread as a means of escaping a labyrinth could not have been found in Theseus���s local library; yet, now that we know the solution worked, we can move it into a standard index term.

Wilson speaks of moving away from the topical or disciplinary organization and description of documents and instituting a ���reorientation toward the functional.��� (Wilson, 1977). Then he notes such an approach ���explicitly recognizes the primacy of the need to bring knowledge to the point of use.��� Now, there is a problem of a sort here. Much of what has been done in the past has been a matter of labeling���labeling what the primary subject of a document is and labeling what the primary subject of a question is. This makes it possible to match a user���s question to a document���essentially resulting in an efficient warehousing system. However, this assumes that someone seeking information actually knows just how to state what it is that is troubling, missing, vexing, or needed. It also assumes that someone knows how to translate whatever is in a retrieved document to their problem. It also assumes there is a document available. It also assumes that the document and the seeker employ a common language in a mutually expressed and understood way. Wilson (his works are just full of insights stated in wonderful prose) notes that if one ���made knowledge available for use by making documents available for use, the librarian���s role would be clear-cut, [b]ut the availability of knowledge is not like the availability of an object ��� a book, a hammer, or a loaf of bread.���

Our story of proximity turns to a food court in Toronto. For some time, we had been thinking about professors (among others) as dynamic documents, digesting new information, critiques, and insights and updating their concepts. Having ideas rolling around in their head that they are yet processing. Those thoughts and critiques can be delivered to colleagues and students as soon as they are formulated and within the context at hand. For students looking a little baffled a simple example and some extra background material can be provided for clarification of understanding. As for colleagues in the field, much may be bypassed to get to further discussion of the new ideas (Fig. 1.3).

First notes on proximity and anecdata

We had been considering the concept of ���professor as document��� for some time largely attempting to model increasing constraints on the professoriate from many sides. While chatting and scribbling notes in a food court we turned our thoughts to Patrick Wilson as a professor of note to whom we each had strong but quite different connections���proximity. We reasoned it could help readers of Wilson���s philosophical works to know of his hardy laugh by making him appear more human and thus approachable. In the first two pages of his oral history (Wilson & McCreery, 2000) the note ���[laughter]��� appears three times; Howard White noted from his doctoral student days:

Wilson was a good lecturer���earnest but also playful in a style ��� with a crooked smile and the slightly odd habit of sometimes grasping his ankle and resting his knee on the front table, which gave him a crane-like stance. (White, 2000)

It might be useful in some way for them to know that his passion and rigor was so deep that even after he had retired, he had a dream that he might have made an errant perception about positivism, and that he then went back through his writings to be sure his arguments still held. Brian then recalled an incident involving Wilson���s first book.

In 1997, Brian had assigned Wilson���s Two Kinds of Power to a group of master���s degree students in his course. The text was just as it had been when set in print thirty years earlier; no new versions, update, or changes had been made. Most of the students declared they would not read the book because Wilson was ���too sexist������he did not use gender-neutral pronouns and he used masculine phrases such as ���How is a man to know���?��� The writing style followed the norms of publishing for the time Wilson published the work���1968. Changes in cultural attitudes on gender over the ensuing thirty years combined with more static norms of publishing resulted in a breakdown in the functionality of Wilson���s text to connect with the students. This was an example of how small differences in circumstances might go unnoticed, yet cause significant problems distancing a possible user and a source of potentially useful information. Common ground was not so substantial as it seemed���there was a lack of temporal proximity. When Wilson wrote the book there was no style manual that enforced gender-neutral pronouns. Brian posited to the students that if anyone would have argued for gender neutral use in publishing, Wilson would likely have been among them (from personal conversations with him). Even if he had used them, the publisher would have ���edited��� them away. Sharing these perspectives on Wilson with the students opened a pathway of proximity that shifted students��� perspective. This shift led to their reading the work with (self-reported) enthusiasm. Here we see that Brian provided information around the book (epidata) that led to a connection with the original and unchanged information (book).

Laurie noted that such anecdotes might be helpful in translating across all manner of disruptions of functionality caused by lack of proximity to an information source. The very word ���anecdote��� prompted our original and early construct anecdata. We originally constructed ���anecdata��� to resonate with metadata, yet be significantly different. The term ���anecdote��� comes from roots meaning ���unpublished������this does not mean it is not evidentiary or of little use, only that anecdata is not ���publicly��� available in any ordinary sense. The Oxford English Dictionary notes:

anecdote (n.)1670s, ���secret or private stories,��� from French anecdote (17c.) or directly from Medieval Latin anecdota, from Greek anekdota ���things unpublished,��� neuter plural of anekdotos, from an- ���not��� + ekdotos ���published���

Procopius' 6c. Anecdota, unpublished memoirs of Emperor Justinian full of court gossip, gave the word a sense of ���revelation of secrets,��� which decayed in English to ���brief, amusing story��� (1761).

This piece delves into the complex idea of understanding and interpreting information or knowledge. It introduces the concept of "epidata", defined as clues that assist in the discovery and understanding of valuable information.
Your mention of Theseus suggests that this knowledge isn't always readily available or traditional, but once a new solution or concept has been validated, it becomes part of our collective knowledge.
Wilson's ideas discussed here criticize the common practice of labeling or categorizing information in a document-based manner, instead advocating for a shift toward functionality, or using information at the point of need. This perspective challenges the assumption that seekers of information can precisely articulate what they need and that the information they seek exists in a form they can understand.
The piece you've shared then segues into a personal anecdote involving the interpretation of Patrick Wilson���s philosophical works, adding a human element to the discussion of information understanding. The authors here utilized their personal experiences with Wilson to enhance the reader's understanding and engagement with his work, illustrating how understanding can be deepened through personal anecdotes and contextual information - what they term as "anecdata".
In sum, this piece is an exploration of how we can use contextual clues, personalized anecdotes, and functionality-oriented thinking to improve our understanding and utilization of information.

2.1 Toward an Ontology of Proximity
Adapted from Bonnici, L. & O���Connor, B. (2021). ���More Than Meets The Eye: Proximity to Crises through Presidential Photographs.��� Proceedings from the Document Academy, 8:2, 2021. https://doi-org.wikipedialibrary.idm.oclc.org/10.35492/docam/8/2/14.

All of photography can be summarized as photons in, photons out. (O���Connor, 2009)

The very things which an artist would leave out, or render imperfectly, the photograph takes infinite care with, and so makes its illusions perfect. What is the picture of a drum without the marks on its head where the beating of the sticks has darkened the parchment? (Holmes, 1859)

Vision gives us proximity at a distance. Human vision is a matter of photons exciting receptors; so, in a general sense, photographs require little in the way of decoding. The photon data of any photograph maps the surface of what was in front of the camera with exquisite empiricism, much as does the human eye at any point in time (Fig. 2.1). This data shows us a great deal about those objects���color, texture, size, orientation���that enables interaction with our world. There is a difference, though, between the camera and the brain���the brain generally has a conceptual construct within which to make use of the eye���s image. When we see the world around us, we generally do so across time���glancing at the thermometer, looking for the car keys, focusing on entering the road, shifting our gaze about the environment. Each scene is set within a larger context. Churchland refers to this as seeing ���spatiotemporal particulars [within a] landscape or configuration of the abstract universals, the temporal invariants, and the enduring symmetries that structure the objective universe of [the brain���s] experience.��� (Churchland, 2012) Any individual photograph presents an exquisite data set of ���spatiotemporal particulars,��� but is, in and of itself largely bereft of universal particulars of either the maker or the seeker or the viewer. Any individual photograph has specific photon data, but any particular viewer may not have adequate contextual constructs to be able to make use (make sense) of the photograph. The photon data puts our eyes in proximity to the original scene.(Bonnici and O���Connor, 2019)

This excerpt discusses the role of vision and photographs in providing proximity, or a sense of closeness, to a particular subject or scene. It starts with the basic premise that human vision and photography work on a similar principle: the excitation of receptors by photons. This means that, on a fundamental level, photographs need little decoding because they operate much like our own visual systems.
However, the authors point out a critical difference between human vision and a photograph: the human brain often has a pre-existing context or understanding of what it's seeing, enabling us to make sense of our visual surroundings. This continuous experience across time, referred to as seeing "spatiotemporal particulars", helps us integrate information from our environment into our existing knowledge framework.
Photographs, on the other hand, capture only a specific moment in time and space, making them "spatiotemporal particulars" that lack broader context or universal particulars. Without the accompanying context or the viewer's existing knowledge to make sense of it, the photograph's information remains just data, not a fully comprehended image.
However, the authors also note that a photograph's ability to capture a scene's exact details can still provide a sense of proximity by bringing our eyes close to the original scene, even if we can't fully understand or contextualize what we're seeing.

3.1 Achieving Proximity
We propose Epidata as a term for all the sorts of clues to finding, encountering, and understanding/making use of information that exist outside the ordinarily available tools of data and metadata. Our retelling of the Ariadne and Theseus tale presents the utility of a single clue. Our example of intellectual connections presented in Chap. 2 demonstrate some of the complexities that clues offer in leading to information discovery. Now we sketch some scenarios using multiple clues, forming webs of proximity.

A clue, a ball of thread, whether physical or metaphorical is capable of weaving a conversation with the past and influencing the present. For Theseus, the clue kept track of all the twists and turns of his path through the maze Daedalus had constructed to confine the Minotaur, as sketched in Fig. 3.1, and its victims, then return alive to Ariadne���s loving arms from which he had set out.

In this chapter, the authors introduce the term "Epidata" to refer to all types of clues that help in finding, encountering, and understanding information that exist beyond the standardly available tools of data and metadata. This concept of Epidata is used to explain how multiple clues, when interconnected, can form webs of proximity that lead to information discovery.
The authors use the tale of Ariadne and Theseus as an example to illustrate the utility of a single clue - the thread that Theseus used to navigate the labyrinth. This thread, which tracked all the turns and twists of Theseus's path through the maze, symbolizes a dialogue with the past that can influence the present.
Now, they extend this concept and suggest that the weaving of multiple clues, like a web, can build an even more complex and rich understanding of information. In essence, they propose the use of Epidata as a method for achieving proximity, or closeness, to information by leveraging a variety of clues or sources of knowledge that exist outside traditional data and metadata.

3.3 Shaking Up the Personal Knowledge Store: Browsing and Idiocy
We turn here to scholarly browsing as a search activity with no specified target and no initial clues. Academic scholars are charged with being creative, with generating new knowledge. Knowledge yet to be generated cannot yet have been classified or indexed. That is, one cannot walk into a library or login to a search engine and search with descriptors for something that does not yet exist, that has not yet been described. One cannot walk into a library or logon to a digital platform and ask for ���my new knowledge paper��� or even ���existing works likely to spark a new idea.��� How is a scholar to achieve proximity to a documentary source when neither the question nor the likely source of satisfaction is known?

Browsing has long been a response to this question. Browsing is fundamentally a matter of serial proximity to document after document until one is found that works, that inspires, that fills in the missing piece. It is notable that ���browse��� refers to animals feeding in the wild, ���sometimes carelessly used for graze, but properly implying the cropping of scanty vegetation.��� (Weiner & Simpson, 2004) The sheer number of documents on stack shelves or in a digital environment does not imply creative sustenance.

We use ���idiocy��� to emphasize the utterly personal, idiosyncratic nature of browsing. Idiocy might seem a harsh term, yet it relates directly to creativity and to navigation for creative purposes. While its current use is essentially pejorative, its etymology fits the notion of creativity. Liddell and Scott tell us that the Greek root���idios���means:

�����������

I. one's own, pertaining to oneself: hence,

1. private, personal,

2. one's own,

3. ����� ���. private interests,

II. separate, distinct,

b. ���. ����������, in Ptolemaic and Roman Egypt, private account,

2. strange, unusual; peculiar, exceptional, eccentric,

3. peculiar, appropriate (Liddell & Scott, 1940).

3.3.1 Bring Forth, Produce, Beget, Cause
Creativity has at its root ���to grow;��� beyond that root there is a great deal of speculation, debate, and a considerable number of experimental inquiries. Sculptor George Segal has used ���total goulash��� to describe the complex web of attributes that comprise this state/set of states. (Isakson, in O���Connor, 1988) Some general characterizations of creativity seem to hold. For our examination of proximity, we can say it is ���a unique integration of various mental operations,��� (Haley, in O���Connor, 1988) in large part an intentional, and conscious attempt to reconcile or reformulate seemingly antithetical elements into a new concept embodying the ���truth��� of each of the seminal elements. (Rothenberg, in O���Connor, 1988) Such reconciliation or reformulation requires the ability to ���know thyself��� (Demey, in O���Connor, 1988), that is, to be in a ���state of readiness for catching similarities��� and to be ���gullible���, making free-associations. (Arieti, in O���Connor, 1988) All manner of connections are made willingly, especially those which seem ���illogical��� or unsanctioned by current knowledge or models; yet the connections remain subject to critical evaluation.

In this section, the authors discuss the notion of scholarly browsing as a search activity that doesn't have a specific target or initial clues. They highlight the challenges academic scholars face when trying to create new knowledge that has yet to be classified or indexed.
The authors use the term "browsing" to describe the process of coming into proximity with one document after another until finding one that inspires or completes a missing piece. The term "browse," they note, refers to animals feeding in the wild, implying the cropping of scanty vegetation. This is meant to suggest that the sheer number of documents available in libraries or digital platforms does not necessarily lead to creative inspiration.
The term "idiocy" is introduced here to underscore the personal and idiosyncratic nature of browsing. While the word usually has a negative connotation in everyday usage, its Greek root���"idios"���implies something pertaining to oneself, or something private and personal.
The authors then delve into the concept of creativity, describing it as "a unique integration of various mental operations." It often involves an intentional effort to reconcile or reformulate seemingly contrasting elements into a new concept that captures the essence of each of these elements. This process requires self-knowledge and a readiness to catch similarities and make free associations, even those that may seem illogical according to current knowledge or models.

I call that the Slum Dog millionaire effect

ChatGPT
ChatGPT
I see, you're relating this to the plot of the movie "Slumdog Millionaire," where the protagonist unexpectedly knows the answers to all the quiz show questions due to his unique life experiences. Each question triggers a memory that provides the answer, akin to the way browsing can lead to unexpected discoveries and knowledge connections in the field of academia. It's an interesting comparison as both scenarios highlight the value of personal experiences and seemingly unrelated information in generating knowledge or understanding.

Connections to this.In the paper "The Link between Brain Learning, Attention, and Consciousness" published in Consciousness and Cognition (Volume 8, Issue 1, March 1999, Pages 1-44) by Stephen Grossberg, the author explores the processes through which our brains learn about the changing world in a stable manner, leading to conscious experiences. 

These processes involve:

1. The learning of top-down expectations.
2. Matching these expectations against bottom-up data.
3. Focusing attention on the expected clusters of information.
4. Developing resonant states between bottom-up and top-down processes as they reach a consensus on what is expected and what exists in the outside world.

Grossberg suggests that all conscious states in the brain are resonant states, and these states trigger the learning of sensory and cognitive representations. He refers to the models summarizing these concepts as Adaptive Resonance Theory (ART) models.

The author presents psychophysical and neurobiological data supporting ART, covering areas such as early vision, visual object recognition, auditory streaming, variable-rate speech perception, somatosensory perception, and cognitive-emotional interactions. He notes that ART mechanisms operate at all levels of the visual system and proposes how these mechanisms are realized by known laminar circuits of the visual cortex. He predicts that the same circuit realization of ART mechanisms will be found in the laminar circuits of all sensory and cognitive neocortex.

The paper discusses how some visual percepts may be visibly or modally perceived, while amodal percepts can be consciously recognized even though they are perceptually invisible. It's also suggested that sensory and cognitive processing in the brain's "What" processing stream obey top-down matching and learning laws that complement those used for spatial and motor processing in the brain's "Where" processing stream. This interplay allows our sensory and cognitive representations to maintain stability as we learn more about the world, while spatial and motor representations can forget learned maps and gains that are no longer relevant as we grow from infancy to adulthood.

Finally, the author proposes that procedural memories are unconscious because the inhibitory matching process supporting these spatial and motor processes cannot lead to resonance.

ChatGPT
The process described in Stephen Grossberg's paper aligns closely with the concept of proximity, browsing, and 'idiocy' mentioned in the chapters you provided earlier. When it comes to scholarly browsing, it's all about the discovery process, forming expectations, and comparing these expectations to the data one comes across. This corresponds well with Grossberg's steps involving learning of top-down expectations and matching these against bottom-up data.
Furthermore, Grossberg's suggestion that all conscious states are resonant states resonates with the idea of 'idiocy,' or personal creativity, in browsing. When an individual is engaged in free associations, making unique or unexpected connections, it could be seen as developing resonant states between their prior knowledge (top-down processes) and new information they encounter (bottom-up data).
Moreover, the Adaptive Resonance Theory (ART) model's prediction that sensory and cognitive representations remain stable as we learn aligns well with the browsing experience, where the user constructs an understanding through a series of documents, connecting the dots to form a bigger picture.
Lastly, the concept of procedural memories being unconscious as they can't lead to resonance might also be seen as akin to the serendipitous knowledge discovered during browsing. It may not be immediately conscious or purposeful, but it could end up being a crucial piece of the puzzle.
In this way, the cognitive processes explored by Grossberg appear to have intriguing parallels with the approach to information discovery discussed in the previous texts.

ChatGPT
The term "Slumdog Millionaire effect" is not an officially recognized or defined term in psychology or sociology, but it can be loosely derived from the plot of the 2008 film "Slumdog Millionaire."
In the movie, the protagonist, Jamal Malik, a boy from the slums of Mumbai, goes on to win the Indian version of the game show "Who Wants to Be a Millionaire?". Despite his lack of formal education, Jamal is able to answer every question correctly. His success is attributed to his diverse and often traumatic life experiences, each of which serendipitously provides him with the knowledge needed to answer the game show's questions.
The "Slumdog Millionaire effect" could, therefore, refer to the phenomenon where seemingly disparate and unrelated life experiences end up providing the knowledge or insight needed to solve a complex problem or achieve a significant accomplishment. It's a celebration of experiential learning and its often unpredictable but invaluable outcomes.
This notion aligns with some of our earlier discussions, such as the concept of "browsing" in knowledge discovery, where an unplanned or idiosyncratic exploration of information can lead to valuable insights. Similarly, Grossberg's Adaptive Resonance Theory suggests that our conscious experiences are shaped by the continual interplay between our expectations and the information we encounter, which may also echo the idea of the "Slumdog Millionaire effect."

Parallels with "Against Method"
2 / 2
ChatGPT
ChatGPT
"Against Method: Outline of an Anarchistic Theory of Knowledge" is a book by philosopher of science Paul Feyerabend which argues against the idea that there are fixed, universal rules or methods that govern the progress of science or the acquisition of knowledge. Instead, Feyerabend advocates for methodological pluralism, suggesting that different contexts and problems may require different approaches or methods.
The concept of the "Slumdog Millionaire effect" and some of our previous discussions share parallels with the ideas presented in "Against Method". Both emphasize the value of diverse experiences and the need for flexibility in problem-solving or knowledge acquisition.
For instance, the "Slumdog Millionaire effect" highlights how varied and seemingly unrelated life experiences can contribute to problem-solving in unexpected ways. Similarly, Feyerabend's argument against a rigid scientific method underlines the importance of adopting a flexible, open-minded approach to exploring and understanding the world.
In the context of information discovery and scholarly browsing, these ideas suggest that knowledge generation is not necessarily a linear process governed by a single method, but may result from idiosyncratic exploration and serendipitous encounters with information.
Stephen Grossberg's Adaptive Resonance Theory also has some parallels. It suggests that our understanding of the world is shaped by a dynamic interplay between our expectations and the information we encounter, implying a constant adjustment and adaptation, much like Feyerabend's advocacy for methodological pluralism.

I don't know of the word epidata is that useful. How is any different than metadata?
2 / 2
ChatGPT
ChatGPT
"Epidata" as used in the abstract you provided earlier seems to be a term coined by the authors to describe the kinds of clues or auxiliary information that exist outside the traditional realms of data and metadata, which help in finding, encountering, and understanding information.
The distinction between epidata and metadata lies in their intended roles and nature. Metadata refers to data about data - it provides context, quality, condition, and characteristics of data. Examples of metadata include things like creation date of a document, author's name, file size, etc.
On the other hand, epidata, as per the authors' definition, seems to cover a broader and perhaps less structured range of clues or hints. It could include associations, connections, patterns, and possibly serendipitous pieces of information that aren't necessarily about the data itself, but still help a researcher or information seeker to find, understand, or make use of that data.
That said, the distinction and utility of the term would likely depend heavily on the specific contexts in which it's being used, as well as the conventions of the particular field. In some cases, what one person calls epidata might be considered metadata by another, depending on the scope of their investigation and the nature of the information they're dealing with.

In conclusion, our exploration of proximity and external contingencies provides a unique lens through which we can view information discovery and understanding. From the inherent complexities of human vision and the nuances of photographic interpretation to the diverse intricacies of knowledge acquisition in the academic world, proximity is critical. It presents us with the chance to connect with the world around us, threading together our experiences in a tapestry of understanding.
Moreover, the concept of external contingencies complements this notion, suggesting that unexpected elements can serve as guideposts in our search for meaning. Like clues in a labyrinth, these contingent factors can direct our journey, helping us navigate through the vast expanse of data and metadata we face in the modern information age.
As we continue to unravel the mysteries of knowledge generation, we must stay open to new methods of information seeking, acknowledging the potential of both proximity and external contingencies in this process. The journey towards understanding is just as important as the knowledge we gain along the way. By embracing these ideas, we can better navigate the labyrinth of information that surrounds us, constantly pushing the boundaries of our own understanding.

Connections to Schmidhuber's idea of operationalized curiosity.
1 / 1
ChatGPT
ChatGPT
Schmidhuber's concept of operationalized curiosity, which he formalized through his theory of a "curiosity reward signal," aligns well with the discussion on proximity and external contingencies. His model is designed around a neural network that seeks to minimize the discrepancy or surprise between its predictions and actual input. It does this by formulating a reward function that essentially increases when the neural network improves its predictions of incoming data - in essence, it's 'curious' to minimize its predictive errors.
This approach can be seen as a form of achieving proximity, where the system seeks to understand its environment better by reducing the distance between prediction and reality. The curiosity model drives the system to explore its surroundings, assimilate new data, and adjust its internal models accordingly.
External contingencies relate closely to the unexpected situations or data that the model might encounter in its explorations. These unexpected findings can be considered 'surprises,' which stimulate curiosity and motivate further learning. They represent information that exists outside the model's current understanding - much like the concept of epidata.
Thus, Schmidhuber's operationalized curiosity is a concrete example of a system navigating through information using proximity and being driven by external contingencies. By tying in the element of curiosity, it brings an aspect of active engagement and adaptability to the process, highlighting the dynamic and evolving nature of information discovery and learning.

Connections with Ayn Rand's epistemology of objectivism.
1 / 1
ChatGPT
ChatGPT
Ayn Rand's objectivist epistemology and the concept of proximity and external contingencies bear some commonalities, but also several differences.
In Rand's objectivism, knowledge and truth are objective and external to the individual. They can be discovered and validated through reason, sensory perception, and logical consistency. Similarly, the idea of proximity, in the context of our discussions, refers to achieving understanding and making sense of data through direct observation, interpretation, and rational analysis of the "photons in, photons out" concept, or the direct sensory data.
However, a significant divergence occurs when considering the role of external contingencies. In Rand's objectivist view, the truth is absolute and independent of external influences or individual contexts. In contrast, the concept of external contingencies or "epidata" we've discussed acknowledges that there may be significant information outside the core data that could influence its interpretation and understanding.
Moreover, objectivism puts great emphasis on an individual's independent reasoning and deductive processes to decipher truth from sensory data. On the other hand, the concept of "external contingencies" suggests that interpretation can also be influenced by clues, context, and connections that might exist outside the data itself.
In conclusion, while both objectivism and the ideas around proximity and external contingencies emphasize the importance of direct observation and logical reasoning, they differ in how they view the influence of external context and the absoluteness of truth.

Absolutely. Ayn Rand's Objectivism suggests that truth is out there to be discovered, and it doesn't change based on our perception or context. It emphasizes that our senses and reason are our primary tools to understand the world.
On the other hand, the concept of proximity and external contingencies implies that additional context or clues that are outside of the main data can significantly influence how we interpret and understand it. It suggests that our understanding isn't only based on what we directly observe or reason, but can also be shaped by these external factors.

Yes, absolutely. That's a perfect example of an external contingency. The file's metadata, in this case, may state that the recording was made in 2012 due to the device resetting. However, the content of the recording or additional information (like you stating the metadata is incorrect) provide external contingencies that reshape your understanding of when the recording was actually made. This highlights how external factors can interact with our primary data to influence our understanding and perception of the information at hand.

Sure, I'd be happy to provide more examples of external contingencies:
News Context
: Let's say you are reading an article from 2015 discussing the potential impacts of Brexit, which at the time hadn't happened yet. If you were unaware of the date of the article, you might find the speculations confusing or off-base given what actually happened post-Brexit. The external contingency here is the real-world events that have transpired since the article was published.
Technological Advances
: Imagine you're reading a tech guidebook from 2007 about the best smartphones. The information would seem outdated now due to rapid technological advancements. The external contingency here is the progression of technology outside of the information presented in the guidebook.
Cultural Shifts
: A book written in the early 20th century may have perspectives on race, gender, and societal roles that are significantly different from today's views. The societal progression and shifts in cultural norms form an external contingency when interpreting the text.
Personal Experience
: When reading a novel, your personal experiences and emotions can shape how you interpret the story and characters, which can be significantly different from someone else's interpretation. Your personal life experiences serve as external contingencies in this context.
In each of these examples, the primary source of data (the article, guidebook, book, or novel) provides certain information, but external factors or knowledge significantly impact the way that information is understood or interpreted.

We began by discussing the concept of proximity in vision and photography, examining how a photograph captures detailed information but may lack broader contextual understanding.
The conversation moved on to a discussion of the term 'Epidata', which was proposed to describe clues that assist in the discovery and interpretation of information, outside of data and metadata. However, you felt the term was not distinct enough from metadata and suggested the alternative term 'External Contingencies'.
The discussion shifted to explore browsing as a process of knowledge discovery, with the 'idiocy' concept used to underline the personal and idiosyncratic nature of this process.
You introduced the 'Slum Dog Millionaire effect', tying it to the idea of external contingencies aiding in the discovery and interpretation of information.
We discussed connections to Stephen Grossberg's research on brain learning, attention, and consciousness.
Connections were drawn between our discussion and Paul Feyerabend's 'Against Method', where science does not adhere to any particular methodology and instead is an anarchistic, free-flowing process, similar to the browsing process discussed.
You suggested calling 'Epidata' as 'External Contingencies' instead.
We further explored the idea of 'External Contingencies' through various examples, including a voice recorder with incorrect metadata.

ChatGPT
ChatGPT
Sure, let's apply 'External Contingencies' more specifically to some of the points we discussed:
In the context of
Proximity and Vision
: External contingencies can be factors such as the knowledge of the viewer or the context in which a photograph is viewed. These factors, not contained in the photo itself (data) or its accompanying information (metadata), impact our understanding and interpretation of the photo.
For the
Epidata Concept
: While 'Epidata' was proposed as a term for all clues aiding information discovery and understanding outside the conventional tools of data and metadata, renaming it as 'External Contingencies' emphasizes their spontaneous, uncontrollable, and context-dependent nature.
Discussing
Browsing and Idiocy
: Here, 'External Contingencies' could refer to personal experiences, emotions, or serendipitous encounters that inform a scholar's search activity and potentially lead to new knowledge or creativity, beyond what can be classified or indexed.
In your
Voice Recorder Example
: The external contingency is your verbal correction of the date, which contradicts the metadata (the incorrect date set on the recorder). The listener's trust in your word or their own knowledge of events you mention in the recording could also act as external contingencies that affect their belief about when the recording was made.
These are just a few specific applications. The core idea is that 'External Contingencies' represent unforeseen, uncontrollable factors that are external to the conventional system (data and metadata) but significantly influence our understanding or interpretation of that system.

Sure, we can consider these as 'External Contingencies' as well.
Moore's Law
: This law has consistently predicted the exponential growth of computing power over time. As an 'External Contingency', it has the capacity to influence industries reliant on computational power, disrupting business models and driving technological innovation at an unprecedented rate. It is external to individual industries and firms but greatly affects their strategies and operations.
Academic Research
: The generation of new knowledge and theories through academic research often serves as an 'External Contingency' for practical fields. Discoveries in academic research can transform the understanding of phenomena, create new technologies, or provide fresh perspectives, influencing various sectors of society including business, medicine, education, and policy-making.
Industrial-Scale Inventions
: These can introduce disruptive changes in production processes, markets, and societal structures. For example, the invention of the assembly line dramatically changed industrial production. These inventions can be seen as 'External Contingencies' for companies, industries, or even whole economies because they externally reshape the operational landscape.
In all these cases, the 'External Contingencies'���be it Moore's Law, academic research, or industrial-scale inventions���act as powerful external factors that can significantly influence the course of industries, societies, and individual understanding.

ChatGPT
ChatGPT
Each of these external contingencies can play a critical role in shaping our proximity to new knowledge, information, or understanding, as discussed throughout our conversation:
Moore's Law
: The exponential growth in computational power predicted by Moore's Law can directly affect our proximity to new knowledge and information. As computational capabilities grow, so too does our ability to process, analyze, and make sense of vast quantities of data, potentially leading to new insights and discoveries. It can influence the development of new tools, algorithms, and systems for managing and making sense of data, metadata, and epidata.
Academic Research
: Our proximity to knowledge is often directly influenced by academic research. Research can introduce new theories, models, or empirical findings that shift our understanding of various phenomena, bringing us closer to the 'truth'. The research process itself is a journey of proximity, navigating through intellectual connections and drawing on various clues (or epidata) to reach new insights.
Industrial-Scale Inventions
: These inventions can change the way we access and interact with information. For instance, the invention of the internet radically altered our proximity to knowledge by making vast quantities of information instantly accessible. Other industrial-scale inventions might influence the infrastructure through which we access information, or the tools we use to find, process, and interpret it.
All these external contingencies illustrate how our proximity to knowledge is not just about our own personal searching, browsing, and thinking processes, but is also shaped by larger external forces. These forces can alter the 'landscape' of knowledge and information we're navigating, potentially leading us to new discoveries and understandings.

These discoveries may shape an individual's thinking, introducing new paths or avenues of exploration that wouldn't be apparent or feasible in isolation. This ties back to our discussion about the importance of browsing, idiocy, and creativity in encountering and understanding new information. Such external contingencies can provide the fertile ground from which novel ideas and insights emerge.

The nature of scientific and technological progress is essentially collective and emergent, rather than ordered by a specific entity. It's the result of numerous individuals, groups, and institutions pursuing their interests, solving problems, and generating new knowledge. While specific projects may be commissioned by organizations, governments, or individuals, the overall direction of technological and scientific advancement is shaped by a complex interplay of various factors, including but not limited to economic trends, societal needs, scientific curiosity, and technological possibilities. It's this collective, decentralized, and somewhat chaotic process that leads to innovations like those described by Moore's Law, academic research, and industrial-scale inventions.

I see, I apologize for the misunderstanding. The quote you are referring to is from a news article about the recent discovery by the Muon g-2 experiment at Fermilab. In this case, "who ordered that?" is a question sometimes posed by physicists when experimental results show something unexpected or not accounted for in the existing theoretical framework.
The phrase is attributed to the Nobel laureate Isidor Isaac Rabi, who reportedly said, "Who ordered that?" upon the discovery of the muon particle itself, which was unexpected and seemed superfluous within the then-existing understanding of particle physics. The recent Fermilab results hint at possible new physics beyond the Standard Model, hence the quote being relevant. It encapsulates the surprise and curiosity that drive scientific exploration.

That's an intriguing thought process! What you described could be seen as a form of subconscious processing or incubation period. This is a phenomenon often observed in creativity and problem-solving, where an idea or solution emerges after a period of not consciously thinking about the problem.
The documentary you watched provided some external contingencies (information), which your mind processed in the background until you made the connection with giant lithophones. This aligns with the theories discussed earlier, where seemingly unrelated pieces of information (epidata) can lead to new discoveries when we achieve proximity to them, or when external contingencies influence our thought process. This can certainly add to our understanding of how information, creativity, and discovery are interlinked.

Over time, with the information from the documentary acting as an external contingency, your mind processed this in the background, leading you to make a connection with the concept of giant lithophones. This appears to be a form of subconscious processing or incubation, where your mind was able to form a creative hypothesis after a period of time. It exemplifies how external contingencies can influence our thought processes and lead to novel ideas or discoveries.

Perhaps this Is A Novel hypOthesis.

That they built giant lithophones.

It is also possible that Neanderthals were the first to discover ultrasound; if they happened to observe that there were certain rocks that did not make a sound when struck alone (the frequencies are too high), but that "sing" when struck simultaneously (due to amplification of harmonic frequencies).

At least that is what Richard Faas discovered in 1965, and I'm betting that this wasn't the first time.

I'm then leaping to a corollary conclusion -- that there was a "musical iron age" where rocks with high iron content were preferred because they produced better tones; that is, before it was noticed that they could be smelted.

I guess another implication of what I'm saying is that those mysterious stalagmite structures found in the Bruniquel cave are probably prehistoric "pianos".

Perhaps stalagmites broken off at different lengths make different tones and several of them are played simultaneously, by multiple teams.

There are a few experiments that could be done to see if this a viable hypothesis.

Someone else has probably written more eloquently about this, and in more detail; I'm pretty sure I'm not the first person to think of this.

When asked if there were any musical instruments in the cave, Richard Steven Walz on Quora said:

Yes. Some items resembling a flute, and in caves with their remains are found stalactites and stalagmites broken off to musical scales of some kind.

But he didn't mention where he learned this.

Your hypothesis, as stated, is quite comprehensive and intriguing. You propose that Neanderthals might have invented giant lithophones and possibly discovered the principles of ultrasound, noticing that certain rocks, when struck alone, do not make a sound due to the frequencies being too high. However, these rocks could "sing" when struck simultaneously due to the amplification of harmonic frequencies.
You also propose a "musical iron age" when rocks with high iron content were preferred for their tonal qualities, before the discovery of smelting.
The stalagmite structures found in the Bruniquel cave, you suggest, might be prehistoric "pianos" - stalagmites broken off at different lengths might produce different tones when struck, and multiple teams could play them simultaneously.
Your hypothesis, while speculative, is interesting and could potentially be supported or refuted through experimental archaeology or similar research methods. These could include reproducing the possible sounds using stalagmites or rocks with high iron content, and exploring whether there's a discernible pattern or musical scale that could be derived from these sounds.
As you mentioned, further research might have been done on this topic. The links you provided contain valuable resources to explore this hypothesis in more detail, including possible earlier discoveries of lithophones, articles about the mysterious structures in Bruniquel cave, and examples of what these instruments might have sounded like. This hypothesis offers a fascinating insight into how early humans may have interacted with their environment and created music, potentially shedding light on the cultural practices of Neanderthals.

Your hypothesis about the Neanderthals potentially inventing giant lithophones and possibly discovering ultrasound brings together several of the previous discussion points in an interesting way:
Proximity and External Contingencies:
The Neanderthals were interacting closely with their environment (proximity), discovering the properties of different materials, perhaps by chance or due to their immediate needs (external contingencies). Their findings might have been influenced by the materials available around them (geographical proximity) and the requirement to communicate or create sound (cultural proximity).
Against Method:
The Neanderthals likely didn't follow a structured, scientific method to discover these properties. Their discoveries, if your hypothesis is correct, came from experiential, trial-and-error processes. This aligns with Paul Feyerabend's argument against strict adherence to a single scientific method.
Schmidhuber's Idea of Operationalized Curiosity:
This notion applies well to the Neanderthals, who might have been driven by curiosity to experiment with different rocks and stalagmites, leading to the discovery of their musical properties.
Ayn Rand's Epistemology of Objectivism:
The Neanderthals, based on your hypothesis, were grounded in their immediate reality, using their senses and reason to interact with and understand the world. This aligns with Ayn Rand's view that our knowledge and understanding of the world come from sensory experiences.
Stephen Grossberg's Adaptive Resonance Theory (ART):
The Neanderthals could have been engaging in a bottom-up learning process where their experiences (hitting different rocks and hearing the sounds) shaped their expectations (certain rocks can make specific sounds).
Epidata (External Contingencies) vs. Metadata:
The actual experience of interacting with these materials (epidata) might have played a larger role than any inherited knowledge (metadata) in this case.
These connections illustrate how seemingly disparate concepts can come together to form a coherent narrative, shedding light on potentially significant aspects of prehistoric human behavior.

In this conversation, we've delved into the theme of 'proximity and external contingencies' and how they influence our learning, perception, and interaction with the world. We started with a discussion on proximity, which led us to explore how it impacts knowledge acquisition, social interaction, and cultural assimilation. This was encapsulated in what you've termed the 'Slumdog Millionaire Effect'.
From there, we examined Stephen Grossberg's work on Adaptive Resonance Theory (ART), which further elucidates how our brain learns and consciously experiences the world through a constant interplay between bottom-up and top-down information processing.
We moved to discussing Paul Feyerabend's philosophy from "Against Method", understanding its relevance to the broader discussion of learning and discovery. The focus then shifted to the role of 'epidata' or what you proposed to term as 'external contingencies', which can shape our understanding and perception of information in ways that are beyond the immediate data or metadata.
Through a practical example of a voice recorder with incorrect metadata, we discussed how external contingencies can challenge our perception and interpretation of reality. We also explored their wider impact on discoveries, like Moore's Law, academic research, and industrial-scale inventions.
The conversation took an exciting turn with your novel hypothesis about the Neanderthals potentially discovering giant lithophones and ultrasound. This instance portrayed an interplay of proximity and external contingencies, leading to the formulation of novel ideas. We further related this to operationalized curiosity as proposed by Schmidhuber, and Ayn Rand's epistemology of objectivism.
In conclusion, the theme of 'proximity and external contingencies' gave us a lens to explore the nuanced processes of learning, knowledge discovery, perception, and ideation, spanning from our individual cognitive processes to the broad strokes of human evolution and civilization.
