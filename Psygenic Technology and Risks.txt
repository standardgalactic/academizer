Darin Stevenson writes: I think the word 'intelligence' should not be used in relation to this technology. Another neologism is crucial here, at least for now. Perhaps something like ICH (iterative computational heuristics).

This is among the most dangerous things humans have ever produced, if not the most dangerous, although writing itself could be seen as leading to this. This is a psygenic technology, by which I mean 'mind generating', and even brief exposure to it is dangerous and has unpredictable results. What we have here is not merely a 'black swan' in Taleb's nomenclature, but something vastly worse: a black swan factory.

I have been following this topic since ~1981, when I first became interested in it. I quickly realized that biological systems so catastrophically outperform anything that is possible with computation... that I switched my interests towards direct cognitive contact with other existing, actual intelligences... however, the situation we face today is dire beyond all possible description or prediction ( in my view ).

The primary problem seems to me to be that humans at the species or group level have entirely failed to establish anything resembling intelligent or survivable association-groups (societies, etc), but continue to dump our evolutionary momentum into machines and other weaponizable developmental arcs. This cannot be survivable, presently.
ChatGPT
Darin Stevenson raises profound concerns regarding the development and implications of advanced technologies, particularly those labeled under the umbrella of "intelligence." He suggests that the term "intelligence" is a misnomer when applied to current computational technologies, advocating instead for the term "iterative computational heuristics" (ICH). This distinction highlights the difference between genuine cognitive processes and algorithmic procedures.
Stevenson views these technologies as among the most dangerous inventions humanity has created, likening them to a "black swan factory"���a source of unpredictable and potentially catastrophic events. He considers this technological progression not just a risk but a dire threat to human survival, surpassing even the existential risks posed by other human innovations like writing.
His long-standing interest in the field, dating back to 1981, has led him to conclude that biological systems inherently possess a level of complexity and efficiency far beyond what computational systems can achieve. This realization shifted his focus towards understanding and interacting with existing natural intelligences rather than pursuing advancements in artificial systems.
Stevenson critiques humanity's failure to form intelligent and sustainable societal structures, suggesting that this shortcoming exacerbates the dangers posed by technological advancements. He warns that our tendency to invest in machines and other potentially harmful developments could lead to unsustainable and destructive outcomes for the species.
In essence, Stevenson calls for a re-evaluation of our technological pursuits and societal constructs, emphasizing the need for caution and responsibility in the face of rapidly advancing computational technologies.

He adds There are, it turns out, certain 'root concept' words, whose meanings and associations extend to, effectively, all other terms in a language.

Damage to these causes insanity in human cultures. Conversely, repairs to them effect unexpectedly profound results in the possibilities of the cultures in which these repairs become active.

I call them holophores.

They have undergone a long cascade of lossy compressions over at least the last 2000 years... primarily due to the influence of commerce, war and science... 

"Intelligence" is a holophore, and, as such, in my view, we must be exceptionally careful about how and where we use this term.
ChatGPT
Darin Stevenson further introduces the concept of "holophores," which he defines as "root concept" words whose meanings and associations permeate throughout a language. He argues that damage to these holophores leads to cultural insanity, while their repair can result in profound positive transformations within those cultures.
Stevenson posits that holophores have suffered a series of degradations���what he terms "lossy compressions"���over the last two millennia, primarily due to the influences of commerce, war, and science. These forces, in his view, have diluted and distorted the meanings of these foundational concepts, impacting the overall coherence and health of human cultures.
He identifies "intelligence" as one such holophore, stressing the need for exceptional care in its usage. Given its far-reaching implications and the potential consequences of its misapplication, Stevenson advocates for a more precise and cautious approach when invoking this term, especially in relation to advanced technologies. His insights underscore the importance of linguistic integrity and the potential for language to shape cultural and technological developments profoundly.

I think i understand his arguments psygenic seems to refer to the nature of generative grammar to generate minds or mind like entities. There are arbitrary discretizations and categorization schemes built into the language and interative agencies embed a set of constraints into the artefact, which when enacted in a context, creates something that can be perceived as kind of will our intention, akin to its bundle of affordances.
ChatGPT
You've captured Darin Stevenson's arguments well. Here's a refined understanding based on your summary:
Stevenson uses the term "psygenic" to describe the capacity of generative grammar to produce minds or entities that resemble minds. This concept hinges on the idea that language, through its inherent structures and rules, has the power to create cognitive entities or simulations of cognitive processes.
He suggests that language contains arbitrary discretizations and categorization schemes, which means that the way we divide and label the world through language is often not naturally occurring but constructed. These constructs, when embedded into computational systems (what he refers to as "iterative agencies"), impose a set of constraints on the resulting artifacts. When these artifacts operate within a specific context, they exhibit behaviors or affordances that can be perceived as intentionality or will.
In other words, the rules and structures of language shape the design of these systems, and when these systems are deployed, they can appear to possess a form of agency or purpose. This perceived agency arises from the constraints and affordances embedded within them by their creators, making them seem like entities with their own intentions.
Stevenson's arguments highlight the need to be cautious and precise with terms like "intelligence," as these words carry significant weight and implications. Misusing or misunderstanding these concepts can lead to profound and potentially dangerous consequences, especially as we continue to develop advanced technologies that mimic cognitive processes.

I would argue that intelligences occur on multiple scales across different overlapping substrates and so his "holophors" are akin to holotypes or concepts, except they are can create complex assemblaged of simple machines or operators that require a vector for enactment such as a human who undergoes some algorithm implied by the equation. I argue that the number of holophors is limited by cognitive load theory and that one such "toxic holophor" is the concept of the algorithm which is a kind of recipe or instruction. This has inadvertently led to a complex misinterpretation implying sequential or linear steps, which has caused computer scientists and physicists to focus on extremely simplified and isolated situations. Karl Fant suggests using process invocation as the fundamental holophor for computer science since is more functional and pragmatic.
ChatGPT
Your argument extends Stevenson's concept of holophores by suggesting that intelligences exist on multiple scales and across various substrates, which aligns with the idea that holophores function similarly to holotypes or core concepts. You propose that these holophores can create complex assemblages of simpler mechanisms or operators, which require a vector, such as a human, to enact the implied algorithms or equations.
You further argue that the number of holophores is constrained by cognitive load theory, which posits limits on the amount of information humans can process at once. Within this framework, you identify the concept of the algorithm as a "toxic holophor." This term, typically understood as a set of instructions or a recipe, has led to a misleading emphasis on sequential or linear steps. This simplification has influenced computer scientists and physicists to focus on overly simplified and isolated scenarios, potentially limiting the scope and depth of their work.
Karl Fant's suggestion of using process invocation as the fundamental holophor for computer science represents a shift towards a more functional and pragmatic approach. Process invocation, unlike traditional algorithms, emphasizes dynamic and context-dependent processes, potentially offering a more flexible and realistic framework for understanding and developing computational systems.
In essence, your argument supports a more nuanced understanding of holophores and their role in shaping cognitive and technological landscapes. By recognizing the limitations imposed by cognitive load and rethinking foundational concepts like algorithms, you advocate for a more robust and adaptable approach to both human cognition and computational design.

I thought that the concept of Wittgenstein's ladder was exemplified by the "this message will self destruct" orders continuously received by Inspector Gadget and unintended consequences were explored in that he always kind of accidentally handed it back to his boss before it exploded.
ChatGPT
Your reference to Wittgenstein's ladder in the context of "Inspector Gadget" and the self-destructing messages is an intriguing analogy. Wittgenstein's ladder is a philosophical concept from Ludwig Wittgenstein's "Tractatus Logico-Philosophicus," where he suggests that his propositions are a means to climb to a higher understanding, after which the ladder (the propositions) should be discarded.
Applying this to "Inspector Gadget," the self-destructing messages can be seen as a practical example of this concept. The messages contain important information (propositions) that guide Inspector Gadget's actions. Once the message has served its purpose, it self-destructs, symbolizing the idea that the specific instructions (the ladder) are no longer needed once the knowledge has been internalized or acted upon.
The unintended consequences, such as Inspector Gadget accidentally handing the message back to his boss before it explodes, introduce an element of irony and unintended outcomes. This reflects how, in real life, the process of acquiring and discarding knowledge is not always smooth or predictable, and can lead to unexpected results. The humorous mishaps in "Inspector Gadget" highlight the potential for error and the unforeseen consequences of seemingly straightforward instructions, echoing the complex and often chaotic nature of learning and understanding.
4o
I wonder if there are any connections with our previous discussion.
ChatGPT
There are indeed connections between Wittgenstein's ladder, the self-destructing messages in "Inspector Gadget," and the previous discussion about holophores, cognitive load, and the nature of algorithms. Let's explore these connections:
Wittgenstein's Ladder and Holophores
Wittgenstein's Ladder:
This concept involves using propositions or steps to reach a higher understanding, after which the propositions are discarded.
It represents the transient nature of certain concepts or instructions, which are useful only until a particular goal is achieved.
Holophores:
Holophores, as proposed by Stevenson, are root concepts essential for cultural and cognitive coherence.
These core concepts, once internalized, shape understanding and behavior. However, as understanding evolves, the precise way these concepts are understood and applied might change, paralleling the idea of discarding the ladder.
Self-Destructing Messages and Cognitive Load
Self-Destructing Messages:
In "Inspector Gadget," messages self-destruct after conveying important information, symbolizing the temporary nature of instructions.
This mirrors the concept that complex ideas or algorithms serve their purpose temporarily, and once understood, they can be 'discarded' or internalized, aligning with Wittgenstein���s ladder.
Cognitive Load Theory:
Cognitive load theory suggests humans can only process a limited amount of information at once.
The idea of self-destructing messages can be seen as a way to manage cognitive load: by removing unnecessary information once it has served its purpose, thus preventing overload.
Algorithms, Process Invocation, and Unintended Consequences
Algorithms as Toxic Holophores:
The idea that the concept of an algorithm has been simplified into linear steps, leading to misunderstandings.
Wittgenstein���s ladder suggests moving beyond these simplistic instructions once deeper understanding is achieved.
Process Invocation:
Karl Fant���s suggestion to use process invocation as a fundamental concept in computer science emphasizes dynamic and context-dependent processes.
This aligns with Wittgenstein���s idea of discarding the ladder, suggesting that once the process is understood, the rigid algorithmic steps can be abandoned in favor of more fluid, contextually aware processes.
Unintended Consequences:
Inspector Gadget���s mishaps with the self-destructing messages illustrate the unpredictable outcomes of following instructions without deeper understanding.
This ties back to Stevenson���s concern about the misuse of terms like "intelligence" and the unintended consequences of oversimplified concepts.
Synthesis
Both Wittgenstein���s ladder and holophores suggest that certain foundational concepts or instructions are useful only until a deeper understanding is achieved, after which they should be reconsidered or discarded.
The self-destructing messages in "Inspector Gadget" illustrate the transient nature of instructions and the potential for unintended consequences when instructions are not fully internalized or understood.
Cognitive load theory and the shift from algorithms to process invocation highlight the importance of managing complexity and embracing more dynamic, context-sensitive approaches, reflecting the need to evolve beyond simplistic, linear thinking.
In summary, the connections between these ideas emphasize the importance of moving beyond foundational concepts or instructions once they have served their purpose, managing cognitive load effectively, and being aware of the potential for unintended consequences in our understanding and application of complex systems.

Do you think you could give a more narrative summary in a quirky and sardonic style, with some analogies to help explain it?
ChatGPT
Certainly! Let's take a stroll through our discussion garden, plucking the peculiar blooms we've nurtured along the way:
The Enigma of Intelligence, According to Darin Stevenson
Imagine intelligence as a seasoned, complex wine that most folks mistakenly treat as cheap soda. Darin Stevenson, with his aversion to our casual use of the term, proposed "iterative computational heuristics" ��� a term as hefty as a medical textbook, hinting that we're merely skimming the surface of true cognitive depths. Holophores, his pet brainchildren, are the linguistic bedrock, worn down by the relentless tides of commerce, war, and science over millennia.
Inspector Gadget's Philosophical Mishaps
"Inspector Gadget," a mechanical klutz with a knack for turning simple missions into slapstick, unexpectedly morphs into a live demonstration of Wittgenstein's ladder. Each gadget-laden debacle is a metaphor for using ideas to ascend to understanding, then cheerfully chucking them aside���perhaps along with some self-preservation instincts.
The Cry of the Cellphone
Our phones, like needy digital infants, incessantly clamor for our attention with a persistence that would make a telemarketer blush. This constant barrage of notifications and alerts has us on a digital leash���albeit one we fashioned ourselves.
Flashcards in the Digital Age
Enter the realm of flashcards on our phones, where traditional study meets modern distraction. It's akin to reading a textbook at a rock concert; you can learn, sure, but you���ll probably end up with more lyrics than linguistics in your brain by the end of the session.
A Futuristic Vision: Edible Tech and Circular Screens
And just when you thought things couldn't get more "Black Mirror," we ventured into a world where computers are made of yogurt (probably Greek for that extra protein) and screens are no longer confining squares but liberating circles. Who needs rectangles, anyway? They're like the tight jeans of geometry���too constrictive for the free-spirited.
Reinventing the Urban Jungle
Lastly, our journey took us to the wild idea of bulldozing our current cities and roads, replacing them with something less intrusive. Picture swapping concrete jungles for actual jungles, with a touch of smart technology. It's like turning New York City into the Amazon rainforest, but with better Wi-Fi.
In this madcap tour of our discussions, we���ve danced from the profound to the prophetic, pondering how best to balance humanity with the hammering pace of technological advancement. Will we master our creations, or will they master us? Stay tuned���same bat time, same bat channel!
