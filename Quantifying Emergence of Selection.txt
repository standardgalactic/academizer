Assembly Theory Explains and Quantifies the Emergence of Selection and Evolution
Abhishek Sharma, D��niel Cz��gel, Michael Lachmann, Christopher P. Kempes, Sara I. Walker, Leroy Cronin
Since the time of Darwin, scientists have struggled to reconcile the evolution of biological forms in a universe determined by fixed laws. These laws underpin the origin of life, evolution, human culture and technology, as set by the boundary conditions of the universe, however these laws cannot predict the emergence of these things. By contrast evolutionary theory works in the opposite direction, indicating how selection can explain why some things exist and not others. To understand how open-ended forms can emerge in a forward-process from physics that does not include their design, a new approach to understand the non-biological to biological transition is necessary. Herein, we present a new theory, Assembly Theory (AT), which explains and quantifies the emergence of selection and evolution. In AT, the complexity of an individual observable object is measured by its Assembly Index (a), defined as the minimal number of steps needed to construct the object from basic building blocks. Combining a with the copy number defines a new quantity called Assembly which quantifies the amount of selection required to produce a given ensemble of objects. We investigate the internal structure and properties of assembly space and quantify the dynamics of undirected exploratory processes as compared to the directed processes that emerge from selection. The implementation of assembly theory allows the emergence of selection in physical systems to be quantified at any scale as the transition from undirected-discovery dynamics to a selected process within the assembly space. This yields a mechanism for the onset of selection and evolution and a formal approach to defining life. Because the assembly of an object is easily calculable and measurable it is possible to quantify a lower limit on the amount of selection and memory required to produce complexity uniquely linked to biology in the universe.

The paper "Assembly Theory Explains and Quantifies the Emergence of Selection and Evolution" by Abhishek Sharma et al. introduces a new theory called Assembly Theory (AT) to understand the transition from non-biological to biological systems. This theory proposes a way to quantify the complexity of objects in terms of their Assembly Index (a), which is the minimum number of steps needed to construct an object from basic building blocks. By combining this index with the copy number of an object, a new metric called Assembly is defined, which measures the amount of selection required to produce a given group of objects.
The authors explore the internal structure and properties of assembly space, differentiating between undirected exploratory processes and directed processes emerging from selection. Assembly Theory allows for the quantification of the emergence of selection in physical systems at any scale, marking the transition from undirected to selected processes within the assembly space.
This approach provides a mechanism to understand the onset of selection and evolution, offering a formal method to define life. It enables the quantification of a lower limit on the amount of selection and memory required to produce biological complexity in the universe, making it possible to measure and calculate the assembly of an object. The theory bridges the gap between evolutionary theory, which explains the existence of certain forms, and the fixed laws of the universe, underpinning the origin of life, evolution, human culture, and technology.

The article presents a new theory called Assembly Theory (AT), which aims to reconcile the evolution of diverse biological forms with the fixed laws of the universe. Traditional evolutionary theory explains why certain things exist based on selection, but it doesn't predict their emergence. AT addresses this by redefining how objects are perceived - not as point particles, but in terms of the possible histories of their formation. This approach allows objects to provide evidence of selection, both within and beyond the boundaries of an individual or selected unit.

AT introduces a concept called Assembly, quantifying the causation required to produce a set of objects. This helps in understanding how novelty and selection can be integrated into the physics of complex objects. The theory demonstrates this through a forward dynamical process that accounts for the assembly of objects. By redefining matter in terms of assembly spaces, AT offers a unified framework for physics and biology, highlighting the significance of history and causal selection at the scale of chemistry. This new perspective suggests a form of physics where history and selection play a crucial role in determining what exists.

The article on Assembly Theory (AT) introduces a novel perspective in understanding the evolution of biological forms in the context of the fixed laws of the universe. Traditional evolutionary theory effectively explains why certain things exist through the mechanism of selection but falls short in predicting their emergence. AT seeks to fill this gap by redefining how objects are perceived, not merely as point particles, but in terms of the possible histories of their formation. This approach allows for a deeper understanding of how objects can provide evidence of selection, extending beyond the boundaries of individual entities or selected units.
AT's core concept is "Assembly," which quantifies the causation required to produce a set of objects. This is a significant step in integrating the concepts of novelty and selection into the physics of complex objects. The theory accomplishes this through a forward dynamical process that takes into account the assembly of objects.
By redefining matter in terms of assembly spaces, AT bridges the gap between physics and biology, emphasizing the importance of history and causal selection even at the scale of chemistry. This innovative perspective suggests a form of physics where history and selection are fundamental in determining the existence of various forms. In essence, AT offers a unified framework that allows for a more comprehensive understanding of the emergence and evolution of complex biological forms within the constraints of the universal laws.

The introduction of the article addresses the limitations of traditional evolutionary theory and physics in explaining the emergence of novelty across various domains like chemistry, biology, and technology. Evolutionary theory, as defined by Darwin, explains why certain entities exist based on survival and selection, but this is a retrospective approach. It doesn't offer predictions about the emergence of new forms or innovations.

Physics, on the other hand, describes forward dynamics by setting an initial state and applying fixed laws to evolve this state. However, this approach struggles with accounting for novelty, which can't be predicted from initial conditions and often must be attributed to randomness. This gap highlights the difficulty in fitting the open-ended generation of novelty within the frameworks established by Darwin for biology and Newton for physics.

Several efforts have been made to bridge this gap. Some have explored dynamics where the laws evolve alongside the states, allowing for a larger possibility space. Others have focused on the evolution of rules acting on other rules, but these models are often too abstract to predict the evolution of physical objects effectively. Another approach involves combinatorial spaces and their expansion, like the theory of the adjacent possible in statistical mechanics. These models result in an exponential growth of possible configurations, but they lack a mechanism for selection, reducing their predictive power regarding which evolutionary innovations occur.

Overall, the introduction highlights the need for a new framework or theory that can effectively integrate the concepts of novelty, selection, and predictability in the context of evolutionary processes spanning from physics to biology and technology.

The introduction of the article discusses the challenges faced by traditional evolutionary theory and physics in explaining the emergence of novelty in various domains, including chemistry, biology, and technology. While Darwinian evolutionary theory explains the existence of entities based on survival and selection, it primarily does so retrospectively, lacking predictive power about the emergence of new forms or innovations.
Physics, in contrast, focuses on forward dynamics by setting an initial state and applying fixed laws to evolve this state. This approach, however, struggles to account for novelty, which often can't be predicted from initial conditions and is usually attributed to randomness. This highlights a significant gap in fitting the open-ended generation of novelty within the frameworks of Darwinian biology and Newtonian physics.
Efforts to bridge this gap have taken various forms. Some have explored dynamics where laws evolve alongside states, broadening the possibility space. Others have examined the evolution of rules that act on other rules, although these models tend to be abstract and less effective in predicting the evolution of physical objects. Another approach involves examining combinatorial spaces and their expansion, as seen in the concept of the adjacent possible in statistical mechanics. While these models predict exponential growth in possible configurations, they often lack a mechanism for selection, thus limiting their predictive ability regarding evolutionary innovations.
The introduction underscores the necessity for a new framework or theory that can seamlessly integrate the concepts of novelty, selection, and predictability across evolutionary processes, encompassing physics, biology, and technology. This new perspective is essential to understand and predict the emergence and evolution of complex forms and innovations in various scientific domains.

Assembly Theory (AT) is introduced as a solution to the challenges in understanding how novelty and selection operate in forward-evolving processes. AT differs from traditional approaches in several key ways:

1. **Predicting and Quantifying Selection**: AT enables predictions about novel forms during selection and quantifies the amount of selection necessary to produce observed objects. This is achieved without needing to pre-define individuals or units of selection.

2. **Redefining the Concept of Objects**: In AT, objects are not viewed as point particles, as is common in physics. Instead, they are defined by the histories of their formation, which is considered an intrinsic property.

3. **Assembly Space**: The concept of the assembly space is central to AT. It refers to the pathways by which an object can be built from elementary building blocks through recursive operations. This space captures the minimal memory, representing the minimum number of physical operations needed to assemble an object based on its past.

4. **Introducing the 'Assembly' Quantity**: Assembly in AT is measured using two empirical observables: the number of copies of the observed objects and their assembly indices. The assembly index indicates the minimal number of steps needed to produce an object. Assembly quantifies the memory required to produce a selected configuration of observed objects, akin to how entropy quantifies the information needed to specify the configuration of point particles.

5. **A Unified Language for Selection and Novelty**: AT provides a unified framework for describing selection and the generation of novelty, bridging the gap between physics and biology.

6. **Potential for a New Physics**: AT has the potential to contribute to a new form of physics that emerges at the scale of chemistry. In this new physics, history and causal contingency via selection become central to understanding physical matter.

In summary, Assembly Theory offers a novel approach to understanding and quantifying the processes of selection and evolution, redefining the concept of objects and their formation histories, and providing a framework that unifies physics and biology with a focus on the role of history and causal selection.

Assembly Theory (AT) introduces a novel approach to understanding the emergence of selection and evolution by redefining the concept of objects and focusing on key observable properties: assembly index and copy number.

1. **Redefinition of Objects**: In AT, objects are defined as finite, distinguishable, and persistent over time. They are considered breakable, meaning their construction from elementary building blocks can be measured. This definition contrasts with standard physics, where objects (like atoms or elementary particles) are often viewed as fundamental and unbreakable. AT acknowledges that what is considered the smallest unit of matter may depend on observational limits and may not be fundamental. Hence, AT treats any constructible entity as an object, making it inclusive of emergent objects produced by evolution and selection.

2. **Assembly Index**: The assembly index is a crucial observable property in AT. It represents the complexity of an object in terms of the steps required to construct it from basic elements. This index provides a measurable way to understand the assembly of objects.

3. **Copy Number**: The concept of copy number is fundamental in AT, especially in the context of selection. The theory posits that the more complex an object is, the less likely it is to find an identical copy without a specific, selected mechanism for its creation. Thus, complex objects existing in high numbers suggest the presence of a system (like a biological cell, technological factory, or human mind) with the capability to recreate these objects.

4. **Experimental Measurement**: The assembly of objects can be experimentally measured, as illustrated by the use of mass spectrometry for molecules. This technique can determine how molecules are constructed by bonding, thus revealing their assembly process.

5. **Implications for Evolution and Selection**: The approach of AT implies that objects existing in high numbers, especially complex ones, are indicators of a physical system that has evolved and been selected over time. This system possesses a memory or mechanism to construct these objects.

In summary, Assembly Theory offers a comprehensive framework for quantifying and understanding the processes of selection and evolution. It does so by redefining objects in a more inclusive manner and focusing on measurable properties like assembly index and copy number, which are key to understanding the complexity and evolution of objects.

Assembly Theory (AT) introduces a groundbreaking perspective for understanding the emergence of selection and evolution, centering on a novel concept of objects and emphasizing observable properties such as the assembly index and copy number.
Redefinition of Objects
: AT defines objects as finite, distinguishable, and persisting over time. Contrasting with traditional physics, where objects like atoms or particles are seen as fundamental and indestructible, AT views objects as constructs that can be broken down into elementary building blocks. This approach recognizes that the smallest unit of matter may be determined by observational limits rather than being inherently fundamental. AT thus treats any constructible entity as an object, accommodating emergent objects created through evolution and selection.
Assembly Index
: A key component of AT, the assembly index quantifies an object's complexity based on the number of steps required to construct it from basic elements. This provides a tangible metric to assess the assembly process of objects.
Copy Number
: Copy number is a vital concept in AT, particularly regarding selection. The theory suggests that the complexity of an object correlates inversely with the likelihood of finding its identical copy without a specific selection mechanism. Therefore, complex objects found in abundance indicate the presence of a system (like a biological cell, technological factory, or human mind) capable of consistently reproducing these objects.
Experimental Measurement
: AT allows for the experimental measurement of object assembly. For example, mass spectrometry can be used to decipher the bonding structure of molecules, revealing their assembly process.
Implications for Evolution and Selection
: AT implies that the prevalence of complex objects, especially in large numbers, signals the existence of a physical system that has undergone evolution and selection. Such a system possesses a memory or mechanism for constructing these objects.
In essence, Assembly Theory presents a comprehensive method for quantifying and understanding selection and evolution processes. By redefining objects in a broader context and focusing on measurable properties like the assembly index and copy number, AT offers profound insights into the complexity and evolutionary history of objects.

The concept of the assembly index in Assembly Theory (AT) is crucial for understanding how objects are constructed from their basic components. Here's an overview of how assembly index and copy number are defined and utilized in AT:

1. **Assembly Index**: 
   - **Definition**: The assembly index is defined by the physical constraints allowing an object's construction. It is determined by analyzing the assembly pathway of an object, starting from elementary building blocks.
   - **Construction Process**: To construct an assembly pathway, one begins with the basic building blocks of the object and recursively joins them to form new structures. At each step, the newly formed objects are added back to the assembly pool for potential use in subsequent steps.
   - **Quantifying Assembly Index**: For any given object, its assembly index (\( a_i \)) is the size of the smallest assembly subspace that contains it. It is quantified as the length of the shortest assembly pathway that can generate the object.

2. **Chemical Systems and Molecular Assembly Theory**: 
   - **Application**: In chemistry, molecular assembly theory considers bonds as elementary operations for constructing molecules. The shortest path to build a target molecule involves breaking it into parts and ordering these parts by size, starting from atoms and adding bonds in sequence.
   - **Recursive Property**: This process is recursive; once a motif is generated along the path, it remains available for reuse. This recursive property is vital for identifying the shortest path and quantifying the minimum number of constraints or memory size required to build the target molecule.

3. **Reading Assembly Index**: 
   - **Experimental Determination**: The assembly index can be experimentally determined from the target molecule. This makes it an intrinsic property of the molecule.
   - **Distinction from Other Complexity Measures**: Assembly theory's approach to measuring assembly index differs from complexity measures in computer science, such as shortest paths and algorithmic compressibility. While computer science often calculates algorithmic complexity as the length of the shortest program that can compute an object, assembly theory focuses on the actual physical assembly process.

4. **Copy Number**: 
   - **Importance in Selection**: Although not detailed here, the concept of copy number is integral to AT. It refers to the number of copies of an object that exist, which is significant in understanding the selection process and the complexity of an object.

In summary, the assembly index in Assembly Theory provides a detailed and practical measure of how complex objects are built from their fundamental components. It offers a new perspective on understanding the physical construction of objects, distinguishing it from theoretical complexity measures in computer science.

Figure 2 in the paper illustrates the concept of selection in Assembly Theory (AT) and the significance of copy number and assembly index in understanding the selection process:

Assembly Space:

(A) Pictorially represents the formation of combinatorial object space from building blocks and physical constraints. It visualizes how objects are constructed from simpler components within the defined constraints of the assembly space.
Copy Number Distributions:

(B) Shows observed copy number distributions of objects at different assembly indices, indicating whether selection is present or absent.
The distribution patterns help in understanding how selection influences the prevalence of objects with varying complexity (assembly index).
Physical Pathways and Directed Selection:

(C) Depicts physical pathways for constructing objects, differentiating between undirected and directed pathways. Directed pathways, indicative of selection, lead to higher copy numbers of the observed object.
Significance of Copy Number:

A single instance of a highly complex molecule (high assembly index) does not alone suggest evidence of selection, as it could potentially arise from random events.
In a forward-building assembly process without specific targets, the number of potential objects grows super-exponentially at each step in the absence of constraints.
Finding multiple identical copies of an object implies a non-random process, as the likelihood of randomly creating identical complex objects diminishes super-exponentially with higher assembly indices.
Evidence of Selection:

Objects with high assembly indices found in abundance are evidence of selection, due to the combinatorially growing space of possible objects at each recursive assembly step.
Only objects with high copy numbers can have their assembly index measured accurately, as detecting a single instance of an object and inferring its assembly index is technically challenging.
Measurement Techniques and Example:

For measuring assembly index in molecules, techniques like mass spectrometry require many thousands of identical molecules for detection.
In conclusion, copy number and assembly index are key factors in Assembly Theory for understanding selection processes. The presence of multiple identical copies of a complex object (high assembly index) in an environment provides strong evidence of a non-random, selective process shaping its existence.

The Assembly Equation introduced in Assembly Theory (AT) is a mathematical formulation designed to quantify the total amount of selection necessary to produce a given ensemble of objects. Here's an explanation of the equation and its components:

1. **The Assembly Equation**:
   - The equation is given as \( \text{Assembly} = \frac{1}{N} \sum_{i=1}^{N} a_i \times (n_i - 1) \).
   - In this equation, \( a_i \) represents the assembly index of object \( i \), \( n_i \) is its copy number, and \( N \) is the total number of objects in the ensemble.
   - The equation normalizes by the number of objects in the ensemble, allowing for the comparison of Assembly between ensembles with different numbers of objects.

2. **Quantifying Selection**:
   - The Assembly quantifies the distribution of objects over a range of assembly indices within the summation. This approach allows for an empirical measurement of the degree of selection in the ensemble.

3. **Competing Effects**:
   - The Assembly Equation accounts for two competing effects:
     - The complexity of discovering new objects.
     - Once discovered, some objects become easier to make because the memory for their formation has been selected.

4. **Exponential Growth with Assembly Index**:
   - The exponential growth of Assembly with depth in the assembly space (quantified by the assembly index) is derived by considering a linearly expanding assembly pool.
   - As objects combine at each step from \( a_i \) to \( a_i + 1 \), discovering new objects at increasing depth becomes harder due to the exponential expansion of possibilities.

5. **Ease of Production and High Copy Numbers**:
   - The production of an object becomes easier as its copy number increases, suggesting that a high copy number implies the object can be readily produced in a given context.
   - The initial innovation or discovery of an object is the hardest step, followed by making the first copy. However, once an object exists in very high abundance, it is relatively easy to make.

6. **Linear Scaling with Copy Number**:
   - For objects with more than one copy, Assembly scales linearly with the copy number, reflecting the ease of production for these objects.

In summary, the Assembly Equation in AT provides a quantitative framework to measure the selection process by balancing the complexities of discovering new objects and the ease of their production once they become more common. This equation offers a nuanced understanding of how selection influences the abundance and complexity of objects within an ensemble.

Quantifying Selection
:
The Assembly Equation is a quantitative measure that assesses the distribution of objects across various assembly indices within the summation.
This approach allows for the empirical measurement of the degree of selection present in the ensemble of objects.
Competing Effects
:
The equation takes into account two competing effects:
The increasing complexity associated with discovering new objects.
The decreasing complexity of producing objects that have already been discovered and have higher copy numbers due to past selection.
Exponential Growth with Assembly Index
:
The Assembly Equation incorporates the concept that the difficulty of discovering new objects increases exponentially with the depth in the assembly space, quantified by the assembly index.
As objects combine at each step from
a
i
a_i
a
i
���
to
a
i
+
1
a_i + 1
a
i
���
+

, the process of discovering new objects becomes increasingly challenging due to the exponential expansion of possibilities.
Ease of Production and High Copy Numbers
:
The equation recognizes that the production of an object becomes easier as its copy number increases.
This implies that objects with high copy numbers can be readily produced in a given context.
The initial innovation or discovery of an object is the most challenging step, followed by making the first copy. However, once an object exists in very high abundance, it becomes relatively easy to reproduce.
Linear Scaling with Copy Number
:
For objects with more than one copy (i.e.,
n
i
>
1
n_i > 1
n
i
���
>
1
), the Assembly scales linearly with the copy number.
This linear scaling reflects the ease of production for objects that have already been selected and exist in multiple copies.
In summary, the Assembly Equation in AT provides a quantitative framework for measuring the selection process. It considers the balance between the complexities of discovering new objects and the ease of producing objects once they become more common. This equation offers a nuanced understanding of how selection influences the abundance and complexity of objects within a given ensemble.

The Assembly Equation in Assembly Theory (AT) has significant implications for understanding the process of selection in the formation of objects. Here's an overview of the consequences and applications of this equation:

1. **Increasing Assembly (A)**:
   - Assembly (A) increases with higher copy numbers (n) and higher assembly indices (a).
   - If high assembly can be indicative of selection, then finding objects with high assembly indices in abundance is a signature of selection.

2. **Information Storage in Assembly Path**:
   - Along an assembly path, the information required to construct an object is stored within the object itself.
   - When two objects from an assembly pool combine, the specificity of this combination process constitutes selection along the assembly path.

3. **Selectivity and Selection**:
   - Randomly combining objects at every step does not constitute selection, as no specific combinations exist in memory for repeated use.
   - Preferential use of certain combinations implies a mechanism that selects specific operations and target objects.
   - The degree of selectivity (s) is quantified, allowing for empirical observation of selection processes.

4. **Example of a Forward Process**:
   - A simple forward process is described, starting with fundamental particles and transforming a fraction of objects at each step into a higher assembly object.
   - This process illustrates how the copy numbers of objects change over assembly steps, both in the presence and absence of constraints.
   - The estimated assembly (A) up to 50 assembly steps is demonstrated in Figure 3C and 3D.

5. **Joint Assembly Space**:
   - In reality, multiple distinguishable objects often coexist with a common history of formation, leading to a common assembly subspace or joint assembly space.
   - An example is transistors used in different technologies, suggesting a shared assembly subspace for many modern technologies.
   - A generalized version of the assembly equation accounts for the joint assembly of objects, quantifying shared pathways to determine the ensemble's Assembly (A).

In summary, the Assembly Equation in AT provides a quantitative method to understand the selection process in the formation of objects. It highlights how specific combinations and preferences in the assembly process can indicate selection mechanisms. Additionally, the concept of a joint assembly space extends this understanding to cases where multiple objects share common formation histories, further enriching the theory's applicability.

The Assembly Equation in Assembly Theory (AT) offers valuable insights into the process of selection and the formation of objects. Here are key implications and applications of this equation:
Increasing Assembly (A)
:
Assembly (A) increases with higher copy numbers (n) and higher assembly indices (a).
Objects with high assembly indices that exist in abundance suggest evidence of selection in the formation process.
Information Storage in Assembly Path
:
The assembly path stores the information required to construct an object.
Specificity in the combination of objects along the assembly path constitutes a form of selection.
This information storage within objects allows for the empirical observation of selection processes.
Selectivity and Selection
:
Random combinations of objects at each step do not indicate selection, as there are no specific combinations repeated from memory.
The presence of preferential combinations implies a mechanism that selects specific operations and target objects.
The degree of selectivity (s) can be quantified, providing a means to observe and measure selection processes.
Example of a Forward Process
:
An illustrative forward process is presented, starting with fundamental particles and transforming objects into higher assemblies at each step.
This example demonstrates how copy numbers of objects change over assembly steps, both with and without constraints.
Figure 3C and 3D in the paper depict the estimated assembly (A) up to 50 assembly steps.
Joint Assembly Space
:
In real-world scenarios, multiple distinguishable objects often share a common history of formation, leading to a shared assembly subspace or joint assembly space.
For example, transistors used in various technologies share common assembly pathways, indicating a joint assembly subspace.
A generalized version of the assembly equation accommodates the joint assembly of objects, quantifying shared pathways and determining the Assembly (A) of the ensemble.
In summary, the Assembly Equation in AT provides a quantitative framework for understanding the selection process in the formation of objects. It highlights the role of specific combinations and preferences in indicating selection mechanisms. Furthermore, the concept of a joint assembly space extends the applicability of the theory to cases where multiple objects share common formation histories, enriching our understanding of selection and evolution.

Figure 3 in the paper demonstrates the concept of the assembly of an ensemble within the framework of Assembly Theory (AT), offering insights into how selection operates in assembly spaces:

1. **Isolated Assembly Path**:
   - (A) Describes an isolated assembly path with a linearly expanding assembly pool. At each step \( ai \rightarrow ai + 1 \), \( n_i \) objects are available for the next assembly step.
   - This model illustrates how the number of available objects changes through each step of the assembly process.

2. **Exponential Increase in Possible Combinations**:
   - (B) Shows that in a linearly expanding assembly pool with the addition of one fundamental object at each step, the number of possible combinations at the \( i \)th step increases exponentially.

3. **Assembly with Constant and Scaling Conversion Fractions**:
   - (C) and (D) Display the assembly of the ensemble up to 50 assembly steps, considering different scenarios:
     - When the conversion fraction ( \( \tilde{a} \) ) is constant with the assembly index.
     - When the conversion fraction scales with the assembly index \( ai \) as \( \tilde{a} = \tilde{a}_0^ai \), where \( \tilde{a}_0 \) is the fraction at the first step, and \( \gamma \leq 1 \) represents the increase in constraints with assembly steps.
   - These scenarios show how objects at higher assembly emerge with higher copy numbers, indicating the efficiency of the forward process in constructing complex objects.

4. **Selection within Assembly Spaces**:
   - The concept of the assembly space allows understanding how selection and historical contingency impose constraints on future possibilities.
   - Assembly spaces are combinatorial, combining items at every step, leading to a super-exponential growth of possibilities.
   - This approach is particularly relevant in chemistry, biology, and technology, where objects are often hierarchical modular structures.

5. **Building Assembly Spaces**:
   - To produce an assembly space, an observed object is broken down recursively to generate a set of elementary building units.
   - These units are then used to construct the assembly pathways of the original object(s), termed Assembly Observed (\( A_{observed} \)).
   - \( A_{observed} \) captures all histories of constructing the observed object(s) from elementary building blocks, consistent with possible physical operations.
   - Objects in AT are compositional, containing information about the larger space of possible objects from which they were selected.

6. **Assembly Universe \( Au \)**:
   - An assembly universe is constructed from the same building blocks in \( A_{observed} \), including not just pathways specific to assembling the original observed objects but all possible pathways for any object composed of the same elementary building blocks.

In summary, Figure 3 and the accompanying explanation in the paper provide a detailed view of how assembly processes evolve over time and how selection influences the complexity and abundance of objects in assembly spaces, emphasizing the combinatorial and compositional nature of objects in AT.

   - (A) Shows the Assembly Observed of three objects (P1, P2, and P3) as graphs. It highlights their shared minimal construction process, termed their Joint Assembly Space. This space represents the overlap in the construction processes of these objects.

2. **Expansion of Various Assembly Spaces**:
   - (B) Illustrates the expansion of different assembly spaces, including the Assembly Universe, Assembly Possible, Assembly Contingent, and Assembly Observed.
   - The figure emphasizes their nested structure but not their relative sizes, where each set is typically exponentially larger than its subset.

3. **Assembly Universe (Au)**:
   - The Assembly Universe (\( Au \)) is a space where all objects are possible without rules, leading to a combinatorial explosion and double exponential growth.
   - This growth is mathematically well-defined but unphysical, as physical laws restrict what can actually be constructed. For instance, quantum mechanics dictates the number of bonds per atom in molecules.

4. **Cosmological and Resource Constraints**:
   - In most systems, including molecular assembly spaces, the Assembly Universe is orders of magnitude larger than the amount of matter available in the observable universe.
   - This means it's impossible to build and exhaust the entire space, especially for larger objects like proteins.

5. **Implications of Resource Limitation**:
   - The real universe does not contain all possible objects at a given depth in the assembly space due to resource and time constraints, as well as selection.
   - By accounting for memory and resource limitations, Assembly Theory restricts the size of what can be built. However, it also allows for the construction of higher assembly objects before exhausting resources on lower assembly objects.

6. **Historical Contingency in Assembly Theory**:
   - Assembly Theory accounts for selection precisely because of the historical contingency in the recursive construction of objects along assembly paths.
   - This historical aspect is crucial in understanding why only certain objects are formed and observed in the real universe, as opposed to the theoretically infinite possibilities in the Assembly Universe.

In summary, Figure 4 and its explanation provide insights into how Assembly Theory conceptualizes different assembly spaces and their relationships. It highlights the importance of historical contingency and resource limitations in understanding the selection and formation of objects in the real universe.

The concept of Assembly Possible (\( A_{possible} \)) in Assembly Theory (AT) describes the space of physically possible objects that can be generated using all known rules of assembly. This section further explains how \( A_{possible} \) is defined and how it functions within the framework of AT:

1. **Definition of Assembly Possible (\( A_{possible} \))**:
   - \( A_{possible} \) encompasses the space of objects that can be created through combinatorial expansion, adhering to the laws governing their assembly.
   - It includes all known rules of assembly, with these rules available at every step for every object.

2. **Assembly Index Dynamics**:
   - When an object with Assembly Index \( a \) combines with its own history, its Assembly Index increases to \( a + 1 \).
   - If a shorter path exists to make the resulting object, its Assembly Index will be less than \( a + 1 \).
   - Combining an object with another not in its own history might result in an Assembly Index larger than \( a + 1 \), unless a shorter path exists.

3. **Statistical Dynamics and Stochastic Rules**:
   - The model assumes a stochastic rule for the dynamics, with object selection based on the number of existing objects with a given Assembly Index.
   - The probability \( P_{a_{object}} \) of an object being selected with Assembly Index \( a \) is proportional to \( n_{a_{object}}^�� \), where \( n_{a_{object}} \) is the number of objects with that Assembly Index.

4. **Parameterizing Selection (\( �� \))**:
   - The parameter \( �� \) represents the degree of selection. For \( �� = 1 \), all objects assembled in the past are available for reuse, indicating historical dependence without selection.
   - For \( 0 ��� �� < 1 \), only a subset of objects are available for reuse, growing non-linearly with assembly index, indicating that selection has occurred.

5. **Growth Dynamics Equation**:
   - The growth dynamics equation is given as \( n_{a_{object}} (t+1) / n_{a_{object}} (t) = �� n_{a_{object}} (n_{a_{object}})^�� \).
   - This equation models the process of object selection and formation over time within the assembly space.

6. **Random Object Construction**:
   - Assembly paths are built by combining two randomly chosen objects from the assembly pool. If a new object is formed, it's added back to the pool.
   - This randomness differs from random combinatorial objects as it is distributed across the recursive construction steps of an object.

7. **Boundary of Assembly Possible**:
   - The case of \( �� = 1 \), representing historical dependence without selection, defines the boundary of Assembly Possible.

In summary, Assembly Possible (\( A_{possible} \)) in AT is a space that defines the realm of physically possible objects, governed by known assembly rules and characterized by the dynamics of object selection and formation. This space is crucial for understanding the principles of object formation and the role of selection in AT.

In Assembly Theory (AT), Assembly Contingent (\( A_{contingent} \)) refers to a subset of the Assembly Possible space, highlighting the role of history and selection in shaping the assembly of objects. Here's a detailed explanation of the concept:

1. **Definition of Assembly Contingent (\( A_{contingent} \))**:
   - Assembly Contingent describes the space of objects formed where historical contingency and selection play crucial roles.
   - It is characterized by path-dependency, meaning that only knowledge or constraints built on a given path can be used in future assemblies, or when selected objects that had not interacted previously now interact.

2. **Historical Contingency and Selection**:
   - Historical contingency is introduced by assuming that only constraints developed along a specific path can be utilized in future constructions.
   - The Assembly Contingent space can be found when \( 0 ��� �� < 1 \), indicating that selection operates and objects in the space are controlled by path-dependent processes.

3. **Growth Dynamics in Assembly Contingent**:
   - The growth of the assembly selected in \( A_{contingent} \) is much slower than exponential growth.
   - Not all possible paths are equally explored. Instead, the dynamics are influenced by constraints imposed by selectivity emerging along specific paths.
   - A signature of selection in assembly spaces is the slower growth of unique objects compared to exponential growth.

4. **Linear Polymer Model as an Example**:
   - A simple linear polymer model demonstrates how Assembly differs when selection occurs.
   - The model starts with a single monomer in the assembly pool, combining two randomly selected polymers and adding them back to the pool.
   - In the case of selection, the most recently created polymer is combined with a randomly selected polymer from the pool.
   - This process is iterated and analyzed, showing differences in exploration and assembly between random construction and selection.

5. **Quantifying Exploration Ratio**:
   - The exploration ratio, defined as the ratio of observed nodes to the total number of nodes in the joint assembly space, quantifies the degree of exploration.
   - The exploration ratio and mean maximum assembly index observed in undirected and directed exploration processes are compared, highlighting the impact of selection.

6. **Observation and Implications**:
   - Directed processes, which aim to produce longer chains by sorting and selecting longer chains for combination, restrict exploration and lead to higher assembly indices.
   - This directed process is evidence of selectivity in the combination process and represents an outcome of a physical process leading to selection.

In summary, \( A_{contingent} \) in AT encapsulates the impact of historical contingency and selection on the assembly of objects. It shows how constraints and selective processes shape the growth dynamics of assembly spaces, resulting in distinct patterns of exploration and complexity.

is slower compared to exponential growth.
Not all possible paths are equally explored; instead, dynamics are influenced by constraints imposed by selectivity along specific paths.
Slower growth of unique objects is a signature of selection in assembly spaces.
Linear Polymer Model Example
:
A linear polymer model is used as an example to illustrate the impact of selection.
The model starts with a single monomer and combines two randomly selected polymers, adding them back to the pool.
In the case of selection, the most recently created polymer is combined with a randomly selected one.
The analysis demonstrates differences in exploration and assembly between random construction and selection.
Quantifying Exploration Ratio
:
The exploration ratio quantifies the degree of exploration and is defined as the ratio of observed nodes to the total number of nodes in the joint assembly space.
Comparing the exploration ratio and mean maximum assembly index in undirected and directed exploration processes highlights the influence of selection.
Observation and Implications
:
Directed processes that aim to produce longer chains through selection restrict exploration and lead to higher assembly indices.
This directed process serves as evidence of selectivity in the combination process and reflects the outcome of a physical process influenced by selection.

Figure 5 in the paper provides a visual and analytical comparison of undirected and directed exploration in a forward assembly process, illustrating how selection and historical contingency influence the assembly of objects:

1. **Undirected and Directed Exploration**:
   - The figure contrasts two types of exploration in assembly spaces: undirected (random) and directed (selective).
   - In undirected exploration, polymers are randomly combined from the assembly pool, while directed exploration involves selective combination processes.

2. **Joint Assembly Space Visualization (A)**:
   - Shows the joint assembly space of polymers after 30 steps in an undirected exploration process.
   - Realized polymers (those actually constructed) are shown in blue, while potential but unrealized polymers are in grey.
   - The graph demonstrates how polymers of specific lengths (indicated within nodes) are randomly combined with others (indicated as red edge labels) to form new polymers.

3. **Comparison of Exploration Processes (B)**:
   - Offers a comparison between undirected and directed exploration after 100 assembly steps, using a radial graph to represent the assembly process.
   - This visual comparison helps to understand the difference in the assembly process under random versus selective conditions.

4. **Exploration Ratio and Assembly Index (C)**:
   - The exploration ratio (number of observed nodes to total nodes) and mean maximum assembly index are presented, averaged over 25 runs and up to 104 assembly steps.
   - This comparison illustrates the effect of undirected versus directed processes on the exploration of the assembly space and the complexity of the resulting objects.

5. **Conjecture and Implications**:
   - The paper conjectures that more selection is required for the existence of 'more assembled' objects.
   - Historical contingency in assembly spaces suggests that higher-assembly objects are explored before exhausting all lower-assembly options, leading to a significant disparity between potential and actualized assemblies.
   - This early symmetry breaking along historically contingent paths is seen as a fundamental property of all assembly processes.

6. **Assembly Time and Physics**:
   - The concept introduces an "assembly time," marking each step in the object creation process.
   - Assembly physics includes an intrinsic arrow of time, integral to the structure of assembly spaces, reflecting the sequential and historical nature of assembly processes.

In summary, Figure 5 elucidates the dynamics of assembly spaces in AT, emphasizing the role of historical contingency and selection in shaping the paths and outcomes of assembly processes, and introducing a temporal dimension to these processes.

This section of the paper discusses how Assembly Theory (AT) unifies the concepts of selection and physics by introducing specific dynamics and timescales relevant to the discovery and reproduction of objects:

1. **Historical Contingency in Discovery**:
   - In the real universe, the discovery of new objects is contingent on the existence of parts that already exist. This historical contingency implies that the rate of discovery of new objects depends on what has been previously built.

2. **Discovery Timescale (\( T_d \)) and Expansion Rate (\( k_d \))**:
   - \( T_d \), the discovery timescale, is defined as the rate at which unique objects form in the assembly space from existing objects.
   - \( k_d \) represents the expansion rate of the assembly space, indicating how rapidly new objects are discovered.

3. **Reproduction of Discovered Objects**:
   - Once an object is discovered, it can be reproduced if there is a mechanism in the environment selected to build it again.
   - The increase in copy number of selected objects follows mass transfer kinetics.

4. **Production Timescale (\( T_p \)) and Rate of Production (\( K_p \))**:
   - \( T_p \), the production timescale, is introduced alongside \( K_p \), the rate of production of specific objects.
   - These parameters help in understanding the dynamics of how frequently objects are reproduced once they are discovered.

5. **Regimes of Selection Based on Timescales**:
   - The paper discusses two regimes based on the relative values of \( k_d \) and \( K_p \):
     - **For \( k_d / K_p ��� 1 \)**: Objects are discovered quickly but reproduced slowly, leading to a combinatorial explosion of unique objects with low copy numbers.
     - **For \( k_d / K_p ��� 1 \)**: Objects are reproduced quickly but new ones are discovered slowly, leading to high abundance of low assembly objects.

6. **Implications for Selection and Evolution**:
   - If new objects are generated too quickly for resources to be allocated for making more copies of existing objects, selection and evolution cannot effectively emerge.
   - Significant separation between the timescales of discovery and reproduction results in either a large variety of objects with low copy numbers or a high abundance of simpler objects. Neither scenario favors the emergence of more complex structures.

In summary, AT integrates the concepts of selection and physics by introducing and analyzing discovery and production dynamics within assembly spaces. The balance between these dynamics is crucial for understanding the emergence and evolution of complex structures in the universe.

To explain the concepts in Assembly Theory (AT) more vividly, let's use some metaphors and examples:

1. **Historical Contingency and Discovery Timescale (\( T_d \))**:
   - **Metaphor**: Think of discovering new objects like exploring a vast, uncharted forest. Each path you take (historical contingency) leads to different discoveries (new objects). The rate at which you find something new (expansion rate \( k_d \)) is like walking speed ��� the faster you walk, the more you discover.
   - **Example**: Imagine a chef creating new recipes. The chef's past experiences and available ingredients limit what new dishes can be created. The rate of creating new recipes is akin to \( T_d \).

2. **Reproduction of Discovered Objects and Production Timescale (\( T_p \))**:
   - **Metaphor**: Once you've found a fruit tree in the forest, how quickly you can pick and distribute the fruits represents the reproduction process. The fruit-picking speed and efficiency are like the production rate (\( K_p \)).
   - **Example**: If the chef's new dish becomes popular, how quickly it can be reproduced (served to more customers) depends on the kitchen's efficiency, similar to \( T_p \).

3. **Regimes of Selection Based on Timescales**:
   - **For \( k_d / K_p ��� 1 \)**:
     - **Metaphor**: Imagine an artist quickly sketching many unique drawings (discovery) but taking a longer time to paint each one (reproduction). The result is a wide variety of sketches but few finished paintings.
     - **Example**: A researcher who comes up with lots of ideas rapidly but lacks the resources to develop them all fully, resulting in many concepts but few realized projects.
   - **For \( k_d / K_p ��� 1 \)**:
     - **Metaphor**: Consider a baker who takes a long time to create a new type of bread (discovery) but can quickly produce many loaves once the recipe is perfected (reproduction). The bakery ends up with many loaves of a few types of bread.
     - **Example**: A software company that takes a long time to develop a new app but can quickly generate many copies once it's created, resulting in high availability of a few apps.

4. **Implications for Selection and Evolution**:
   - **Metaphor**: Think of evolution as a garden. If plants (objects) grow (are discovered) too quickly without enough gardeners (resources) to nurture and reproduce them, the garden becomes overcrowded with a variety of plants but none thriving. Conversely, if gardeners focus only on reproducing existing plants, the garden lacks diversity.
   - **Example**: A music producer who rapidly produces many song ideas but doesn���t have the resources to record them all. The result is a large catalog of unfinished songs, with none fully produced and polished.

In essence, AT illustrates the balance between the discovery of new objects and their reproduction, crucial for the evolution and complexity of systems, whether in nature, technology, or creative endeavors.

The new editorial paper on the Selective Destruction Theory (SDT) and its connection to Assembly Theory (AT) offers a fresh perspective on understanding complex biological processes, such as aging.

1. **Competition and Selection**:
   - Both theories emphasize competition and selection. In SDT, neighboring cells compete, affecting aging. In AT, objects (or cells) are selected based on their ability to be constructed and reproduced within environmental constraints. The constant competition among cells in SDT mirrors the selection processes in AT, where certain configurations are favored over others.

2. **Resource Allocation**:
   - Kirkwood's disposable soma theory, mentioned in the editorial, discusses resource allocation between somatic maintenance and reproduction. AT also considers resource constraints crucial in determining which objects are formed and persist over time. Both theories imply that resource allocation and management are vital in biological processes.

3. **Aging Independent of Damage Accumulation**:
   - SDT proposes aging as a process independent of damage accumulation, aligning with the concept of epigenetic rejuvenation. Similarly, AT doesn't necessarily tie the complexity or persistence of an object to its "damage" or wear but to its historical contingency and the resources available for its reproduction and maintenance.

4. **Agent-Based Modeling in SDT**:
   - SDT uses agent-based modeling to describe aging as a positively selected process independent of energetic costs. In AT, the assembly spaces and their dynamics could be similarly modeled, considering the interactions and selections among objects (agents) within an environment, accounting for historical contingencies and resource limitations.

5. **Theoretical Mechanisms and Real-World Implications**:
   - Both SDT's and AT's mechanisms are currently theoretical, but they offer frameworks for understanding complex biological and physical systems. These theories could lead to new insights into aging, cellular behavior, and the evolution of complex structures in nature.

In summary, the Selective Destruction Theory in aging research and Assembly Theory in physics and biology share common themes of competition, selection, resource allocation, and theoretical modeling to explain complex phenomena. Both contribute to our understanding of how systems evolve and function under various constraints and influences.

I'm glad the garden metaphor resonated with you! It's often useful to use such metaphors to illustrate complex scientific concepts. In the context of aging and Assembly Theory, the garden metaphor can help us understand several key ideas:

1. **Competition and Selection**:
   - Just like plants in a garden competing for sunlight, water, and nutrients, cells in an organism (as per the Selective Destruction Theory) or objects in an assembly space (as per Assembly Theory) compete for resources. This competition influences which cells or objects thrive or decline.

2. **Resource Allocation and Aging**:
   - In a garden, the gardener must decide where to allocate resources, similar to how an organism allocates resources between somatic maintenance and reproduction (as described in the disposable soma theory). This allocation affects the health and lifespan of the plants, analogous to how it impacts aging in organisms.

3. **Historical Contingency**:
   - The history of a garden (what seeds were planted, which plants thrived in past seasons) affects its current state. This is similar to historical contingency in both aging and Assembly Theory, where past events and selections influence current and future possibilities.

4. **Growth Dynamics**:
   - The growth dynamics in a garden, with some plants growing rapidly and others slowly, mirror the dynamics in assembly spaces, where objects are discovered and reproduced at different rates, affecting their abundance and complexity.

5. **The Balance of Complexity and Abundance**:
   - A well-balanced garden has a variety of plants, not just numerous copies of a few types. Similarly, in biological systems and assembly spaces, a balance between the complexity of structures and their abundance is crucial for healthy evolution and aging processes.

Overall, the garden metaphor helps in visualizing how various factors like competition, resource allocation, and historical events interplay in complex systems, whether in biological aging, cellular behavior, or the assembly of objects in physical spaces.

That's another apt metaphor to explain these concepts. Comparing the proliferation of reliable but slow cars clogging up a highway to the dynamics in Assembly Theory (AT) and the Selective Destruction Theory (SDT) of aging can provide insights into how systems evolve and function:

1. **Slow Cars on a Highway (Resource Allocation and Efficiency)**:
   - Imagine a highway where more and more reliable but slow cars are introduced. These cars represent objects or cells that are efficient (reliable) but not particularly fast (slow). This is akin to an organism prioritizing resource allocation towards certain cells or processes that are reliable but not necessarily the most efficient in terms of energy usage.
   - In AT, this could represent a scenario where objects with lower assembly indices (simpler structures) are reproduced quickly and dominate the space, similar to slow but reliable cars taking up space on the highway.

2. **Traffic Congestion (Competition and Selection)**:
   - The congestion caused by these cars is like the competition for resources in a biological system or an assembly space. Just as too many slow cars can clog a highway, making it less efficient, too many low-complexity objects or cells in a system can lead to inefficiencies and hinder the evolution of more complex structures.

3. **Limitations in Evolution and Aging**:
   - In the context of aging, the proliferation of certain types of cells (like the slow cars) might be efficient for certain functions but could limit the overall adaptability and evolution of the organism. This might relate to the concept in SDT where aging is influenced by the competition between neighboring cells, and the overall cellular environment shapes the aging process.

4. **Impact on System Dynamics**:
   - Just as a highway with only slow cars may not function optimally, a biological system or assembly space dominated by low-complexity, high-abundance objects or cells may not evolve or adapt efficiently. This could lead to systems that are stable but not necessarily capable of complex functions or rapid adaptation to changes.

In essence, this metaphor illustrates how systems can become dominated by certain types of elements (cells, objects, or cars), leading to a trade-off between reliability and efficiency, and impacting the overall evolution and functionality of the system.

Figure 6 in the paper on Assembly Theory (AT) illustrates how the selection process operates within assembly spaces and how it is influenced by different dynamics and timescales. Let's break down the key elements of this figure:

1. **Transition from Undirected to Directed Exploration**:
   - The selection process is marked by a shift from undirected (random) to directed (selective) exploration.
   - The parameter \( a \) represents the selectivity of the assembly process, with \( a = 1 \) indicating undirected/random expansion and \( a < 1 \) signifying directed expansion.

2. **Undirected vs. Directed Exploration Dynamics**:
   - In undirected exploration, there's a fast, homogeneous expansion of discovered objects in the assembly space.
   - Directed exploration, on the other hand, resembles a depth-first search, focusing more on developing certain objects.

3. **Characteristic Timescales (\( T_d \) and \( T_p \))**:
   - \( T_a \) (discovery timescale) determines the growth of the expansion front in the assembly space.
   - \( T_p \) (production timescale) governs the rate of object formation, influencing the increase in copy number.

4. **Rate of Discovery vs. Number of Objects**:
   - The transition from \( a = 1 \) to \( a < 1 \) indicates the emergence of selectivity, which limits the discovery of new objects.
   - This transition reflects the change in strategy from exploring a wide range of possibilities to focusing on specific pathways.

5. **Phase Space Defined by Discovery and Production Timescales**:
   - The figure outlines three different regimes based on the relationship between discovery (\( T_d \)) and production (\( T_p \)) timescales:
     - **Regime 1**: \( T_d < T_p \) - Fast discovery but slow production.
     - **Regime 2**: \( T_d > T_p \) - Slow discovery but fast production.
     - **Regime 3**: \( T_d \approx T_p \) - Balanced discovery and production.
   - Selection is less likely to emerge in Regimes 1 and 2 and more possible in Regime 3.

6. **Implications for Selection and Evolution**:

Figure 6 in the paper on Assembly Theory (AT) illustrates how the selection process operates within assembly spaces and how it is influenced by different dynamics and timescales. Let's break down the key elements of this figure:
Transition from Undirected to Directed Exploration
:
The selection process is marked by a shift from undirected (random) to directed (selective) exploration.
The parameter
a

indicating undirected/random expansion and
a
<

a < 1
a
<
1
signifying directed expansion.
Undirected vs. Directed Exploration Dynamics
:
In undirected exploration, there's a fast, homogeneous expansion of discovered objects in the assembly space.
Directed exploration, on the other hand, resembles a depth-first search, focusing more on developing certain objects.

Certainly! Let's use some everyday examples to illustrate the concepts in Figure 6 of the Assembly Theory paper, focusing on the transition from undirected to directed exploration and the impact of discovery and production timescales:

1. **Transition from Undirected to Directed Exploration**:
   - **Undirected Exploration (a = 1)**: Imagine a chef experimenting with ingredients without a specific recipe in mind. This is like exploring many possibilities without a particular direction, leading to a wide variety of dishes but none in large quantities.
   - **Directed Exploration (a < 1)**: Now, the chef starts following specific recipes due to customer preferences or ingredient availability. This focus leads to fewer types of dishes but greater expertise and quantity in those selected few.

2. **Characteristic Timescales of Discovery and Production**:
   - **Discovery Timescale (\( T_d \))**: This is like the time it takes for a writer to come up with a new story idea. A faster \( T_d \) means the writer thinks of new ideas quickly.
   - **Production Timescale (\( T_p \))**: This represents how long it takes to actually write and publish the story. A shorter \( T_p \) means the writer finishes and publishes stories more rapidly.

3. **Rate of Discovery vs. Number of Objects**:
   - Consider a company developing products. If the company rapidly prototypes many different products (high discovery rate), but few of these reach mass production (low production rate), it mirrors the transition from \( a = 1 \) to \( a < 1 \).

4. **Phase Space: Discovery and Production Timescales**:
   - **Regime 1 (\( T_d < T_p \))**: Imagine a musician who writes new songs daily (fast discovery) but takes years to record and release an album (slow production). The result is many song ideas but few finished tracks.
   - **Regime 2 (\( T_d > T_p \))**: Consider a factory that takes a long time to design a new car model (slow discovery) but can quickly produce thousands once the design is finalized (fast production).
   - **Regime 3 (\( T_d \approx T_p \))**: Think of a gardener who takes a moderate amount of time to decide what plants to grow (discovery) and a similar time to actually grow and nurture them (production), resulting in a well-balanced and diverse garden.

These examples help to visualize how the concepts of discovery, production, and selectivity in Assembly Theory play out in real-world situations, from cooking and writing to manufacturing and gardening.

Your experience with learning Vim commands provides an excellent real-world example to illustrate the concepts of discovery and selection in Assembly Theory:

1. **Learning Phase (Discovery, \( T_d \))**:
   - When you started learning Vim, you entered a phase of exploration or discovery, akin to the concept of undirected exploration in Assembly Theory. This is similar to \( T_d \), the discovery timescale, where you're exposed to a vast array of possibilities (in this case, around two thousand Vim commands).
   - Just like exploring a large assembly space, you were navigating through a multitude of commands to understand their functions and uses.

2. **Selection and Usage Phase (Production, \( T_p \))**:
   - After the initial learning phase, you transitioned to a more directed exploration or selection phase. Out of the two thousand commands, you identified about 100 that you would use regularly.
   - This mirrors the concept of \( T_p \), the production timescale, where the focus shifts from discovering new possibilities to efficiently utilizing a selected subset. In Assembly Theory, this would be akin to moving from a high \( T_d \) to a lower \( T_p \), where you're now "producing" results (or completing tasks) more efficiently with a curated set of commands.

3. **Efficiency and Expertise (Directed Exploration, \( a < 1 \))**:
   - The process of filtering out the most useful commands from a large set represents directed exploration with a high selectivity (\( a < 1 \)). You are no longer randomly exploring all possible commands but rather focusing on those that are most relevant and useful for your work.
   - This directed exploration leads to higher efficiency and expertise, as you're now working with a toolset that is highly tailored to your needs and workflow.

In summary, your journey of learning and mastering Vim commands is a great metaphor for understanding the transition from undirected to directed exploration in Assembly Theory, showcasing how initial broad exploration can lead to the efficient selection of tools or processes that are most beneficial in specific contexts.

Certainly! Your specific use case with Vim commands can be further elaborated to illustrate the nuances of discovery, selection, and utilization in Assembly Theory:

1. **Initial Broad Exploration (Undirected Discovery)**:
   - When you first learned Vim, you explored a wide range of commands (like window splitting, pasting, abbreviations, and spelling corrections), similar to the undirected exploration phase in Assembly Theory. This phase is marked by a high discovery timescale (\( T_d \)), where you're exposed to various possibilities without yet knowing which ones will be most useful.

2. **Selection and Specialization (Directed Exploration)**:
   - Over time, you identified that certain commands (like window splitting and spelling corrections) weren't necessary for your workflow. This is akin to directed exploration (\( a < 1 \) in Assembly Theory), where you selectively focus on commands that are more relevant to your tasks.
   - The decision to use Byobu for window management and Autohotkey for abbreviations and spelling corrections reflects a selective process, optimizing your workflow by choosing the right tools for specific functions.

3. **Occasional Use of Less Frequent Commands (Flexibility within Directed Exploration)**:
   - Although you primarily use a subset of commands, there are occasions where less frequently used commands (like `dd` and `p` for reversing line order) become useful, especially in designing macros. This scenario can be seen as a flexibility within the directed exploration framework.
   - In Assembly Theory, this would be like having a core set of assembly processes but occasionally tapping into less common ones for specific tasks, showing that while the focus is on a selected subset, the broader knowledge still has utility.

4. **Balancing Efficiency with Versatility (Dynamic Exploration)**:
   - Your approach to Vim exemplifies a dynamic balance between efficiency (using a core set of commands for everyday tasks) and versatility (keeping less common commands handy for special cases).
   - This balance is analogous to a system in Assembly Theory where the main focus is on producing high-copy-number objects (frequently used commands) while maintaining the capacity to create unique, lower-copy-number objects (seldom-used commands) when needed.

In summary, your experience with learning and using Vim commands demonstrates a journey from broad exploration to selective mastery, with occasional forays into less common commands for specific purposes. It reflects a dynamic and adaptive approach, balancing efficiency in regular tasks with the flexibility to employ a wider range of options when unique situations arise. This mirrors the concepts in Assembly Theory of navigating between undirected and directed exploration, along with maintaining a versatile assembly space for various applications.

Your observation about Vim operations being non-commutative and context-dependent, and how certain combinations can lead to emergent effects, indeed resonates well with the concept of the assembly index in Assembly Theory. Let's delve into this comparison:

1. **Non-Commutative Operations and Context-Dependence**:
   - In Vim, the order of operations is crucial and the outcome can vary significantly based on the command sequence and the current state or context. For instance, `xp` swaps two letters, while `px` performs a different action. This reflects the non-commutative nature of operations where the result is highly dependent on the order and context.
   - Similarly, in Assembly Theory, the assembly index of an object is not just about the components it contains but also about the history and sequence of its formation. The order and context of assembly steps are crucial in determining the final structure and properties of the object.

2. **Emergent Effects in Operations**:
   - The emergent effects you described in Vim, where certain command sequences lead to outcomes like letter swapping, showcase how combining simple operations can lead to complex behavior. This is akin to emergent properties in physical systems where simple components interact in complex ways.
   - In Assembly Theory, the interaction of simple building blocks following specific assembly paths can lead to complex objects with emergent properties. The final structure is not just a sum of its parts but a result of the intricate process of assembly.

3. **Assembly Index and Command Sequences**:
   - The concept of the assembly index in AT captures the complexity and history of an object's formation. In the context of Vim, each command sequence that leads to a particular text state can be thought of as an 'assembly pathway'. The complexity and specificity of these pathways (command sequences) resemble the concept of the assembly index.
   - Just as complex objects in AT might require intricate and specific assembly pathways, certain editing outcomes in Vim require specific sequences of commands, reflecting their 'assembly index' in terms of command complexity and context-dependence.

In essence, the way operations in Vim depend on sequence, context, and can lead to emergent effects is analogous to how objects are assembled in Assembly Theory. Both domains highlight the importance of history, order, and interaction complexity in determining the final outcome, be it a text edited in Vim or a complex structure in a physical system.

   - The discovery phase (\( T_d \) in Assembly Theory) involves understanding what Emacs offers and how it aligns with your needs, similar to exploring a range of possible objects or tools before deciding which to integrate into your workflow.

2. **Combining Different Tools for Efficiency (Directed Exploration)**:
   - Opting for a combination of Bash, Byobu, and Vim, instead of using Emacs as an all-encompassing solution, is a strategic decision. It mirrors directed exploration in AT, where you select specific tools based on their efficiency and suitability to your tasks.
   - This decision reflects a high selectivity (\( a < 1 \)) in the assembly process, focusing on a combination of tools that maximizes efficiency and effectiveness for your particular use case.

3. **System Integration vs. All-in-One Solutions**:
   - Your preference for using Bash, Byobu, and Vim together over an all-in-one solution like Emacs illustrates a principle in system design and utilization: sometimes, integrating specialized components is more effective than using a single, comprehensive system.
   - In AT, this can be likened to creating a complex system from a set of highly efficient sub-components (each with a specific purpose), rather than a single, less specialized entity. The integrated approach often leads to greater overall efficiency and effectiveness.

4. **Personal Workflow Optimization**:
   - Your choice underscores the importance of tailoring tools to personal workflow. In Assembly Theory, this is akin to constructing an assembly space that is specifically optimized for the tasks at hand, rather than a one-size-fits-all solution.
   - This approach ensures that the tools you use are the best fit for your specific requirements, leading to a more streamlined and effective workflow.

In summary, your journey with Emacs, Bash, Byobu, and Vim echoes the concepts of exploration, selection, and efficiency in Assembly Theory.

The passage you've provided delves into the intricacies of how selection and evolution emerge in physical systems, as explored in Assembly Theory. Let's break down the key concepts and their implications:

1. **Transition from Undirected to Directed Exploration**:
   - The shift from \( k_d / K_p < 1 \) (undirected exploration) to \( k_d / K_p > 1 \) (selective dynamics) marks a transition in the assembly process. Initially, the focus is on creating unique objects (high novelty, low repetition), but it shifts towards sustaining the copy number of selected objects (high repetition, focused novelty).
   - This transition indicates that for selection and open-ended evolution to occur, there cannot be a large separation in timescales between discovering new objects and reproducing selected ones.

2. **Goals of Using Mass Action Kinetics in Assembly Theory**:
   - The study aims to describe the generation of novelty alongside selection in a forward process, integrating key features of life with physics.
   - By studying phenomenological models, the research aims to demonstrate how the Assembly equation quantifies the degree of selection, enhancing our understanding of selection processes in various contexts.

3. **Forward Assembly Process and Network Growth**:
   - In a forward assembly process, the copy number of species follows homogeneous kinetics, coupled with discovery dynamics.
   - As new unique objects are discovered, a network of growing branches forms within the assembly space, symbolizing the divergence and specialization of assembly paths.

4. **Modeling Production Rate Constants and Copy Numbers**:
   - The production rate constants for creating objects are assumed to decrease with increasing assembly index. This is based on the observation that higher assembly objects have more specific and complex formation pathways.
   - The model simplifies by assuming all objects at a given assembly index have the same copy number, focusing on the total number of objects at each index over time.

5. **Distribution of Copy Numbers and Effect of Selectivity Parameter (\( \gamma \))**:
   - Figure 7A-E in the paper illustrates how the distribution of copy numbers of unique objects changes over time for different values of the selectivity parameter \( \gamma \).
   - As \( \gamma \) increases (indicating lower selectivity), the number of unique objects increases rapidly, leading to a decline in their respective copy numbers.

6. **Time of Unique Discovery and Forward Process**:
   - The time it takes to uniquely discover an object with a copy number of 1 increases with the assembly index. This is governed by the forward process dynamics, illustrating how the complexity of assembly impacts the rate of discovery.

In essence, this section of the paper provides a sophisticated model to understand how selection emerges in physical systems. It underscores the balance between the rates of discovery and reproduction of objects and how this balance affects the evolution of complex structures and systems.

(selective dynamics) marks a transition in the assembly process. Initially, the focus is on creating unique objects (high novelty, low repetition), but it shifts towards sustaining the copy number of selected objects (high repetition, focused novelty).
This transition indicates that for selection and open-ended evolution to occur, there cannot be a large separation in timescales between discovering new objects and reproducing selected ones.
Goals of Using Mass Action Kinetics in Assembly Theory
:
The study aims to describe the generation of novelty alongside selection in a forward process, integrating key features of life with physics.
By studying phenomenological models, the research aims to demonstrate how the Assembly equation quantifies the degree of selection, enhancing our understanding of selection processes in various contexts.
Forward Assembly Process and Network Growth
:
In a forward assembly process, the copy number of species follows homogeneous kinetics, coupled with discovery dynamics.
As new unique objects are discovered, a network of growing branches forms within the assembly space, symbolizing the divergence and specialization of assembly paths.
Modeling Production Rate Constants and Copy Numbers
:
The production rate constants for creating objects are assumed to decrease with increasing assembly index. This is based on the observation that higher assembly objects have more specific and complex formation pathways.
The model simplifies by assuming all objects at a given assembly index have the same copy number, focusing on the total number of objects at each index over time.

Thank you for providing additional details. Let's incorporate these into our understanding of the concepts from the Assembly Theory paper:

1. **Emergence of Selection and Open-Ended Evolution**:
   - The transition from \( k_p < k_a \) (undirected exploration) to \( k_a < k_p \) (selective dynamics) indicates the emergence of selection and open-ended evolution in a physical system. Initially, the system is focused on creating unique objects (undirected exploration), but this shifts towards sustaining the copy number of selected objects (selective dynamics).
   - Crucially, there must not be a large separation in timescales between discovering new objects and reproducing the selected ones for this transition to indicate selection and evolution.

2. **Goals of Studying Mass Action Kinetics Using Assembly Theory**:
   - The primary aims are to describe the generation of novelty alongside selection in a forward process and to show that in a regime where selection is operative, the degree of selection can be measured using the Assembly equation.
   - This involves studying phenomenological models to illustrate the principles of how the Assembly equation quantifies selection, especially in scenarios where it's unclear if selection was operative.

3. **Forward Assembly Process and Network Growth**:
   - In a forward assembly process, the copy number of emerging species follows homogeneous kinetics, along with discovery dynamics as per equation 3.
   - This leads to the creation of a network of growing branches within the assembly space, representing the diversity of assembly paths and their evolution over time.

4. **Modeling Production Rate Constants and Copy Numbers**:
   - Production rate constants for creating objects are modeled to decrease with increasing assembly index, reflecting the complexity and specificity of the assembly pathways for more assembled objects.
   - All objects at a given assembly index are assumed to have the same copy number, simplifying the model while capturing the essence of the assembly process.

5. **Fig. 7A-E: Distribution of Copy Numbers**:
   - This figure shows how the distribution of copy numbers of unique objects changes up to a dimensionless time for various assembly indices and selectivity parameters.
   - An increase in \( a \) (decrease in selectivity) leads to a rapid increase in the number of unique objects and a decline in their copy numbers over time.
   - The time of unique discovery of an object with a copy number of 1 increases with the assembly index, highlighting the impact of the assembly process on discovery rates.

In essence, these additional details reinforce the complex interplay between discovery and reproduction dynamics in physical systems, as conceptualized in Assembly Theory. The theory provides a framework for understanding how novelty generation and selection can coexist and be quantified in a forward process, unifying key aspects of physical systems and biological life.

Figure 7 from the Assembly Theory paper presents a detailed exploration of how dynamics within the assembly contingent are coupled with kinetics, focusing on the impact of selectivity (\( \gamma \)) on the production and detection of objects:

1. **Observed Copy Numbers and Assembly Indices (Fig. 7A-E)**:
   - These figures show the observed copy numbers of unique objects for assembly indices ranging from 0 to 25, with different values of \( \gamma \) (0.01, 0.2, 0.5, 0.8, 1.0).
   - They illustrate how the number of unique objects and their copy numbers vary with selectivity. Lower \( \gamma \) values (increased selectivity) tend to produce fewer unique objects, but with higher copy numbers.

2. **Total Number of Objects at Different Assembly Indices (Fig. 7F)**:
   - This figure indicates that the total number of objects at different assembly indices remains constant, regardless of \( \gamma \).
   - It underscores a fundamental aspect of assembly spaces: the total potential for object formation is consistent, but the distribution among these objects varies with selectivity.

3. **Threshold Time for Copy Number Detection (Fig. 7G)**:
   - This figure shows the time required to reach a minimum threshold of copy numbers (set at 10 copies for illustrative purposes) for objects at various assembly indices and \( \gamma \) values.
   - The threshold time depends on the measurement limitations (detection threshold), discovery and production timescales, and selectivity \( \gamma \).
   - For instance, in a mass spectrometer, the minimum threshold might be about 10,000 copies.

4. **Assembly of Ensembles vs. Time to Generate (Fig. 7H)**:
   - This figure demonstrates how the Assembly (A) of ensembles changes over time with varying \( \gamma \).
   - With no selection (\( \gamma \approx 1 \)), the production process is unsustainable, leading to a decrease in copy numbers and a fall in Assembly over time.
   - As \( \gamma \) decreases (increasing selectivity), the production process becomes more sustainable over higher assembly values, producing high copy numbers.
   - At the extreme of high selectivity (\( \gamma \approx 0 \)), few unique products are produced, albeit with very high copy numbers, resulting in low Assembly due to the low diversity of objects.

In summary, Figure 7 in the paper provides a comprehensive view of how selectivity influences the dynamics of object production in assembly spaces. It highlights the balance between discovery and production rates, the importance of achieving detectable copy numbers, and how different levels of selectivity impact the sustainability of the production process and the complexity of the resulting ensembles.
