Abstract.Unphysical equations of state result from the unrestricted use of the Synge 
G-trick of running the Einstein i eld equations backwards; in particular often this 
results in ��+p < 0 which implies negative inertial mass density, which does not occur 
in reality. This is the basis of some unphysical spacetime models including phantom 
energy in cosmology and traversable wormholes. 
The slogan ���ER = EPR��� appears to have no basis in physics and is merely the 
result of vague and unbridled speculation. Wormholes (the ���ER��� of the slogan) are 
a mathematical curiosity of general relativity that have little to no application to a 
description of our universe. In contrast quantum correlations (the ���EPR��� of the slogan) 
are a fundamental property of quantum mechanics that follows from the principle of 
superposition and is true regardless of the properties of gravity. 
The speculative line of thought that led to ���ER = EPR��� is part of a current vogue 
for anti-geometrical thinking that runs counter to (and threatens to erase) the great 
geometrical insights of the global structure program of general relativity.

1. Introduction 
J L Synge many years ago showed how a simple process (his ���G-Method���) could lead 
purely by dif f erentiation to exact solutions of the Einstein Field Equations (���EFE���). 
However this often leads to a negative inertial mass density, hence they are unphysical 
solutions of the EFE. In this paper we discuss how this occurs both in cosmology, and 
in proposals made by members of the string theory community for the existence of 
���traversable wormholes���. We argue they can neither come into existence by physically 
plausible processes, nor- even disregarding that problem- can they actually exist . 
There is a tension as regards gravitational theory between those who come from 
the general relativity side, who by and large approach the subject in a geometric fashion 
[Hawking and Ellis (2023)], and those who come from the particle physics/string theory 
side, who by and large treat it non-geometrically [Weinberg (1972)] except sometimes

This paper discusses the Synge G-Method and its implications in cosmology and proposals related to traversable wormholes. It highlights how the G-Method can lead to unphysical solutions of the Einstein Field Equations with negative inertial mass density. The paper also critiques the "ER = EPR" slogan, suggesting it lacks a basis in physics and emphasizes the importance of geometric thinking in gravitational theory.

for the use of some causal diamonds to represent causal relations. A key feature is that 
for the former, the ���force of gravity��� is a i ctitious force resulting from the ef f ects of the 
curvature of spacetime seen in an accelerated frame, so that while the idea of quantising 
the gravitational force may be a useful ef f ective theory, at a fundamental level it does 
not make sense. For the latter, gravity is just another force, to be quantised like all 
the others. This is a key aspect of the dif f erence between geometric and non-geometric 
approaches.

to cosmology; ��3, Wormholes in General Relativity; ��4, AdS/CFT, Wormholes and EPR;

2. The Synge Trick and Energy Conditions 
There are two quite dif f erent ways of solving EFE: the standard way, and the Synge 
G-Method (��2.1). The latter is very easy to do but often results in unphysical matter 
tensors, and violates stability conditions (��2.2). However it can be useful in inf l ationary 
contexts (��2.3), but can lead to problems with dark energy phenomenology (��2.4). 
2.1. Two ways of solving the EFE 
Many years ago, J. L. Synge [Synge (1961)] pointed out an inverse way of solving the 
the EFE Rab��� 
1 2Rgab 
+ ��gab= ��Tab, ��,c= 0,(1) 
where �� > 0 is the gravitational constant, with integrability condition 
(Rab��� 
1 2Rg ab);b = 0 ��� (T ab);b = 0.(2) 
These are usually solved by the following process, from right to left: 
��� Assume a specif i c form for the energy-momentum tensor Tab(a vacuum, perfect 
l uid, electromagnetic i eld, scalar i eld, and so on), 
��� Impose some symmetries on gab(xi) to represent an interesting physical context 
(a cosmological model, a black hole, a gravitational wave, and so on), possibly 
linearising about a space with exact symmetries, 
��� Calculate the Ricci tensor Rab(xi) and Ricci scalar R(xi) as a function of the metric 
gab(xi), its inverse gcd(xi), and their i rst and second derivatives, 
��� Substitute in (1) to obtain partial dif f erential equations (PDE) for the metric and 
any matter i elds. Also impose any additional PDE that the matter i elds themselves 
have to satisfy (e.g. Maxwell���s equations for the electromagnetic i eld). 
��� Solve those PDE for gab(xi) and any associated matter i elds. 
However one can proceed in the opposite manner, from left to right: 
��� Assume a specif i c spacetime geometry gab(xi),

This paper discusses two approaches to solving the Einstein Field Equations (EFE): the standard way and the Synge G-Method. The latter often leads to unphysical matter tensors and stability issues but can be useful in inflationary contexts. It also touches on the challenges of applying the Synge G-Method to dark energy phenomenology.
In the standard approach, EFE are typically solved by assuming a specific form for the energy-momentum tensor, imposing symmetries on the metric, calculating the Ricci tensor and scalar, and then solving partial differential equations for the metric and matter fields.
In contrast, the Synge G-Method works in the reverse order, starting with a specific spacetime geometry and deriving the energy-momentum tensor and matter field equations from it.
The paper covers various aspects, including the Synge Trick and Energy Conditions, wormholes in General Relativity, AdS/CFT, horizons, firewalls, and the distinction between geometric and non-geometric approaches.

Calculate the Ricci tensor Rab(xi) and Ricci scalar R(xi) from gab(xi), 
��� Substitute in the EFE (1) to determine Tab(xi). 
��� The solution {gab(xi),Tab(xi)} will automatically satisfy (2). 
This is the Synge G-method, a simple process that generates an exact solution of the 
EFE without the need to solve any partial dif f erential equations. 
Note that to apply the Synge G-method without any restrictions is to deprive the 
Einstein i eld equations of all content. To see why, consider the following analogy with 
Newton���s second law ~ 
F = m~ a. Pick any particle trajectory ~ x(t) and calculate �� 
~ x(t). 
Now assert that you have a solution to ~ 
F = m~ a where the force is given by m��~ 
x(t). 
Since this can be done with any trajectory, the statement ���I have a trajectory that is a 
solution of ~ 
F = m~ a ��� then has no more content than the statement ���I have a trajectory.��� 
Similarly, if one uses the Synge G-method without restriction, the statement ���let (M,gab) 
be a spacetime satisfying the Einstein i eld equations��� has no more content than the 
statement ���let (M,gab) be a spacetime.��� 
However, the Synge G-trick does become meaningful (and indeed quite useful) 
with the imposition of only a causality condition (like the presence of a Cauchy 
surface or the absence of closed timelike curves) and an energy condition (to be 
discussed below). Indeed it is the great triumph of the global structure program (see 
[Hawking and Ellis (2023)] and references therein) that powerful results can be obtained 
using only such mild restrictions. 
The main problem with the unrestricted G-method is that the stress-energy 
tensor Tab(xi) determined this way will in general not correspond to any known form 
of matter, thus it will be unphysical.Furthermore it will in general not satisfy 
the stability conditions that are required for a solution to be physically meaningful 
[Bishop and Ellis (2020)]. 
2.2. Energy conditions and stability conditions 
In many cases a ���perfect l uid��� description is used in general relativity, where the stress- 
energy tensor takes the form 
Tab= (�� + p)uaub+ pgab, ua= dxa/d��, uaua= ���1(3) 
where ��(xi) is the matter density, p(xi) its pressure in units where the speed of light 
c = 1, and �� is proper time along the l uid world line xa(��). 
In the case of a perfect l uid (3), the conservation equations (2) become the energy 
equation (4) and momentum equation (5): 
�� �� + (�� + p)�� = 0,(4) 
(�� + p)�� ua+ ���p = 0,(5) 
where �� := ua;ais the l uid expansion, �� ua:= ua;bubits relativistic acceleration, and 
���p := (gab+ uaub)p;bthe spatial gradient of the pressure [Ehlers (1993), Ellis (1971)].

The Synge G-Method is a simple process that generates exact solutions of the Einstein Field Equations (EFE) without solving partial differential equations. It involves the following steps:
Calculate the Ricci tensor Rab(xi) and Ricci scalar R(xi) from gab(xi).
Substitute these into the EFE (1) to determine Tab(xi).
The solution {gab(xi),Tab(xi)} automatically satisfies the integrability condition (2).
However, applying the Synge G-Method without any restrictions would render the Einstein field equations devoid of meaningful content. It is akin to asserting that you have a trajectory that is a solution of Newton's second law without specifying the force. Therefore, to make the Synge G-Method meaningful, certain conditions must be imposed, such as causality conditions and energy conditions.
The main issue with the unrestricted G-Method is that the stress-energy tensor Tab(xi) determined this way often does not correspond to any known form of matter and may not satisfy the stability conditions required for a physically meaningful solution.
In many cases in general relativity, a "perfect fluid" description is used, where the stress-energy tensor takes a specific form involving matter density (��), pressure (p), proper time (��), and other variables. The conservation equations for such a perfect fluid lead to energy and momentum equations that are essential for describing the behavior of matter in the context of general relativity.

The weak energy condition is that 
�� ��� 0, (�� + p) ��� 0.(6) 
No known matter violates (6). If it were violated, the inertial mass density would be 
negative: ��inert:= �� + p < 0 ��� p < 0(7) 
which leads to unphysical behaviour of two kinds. 
��� From (5), if you push the l uid to the left, it goes to the right, unlike any ordinary 
matter. If p = w�� where w is constant or almost constant, the speed of sound csis 
given by c2 
s = 
dp 
d�� = w [Ellis et al (2007)]. Then (6) can be rewritten as 
(1 + w)�� < 0 ��� 1 + c2 
s < 0.(8) 
Thus the speed of sound is imaginary and mechanical instability arises (perturbation 
gives exponential expansion or collapse rather than oscillations).Also runaway 
motion occurs [Bonnor (1989)].Thomas Gold suggested such runaway linear 
motion could be used in a perpetual motion machine if converted to circular 
motion by attaching positive and negative masses to the rim of a wheel 
([DeWitt-Morette and Rickles (2017)]:159), hence it cannot occur. 
This is to be distinguished from gravitational instability, which occurs whenever 
the active gravitational mass is positive: ��grav:= (�� + 3p) > 0. This is obeyed by 
all baryonic matter and plays a key role in structure formation in the universe, 
but can be violated by ef f ective scalar i elds, as in the inf l ationary era in the early 
universe [Peter and Uzan (2009), Ellis and Uzan (2017)] . 
��� From (4), if the l uid expands and ��inert< 0, the density goes up, not down, 
contrary to all experimental evidence for known matter, and the pressure has to 
become even more negative to preserve inequality (7). This unphysical behaviour 
results in the prediction of Sudden Singularities [Barrow (2004)]: the l uid density 
diverges in a i nite time as it expands. Nothing we know behaves like this. If it 
were true, you could in principle obtain an inf i nite amount of energy from such a 
l uid in a i nite time- which is unphysical [Ellis et al (2018)]. 
In summary: the standard method produces solutions of the EFE that correspond to 
the kind of matter we know exists. Use of the Synge G-method results in ���solutions��� 
that in general do not correspond to any kind of matter we have ever encountered, and 
arguably allow perpetual motion- that is, they represent unphysical behaviour. 
2.3. Inf l ationary potentials and dark energy phenomenology 
An interesting variant of the G-method is that when inf l ation takes places in cosmology 
[Peter and Uzan (2009), Ellis and Uzan (2017)], driven by a scalar i eld �� with potential 
V (��), one can choose an (almost) arbitrary scale factor a(t) and then run the EFE 
backwards to determine a potential V (��) that will lead to that scale factor a(t)

The weak energy condition (WEC) is an important criterion in physics, stating that the energy density (��) should always be greater than or equal to zero, and the sum of energy density and pressure (�� + p) should also be greater than or equal to zero. This condition is typically obeyed by all known forms of matter.
Violation of the WEC leads to unphysical behavior, including:
Imaginary Speed of Sound:
If the pressure (p) is negative (p < 0), it implies that the speed of sound (cs) is imaginary. This results in mechanical instability, where perturbations cause exponential expansion or collapse rather than oscillations. Such behavior is not observed in ordinary matter and is physically problematic.
Sudden Singularities:
If the energy density (��) becomes negative (��inert < 0) as the fluid expands, it leads to an increase in density, contrary to experimental evidence for known matter. This unphysical behavior predicts sudden singularities where the fluid density diverges in a finite time during expansion, which is not observed in the physical world.
In summary, the standard method of solving the Einstein Field Equations (EFE) produces solutions that correspond to known forms of matter, respecting the WEC. However, the use of the Synge G-Method often results in solutions that do not correspond to any known matter, potentially allowing for unphysical behavior.
In cosmology, when considering inflection potentials and dark energy phenomenology, the G-Method can be used to determine a potential (V(��)) for a scalar field (��) that drives inflation, given a chosen scale factor (a(t)). This allows for a flexible approach in cosmological modeling.
You
[Ellis and Madsen (1991)]. Indeed this is what is done in practice in many inf l ationary 
cosmology studies [Martin et al (2014)]. Such potentials will in general not be directly 
related to any deeper physical models: they are simply designed to give the desired 
dynamic result. They are simply a phenomenological i t of the ���matter��� potential V (��) 
as required to give the desired inf l ationary dynamics a(t). 
2.4. Dark energy equations of state 
Famously, the late time universe has been determined to be accelerating, where the scale 
factor a(t) obeys �� a(t) > 0 [Peter and Uzan (2009), Ellis and Uzan (2017)]. This might 
be due to a cosmological constant but many possibilities of ���dark energy��� are also being 
explored, with a phenomenogical equation of state w(t) def i ned by 
p(t) = w(t)��(t).(9) 
Here w(t) is to be determined from the observational relation rO(z(t)) between 
observed area distance rO(t) and redshift z(t) where t is the time of emission of light 
[Ellis (1971)]. This relation determines a(t) and hence, on using the EFE, p(t) and 
so w(t), and many investigations are under way to do this.These are examples of 
the Synge G-method: the logic is, rO(z(t)) ��� a(t) ��� w(t). Observational analyses 
usually include cases where w < ���1 (called phantom energy), that is ��inert< 0 
[Melchiorri et al (2003)],[Vazquez et al (2012)]).This runs into the same kind of 
stability issues as just discussed [Carroll et al (2003), Vikman (2004)]. In our view this 
domain of the parameter space for a(t) should be rejected as being unphysical. 
3. Wormholes in General Relativity 
Before delving into the exotic, implausible claims that have been recently made about 
wormholes, it is helpful to go over what general relativity has to say about wormholes. 
To begin, note that general relativity has an initial value formulation: that is we 
pick the initial conf i guration and the theory tells us how it evolves. But because general 
relativity is a geometric theory it has a degree of freedom not present in our other 
theories: the topology of space. In all our other theories the topology of space is R3. 
But in general relativity other topologies are allowed. In particular, the topology of space 
in the extended Schwarzschild spacetime is S2XR, that is there are two asymptotically 
l at spaces connected along a sphere. This is what is referred to as a ���wormhole���. 
Though we have referred to spatial topology as a ���degree of freedom��� it is so only 
in a very restricted sense: the topology of space remains whatever it was at the initial 
time, as shown in the Geroch no topology change theorem: In classical GR, no topology 
change can occur in the development of initial data on a spatial hypersurface without 
causal violations or a singularity occurring [Geroch (1967)]. An example is that the 
spatial topology of standard cosmological models cannot change [Ellis (1987)]. 
Thus we either live in a space of exotic topology or we don���t. In either case we have 
no power to change this. Nonetheless, one might think that if we did happen to live in

In the context of inflationary cosmology, researchers often employ the G-Method to determine potentials (V(��)) for scalar fields (��) that drive inflation. These potentials are not necessarily related to deeper physical models but are designed to produce the desired dynamic results for the expansion of the universe (a(t)). They are considered phenomenological and serve the purpose of achieving the desired inflationary dynamics.
In the study of dark energy, which is responsible for the late-time acceleration of the universe, a phenomenological equation of state is used. This equation relates the pressure (p) to the energy density (��) through w(t), where p(t) = w(t)��(t). Determining w(t) is crucial, and it is often derived from observational data related to the redshift and area distance of celestial objects. The Synge G-Method is applied to infer w(t) from these observational relations, and it includes cases where w(t) < -1, known as phantom energy. However, such cases can lead to stability issues and are considered potentially unphysical in some analyses.
Moving on to the topic of wormholes in General Relativity, it's essential to understand that general relativity allows for the possibility of space having different topologies. Wormholes, in this context, refer to configurations where space has a nontrivial topology, such as two asymptotically flat spaces connected along a sphere.
However, general relativity imposes constraints on the evolution of space's topology. The Geroch no-topology-change theorem states that in classical general relativity, no change in the topology of space can occur during the evolution of initial data on a spatial hypersurface without violating causality or leading to a singularity. This means that the topology of space remains constant from the initial time.
In summary, the topology of space in general relativity can be exotic, but it cannot change over time without violating fundamental principles. Whether we live in a space with exotic topology or not is beyond our control and remains a theoretical possibility.

Figure 1. Penrose diagram of the maximally extended Schwarzschild spacetime. The 
two asymptotically l at regions, I and II, share a common black hole interior 
a space with exotic topology, we might explore this space at our leisure and map out its 
topology. That we can���t do this is shown in two sets of results: Gannon���s theorem and 
the topological censorship theorems. Gannon���s theorem [Gannon (1975)] says that the 
evolution of initial data with exotic topology results in the production of a spacetime 
singularity. Thus, for example the initial data for the extended Schwarzschild spacetime 
evolves to the extended Schwarzschild spacetime:a black hole with a spacetime 
singularity in its interior. 
The topological censorship theorems [Friedman et al (1993)] say that no observer 
can visit more than one part of the exotic topology and thus that no observer will 
notice that they live in a space with exotic topology. Thus, for example in the extended 
Schwarzschild spacetime (Figure 1) observers either remain in asymptotically l at region 
I or remain in asymptotically l at region II, or fall into the black hole. Observers who 
remain in asymptotically l at region I have no contact with those in asymptotically l at 
region II and have no way of knowing that they are there. Or to put it another way, 
these observers have no way of knowing that the black hole in their space is really a 
wormhole. The only observable consequence of the exotic topology is that observers 
from the two regions can each jump into the black hole and brief l y meet each other on 
their way to being crushed by the spacetime singularity (and without any way to tell 
the people back home what happened).

The Penrose diagram shown in Figure 1 represents the maximally extended Schwarzschild spacetime, which describes a black hole. In this diagram:
Regions I and II are asymptotically flat regions.
The black hole interior is denoted as "i0i0."
"i-" and "i+" represent the past and future null infinities.
"I-" and "I+" represent the past and future timelike infinities.
The diagram illustrates the complex structure of this spacetime, where two asymptotically flat regions share a common black hole interior.
Regarding the idea of exploring a space with exotic topology, it's important to note two significant results:
Gannon's Theorem:
This theorem states that if initial data with exotic topology is evolved, it will result in the production of a spacetime singularity. For example, in the case of the extended Schwarzschild spacetime, the initial data evolves into a black hole with a spacetime singularity in its interior.
Topological Censorship Theorems:
These theorems assert that no observer can visit more than one part of the exotic topology. Therefore, observers will not be aware that they live in a space with exotic topology. In the case of the extended Schwarzschild spacetime, observers in regions I and II have no contact with each other and cannot detect the exotic topology. The only observable consequence is that observers from both regions can briefly meet each other when they enter the black hole on their way to the spacetime singularity.
In essence, these results imply that the exotic topology of spacetime, such as a wormhole, cannot be explored or observed directly by observers in different regions, and the meeting of such observers within a black hole remains a fleeting and uncommunicable event due to the presence of spacetime singularities.

4. AdS/CFT, Wormholes and EPR 
Following a paper by Maldacena and Susskind [Maldacena and Susskind (2013)], a 
huge literature has developed around the slogan ���ER = EPR��� linking ���Einstein-Rosen Bridges��� (ER: the idea of traversable wormholes [Einstein and Rosen (1935)]) on the one 
hand, and the idea of quantum entanglement following on the groundbreaking paper by 
Einstein, Podolsky, and Rosen (EPR: [Einstein et al (1935)]) on the other (the idea of 
quantum entanglement was also proposed by Schr�� odinger [Schr�� odinger (1935)]). It is 
often alleged that experimental demonstration of the existence of entanglement, as has 
been done, proves spacetime wormholes exist. It is even alleged that such wormholes 
have been created in a quantum computer, whose operation is based in entanglement. 
However traversable wormholes do not occur naturally in GR: the wormhole 
in the maximal Schwarzschild extension ([Hawking and Ellis (2023)]:154, see Fig.1) 
is non-traversable,as is also the case in the the maximal Reissner-Nordstr�� om 
([Hawking and Ellis (2023)]:158) and Kerr solution ([Hawking and Ellis (2023)]:165). 
The Weak Energy Condition is violated in the case of traversable wormholes 
[Friedman et al (1993)]- a result known as ���topological censorship���.Sure one can 
construct a traversable wormhole by choosing a suitable metric and using the Synge 
G-Method. The resulting spacetime will be non-physical, as it will violate the weak 
energy condition (6). 
Here we discuss, the claims made (��4.1), Can they come into existence? (��4.2), Can 
they exist? (��4.3), A simulation is not the thing (��4.4), and Is ER = EPR true? (��4.5). 
4.1. The claims made 
The paper [Maldacena and Susskind (2013)] (hereafter MS) considers two dif f erent 
wormhole spacetimes:(1) the Schwarzschild-anti-de Sitter spacetime,and (2) 
thespacetimeforblackholepaircreationbyamagneticf i eldtreatedin 
[Garf i nkle and Strominger (1991)]. 
In both cases these are non-traversable wormholes. That is, just as in the extended 
Schwarzschild spacetime, these are two spaces where their black holes share a common 
interior.Thus when MS consider signals sent from an observer in one space to an 
observer in the other space, these messages can only be received when the second 
observer jumps into the black hole. 
In both cases there are quantum correlations between the two sides of the wormhole 
spacetime, but in each case these correlations seem to have nothing to do with the fact 
that the spacetime contains a wormhole: In Schwarzschild-anti-de Sitter spacetime the 
wormhole is eternal and the quantum correlations are there simply because the vacuum 
state has quantum correlations. Or to put it another way, there are quantum correlations 
between the two halves of the wormhole for the same reason that there are quantum 
correlations between the two Rindler wedges in Minkowski spacetime. In the black hole 
pair creation case, the correlations are there because pair creation produces correlations: 
again nothing to do with the fact that there is a wormhole. 
Thus, in terms of their slogan ���ER=EPR��� up to that point MS had produced 
two examples of ER that also happened to be EPR, though not for any reason to do 
with the fact that they were ER. However, MS then went on to make (what even they

In the context of AdS/CFT (Anti-de Sitter/Conformal Field Theory) and the slogan "ER = EPR," there has been substantial discussion linking Einstein-Rosen Bridges (ER) to quantum entanglement (EPR). This connection was popularized by a paper by Maldacena and Susskind in 2013.
ER refers to the concept of traversable wormholes, originally proposed by Einstein and Rosen in 1935.
EPR refers to the idea of quantum entanglement, first discussed in a groundbreaking paper by Einstein, Podolsky, and Rosen in 1935.
It is sometimes claimed that experimental demonstrations of quantum entanglement prove the existence of spacetime wormholes. Furthermore, there are allegations that quantum computers, which operate based on entanglement, can create wormholes.
However, it's essential to clarify several points:
Traversable Wormholes in General Relativity (GR): Traversable wormholes, which allow for travel through spacetime shortcuts, do not naturally occur within the framework of General Relativity. The maximal Schwarzschild extension and other GR solutions do not provide traversable wormholes.
Weak Energy Condition Violation: Traversable wormholes would typically violate the Weak Energy Condition, as established by topological censorship theorems. While one can construct a metric using the Synge G-Method to create a traversable wormhole, the resulting spacetime would be non-physical because it violates the Weak Energy Condition.
4.1. The Claims Made:
The paper by Maldacena and Susskind considers wormhole spacetimes within the AdS/CFT framework. These wormholes are non-traversable, much like the extended Schwarzschild spacetime.
Quantum correlations are observed between different sides of the wormhole spacetime, but these correlations do not directly relate to the existence of the wormhole itself. In some cases, the correlations exist due to the nature of the vacuum state or pair creation, not the presence of a wormhole.
In summary, Maldacena and Susskind's work initially provided examples of wormholes (ER) that also happened to exhibit quantum entanglement (EPR), but the quantum correlations observed were not inherently linked to the wormholes themselves. The slogan "ER = EPR" has been a subject of debate and exploration in theoretical physics, but it does not necessarily imply that wormholes can be created or traversed as implied in popular science discussions.

considered at the time to be) the bold speculation that all cases of EPR (i.e. quantum 
correlations) are dual (in the sense of AdS/CFT) to ER (i.e. wormhole) spactimes. We 
will attempt to evaluate this claim in subsequent sections, but for now we note (as a 
tidbit of sociology of science) that in the years since 2013, ER=EPR seems to have gone 
from bold speculation to received wisdom without any solid arguments on its behalf 
having ever been of f ered. 
In contrast to MS, [Maldacena et al (2023)] consider traversable wormholes. The 
matter needed to hold these wormholes open necessarily violates the weak energy 
condition. Similarly the wormholes in [Gao et al (2017)] are also traversable and also 
involve matter that violates the weak energy condition. 
4.2. Can they come into existence? 
Do wormholes satisfy the conditions of Assembly Theory [Sharma et al (2023)]? That 
is, can they come into existence by an assembly process from pre-existing components ? 
Classically: no. In general relativity theory, not only can���t wormholes be assembled 
from existing components, but also they can���t be made by any process at all: either a 
wormhole has existed forever or it won���t exist at all. Certainly a wormhole exists in the 
maximally extended Schwarzschild solution ([Hawking and Ellis (2023)]:154), but that 
wormhole has existed for ever, and so does not relate to any process of astrophysical 
formation as understood either from the general relativity side [Penrose (1965)] or the 
astrophysical side [Begelman and Rees (2020)]. In realistic astrophysical processes, the 
potential wormhole that exists in the maximal Schwarschild solution as represented 
in the Kruskal diagram is cut of f by the infalling matter that creates the black hole 
([Hawking and Ellis (2023)]:300,302,309; [Hawking (1975)]:Figs 2,3). As for the original 
Einstein-Rosen paper [Einstein and Rosen (1935)], it involves modifying the EFE so it 
is not in fact a General Relativity solution. 
Quantum mechanically:maybe.Not through assembly but through quantum 
tunneling. The most reliable way to do calculations in quantum i eld theory is within 
a perturbative regime using Feynman diagrams. But quantum wormhole production is 
a non-perturbative quantum tunneling process calculated using instantons (as e.g. in 
[Garf i nkle and Strominger (1991)]). Here it is helpful to recall the limitations of such 
calculations: (1) since we don���t have a quantum theory of gravity we don���t know whether 
such a theory has a topology superselection rule (a quantum analog of the Geroch no 
topology change theorem) that would forbid the production of wormholes. (2) we don���t 
know for sure that the action of a Euclidean spacetime is the correct quantity to put 
in the quantum tunneling formula. We do this because it is analogous to what does 
work in (non-gravity) quantum theories where we know how to do calculations. (3) 
instanton calculations are semiclassical but also exponentially suppressed. This means 
that the wormholes produced need to be suf i ciently larger than the Planck mass that 
we can trust the calculation, but also suf i ciently small that their production rate is 
not negligibly tiny. That amounts to a wormhole mass of order say 10 Planck masses.

The idea that all cases of quantum entanglement (EPR) are dual to wormhole spacetimes (ER) was initially a bold speculation put forward by Maldacena and Susskind in 2013. However, over the years, this idea has gained popularity without strong supporting arguments.
In contrast to the original proposal by Maldacena and Susskind, there are cases where traversable wormholes are considered, but they involve matter that violates the weak energy condition. [Maldacena et al (2023)] and [Gao et al (2017)] explore such scenarios.
4.2. Can They Come into Existence?
In classical general relativity, wormholes cannot be assembled from pre-existing components. According to the theory, either a wormhole has existed forever or it won't exist at all. The maximally extended Schwarzschild solution does contain a wormhole, but it has existed forever and doesn't relate to astrophysical formation processes.
Realistic astrophysical processes, as understood from both the general relativity and astrophysical perspectives, do not typically lead to the formation of traversable wormholes. In many cases, the potential wormholes are cut off by the infalling matter that creates black holes.
Quantum mechanically, there is a possibility of wormhole production through quantum tunneling, rather than assembly. Calculations involving quantum field theory and instantons have been used to explore this concept. However, it's important to note several limitations in such calculations:
Lack of a Quantum Theory of Gravity: Without a complete quantum theory of gravity, it's uncertain whether there might be a topology superselection rule that would forbid the production of wormholes in a quantum context.
Correctness of Euclidean Spacetime Action: The use of the action of a Euclidean spacetime in quantum tunneling calculations is a useful analogy, but it's not confirmed whether this is the correct quantity to use in the context of quantum gravity.
Exponential Suppression: Instanton calculations are semiclassical and involve exponential suppression. This means that the production rate of wormholes depends on both their size and the accuracy of the calculation. The size of a produced wormhole would need to be within a specific range to be meaningful, typically on the order of 10 Planck masses.
In summary, the possibility of wormhole existence is still a subject of exploration and debate, with various theoretical and quantum mechanical considerations. While classical general relativity does not readily support their formation in astrophysical processes, quantum tunneling calculations suggest the potential for their creation, but with significant uncertainties and limitations.

Note that such a mass is much too small for any of the thought experiments envisioned 
in MS. So to perform any of their thought experiments they would need to i rst grow 
the wormhole to a much larger size. However, since their thought experiments involve 
observers sending messages ���suf i ciently early��� it is not clear which (if any) of those 
thought experiments are compatible with the wormhole production and growth process. 
4.3. Can they exist? 
So can they in fact exist? Insofar as traversable wormholes are solutions of the EFE, 
they are examples of use of the Synge G-method without restriction (��2.1). Vacuum 
wormhole EFE solutions exist (the Kruskal maximal extension of the vacuum spherically 
symmetric Schwarzschild solution is a wormhole) but are not traversable. Traversable 
wormholes are derived by assuming a traversable spherically symmetric geometry and 
then running the EFE backwards to determine whatever form of ���matter��� allows such 
solutions to exist. This does not imply that such ���matter��� is physically plausible, or 
can indeed exist in reality. [Morris and Thorne (1988)] acknowledge that traversable 
wormholes require unphysical matter, but press on anyhow suggesting they are a good 
tool for teaching general relativity. We strongly disagree. Maldacena et al present a 
traversable wormhole in four dimensions in [Maldacena et al (2023)], but it is based in 
the concept of charged massless fermions- which do not exist in physical reality and 
would be subject to the Coleman-Weinberg instability. We conjecture that if they were 
indeed to exist despite these considerations, they would be highly unstable and subject 
to singularities such as ���sudden future singularities��� [Barrow (2004)] in a i nite time 
because of the nature of the ���matter��� involved. 
4.4. A simulation is not the thing 
Recently some excitement was generated by a paper ���Traversable wormhole dynamics on 
a quantum processor��� [Jaf f eris et al (2022)], claiming that traversable wormholes had 
been created by a quantum computer. But this was actually a simulation of (a system 
speculated to be the dual of) such wormholes, not the thing itself, and the press release 
proclaiming this event generated much incredulity���. In any case a quantum computer 
generates a negligible gravitational i eld- not remotely large enough to create a black 
hole let alone any associated wormhole. 
For what it���s worth, we also note that computer simulations of classical non- 
traversable wormholes are done routinely and have been done for decades as a byproduct 
of a particular method for binary black hole simulations.[Campanelli et al (2005)] This 
is because this method (called the moving puncture method) chooses initial data where 
each of the black holes is connected to another space with initial data close to that of 
the extended Schwarzschild spacetime. For the region outside the black hole horizon, 
these simulations with wormholes are in complete agreement with other binary black hole simulations that don���t use wormhole initial data,[Pretorius (2005)] thus once again 
showing that in GR you can���t tell if there is a wormhole.

4.3. Can They Exist?
Traversable wormholes, while being solutions of the Einstein Field Equations (EFE), are derived by assuming a specific spherically symmetric geometry and then running the EFE backward to determine the required form of "matter" that would allow such solutions. This does not imply that the associated "matter" is physically plausible or can exist in reality. Traversable wormholes are known to require unphysical forms of matter, as acknowledged by [Morris and Thorne (1988)].
In a four-dimensional spacetime, [Maldacena et al (2023)] presented a traversable wormhole, but it was based on the concept of charged massless fermions, which do not exist in physical reality and would be subject to the Coleman-Weinberg instability. It is conjectured that even if such entities were to exist, they would likely be highly unstable and could lead to singularities in a finite time due to the nature of the associated "matter."
4.4. A Simulation Is Not the Thing
A recent paper by Jafferis et al. claimed that traversable wormholes had been created by a quantum computer. However, this was actually a simulation of such wormholes and not the physical creation of wormholes themselves. The press release around this claim generated skepticism because a quantum computer generates a negligible gravitational field, far from being capable of creating black holes or associated wormholes.
Furthermore, it is noted that computer simulations of classical non-traversable wormholes have been conducted for years as a byproduct of binary black hole simulations using methods like the moving puncture method. These simulations, including those with wormhole initial data, are in agreement with other simulations that do not use wormhole data, demonstrating that in the context of general relativity, it is challenging to distinguish the presence of a wormhole.

4.5. Is ER = EPR true? 
Theoriginal EPRpaper[Einstein et al (1935)] as wellas Schr�� odinger���sbasic 
paperonentanglement[Schr�� odinger (1935)]are calculationsinf l at spacetime, 
as are subsequent discussions of quantum entanglement [Horodecki et al (2009), 
Susskind and Friedman (2014)]. They have nothing whatsoever to do with wormholes, 
as denoted by ER. Experimental proofs that entanglement is possible over macroscopic 
scales, such as those that won the Nobel Prize in 2022, were also based on l at 
spacetime calculations.By contrast a standard wormhole solution of the EFE 
represents the maximal spacetime curvature that is possible- spacetime is curved 
so highly by matter that both closed trapped surfaces and event horizons exist 
[Penrose (1965), Hawking and Ellis (2023)]. These are manifestly completely dif f erent 
spacetime situations both geometrically and physically. Entanglement (EPR) is possible 
in both cases: it does not require a spacetime wormhole (ER). 
Thus despite what has been claimed vociferously by some, ER = EPR is not true in 
general, and in particular experimental verif i cation of quantum entanglement either in 
a laboratory or at macroscopic scales does not imply that spacetime wormholes exist.�� 
How a wormhole is def i ned in a quantum gravity context, where a spacetime metric may 
not be def i ned, is not even clear. 
5. Horizons, Firewalls, and Atlases 
Where did the the ER = EPR conjecture originate? To fully understand this we have 
to consider the phenomenon of black hole evaporation. We discuss here in turn, Atlases 
and local wavefunctions (��5.1), Is there a Black Hole Information Paradox? (��5.2), Black 
hole evaporation (��5.3), and The Firewall and ER = EPR (��5.4). 
5.1. Prolog: Atlases and local wavefunctions 
Preliminary to the subsequent discussion, we consider coordinate atlases and local 
wavefunctions. 
5.1.1. AtlasesA crucial feature enabling global studies in GR was the introduction of 
coordinate atlases {U��,xi ��} ([Hawking and Ellis (2023)]:��2.1). The coordinate system 
{xi ��} is valid only in the open set U��, and the relevant manifold M is covered by a 
union �����{U��} of such coordinate neighbourhoods. Dif f erent coordinate systems for the 
same manifold are related by dif f eomorphisms. Even as simple a space as the 2-sphere 
S2cannot be covered by a single coordinate system. 
�� One of us (GE) has been vociferously attacked on social media for denying that experimental proof 
of entanglement implies existence of spacetime wormholes.
5.1.2. Local Wave functionsA key puzzle for quantum theory is how a strictly linear 
theory- a wave function |��(t)i obeying the time-dependent i rst order Schr�� odinger 
equation [Laughlin and Pines (2000)] 
i~���|��(t)i 
���t 
= �� 
H|��(t)i(10) 
can underlie all the non-linear emergent dynamics we see around us all the time. It can 
be proposed that the same kind of analysis as in the GR case is needed: in complex 
systems, only local wave functions |��(t)i��exist, each valid in a local region {U��} small 
enough that the dynamics is still linear, enabling physics to be locally unitary everywhere 
but linked in non-linear ways to create complex outcomes [Ellis (2023)]. The implication 
is that in cases such as quantum cosmology or the emission of Hawking radiation, one is 
not entitled to simply assume a priori that a global wave function exists for the system 
concerned: this has to be justif i ed. In the case of black holes forming by astrophysical 
processes, this is almost certainly not the case. The ���black hole information paradox��� 
assumes (1) unitary dynamics (10), perhaps expressed in terms of the associated Klein- 
Gordon equation, which in turn assumes (2) existence of a single relevant wave function 
|��(t)i in all relevant domains. We will question both assumptions below. 
5.2. Is there a Black Hole Information Paradox? 
Black body radiation is emitted by black holes [Hawking (1975)] irrespective of the 
matter out of which the black hole is formed. By the black hole uniqueness theorems, 
the result will be a Schwarzschild or Kerr black hole with closed trapped surfaces and 
with the interior hidden behind an event horizon (in astrophysical reality, charged black 
holes will not occur), The solution is fully characterised by just two parameters; the 
mass m and rotation parameter a. Thus all information about the matter that created 
the black hole, or anything that later falls into it, is completely lost to those who remain 
outside the black hole. This contradicts the intuition that dif f erent initial states should 
always lead to dif f erent i nal states, no matter how small the dif f erence is. More formally, 
the assumption is made that the associated quantum evolution is unitary. But this is 
not true, either classically or quantum mechanically 
5.2.1. ClassicallyIn the classical case, of course no black hole radiation takes place. 
Information is not conserved: if you drop anything in, there is a singular boundary 
to spacetime and both matter and information get lost as they leave spacetime. No 
conservation law applies within spacetime because of this local boundary. 
5.2.2.Quantum Mechanically In the quantum case, Hawking radiation is emitted 
[Hawking (1975)] and information is lost in the sense that dif f erent starting states lead 
to the same outcome [Hawking (1976), Mathur (2009)].The ���information paradox��� 
arises from the assumption that the dynamics is unitary.One possible resolution 
of this paradox is that black hole evaporation can be regarded as a wave function collapse situation, not a unitary one, because the initial quantum state leads to 
a classical detection event- and any such quantum to classical transition is non- 
unitary and information is lost [Ellis (2012)].It is basically a measurement event 
([Aaronson (2016)]:��1.2.1 2.).Furthermore while the calculation done uses dif f erent 
bases for the inward and outward wave functions, it nevertheless assumes a single 
wave function exists for the entire spacetime- which may not be justif i ed. There may 
be no such single wavefunction, just as there is no ���Wave Function of the Universe��� 
[Ellis (2023)]. In particular this lack of a single wavefunction may be expected to be 
the true in the case of astrophysical black holes [Begelman and Rees (2020)], where 
manifestly the dynamics is very non-linear.The underlying issue is whether these 
discussions are related to highly idealised models of the situation, or more realistic non- 
linear cases where unitary evolution will not in fact take place [Ellis (2012), Ellis (2023)]. 
Moreover, any quantum description that neglects the black hole interior will always 
be non-unitary because it traces over states in the interior and thus uses a density 
matrix, not a wave function. But to properly include the interior one must include 
the singularity. If the singularity exists even in a quantum gravity description of black 
holes then information can be lost because singularities can destroy information. If the 
singularity does not exist in quantum gravity then the answer to the information paradox 
is likely to be tied to the nature of whatever quantum gravity replaces the singularity 
with. In any case that description is unlikely to be a single classical spacetime with an 
associated quantum state for the matter i elds.

4.5. Is ER = EPR True?
The ER = EPR conjecture, which links the concepts of "Einstein-Rosen Bridges" (ER) and quantum entanglement (EPR), has gained attention in recent years. However, it's important to clarify that the original EPR paper by Einstein, Podolsky, and Rosen [Einstein et al (1935)] and Schr��dinger's work on entanglement [Schr��dinger (1935)] had no direct connection to wormholes (ER).
Experimental proofs of quantum entanglement, including those that won the Nobel Prize in 2022, are based on calculations within flat spacetime and do not require the existence of spacetime wormholes (ER). Quantum entanglement is a well-established phenomenon that can occur independently of spacetime curvature.
ER represents wormholes, which are solutions of the Einstein Field Equations (EFE) and involve highly curved spacetime with features like closed trapped surfaces and event horizons. These are fundamentally different from the spacetime conditions associated with quantum entanglement.
Therefore, despite claims made by some, it cannot be generalized that ER = EPR is universally true, and the experimental verification of quantum entanglement does not imply the existence of spacetime wormholes.
Horizons, Firewalls, and Atlases
This section delves into the origin of the ER = EPR conjecture and its connection to black hole evaporation and the information paradox. It discusses coordinate atlases, local wavefunctions, and the debate over whether a black hole information paradox truly exists.
5.2. Is There a Black Hole Information Paradox?
The concept of a "Black Hole Information Paradox" arises from the idea that black hole evaporation leads to information loss, contradicting the principle that different initial states should yield different final states. The paradox stems from the assumption that quantum evolution is unitary.
In the classical context, no black hole radiation occurs, and information is not conserved because of the singular boundary to spacetime where matter and information get lost.
Quantum mechanically, Hawking radiation is emitted, and information appears to be lost because different initial states can result in the same final outcome. However, this paradox may be resolved by considering black hole evaporation as a wave function collapse event, which is inherently non-unitary.
One aspect of this discussion revolves around whether there exists a single wave function for the entire spacetime or whether more complex non-linear scenarios are at play. Additionally, the presence of singularities in black holes can be a complicating factor, potentially leading to information loss.
In quantum gravity, the treatment of black hole interiors and singularities remains a significant challenge, and any resolution of the information paradox may be contingent on the nature of quantum gravity that replaces or describes singularities. The classical assumption of a single spacetime with an associated quantum state may not hold in these more complex scenarios.

associated quantum state for the matter i elds. 
5.3. Black hole evaporation 
When a black hole emits radiation through the Hawking ef f ect those of us who stay 
outside the black hole will describe the radiation by tracing over the state in the interior 
of the black hole and thus obtain a density matrix.But then once the black hole 
evaporates completely, it sounds like we���re just left with a density matrix. That doesn���t 
sound like something quantum mechanics should do, allowing a pure state to evolve 
into a density matrix. So what (if anything) was missing from the original calculation 
of black hole evaporation? 
The original calculation was done in the semiclassical approximation in which 
gravity is treated classically (using general relativity) and everything else is treated 
using quantum mechanics.So clearly one thing that was missing from the original 
calculation is the ef f ects of quantum gravity. The singularity deep in the interior of the 
black hole is where quantum gravity ef f ects are important, but it is far from where the 
radiation is emitted, so instead string theorists decided to concentrate on the ef f ects of 
quantum gravity near the event horizon. 
On the face of it, this sounds like a terrible idea (and in our opinion it really is a 
terrible idea), but that���s the path most researchers decided to pursue and have pursued 
to this day. What���s disturbing to us about regarding the horizon and its vicinity as a 
place of strong gravity is that it seems like a giant step backwards from the hard-won geometric insights of the global structure program. 
Recall that the coordinate components of the Schwarzschild metric are singular 
in the usual Schwarzschild coordinate system. But one of the insights of the global 
structure program is that geometry is important and coordinates aren���t. So the horizon 
is i ne, but the Schwarzshild time coordinate t is not: it goes to inf i nity on the horizon. 
More generally, the horizon is a null surface, but if you regard a null surface as a limit 
of a family of timelike surfaces, then in the limit the geometry of the surface becomes 
singular. One can consider a ���stretched horizon���[Susskind (1993)] a timelike surface 
very near the event horizon and thus a place where (if you don���t think geometrically) it 
sounds like the ef f ects of quantum gravity might be strong. 
Ironically the stretched horizon is almost identical to Kip Thorne���s black hole 
membrane paradigm [Price and Thorne (1988)].But Thorne wasn���t so much trying 
to generate new insight as trying to make black holes user friendly to astrophysicists 
who (Thorne thought) wouldn���t have the time or inclination to absorb the insights of the 
global structure program. The irony is that now that there is plenty of astrophysical data 
about black holes, astrophysicists have shown themselves nimble enough to understand 
black holes just i ne. So the main use of membranes (a.k.a stretched horizons) is to 
those who want to think of black hole horizons as extreme environments. 
Another dif i culty with concentrating on the horizon is that the black hole interior 
is a four dimensional spacetime, while the horizon is a three dimensional null surface. 
Are there really enough degrees of freedom in the horizon to account for all the stuf f we 
trace over in the interior? For this to be the case, nature would have to satisfy some sort 
of ���holographic principle���[Susskind (1993)] by which a surface has as much information 
as the volume it surrounds. 
At the time the holographic principle was proposed, no system was known that 
satisf i ed it, but the proposed principle motivated the search for such a system and in 
due course one was found: the AdS/CFT correspondence [Maldacena (1998)]. Here AdS 
stands for string theory in a spacetime that is asymptotic to anti-de Sitter spacetime, 
and CFT stands for a supersymmetric conformal i eld theory on the boundary at inf i nity 
of the spacetime. The correspondence is that the predictions of one theory in the limit 
of strong coupling are also those of the other theory in the limit of weak coupling. 
AdS/CFT is an interesting mathematical system. But we have serious doubts as 
to whether it describes the physics of our universe. To begin with, our spacetime is not 
asymptotically anti-de Sitter, which has a negative cosmological constant �� contra to 
astronomical observations, and the standard model is not a supersymmetric conformal 
i eld theory. Moreover, from the geometric point of view there is something disturbing 
about using anti-de Sitter spacetime as a model: recall that in addition to energy 
conditions, the global structure program also uses causality conditions, in particular the 
existence of a Cauchy surface. Anti-de Sitter spacetime violates the energy condition by 
having a negative cosmological constant. In addition it violates the causality conditon 
by not having a Cauchy surface. This is because there are accelerated observers who 
can get to inf i nity in a i nite AdS time. Thus the boundary at inf i nity (which is needed for there to be any correspondence) is there only because from the geometric point of 
view anti-de Sitter spacetime is pathological. It is not the universe in which we live. 
The holographic principle also gave rise to an argument that information gets out 
of an evaporating black holes as follows: If an evaporating black hole is equivalent to 
a conformal i eld theory, then since in i eld theories pure states evolve to pure states, 
therefore the i nal state of an evaporating black hole is a pure state. Since we���re not 
convinced that nature obeys a holographic principle, we���re not convinced by holographic 
arguments involving extra dimensions about black hole evaporation

5.3. Black Hole Evaporation
Black hole evaporation, as described by the Hawking effect, presents intriguing questions about the nature of information preservation in quantum mechanics and gravity. When a black hole emits Hawking radiation, those outside the black hole describe the radiation using a density matrix. However, when the black hole fully evaporates, it may appear that only a density matrix remains, seemingly violating the principles of quantum mechanics.
One significant factor missing from the original Hawking radiation calculation is the effects of quantum gravity. While gravity was treated classically (using general relativity) in the semiclassical approximation, everything else was treated using quantum mechanics. The singularity deep inside the black hole is where quantum gravity becomes crucial. Still, researchers have focused on the effects of quantum gravity near the event horizon rather than attempting to address the singularity directly.
The notion of a "stretched horizon" was introduced to describe a timelike surface very close to the event horizon, where quantum gravity effects might be strong. However, this concept has been criticized for potentially deviating from the geometric insights gained through the global structure program. The stretched horizon concept resembles Kip Thorne's black hole membrane paradigm, which aimed to make black holes more comprehensible to astrophysicists but may not provide deep insights into the fundamental nature of black holes.
Another challenge arises from the difference in dimensionality between the black hole interior (four-dimensional spacetime) and the event horizon (three-dimensional null surface). It raises questions about whether the degrees of freedom at the horizon are sufficient to account for all the information traced over in the interior. This issue led to the proposal of the "holographic principle," suggesting that a surface could contain as much information as the volume it surrounds. While this principle motivated the search for systems satisfying it, such as the AdS/CFT correspondence, it remains uncertain whether it applies to our universe, given that our spacetime does not match the assumptions of the model.
Additionally, AdS/CFT correspondence relies on asymptotically anti-de Sitter spacetime, which contrasts with our universe's observed positive cosmological constant. Moreover, the standard model does not align with a supersymmetric conformal field theory. From a geometric perspective, anti-de Sitter spacetime violates energy and causality conditions, making it an imperfect model for our universe.
The holographic principle has been used to argue that information escapes an evaporating black hole, assuming that the black hole's equivalent system follows conformal field theory rules. However, this argument hinges on accepting the validity of the holographic principle, which is a topic of debate. Consequently, the question of whether information is truly preserved during black hole evaporation remains complex and is still an active area of research.

5.4. The Firewall and ER = EPR 
Nonetheless, even if one is convinced by holographic arguments there remains the 
following question: exactly how does the information get out of the black hole? Several 
mechanisms were considered, but i nally one group [Almheiri et al (2013)] (hereafter 
known as AMPS) produced a no-go result: any mechanism ef f ective enough to get the 
information out would actually give rise to a huge amount of stress-energy on the horizon 
(a ���f i rewall���). No mechanism would work. 
Though the AMPS paper is often thought of as predicting a i rewall, its structure is 
actually that of a standard proof by contradiction: one of their assumptions (in addition 
to information getting out) is the absence of huge stress-energy in the vicinity of the 
horizon (i.e. the absence of a i rewall). When their reasoning then leads to the presence 
of a i rewall they have obtained a contradiction with one of their original assumptions 
thus showing that the original set of assumptions can���t obtain. 
From our point of view, the result of the AMPS paper is both welcome and 
unsurprising. Everything that we know about quantum mechanics and null surfaces 
leads us to believe that quantum information can���t emerge from behind a null surface. 
One really nice feature of the AMPS paper is that it also gives the reason why 
information can���t get out: the quantum no cloning property. Though for many purposes, 
we get to ignore black hole interiors, they contain a lot of quantum information. For 
that information to also get out, there would have to be two copies of it: one inside the 
black hole and one outside, which would violate quantum no-cloning. 
We mention in passing that though we are quite fond of no-go theorems, not 
everyone feels that way.For example, Werner Israel liked to refer to people who 
prove no-go theorems as ���mathe-morticians��� by which he meant people who use their 
mathematical skills to bury an idea.For those who dislike either no-go theorems 
in general, or just a particular no-go theorem, there is always a way to evade the 
consequences of the theorem. This is because all theorems have assumptions, so if you 
don���t like the conclusions of the theorem, you can evade the conclusions by considering 
a situation where one or more of the assumptions don���t obtain. 
And now we (f i nally) come to the reason for ER=EPR: it is a way to evade the 
no-go result of AMPS. Essentially the evasion works as follows: suppose that all black 
holes are really wormholes.Then there are enough degrees of freedom in the other spacetime that we could imagine people in the other spacetime doing things that would 
cancel out the i rewall that would occur if the black hole were just a black hole. This 
still doesn���t tell us anything about how the information is supposed to get out, but at 
least it���s no longer impossible. 
On the formal level, the assumption of AMPS that is being dropped is that we are 
dealing with the evaporation of a black hole (rather than a wormhole). While formally 
this sort of maneuver is perfectly acceptable, from the geometric point of view (and it 
seems to us also the physical point of view) the statement ���maybe there just aren���t any 
black holes��� seems like a pretty extreme maneuver. It will certainly surprise all those 
who study black holes from an astrophysical viewpoint [Begelman and Rees (2020)]

5.4. The Firewall and ER = EPR (Continued)
The concept of a "firewall" near the event horizon of a black hole emerged as a consequence of attempting to resolve the question of how information escapes from a black hole during Hawking radiation. The AMPS (Almheiri, Marolf, Polchinski, and Sully) paper argued that any mechanism effective enough to allow information to escape would generate a significant amount of stress-energy on the horizon, essentially creating a "firewall." In essence, their paper demonstrates a proof by contradiction: if information gets out and there is no firewall, it leads to a contradiction, implying that the original assumptions can't hold.
From a quantum mechanics perspective, the AMPS result aligns with the no-cloning theorem, which states that quantum information cannot be cloned. Inside a black hole's interior, there is a significant amount of quantum information, and for that information to escape, there would need to be two identical copies of it���one inside the black hole and one outside. This would violate the fundamental no-cloning property of quantum mechanics.
The AMPS result poses a challenge to understanding how information can escape from a black hole without violating fundamental principles of quantum mechanics. It also underscores the difficulties in reconciling the behavior of quantum information near black holes.
The concept of ER = EPR is introduced as a way to evade the AMPS no-go result. In this scenario, all black holes are considered to be wormholes, which have enough degrees of freedom in another spacetime. By imagining that individuals in the other spacetime can perform actions that cancel out the firewall effect, it becomes possible to avoid the impossibility of information escape. However, this evasion is somewhat unconventional, as it essentially suggests that there are no true black holes in the conventional sense.
The idea that all black holes are actually wormholes may appear extreme, especially when considering astrophysical observations of black holes. While it provides a theoretical avenue to evade the firewall problem, it raises questions about the practical applicability of such a hypothesis in the context of real astrophysical black holes [Begelman and Rees (2020)]. The ER = EPR conjecture, while intriguing, remains a subject of debate and ongoing research.

6. Geometric and non-geometric approaches; ���computational complexity��� 
Though we i nd the question of black hole evaporation very interesting, we are dismayed 
by how much of it is done in an explicitly anti-geometric way. We note that it is a 
little over 50 years since Penrose and Hawking and Geroch and the other researchers 
of the global structure program brought new geometric insight to the relativity 
community [Penrose (1965), Hawking and Ellis (2023), Senovilla and Garf i nkle (2015)] 
and the physics community in general. We are concerned that much of that insight will 
be lost: drowned in a deluge of anti-geometric attitudes. 
We close with two last examples. The i rst has to do with the concept of spacetime 
and foliations. Physics is about dynamics: the development of a system as a function 
of time.But to treat general relativity this way, one needs to divide spacetime up 
into space and time:that is one needs a foliation.One important insight of the 
global structure program is that the spacetime is the physics: the choice of foliation 
is completely arbitrary to be chosen by the user for their own convenience. This insight 
was crucial for understanding black holes since otherwise one might be tempted to 
look at the Schwarzschild spacetime only in the foliation by constant Schwarzschild 
coordinate time slices. One would then be misled into thinking that it takes forever to 
fall into a black hole since the Schwarzschild time slices never reach the future event 
horizon. In contrast to this geometric insight consider the work of [Susskind (2014)] 
which treats black hole interiors and speculates about what their i eld theory duals 
might be. This work makes a particular choice of foliation: maximal slicing. Much of 
the paper is taken up with speculation on a supposed dual relation between growth of 
volume of the slices and ���growth of complexity��� on the i eld theory side. This growth of 
volume of maximal slices inside black holes is well known in numerical relativity where 
it is associated with the ���collapse of the lapse��� i.e. the fact that the slices slow down 
inside the black hole and stay well away from the singularity. But maximal slicing is 
just one of many slicing conditions that could be chosen. So to single out this particular 
slicing as the right slicing, the one whose dynamics has physical meaning, is to adopt a 
specif i cally anti-geometric attitude. 
The second example has to do with a growing body of work on the idea of ���computational complexity��� and black holes [Susskind (2016), Aaronson (2016), 
Haferkamp et al (2022,Chapman and Policastro (2022)]whichderivesfromthe 
literature on i rewalls plus that on the AdS/CFT formalism as well as that on ER 
bridges. [Susskind (2016)] states (��3), 
���It is commonly believed that black holes can be modeled as systems of N qubits 
with N is of order the entropy of the black hole.��� 
We are completely baf l ed by such statements. The concept of a physical qubitk only 
arises in the context of a quantum computer, where they are controlled by algorithms 
as explained in [DiVincenzo (2000)]: 
������A quantum algorithm is typically specif i ed as a sequence of unitary 
transformations U1, U2, U3,..., each acting on a small number of qubits... 
The most straightforward transcription of this into a physical specif i cation is 
to identify Hamiltonians which generate these unitary transformations���. 
In the context of a black hole, precisely what are the qubits, and what generates these 
unitary transformations?Where does the relevant algorithm come from?Why is 
any such concept needed or relevant? As a consequence of the black hole uniqueness 
theorems [Robinson (2009)], the geometry of a black hole B is classically described by 
just three parameters: its mass m, rotation a, and charge e, so its number of degrees 
of freedom D(B) is 3. That is a measure of its complexity. If we consider quantum 
gravity, the graviton is presumably a massless spin-2 boson (see [Weinberg (1972)] and 
references therein). There is nothing remotely resembling qubits in sight. Solid physics 
has given way to what appears to be pure fantasy: layer upon layer of unsubstantiated 
concepts being invoked��. 
The actual geometry of black holes ([Hawking and Ellis (2023)]:��5.5, see Fig. 1) 
has nothing to do with AdS/CFT, which is the centre of such speculation, or qbits. It is 
perfectly well described by General Relativity as usually understood. As for holography 
and general relativity proper, there are cases where the idea can be understood in a 
sensible way that does not involve AdS/CFT. It is basically a restatement of the null 
initial value problem [Goswami and Ellis (2017)] but runs into problems in the cosmo- 
logical case because of cusps and folds in null surfaces [Tavakol and Ellis (1999)].

Geometric and Non-Geometric Approaches; "Computational Complexity" (Continued)
The authors express concern about the trend towards anti-geometric approaches in the study of black hole physics and the potential loss of the geometric insights gained over the past few decades. They provide two examples to illustrate their point.
Firstly, they discuss the importance of foliations in the study of spacetime dynamics in general relativity. Foliations involve dividing spacetime into space and time, allowing for the treatment of dynamics as a function of time. A key insight from the global structure program is that the choice of foliation is arbitrary and chosen for convenience, with spacetime itself being the essential physics. This insight was crucial for understanding black holes and avoiding misconceptions related to coordinate choices. However, recent work in black hole interiors, such as maximal slicing, has made specific foliation choices and introduced concepts like the "growth of complexity." The authors argue that singling out a particular slicing as the "correct" one represents an anti-geometric attitude and overlooks the geometric flexibility inherent in general relativity.
Secondly, the authors express bewilderment at the growing body of work linking "computational complexity" to black holes. This work suggests that black holes can be modeled as systems of qubits, where N (the number of qubits) is related to the black hole's entropy. The authors question the relevance of such concepts in the context of black holes, as qubits are typically associated with quantum computers and algorithms. They ask where the qubits come from, what generates unitary transformations, and why such a concept is needed or relevant for black holes. They emphasize that the geometry of black holes is classically described by just three parameters (mass, rotation, charge), and there is no evidence of qubits or unitary transformations in the physical description of black holes. They argue that this trend appears to introduce layers of unsubstantiated concepts and move away from solid physics.
In summary, the authors raise concerns about the departure from geometric approaches in black hole physics and the introduction of speculative concepts like qubits and computational complexity, which may not have a clear physical basis or relevance in the context of black holes. They stress the importance of maintaining the geometric insights gained over the years in the study of general relativity and black hole physics.

So how was ER=EPR interpreted and his does it imply this?
ChatGPT

The ER = EPR conjecture, proposed by Juan Maldacena and Leonard Susskind, suggests a deep and intriguing connection between two seemingly unrelated phenomena in theoretical physics: quantum entanglement (EPR) and wormholes (ER). Here's how ER = EPR is interpreted and what it implies:
Entanglement and Wormholes:
The EPR paradox, named after Einstein, Podolsky, and Rosen, involves the entanglement of quantum particles. When two particles are entangled, their quantum states become correlated in such a way that the measurement of one particle instantaneously determines the state of the other, regardless of the distance separating them.
Wormholes, on the other hand, are hypothetical shortcuts or bridges in spacetime. In general relativity, they are solutions to the Einstein field equations that allow for shortcuts between distant points in the universe.
ER = EPR Hypothesis:
The ER = EPR conjecture posits that entangled particles (EPR) are connected by a type of wormhole (ER) in the fabric of spacetime. In other words, when two particles become entangled, they are linked by a microscopic, hidden wormhole.
Implications of ER = EPR:
ER = EPR suggests a profound connection between the quantum world of entanglement and the classical world of general relativity, which describes gravity and the geometry of spacetime.
If this conjecture holds true, it would mean that the phenomena of quantum entanglement and spacetime wormholes are not separate but are intimately related. This could have significant implications for our understanding of the fundamental laws of physics and the nature of spacetime itself.
It has been suggested that ER = EPR might help resolve the long-standing "black hole information paradox." If entangled particles are connected by wormholes, information that falls into a black hole might somehow be stored or transmitted through these wormholes, allowing for the eventual recovery of information, thus preserving the principles of quantum mechanics.
ER = EPR also raises questions about the nature of spacetime, the geometry of wormholes, and the fundamental structure of the universe. It challenges physicists to explore new connections between quantum field theory and gravity.
It's important to note that the ER = EPR conjecture remains speculative and has not been definitively proven. While it offers an intriguing insight into the potential unity of quantum mechanics and general relativity, more research and evidence are needed to establish its validity. Nonetheless, it represents an exciting avenue of exploration at the intersection of two fundamental branches of physics.
