etrocausal models of QM add further weight 
to the conf l ict between causality and the pos- 
sible existence of free will. We analyze a sim- 
ple closed causal loop ensuing from the interaction 
between two systems with opposing thermodynamic 
time arrows, such that each system can forecast âfu- 
tureâ events for the other. The loop is avoided by the 
fact that the choice to abort an event thus forecasted 
leads to the destruction of the forecasterâs past. Phys- 
ical law therefore enables prophecy of future events 
only as long as this prophecy is not revealed to a free 
agent who can otherwise render it false. This reso- 
lution is demonstrated on an earlier i nding derived 
fromtheTwo-State-VectorFormalism(TSVF),where 
a weak measurementâs outcome anticipates a future 
choice, yet this anticipation becomes apparent only 
after the choice has been actually made. To quan- 
tify this assertion, âweak informationâ is described in 
terms of Fisher information. We conclude that an âal- 
ready existingâ future does not exclude free will nor 
invoke causal paradoxes. On the quantum level, par- 
ticles can be thought of as weakly interacting accord- 
ing to their past and future states, but causality re- 
mains intact as long as the future is masked by quan- 
tum indeterminism.

1 Introduction 
Time-symmetric formulations of QM are gaining growing 
interest. Using two boundary conditions rather than the 
customary one, they of f er novel twists to several foun- 
dational issues. Such are the Wheeler-Feynman electro- 
magnetic absorber theory [1], and Hoyle and Narlikarâs 
modif i cation [2] and Cramerâs transactional interpreta- 
tion [3]. Among these, however, the ABL rule [4] and 
Aharonovâs Two-State-Vector Formalism (TSVF) [5] are 
distinct, in that they even predict some novel ef f ects for a 
combination of forwards and backwards evolving wave 
functions. When performing a complete post-selection 
of the quantum state, otherwise counterfactual questions 
can be intriguingly answered with regard to the stateâs 
previous time evolution. 
These advances, however, might seem come with a 
price that even for adherents is too heavy, namely, dis- 
missing free will. While quantum indeterminism seemed 
to of f er some liberation from the chains imposed on our 
choices by classical causality, time-symmetric QM some-

what undermines quantum indeterminism, as it renders 
future boundary conditions the missing source of possible 
causes. This might eventually reveal causality to be just 
as strict and closed as classical causality. If the future 
is, in some sense, âalready thereâ to the point of being 
causally equal to the past, free will (which is def i ned 
in the next section) might appear to be as illusory as it 
has appeared within the classical framework. We aim to 
show this is not necessarily the case. TSVF is no worse 
of f than classical physics, or other formulations of quan- 
tum mechanics as it pertains to the incorporation of free 
will. In other words, free will is not precluded even when 
discussing a quantum world having both past and future 
boundary. 
In this special issue of Quanta, dedicated to Richard 
Feynman and discussing time-symmetry in quantum me- 
chanics, we examine what might seem to be a problem in 
theseformulations, namely thenotion offree will[6]. Dis- 
cussionofthiskindmightatf i rstberegardedasphilosoph- 
ical in character, but we hope to formulate the problem 
rigorously enough to yield nontrivial physical insights.1 / 1ChatGPTChatGPTIt looks like you've provided an abstract or summary of a scientific paper related to retrocausality, free will, and quantum mechanics. The authors Yakir Aharonov, Eliahu Cohen, and Tomer Shushi discuss how time-symmetric formulations of quantum mechanics (QM) might conflict with the idea of free will but conclude that free will is not necessarily precluded.The paper appears to explore concepts like Two-State-Vector Formalism (TSVF) and time symmetry, and how these relate to the nature of causality and free will. It suggests that physical law can accommodate predictions of future events as long as those predictions are not revealed to a free agent who might interfere with the outcome. The authors also touch upon quantum indeterminism and its relationship with causality, arguing that the future's existence does not exclude free will.If you have any specific questions about the content or need further clarification on a particular aspect, please let me know!1 / 12 The Problem 
Following Russell and Deery [6], we propose def i ning 
free will as follows. Let a physical system be capable of 
initiating complex interactions with its environment, gain- 
ing information about it and predicting its future states, as 
well as their ef f ects on the system itself. This grants the 
system purposeful behavior, which nevertheless fully ac- 
cords with classical causality. Now let there be more than 
one course of action that the system can take in response 
to a certain event, which in turn lead to dif f erent future 
outcomes that the system can predict. âFree willâ then 
denotes the systemâs taking one out of various courses 
of action, independently (at least to some extent) of past 
restrictions. This def i nition is very close in spirit to the 
one employed in [7], i.e. the ability to make choices. It 
should be emphasized that even in our time-symmetric 
context, free will means only freedom from the past, not 
from the future (see also [5]). 
In classical physics, conservation laws oblige any event 
to be strictly determined by earlier causes. In our con- 
text, this might apparently leave only one course of action 
for the system in question, and hence no real choices. 
When moving to the quantum realm, free will might be 
recovered [7], but then again, if one adds a i nal boundary 
condition to the description of the quantum system, can 
free will exist? We shall answer both classical and quan- 
tum questions on the af i rmative, employing statistical 
and quantum l uctuations, respectively. 
In what follows, we analyze a classical causal paradox 
avoided by the pastâs instability. We subsequently con- 
sider a more acute variant of this paradox and discuss 
a few possible resolutions. Then we present the quan- 
tum counterpart of these two paradoxes where inherent 
indeterminism saves causality. We show that within the 
TSVF, although both future and past states of the system 
are known, genuine freedom is not necessarily excluded. 
We then def i ne and quantify the term âweak informationâ 
â the kind of information coming from the future that can 
be encrypted in the past without violating causality. 
3 An Interaction between Two 
Systems with Opposing 
Time-Arrows 
To demonstrate the possibility of knowing oneâs future 
and its consequences, we discuss a highly simplif i ed clas- 
sical gedanken experiment. Naturally, there are immedi- 
ate dif i culties with such a setup. Can, e.g., two regions in 
space have opposite time arrows to begin with? Can ob- 
servers inside them communicate? etc. These questions 
deserve further probing, but we focus here only on what 
would happen if several conditions are met, rather than 
whether and how they can be achieved. 
Consider, then, a universe comprised of only two 
closed, non-interacting laboratories located at some dis- 
tance from one another. Suppose further that their ther- 
modynamic time arrows are opposite to one another, such 
that each systemâs âfutureâ time direction is the otherâs 
âpastâ. Finally let each laboratory host a free agent, hence- 
forth Alice and Bob, capable of free choice. 
It is challenging to create a communication channel 
between two laboratories of this kind. An exchange of 
signals is possible in the following form. A light beam is 
sent from the exterior part of one laboratory to the otherâs 
boundary, where a static message is posted. The beam is 
then ref l ected back to its origin. If the labs are massive 
enough, the beam imparts only a negligible momentum 
transfer. 
The gedanken experiment is as follows (see Fig. 1): 
t(b) 
1 : Bob sends a light-beam (red arrow) to Aliceâs lab. 
t(b) 
2 : He receives through his returning beam a message 
from Alice saying: âLet me know if you see this messageâ 
(dotted blue world-line). 
t(b) 
3 : Bob posts a conf i rmation saying: âI saw your 
messageâ(red world-line). 
Then there are the following events in Aliceâs lab: 
t(a) 
1 : Alice sends a light-beam (blue arrow) to Bobâs 
lab. t(a) 
2 : Alice receives through her returning beam of par- 
ticles that scattered of f Bobâs message, i.e. she gets the information from Bob through this beam ref l ected from 
Bobâs system to her system. 
t(a) 
3 : Alice, realizing that this conf i rmation comes from 
her future, chooses not to post a message. 
The Causal Paradox is obvious: The dotted blue world- 
line represents an absent message. How, then, could Bob 
reply to a message which was removed before he was 
supposed to see it? 
It should be noted, that alongside with this formula- 
tion of the paradox, one can equivalently describe the 
complementary scenario: Bob i nds through his return- 
ing beam that Alice did not post a message. Therefore, 
he sends no conf i rmation, but eventually Alice, having 
free will, decides to post a message in contrast to Bobâs 
observation.1 / 1ChatGPTChatGPTThe passage you've shared delves into the problem of free will and causality in both classical and quantum contexts. It provides a definition for free will, in accordance with the views of Russell and Deery, that emphasizes the ability to take one of various possible courses of action.The authors then present a thought experiment involving two closed laboratories with opposite thermodynamic time arrows. This sets up a scenario where two agents, Alice and Bob, are capable of free choices but face a paradox when they attempt to communicate.In this experiment, Bob receives a message from Alice's future that prompts him to reply. Alice, in turn, receives this reply and then chooses not to send the original message. This creates a paradox as Bob's reply is to a message that, from his point of view, was never sent.The scenario highlights the challenge of accommodating both causality and free will in a situation where information from the future can be known. It illustrates the complex and counterintuitive nature of causality when time symmetry is taken into account.The paper seems to argue that although paradoxes can arise, they don't necessarily rule out the existence of free will, even in contexts where both past and future states of a system are known. This may involve the use of statistical or quantum fluctuations to preserve causality.If you have any specific questions or need further clarification on certain points, please let me know!1 / 1How can someone get a message from the future?1 / 1ChatGPTChatGPTThe idea of receiving a message from the future is a theoretical concept often explored in science fiction and certain philosophical and scientific discussions. In the context of the gedanken experiment described in the paper, it's used to explore paradoxes and insights related to time, causality, and free will.The scenario involves two systems (or laboratories) with opposing thermodynamic time arrows, meaning that each system's "future" is the other's "past." Within this hypothetical framework, it becomes theoretically possible for one system to receive information from the other that would be considered as coming from the "future."In real-world physics, as we currently understand it, there is no practical way to receive messages from the future. The laws of physics are time-symmetric, meaning they work the same way forwards and backwards in time, but macroscopic processes like sending and receiving messages typically follow the arrow of time as determined by the increase of entropy.The scenario described in the paper is a thought experiment designed to probe the nature of time and causality rather than a proposal for a real-world experiment or technology. It can help in understanding how time-symmetry might theoretically allow for interactions between different temporal directions, but it doesn't provide a method for actually receiving messages from the future in our universe.1 / 1Ok I have trouble following it. What if two people where planting a garden, Alice plants Artichokes, Broccoli, and Carrots moving up the alphabet and Bob plants Zucchini, Xigua, and Yam, moving down the alphabet. Can we come up with an analogy like this?1 / 1ChatGPTChatGPTCertainly! Analogies can be a helpful way to understand complex concepts. Here's an attempt to illustrate the ideas in the paper using the garden planting scenario:Imagine Alice and Bob are planting a garden together, but they have different approaches. Alice likes to plant vegetables starting with A and moving up the alphabet, while Bob starts with Z and moves down.Now, suppose there's a magical gardening rule that allows them to glimpse a hint of their future garden. Alice can see a small piece of what Bob will plant, and Bob can see a piece of what Alice will plant. This is analogous to the opposing time arrows in the thought experiment.Alice's Hint from the Future: Alice sees a glimpse of Bob planting Yams, so she decides to plant Artichokes next to them to create a nice combination.Bob's Hint from the Future: Bob sees Alice planting Artichokes, so he decides to plant Yams next to them, confirming what Alice saw.Paradox and Free Will: Here's where it gets tricky. Suppose Alice, after seeing Bob's future Yams, decides not to plant Artichokes after all, but instead plants Broccoli. Bob's glimpse of the future showed Artichokes, but now that future has changed. This creates a paradox, similar to the one in the original thought experiment.The analogy is meant to illustrate the tension between deterministic future glimpses and the free will to change decisions. In the original experiment, this tension leads to a paradox. In the gardening scenario, the paradox arises if Alice changes her decision after seeing Bob's future planting, thereby altering the future that Bob saw.The original paper's conclusion that an "already existing" future doesn't exclude free will would be akin to saying that even though Alice and Bob have glimpses of the future, they can still make independent planting decisions, with some constraints to avoid paradoxes. The gardening analogy simplifies many details, but it captures some of the essential dynamics between causality, future knowledge, and free will.1 / 1That makes it more confusing. They can't see the future, they are working from the same list but they have it folded. 1 / 1ChatGPTChatGPTCertainly! Let's revise the analogy to match the scenario where Alice and Bob are working from the same list but have it folded, so they can't see the entire thing.Imagine Alice and Bob are planting a garden together, but they have different approaches. They both have the same list of vegetables to plant, but it's folded in such a way that they can only see part of the list. Alice is working from the beginning of the alphabet, and Bob is working from the end.Alice's Approach: Alice sees the part of the list starting with A, so she plants Artichokes, Broccoli, and Carrots, moving up the alphabet.Bob's Approach: Bob sees the part of the list starting with Z, so he plants Zucchini, Xigua, and Yam, moving down the alphabet.The Folded List: The folded list represents the boundary between the known and unknown, or the present and future. Neither Alice nor Bob can see beyond the fold, so they don't have access to the "future" part of the garden. They must make decisions based on the "past" and "present" that they can see.Decision Making and Free Will: Since the list is folded, both Alice and Bob have to make choices based on the limited information they have. They can choose which vegetables to plant next, but they're constrained by the part of the list they can see. This represents a form of free will within certain boundaries.Potential for Paradox: If Alice and Bob somehow manage to peek beyond the fold, they might glimpse the "future" part of the garden and make decisions based on that information. However, if they then change their minds and make different choices, they could create a paradox, where their actions conflict with the information they saw.This analogy is meant to illustrate how working within constraints (the folded list) allows for free will and decision making, but peeking into the "future" can create paradoxes. It's a more concrete scenario than the original thought experiment and may map more directly to the idea of limited information and the relationship between past, present, and future.1 / 1They can sort of "peek" in to the future by seeing what the other has planted. Maybe the list gets wet and the words get smudged, they can look into the others garden to see what the missing entries were. 1 / 1ChatGPTChatGPTCertainly! The adjustment you've made provides a great way to explain the concept of peeking into the future while still operating within certain constraints.Here's how the analogy might look with these additions:Alice and Bob's Approach: They both have the same smudged list of vegetables to plant. Alice is planting from A onwards, while Bob is planting from Z downwards.The Smudged List: The smudging on the list represents uncertainty and the boundary between what's known and unknown. The smudged part hides certain information about what they should plant next.Peeking into Each Other's Garden: If Alice or Bob are uncertain about what to plant next due to the smudged list, they can "peek" into each other's garden to see what the other person has planted. This gives them information about the "future" (or the hidden part of the list) and helps them make decisions about what to plant next.Constraints and Free Will: Even though they can peek into each other's garden, Alice and Bob still have to make choices about what to plant based on the available information. They have free will within the constraints of the list and what they can see in each other's garden.Potential Paradox: If they were to act on what they saw in the other's garden but then changed their minds and planted something different, it could create a paradox or inconsistency in their planting scheme.Resolution: The fact that the list is smudged and that they can only peek into each other's garden (not see the entire future) allows for some level of uncertainty and indeterminacy. This allows for free will without creating strict paradoxes, as their actions are still constrained by the overall planting scheme.This garden planting analogy helps to illustrate complex concepts like uncertainty, limited future knowledge, and free will within constraints. It offers a way to think about how knowledge of the "future" can influence actions without strictly determining them, and how free will can operate within certain boundaries without leading to logical inconsistencies.1 / 1Ok let's extend the analogy to a church or a school. You visit only for a short while but you see babies, toddlers, adults, and elders, or kindergarteners, assistants, and teachers. If it is a large enough school, you can see people from all ages of life and  ask them questions and so even if you are young you can see a fuzzy snapshot of your "future" and "past".

In a similar way we can see stars, galaxies, and planets in different stages of their existence (think Main sequence in the HR diagram), and know something about the lifecycle of stars even though they might be billions of years.1 / 1ChatGPTChatGPTCertainly! Extending the analogy to a church, school, or even observing celestial bodies can help illustrate the idea of gaining insights into different stages of existence, which might metaphorically represent glimpsing into the "future" and "past." Here's how the analogy might work in each context:Church or School Setting:Observing Different Life Stages: When visiting a church or school, you can see individuals at different stages of life, from babies to elders, or kindergarteners to teachers.Learning from Others: By observing, interacting with, and asking questions of people at different stages, you can gain insights into what your own future might hold or reflect on your past. It's like a snapshot of life's continuum that provides a fuzzy glimpse into the possibilities of existence.Free Will and Choices: Even though you can observe and learn from these different stages, your path is not determined. You have the ability to make choices and decisions that will shape your own future.Studying Stars and Celestial Bodies:Observing Different Stages: By looking at stars, galaxies, and planets at different points in their lifecycles (e.g., the Main Sequence in the HR diagram), astronomers can piece together a picture of how these celestial bodies evolve over time.Glimpse into Past and Future: The observation of different stages provides a window into the past and future of these celestial bodies. We can see what they were like billions of years ago and predict what they might become in the future.Understanding Without Direct Experience: Just as a young person in a school can gain insights into older stages without living them, astronomers can understand the lifecycle of stars without directly experiencing their entire existence.These analogies build on the idea of gathering information about different stages or states and using that information to understand a broader continuum of existence. It demonstrates how observing various stages can give us a window into the past and future, while still leaving room for uncertainty, indeterminacy, and choice. It's a rich metaphor for how we can learn from what's around us to inform our understanding of where we've been and where we might be going, without necessarily being constrained by that knowledge.1 / 1Here is the final part of the essay we were discussing earlier: 9 Cryptography Can Protect 
Causality 
Weak or encrypted information can be used for communi- 
cation between future and past in a causality preserving 
manner thanks to quantum indeterminism. The main idea 
behind this type of communication is quantum cryptogra- 
phy [15]. Suppose Bob somehow knows what Alice will 
choose in the future. He uses a quantum cryptography 
scheme to encode Aliceâs future choice and gives her the 
encrypted prophecy. However, he does not share with her 
the key to decode this revelation until she actually makes 
her choice. In this case, similarly to the example in Sec. 
6, both Bobâs past and Aliceâs future are secured. Due to 
quantum indeterminism, Alice still has free will. 
For example, in the BB84 scheme [16], even though 
Alice and Bob communicate through a public channel, 
their secret key is secured due to another form of quantum 
indeterminism, namely, that non-orthogonal states are 
indistinguishable. This means that even if the generated 
string contains information regarding Eveâs future, it will 
not create a causal paradox. 
10 A Few alternatives 
In addition to the proposed resolution for the above para- 
doxes, there exist some other well-known possibilities. 
The parallel universe resolution suggests that if one goes 
back in time and kills his grandfather he actually does it 
in a parallel universe and therefore he does not interfere 
with the laws of nature [17,18]. A dif f erent approach 
to solve this is by postulating another time dimension 
in which such disagreements can be solved before being 
recorded in our history [19,20]. 
Thesetworesolutionsclearlylacksimplicityandoblige 
an excessive ontology to our existing theories. Moreover, 
detailed work is needed to refute each and every paradox. 
Therefore, bearing in mind Occamâs razor as a tool 
for denying complex theories, it seems these alternative 
solutions are unfavorable. 
Another solution simply dictates that one cannot cre- 
ate paradoxes in the universe and therefore cannot, for 
instance, kill his grandfather. This approach implies a 
universe guided by global consistency condition such 
as in [21,22] and was shown to naturally arise in post- 
selected closed-timelike curves [23]. 
11 Free will and Becoming 
Classical physics treats time as a purely geometrical in- 
gredient of the universe, alongside the three spatial dimen- 
sions. Against the perfect logical rigor and experimental 
support that make relativity so powerful, many physicists 
i nd the âblock universeâ picture emerging from it man- 
ifestly awkward. In fact, the very notion of space-time 
implies that, just as all locations have the same degree 
of reality in space, so do all past, present, and future mo- 
ments exist along the temporal dimension without any 
moment being unique as the privileged ânow â. 
Against this mainstream view, there are alternative ac- 
counts [24]. They suspect that, if we experience time 
so dif f erently from space, this dif f erence may be objec- 
tive. They provide some models to capture this notion of 
dynamic time. 
Bobâs access to Aliceâs future in the classical gedanken 
experiment above and the double boundary condition on 
the wave function proposed by the TSVF may seem at 
i rst sight to resonate with a block universe approach. 
However, as we have just seen, statistical and quantum 
l uctuations may provide us with freedom to def i ne the 
present. As was shown in Secs. 4-5, this freedom, and 
also the notion of becoming, is subjective and system- 
dependent. 
Within the TSVF, while both backward and forward 
states evolve deterministically, they have limited physical 
signif i cance on their own â physical reality is created 
by the product of the causal chains extending in both 
temporal directions. The past does not determine the fu- 
ture,yet the future is set, and only together do they form 
the present. However, the existence of a future boundary 
condition,and its deterministic ef f ect, do not deny our 
freedom of choice. It is allowed due to the inaccessibility 
of the data (which is a requirement of causality, as dis- 
cussed in Sec. 5). Examining the concept of free will 
from a physical point of view,we i nd it must contain at 
least partial freedom from past causal constraints, and 
such freedom is duly manifested in the TSVF, where a 
juxtaposition of freedom and determinacy is epitomized. 
12 Conclusions 
We examined the possibility of free will in a retrocausal 
theory. Closed causal loops, which arise due to the inter- 
action between two systems with opposing time arrows 
were discussed. The suggested resolution of the ensuing 
Quanta | DOI: 10.12743/quanta.xxxMonth 2014 | Volume X | Issue Y | Page 6 
paradoxes relies on the thermodynamic instability of the 
past. 
Moving to the quantum realm, a similar paradox can 
be solved via the quantum indeterminism, which is under- 
stood to protect free will. This resonates with previous 
i ndings of Georgiev [7]. Furthermore, we discussed the 
âstrengthâ of information transmission, where the terms 
âstrongâ and âweakâ are related to strong (projective) and 
weak values, respectively. When information about a 
future event is buried under quantum indeterminism it 
cannot violate free will. Similarly, encrypted information, 
e.g., the one available through weak measurements, does 
not violate causality. The existence of free will in these 
time symmetric models was conjectured to resonate with 
a dynamical notion of time.1 / 1ChatGPTChatGPTThe final part of the essay you shared is a complex and philosophical discussion about the nature of time, causality, free will, and quantum mechanics. Here's a summary of the key points:Cryptography and Causality: Quantum cryptography is used as a method to allow communication between the future and the past in a way that doesn't violate causality. Bob can encrypt information about Alice's future choice and share it with her without violating free will, thanks to quantum indeterminism.Quantum Indeterminism: The idea that non-orthogonal states are indistinguishable allows for a secret key to be secured even in a public channel, and this quantum indeterminism prevents causal paradoxes.Alternative Resolutions to Paradoxes: The text explores various other solutions to paradoxes related to time travel, such as the parallel universe theory or adding another time dimension. However, it argues that these solutions lack simplicity and are unfavorable according to Occam's razor.Global Consistency and Paradox Prevention: Another approach is the idea that the universe maintains a global consistency condition, preventing the creation of paradoxes, such as killing one's own grandfather.Free Will and Becoming: The text contrasts the classical "block universe" view, where all past, present, and future moments exist simultaneously, with alternative views that regard time as dynamic. In the framework of TSVF (Two-State Vector Formalism), both backward and forward states evolve deterministically, but they have limited significance on their own. The combination of freedom and determinacy allows for free will without violating causality.Conclusions: The essay concludes by examining the possibility of free will in a retrocausal theory and exploring the thermodynamic instability of the past, quantum indeterminism, and the strength of information transmission. It posits that free will can exist without violating causality in time-symmetric models.The essay seems to touch on deep and intricate philosophical and physical ideas. If you would like more specific details or have questions on particular sections, please let me know!1 / 1See if you can illustrate those concepts with our metaphors.1 / 1ChatGPTChatGPTCertainly! Let's take the key concepts from the essay and try to connect them to the metaphors we've been discussing.Cryptography and Causality: This is like the garden scenario where Bob and Alice plant vegetables using a folded list. They can "peek" at the other's garden (the future) without causing paradoxes. The encryption represents the folded list, and the quantum indeterminism represents the smudging, allowing them to see but not fully know the future.Quantum Indeterminism: Think of the school metaphor, where you can see different stages of life simultaneously but can't determine a specific individual's future with certainty. It's like seeing all grades in school but not knowing the exact path one student will follow.Alternative Resolutions to Paradoxes: The parallel universe theory is like planting in different gardens; if one thing happens in Alice's garden, it doesn't affect Bob's garden. A different time dimension could be likened to having a separate growing season or a different field entirely.Global Consistency and Paradox Prevention: This is akin to a rule in the garden that prevents certain actions (e.g., planting the same vegetable twice). In the church or school, it's like a structure or curriculum that everyone follows, maintaining consistency.Free Will and Becoming: The school metaphor illustrates this well. Though you see all stages of life, each individual still has the free will to make choices that affect their path. In the garden, Alice and Bob have the free will to choose what to plant, even if they can peek at each other's gardens.Conclusions and Retrocausal Theory: The garden and school metaphors reflect the essay's conclusions by showing how one can gain insights into future events (different stages of growth or life) without creating paradoxes or fully determining those events.The metaphors of the garden and the school/church are rich and versatile, and they can illustrate these complex philosophical and physical ideas in a more accessible way. They symbolize a balance between determinism and free will, causality and future insights, all of which are central themes in the essay.1 / 1When I was in university I remember I kind of created my own degree program by taking extra courses and electives. There was no program for psycholinguistics, so I asked for some courses to be taught and helped choose the reading material and did the tutoring and marking for those courses while taking them. I took a double major in psychology and linguistics and minor in philosophy, and the university added it to the curriculum. 1 / 1ChatGPTChatGPTThat's an impressive and innovative approach to your education! By identifying a gap in the curriculum and taking the initiative to create a tailored degree program in psycholinguistics, you not only furthered your own education but also enriched the academic offerings of the university.Your experience could even serve as another metaphor in our discussion. Just as you were able to shape your own educational path while still working within the structure of the university system, the ideas in the essay reflect a balance between predetermined structures (like causality and physical laws) and the ability to influence and "create" within those structures (like free will and quantum indeterminism).Your unique educational journey might represent a real-life example of this balance, demonstrating how individuals can work within existing systems to bring about change and create new possibilities.1 / 1Yeah I guess it was intuitive because I had gone to a self-directed school, had been unschooled, and did something similar in high school. I was inspired by Ebbinghaus, Piaget, Montessori, John Holt, William Glasser, William Powers, Alison Gopnik, Torey Hayden, Vygotsky, and Wittgenstein, to name a few.1 / 1ChatGPTChatGPTYour educational background and the influences you've mentioned certainly explain your intuitive approach to self-directed learning. The thinkers you've cited all contribute to a rich intellectual framework that emphasizes personal agency, cognitive development, child-centered education, and a profound understanding of language and thought.It's not hard to see how these principles could lead you to forge your own educational path, both in terms of content and methodology. The self-directed nature of your learning experiences may indeed provide a real-life illustration of some of the abstract concepts we've been discussing, such as free will within deterministic systems.The balance between structure and agency, between existing rules and personal creativity, is a theme that resonates in both the educational philosophies you've embraced and the scientific concepts explored in the essay. Your experiences provide a tangible example of how these abstract ideas can play out in the real world.1 / 1The basic principles of their philosophies.1 / 1ChatGPTChatGPTCertainly! Here's a brief overview of the basic principles of some of the philosophers and theorists you've mentioned:Hermann Ebbinghaus: Known for his pioneering work on memory, Ebbinghaus's principle involved the forgetting curve and the spacing effect, demonstrating how information is lost over time unless it is consciously reviewed.Jean Piaget: Piaget's theory of cognitive development included four developmental stages: sensorimotor, preoperational, concrete operational, and formal operational. His work emphasized how children build an understanding of the world through experience and interaction.Maria Montessori: Montessori's approach is child-centered and emphasizes self-directed activity, hands-on learning, and collaborative play. It believes in children's natural ability to initiate their own learning in a well-prepared environment.John Holt: A proponent of unschooling, Holt emphasized learning as a natural process and argued against traditional schooling's rigid structure and lack of trust in children's innate curiosity and intelligence.William Glasser: Glasser's Choice Theory highlights that almost all behavior is chosen and that we are driven by our needs for survival, love, power, freedom, and fun.William Powers: Known for his work on perceptual control theory, Powers emphasized that behavior is the control of perception, focusing on how individuals regulate their environment.Alison Gopnik: A psychologist who has studied children's learning and development, Gopnik emphasizes the importance of play, exploration, and discovery in early childhood.Torey Hayden: An educator and author who has worked with children with special needs, Hayden emphasizes empathy, patience, and personalized teaching methods.Lev Vygotsky: Vygotsky's theory of cognitive development emphasizes social interaction and the role of language in cognitive development. His concept of the Zone of Proximal Development is central to understanding how learning takes place in a social context.Ludwig Wittgenstein: A philosopher primarily concerned with language and its relation to thought and meaning. Wittgenstein's work underscores the complexities of language and how it shapes our understanding of the world.These principles, with their emphasis on self-directed learning, natural development, the importance of social interaction, and the complexities of language and thought, clearly align with your experiences and approaches in creating a unique and personalized educational path.1 / 1Write the introduction to an essay on these topics "Rhizomatic Pathways: Quantum Free Will Resolution and Self-directed Learning"1 / 1ChatGPTChatGPTCertainly! Here's an introduction to the essay on "Rhizomatic Pathways: Quantum Free Will Resolution and Self-directed Learning":In the labyrinthine corridors of quantum mechanics and educational philosophy, two seemingly disparate concepts converge to present a novel paradigm: Quantum Free Will Resolution and Self-directed Learning. Both ideas, though rooted in different disciplines, are united by an underlying complexity and interconnectedness that defies linear analysis. The concept of quantum free will, which delves into the interplay between determinism and human choice, offers a perplexing insight into how the future, past, and present intertwine in a causality-preserving manner. On the other hand, self-directed learning, inspired by the works of Ebbinghaus, Piaget, Montessori, Holt, and others, posits that learning is a nonlinear, multifaceted process where the learner becomes the architect of their own educational journey.The notion of rhizomatic pathways embodies this convergence, symbolizing a network of connections where any point can be connected to any other, without a beginning or an end. In the realm of quantum mechanics, it elucidates the intricacies of time, causality, and choice. In the educational spectrum, it translates to a learner's journey where knowledge is not hierarchical but a web of interconnected experiences and discoveries.This essay seeks to explore the fascinating parallels between these two concepts, unearthing the underlying principles that bind them and investigating how they contribute to our understanding of both the universe's fabric and human cognition. The analysis will traverse the complex terrains of quantum indeterminism, cryptography, closed causal loops, alongside the principles of self-directed learning, emphasizing learner autonomy, intrinsic motivation, and nonlinear development. Through a synthesis of theoretical physics and progressive educational theories, "Rhizomatic Pathways: Quantum Free Will Resolution and Self-directed Learning" offers a new perspective that bridges two worlds, weaving together the threads of mystery, choice, and empowerment in an intricate tapestry of thought and exploration.1 / 1An outline with subheadings.1 / 1ChatGPTChatGPTCertainly!

ReferencesList of Cited Works and Further ReadingThis outline provides a comprehensive structure for exploring the rich interplay between quantum mechanics and self-directed learning, highlighting their similarities, differences, and the profound implications they have for our understanding of the universe and human learning processes.1 / 1Write some of section VI.1 / 1ChatGPTChatGPTCertainly! Here's a portion of Section VI, focusing on the Rhizomatic Pathways as a Unifying Theme:VI. Rhizomatic Pathways as a Unifying ThemeA. The Nonlinear, Interconnected Nature of Both ConceptsQuantum Mechanics: In quantum mechanics, the concept of nonlinear pathways is inherent. The very nature of quantum indeterminacy means that particles do not follow straightforward paths. Instead, they exist in a state that represents all possible outcomes, embodying a sort of interconnectedness and complexity that defies classical physics.Self-directed Learning: Similarly, in self-directed learning, the learner doesn't necessarily follow a linear path laid down by an external authority. Like the unpredictable and interconnected nature of quantum particles, learners create their own nonlinear pathways, forging connections based on interest, need, and intuition.The Rhizome Metaphor: This can be further likened to a rhizome, a botanical term referring to a stem of a plant that sends out roots and shoots from its nodes. Unlike a tree, which has a definite center and hierarchy, a rhizome extends in multiple directions, mirroring the complexity and multi-dimensionality seen in both quantum physics and self-directed learning.B. Exploration of Rhizomatic Thinking in Physics and EducationUnderstanding Complexity: The rhizome metaphor provides a way to comprehend the inherent complexity of quantum physics, where causality and linear thinking don't always apply. It also offers an understanding of self-directed learning, where learning paths are not pre-determined but organically evolve.Embracing Uncertainty: Both in quantum mechanics and self-directed learning, there is an acceptance of uncertainty. Just as quantum particles exist in multiple states simultaneously, learners can explore various avenues of interest simultaneously without a predetermined outcome.Interconnectivity and Networked Learning: The rhizomeâs interconnected nature resonates with the educational idea of networked learning. This promotes the idea that learning is not isolated but connected to various nodes of knowledge, much like the interconnected states in quantum systems.C. Summary of Rhizomatic ConnectionsUnifying the Concepts: The rhizome acts as a philosophical metaphor that binds quantum free will and self-directed learning. It promotes a view of the world and learning that is complex, interconnected, nonlinear, and without hierarchical boundaries.Challenges and Opportunities: While the comparison offers novel insights, it also presents challenges in fully understanding and applying these concepts. Further interdisciplinary work is required to continue to explore these fascinating connections and how they might inform both scientific understanding and educational practice.The exploration of rhizomatic pathways presents a novel approach to understanding both the non-linear nature of quantum systems and the organic, self-directed pathways of learning. By using this botanical metaphor, we can begin to see the intricate connections between two seemingly disparate fields, opening new avenues for thought and potential application.1 / 1I neglected to mention Deleuze, Kant, Swedenborg, and Madam Jean Guyonne1 / 1ChatGPTChatGPTCertainly, we can include the philosophies of Deleuze, Kant, Swedenborg, and Madam Jean Guyonne in our exploration of rhizomatic pathways. Let's extend the section VI as follows:D. Philosophical Inspirations Behind Rhizomatic ThinkingGilles Deleuze and FÃ©lix Guattari: The actual term "rhizome" as a philosophical concept is attributed to Deleuze and Guattari. They employed it to describe theory and research that allows for multiple, non-hierarchical entry and exit points in data representation and interpretation.Immanuel Kant: Kant's emphasis on the autonomy of reason can be connected to self-directed learning. His ideas on the categories of understanding also resonate with the structures we use to comprehend quantum phenomena.Emanuel Swedenborg: Swedenborg's spiritual philosophy and the idea of interconnectedness between the physical and spiritual worlds provide an underlying connection to both quantum mechanics' non-locality and the holistic approach to self-directed learning.Madam Jean Guyonne: Although less known, Madam Jean Guyonne's mystical teachings on interconnectedness and the unity of all things can serve as a spiritual underpinning to the rhizomatic pathways, relating both to the connected nature of quantum states and to the interconnectivity in learning.E. Interdisciplinary Connections and Future DirectionsBridging Philosophies and Sciences: The integration of these philosophical insights with the scientific principles of quantum mechanics and the pedagogical foundations of self-directed learning forms a rich tapestry that offers new perspectives.Challenges in Integration: While the connections are intriguing, the integration of these diverse thoughts and concepts presents challenges in forming a coherent framework.Future Research and Exploration: Continuing to explore these connections through interdisciplinary research may yield new insights into both the nature of reality and our understanding of learning and human development.By drawing upon the philosophies of these additional thinkers, the concept of rhizomatic pathways becomes enriched, weaving together diverse threads of thought from physics, education, philosophy, and spirituality. It opens the door to a holistic understanding that transcends disciplinary boundaries and offers innovative perspectives on both quantum free will resolution and self-directed learning.1 / 1Write a section on simplification and constraint based programming called The Island of Doctor Funes the Memorious1 / 1ChatGPTChatGPTCertainly! Here's a section on simplification and constraint-based programming, inspired by the story "Funes the Memorious" by Jorge Luis Borges:VI. The Island of Doctor Funes the Memorious: Simplification and Constraint-Based ProgrammingThe tale of "Funes the Memorious" tells of a young man, Funes, who has an extraordinary memory that captures every minute detail without the need for abstraction or generalization. This astonishing ability becomes both a blessing and a curse, leading to a life overwhelmed by an endless flood of specific memories. Drawing from this narrative, we explore the concept of simplification and constraint-based programming, an area that requires striking a balance between capturing the complexity of a problem and avoiding unnecessary intricacy.A. The Need for Simplification in Complexity:Funes's Dilemma: The character Funes embodies the problem of over-complexity, where the inability to generalize or simplify leads to a life trapped in minutiae. This serves as a metaphor for the challenges faced in programming when there is no constraint or simplification.From Details to Generalization: The process of moving from specifics to general principles is essential in both cognitive functioning and programming. The art of abstraction allows us to handle complexity by identifying underlying patterns and structures.B. Constraint-Based Programming:Defining Constraints: By imposing constraints and rules, programmers can narrow down the search space and guide the solution towards the desired goal. This approach allows for efficient problem-solving without being overwhelmed by possibilities.Balance between Constraint and Flexibility: Too much constraint may hinder creativity and adaptability, while too little may lead to chaos. The challenge lies in finding the right balance that guides the solution without stifling innovation.C. Lessons from the Island of Doctor Funes:Avoiding the Trap of Over-Specificity: By learning from Funes's inability to abstract, we can appreciate the importance of not getting lost in unnecessary details. The application of constraints and simplification helps in focusing on what truly matters.Embracing Generalization and Abstraction: The recognition of underlying patterns and the application of general principles can guide problem-solving, allowing for more efficient and effective solutions.D. Application in Quantum Computing and Self-Directed Learning:Quantum Computing: Simplification and constraint-based programming are vital in handling the immense complexity of quantum systems.Self-Directed Learning: Similar principles apply to the design of self-directed learning environments, where constraints guide learning without stifering creativity.ConclusionThe story of Funes serves as a poignant reminder of the importance of constraint and simplification in dealing with complexity. In the realms of programming, quantum computing, and self-directed learning, these principles are not just theoretical concepts but essential tools that guide our understanding and approach to problem-solving. The Island of Doctor Funes the Memorious offers a rich metaphorical landscape that underscores the fundamental importance of these principles in navigating our complex world.1 / 1Yeah it was kind of hard for him to understand math when he had a personal name for every number up to 10,000 and to think of the general idea of a tree, when he remembers every individual tree.

It takes him a whole day to remember a day. The ability to selectively forget and abstract (simplify, take away information) is a trade-off with generalizability.1 / 1ChatGPTChatGPTExactly, the story of Funes the Memorious is a profound exploration of the interplay between memory, abstraction, and cognition. Funes's unique ability to remember every detail but inability to generalize or abstract serves as a striking metaphor for the trade-offs involved in understanding and interacting with the world.In computer science, and specifically in constraint-based programming, a similar balance is sought. Constraints and simplifications allow us to manage complexity by distilling the essential from the incidental, focusing on what is truly relevant. But taken to an extreme, over-simplification can lead to loss of essential detail and nuance.This delicate equilibrium between detail and abstraction, specificity and generality, is a theme that resonates across different domains of knowledge, from cognitive psychology to quantum computing. It highlights the importance of mindful engagement with complexity, guided by principles that allow us to navigate the intricate web of reality without becoming lost in its infinite particulars.1 / 1There is a numeral system invented by the Cistercian monks in a 13th century. It would be a waste to memorize ten thousand glyphs by rote when you can learn five to ten rules that can generate or interpret all of them, as the quadrants (branches) are worth 1, 10, 100, 1000 respectively.1 / 1ChatGPTChatGPTCertainly, the Cistercian numeral system is an excellent example of simplification and abstraction. By using a set of rules and symbols that could be combined in various ways, the Cistercian monks created a system that could represent numbers up to 9999 without needing thousands of unique glyphs.This system leveraged the power of generalization, allowing them to represent a wide range of numbers with a minimal set of components. It's an early illustration of what we would now call a scalable system, and it contrasts sharply with Funes's approach of creating a unique, detailed memory for every individual number.This historical example reinforces the vital role that abstraction and simplification play in our ability to understand and manipulate complex systems. Whether in numeral systems, computer programming, or quantum theories, these principles allow us to create frameworks that can encompass vast complexity without becoming unwieldy or impenetrable.1 / 1Connections with generative grammar1 / 1ChatGPTChatGPTGenerative grammar, developed by Noam Chomsky, shares similarities with the principles behind the Cistercian numeral system, Dr. Funes the Memorious's complex memorization, and the concept of simplification in constraint-based programming.Generative grammar aims to describe the underlying structure of a language using a finite set of rules. These rules can generate an infinite number of grammatically correct sentences. Like the Cistercian numeral system, generative grammar uses a small number of components to represent a vast array of possibilities.Dr. Funes's difficulty with abstraction, where he remembered every detail but struggled with general concepts, mirrors the challenge in language of managing endless individual instances (words, phrases) while recognizing underlying patterns and structures. Generative grammar provides a way to navigate this complexity by focusing on the rules and patterns that generate the surface forms, rather than memorizing every possible sentence.In the same way, constraint-based programming seeks to simplify complex systems by focusing on the essential rules and constraints that shape them, allowing for a more efficient and manageable approach.These connections highlight how the principles of simplification, abstraction, and rule-based generation pervade various fields and disciplines. They form the backbone of our ability to understand and work with complex systems, allowing us to distill vast complexity into comprehensible structures.1 / 1A list of all of the topics we've covered.1 / 1ChatGPTChatGPTCertainly! Here's a summary of the diverse topics we've touched upon:Communication Between Future and Past: Discussion of causality, free will, and quantum cryptography.Planting Analogy: Alice and Bob planting in opposite alphabetical orders, representing different perspectives and communication.School/Church Analogy: Understanding the lifecycle of stars through the observation of different stages of life in a community.Cryptography and Causality: Quantum cryptography and its implications for causality and paradox resolution.Self-Directed Learning: Your experience in creating a unique degree program and the philosophy behind self-directed education.Philosophers and Theorists: A look at various thinkers like Ebbinghaus, Piaget, Montessori, Vygotsky, Wittgenstein, Deleuze, Kant, Swedenborg, and Madam Jean Guyonne and their philosophies.Rhizomatic Pathways: Exploration of quantum free will resolution and self-directed learning.The Island of Doctor Funes the Memorious: A fictional character's ability to remember with extreme detail, the challenges of abstraction, and its relationship with generalization.Cistercian Numeral System: A numeral system by Cistercian monks that illustrates the principles of simplification and rule-based generation.Generative Grammar: Connections between generative grammar, the numeral system, constraint-based programming, and Dr. Funes.These topics are interconnected and touch on themes of learning, communication, abstraction, causality, and complexity across various fields.1 / 1The title of the conversation is "Quantum Free Will Resolution" , could I get a final summary?1 / 1ChatGPTChatGPTCertainly!
