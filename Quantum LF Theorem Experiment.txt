Abstract
A recent paper by two of us and co-workers [1], based on an extended Wigner's friend scenario, demonstrated that certain empirical correlations predicted by quantum theory (QT) violate inequalities derived from a set of metaphysical assumptions we called "Local Friendliness" (LF). These assumptions are strictly weaker than those used for deriving Bell inequalities. Crucial to the theorem was the premise that a quantum system with reversible evolution could be an observer (colloquially, a "friend"). However, that paper was noncommittal on what would constitute an observer for the purpose of an experiment. Here, we present a new LF no-go theorem which takes seriously the idea that a system's having 
t

s
 is a sufficient condition for it to be an observer. Our new derivation of the LF inequalities uses four metaphysical assumptions, three of which are thought-related, including one that is explicitly called "Friendliness". These four assumptions, in conjunction, allow one to derive LF inequalities for experiments involving the type of system that "Friendliness" refers to. In addition to these four metaphysical assumptions, this new no-go theorem requires two assumptions about what is

 feasible: Human-Level Artificial Intelligence, and Universal Quantum Computing which is fast and large scale. The latter is often motivated by the belief that QT is universal, but this is

 an assumption of the theorem. The intent of the new theorem is to give a clear goal for future experimentalists, and a clear motivation for trying to achieve that goal. We review various approaches to QT in light of our theorem. The popular stance that "quantum theory needs no interpretation" does not question any of our assumptions and so is ruled out. Finally, we quantitatively discuss how difficult the experiment we envisage would be, and briefly discuss milestones on the paths towards it.

Popular summary
In recent years, new theorems in the foundations of physics have reawakened interest in the idea of Wigner���s friend ��� an extrapolation of the Schrodinger���s cat thought experiment. In particular, two of us and co-workers showed that certain correlations predicted by quantum theory violate inequalities derived from a set of theory-independent assumptions which we called ���Local Friendliness���. Our theorem is similar to the strongest versions of Bell���s theorem, but, crucially, it is an even stronger theorem, in that the inequalities are derived using a strictly smaller set of assumptions. However, unlike Bell���s theorem (but like all recent Wigner���s friend theorems), the Local Friendliness theorem has the technological assumption that it is possible to reverse an observation performed by a friend. This raises an obvious objection: this technological assumption is not plausible if the friend is a human being. Here we address that objection by proposing a (very challenging) experiment in which the technological assumption is plausible, for a being who could be broadly accepted as a friend. This being, QUALL-E by name, is a quantum computer running a human-level artificial intelligence algorithm. In addition to estimating just how challenging such an experiment would be, we formulate a new theorem, tailored for this experiment. We dub it a Thoughtful Local Friendliness theorem, as three of its assumptions are thought-related, including one that is explicitly called ���Friendliness���. The intent of the new theorem is to give a clear goal for future experimentalists, and a clear motivation for trying to achieve that goal, by using assumptions that are widely held and not reliant on the universality of quantum mechanics. The popular stance that ���quantum theory needs no interpretation��� does not question any of our assumptions and so is ruled out by our theorem.

The article from "Quantum," the open journal for quantum science, presents an intriguing development in quantum theory and experimentation. The authors, Howard M. Wiseman, Eric G. Cavalcanti, and Eleanor G. Rieffel, have introduced a new theorem called the "Thoughtful Local Friendliness (LF) no-go theorem." This theorem is an advancement from previous work in quantum theory, specifically building upon the concept of Wigner���s friend, which itself is an extension of the Schr��dinger's cat thought experiment.
Key aspects of this theorem include:
Local Friendliness Assumptions
: The LF no-go theorem is based on a set of metaphysical assumptions called "Local Friendliness," which are weaker than those used for deriving Bell inequalities. This new theorem focuses on the premise that a quantum system capable of reversible evolution could be considered an observer.
Defining an Observer
: A crucial aspect of this theorem is the definition of an observer. The authors propose that the ability to have thoughts is a sufficient condition for a system to be considered an observer. This is a significant shift from previous theories and leads to new possibilities in quantum experimentation.
Technological Assumptions
: The theorem makes two technological assumptions: the existence of Human-Level Artificial Intelligence and the feasibility of Universal Quantum Computing on a large scale. These assumptions are vital for the experimental approach proposed by the authors but are not based on the universality of quantum theory.
QUALL-E Experiment
: The article suggests a prospective experiment involving QUALL-E, an advanced quantum computer running a human-level AI algorithm. This experiment aims to test the LF theorem under conditions where the observer (QUALL-E) observes a quantum system and may have its observation reversed.
Interpretations of Quantum Theory
: The authors discuss various approaches to Quantum Theory in light of their theorem. They argue that the popular stance of "quantum theory needs no interpretation" is inadequate as it does not question any of the assumptions made in the LF theorem.
Challenges and Future Directions
: The article acknowledges the technological and theoretical challenges in conducting such an experiment and outlines the potential milestones needed to achieve it.
This development represents a significant step in understanding quantum mechanics, particularly in relation to the role of observers and consciousness in quantum experiments. The proposal of an experiment using a quantum computer as an observer opens new avenues for testing and interpreting quantum theory.
You
So what might that mean, reversible system as an observer?
ChatGPT
ChatGPT
The concept of a reversible system serving as an observer in quantum mechanics, as discussed in the article from "Quantum," relates to a few fundamental ideas in quantum theory:
Reversible System
: In quantum mechanics, a reversible system is one where the evolution of the system's state can be reversed back to its original state. This reversibility is a core feature of quantum systems, contrasting with many classical systems where processes are often irreversible.
Observer in Quantum Mechanics
: Traditionally, an observer in quantum mechanics is any entity that can measure or interact with a quantum system, causing the system to transition from a superposition of states to a definite state, a process known as "wave function collapse."
Combining Reversibility and Observation
: The intriguing aspect of considering a reversible system as an observer lies in the potential to observe a quantum system, induce a state change (like a wave function collapse), and then reverse both the observer and the observed system back to their original states. This challenges traditional notions of measurement and observation in quantum mechanics, where measurements are typically seen as fundamentally irreversible processes.
Implications for Quantum Theory
: If an observer can be part of a reversible quantum system, it opens up new theoretical and experimental possibilities. It suggests that the act of observation might not irreversibly collapse a quantum state, but rather that this process could be part of a larger, reversible quantum evolution. This could have profound implications for understanding quantum entanglement, superposition, and the role of consciousness or information processing in quantum theory.
Experimental Considerations
: Experimentally, realizing a reversible observer involves significant technological and theoretical challenges. It requires creating systems where both the observer's and the observed's states can be precisely controlled and reversed, which is an advanced task in quantum computing and quantum information science.
In summary, the idea of a reversible system as an observer challenges and expands traditional concepts in quantum mechanics, potentially leading to new insights into the nature of observation, measurement, and the role of information in quantum systems.
