Abstract. Phase spaces as given by the Wigner distribution function pro- 
vide a natural description of inf i nite-dimensional quantum systems. They 
are an important tool in quantum optics and have been widely applied 
in the context of time���frequency analysis and pseudo-dif f erential opera- 
tors. Phase-space distribution functions are usually specif i ed via integral 
transformations or convolutions which can be averted and subsumed by 
(displaced) parity operators proposed in this work. Building on earlier 
work for Wigner distribution functions (Grossmann in Commun Math 
Phys 48(3):191���194, 1976. https://doi.org/10.1007/BF01617867), parity 
operators give rise to a general class of distribution functions in the form 
of quantum-mechanical expectation values. This enables us to precisely 
characterize the mathematical existence of general phase-space distribu- 
tion functions. We then relate these distribution functions to the so-called 
Cohen class (Cohen in J Math Phys 7(5):781���786, 1966. https://doi.org/ 
10.1063/1.1931206) and recover various quantization schemes and distri- 
bution functions from the literature. The parity operator approach is also 
applied to the Born���Jordan distribution which originates from the Born��� 
Jordan quantization (Born and Jordan in Z Phys 34(1):858���888, 1925. 
https://doi.org/10.1007/BF01328531). The corresponding parity opera- 
tor is written as a weighted average of both displacements and squeezing 
operators, and we determine its generalized spectral decomposition. This 
leads to an ef i cient computation of the Born���Jordan parity operator in 
the number-state basis, and example quantum states reveal unique fea- 
tures of the Born���Jordan distribution.

1. Introduction 
There are at least three logically independent descriptions of quantum me- 
chanics: the Hilbert space formalism [31], the path-integral method [49], and 
the phase-space approach such as given by the Wigner function [24,32,52,69, 
75,84,109,111,125]. The phase-space formulation of quantum mechanics was 
initiated by Wigner in his ground-breaking work [123] from 1932, in which 
the Wigner function of a spinless non-relativistic quantum particle was intro- 
duced as a quasi-probability distribution. The Wigner function can be used to 
express quantum-mechanical expectation values as classical phase-space aver- 
ages. More than a decade later, Groenewold [63] and Moyal [99] formulated 
quantum mechanics as a statistical theory on a classical phase space by map- 
ping a quantum state to its Wigner function and they interpreted this corre- 
spondence as the inverse of the Weyl quantization [119���121]. 
Coherent states have become a natural way to extend phase spaces to 
more general physical systems [5,8���11,13,21,54,100]. In this regard, a new 
focus on phase-space representations for coupled, i nite-dimensional quantum 
systems (as spin systems) [53,76���82,87,106,108,115] and their tomographic 
reconstructions [81,85,86,107] has emerged recently. A spherical phase-space 
representation of a single, i nite-dimensional quantum system has been used to 
naturally recover the inf i nite-dimensional phase space in the large-spin limit 
[78,81]. These spherical phase spaces have been def i ned in terms of quantum- 
mechanical expectation values of rotated parity operators [77,78,81,87,108, 
115] (as discussed below) in analogy with displaced ref l ection operators in l at 
phase spaces. But in the current work, we exclusively focus on the (usual) 
inf i nite-dimensional case which has Heisenberg���Weyl symmetries [21,54,90, 
100]. This case has been playing a crucial role in characterizing the quantum 
theory of light [59] via coherent states and displacement operators [3,4,22,23] 
and has also been widely used in the context of time���frequency analysis and 
pseudo-dif f erential operators [16���18,28,29,43,44,62]. Many particular phase 
spaces have been unif i ed under the concept of the so-called Cohen class [28, 
29,44] (see Def i nition 2), i.e., all functions which are related to the Wigner 
function via a convolution with a distribution (which is also known as the 
Cohen kernel). 
Phase-space distribution functions are mostly described by one of the 
following three forms: (a) convolved derivatives of the Wigner function [43,44], 
(b) integral transformations of a pure state (i.e., a rapidly decaying, complex- 
valued function) [16���18,28,29,43,44,123], or (c) as integral transformations 
of quantum-mechanical expectation values [3,4,22,23]. Also, Wigner functions 
(and the corresponding Weyl quantization) are usually described by integral 
transformations. But the seminal work of Grossmann [44,64] (refer also to 
[102]) allowed for a direct interpretation of the Wigner function as a quantum- 
mechanical expectation value of a displaced parity operator �� (which ref l ects 
coordinates ����(x) = ��(���x) of a quantum state ��). In particular, Grossmann 
[64] showed that the Weyl quantization of the delta distribution determines 
Phase Spaces, Parity Operators 
the parity operator ��. This approach has been widely adopted [15,25,33,36, 
52,91,103,104].

The introduction to the paper gives an overview of the existing formulations of quantum mechanics, highlighting three main approaches: the Hilbert space formalism, the path-integral method, and the phase-space approach as given by the Wigner function. The Wigner function serves as a quasi-probability distribution that allows quantum-mechanical expectations to be expressed as classical phase-space averages.
The introduction also focuses on recent developments in phase-space representations for finite-dimensional quantum systems and emphasizes the coherence states that have played a significant role in characterizing the quantum theory of light. Different forms of phase-space distribution functions, including convolved derivatives of the Wigner function, integral transformations of a pure state, and integral transformations of quantum-mechanical expectation values, are detailed.
The text also refers to Grossmann's work, which has allowed for a direct interpretation of the Wigner function as a quantum-mechanical expectation value of a displaced parity operator. This approach seems to form the basis for some of the paper's subsequent exploration.

However, parity operators similar to the one by Grossmann and Royer 
[44,64,102] have still been lacking for general phase-space distribution func- 
tions. (Note that such a form appeared implicitly for s-parametrized distri- 
bution functions in [22,98].) In the current work, we generalize the previously 
discussed parity operator �� [44,64,102] for the Wigner function by introducing 
a family of parity operators ����(refer to Def i nition 3) which is parametrized 
by a function or distribution ��. This enables us to specify general phase-space 
distribution functions in the form of quantum-mechanical expectation values 
(refer to Def i nition 4) as 
F��(��,��) := (��?)���1Tr[��D(��)����D���(��)]. 
We will refer to the above operator ����as a parity operator following the lead 
of Grossmann and Royer [64,102] and given its resemblance and close analogy 
to the ref l ection operator �� discussed in prior work [15,77,78,81,87,108,115]. 
Here, D(��) denotes the displacement operator and �� describes suitable phase- 
space coordinates (see Sect. 3.1). (Recall that ? = h/(2��) is def i ned as the 
Planck constant h divided by 2��.) The quantum-mechanical expectation val- 
ues in the preceding equation give rise to a rich family of phase-space distri- 
bution functions F��(��,��) which represent arbitrary (mixed) quantum states 
as given by their density operator ��. In particular, this family of phase-space 
representations contains all elements from the (above-mentioned) Cohen class 
and naturally includes the pivotal Husimi Q and Born���Jordan distribution 
functions. 
We would like to emphasize that our approach to phase-space repre- 
sentations averts the use of integral transformations, Fourier transforms, or 
convolutions as these are subsumed in the parity operator ����which is inde- 
pendent of the phase-space coordinate ��. Although our def i nition also relies on 
an integral transformation given by a Fourier transform, it is only applied once 
and is completely absorbed into the def i nition of a parity operator, thereby 
avoiding redundant applications of Fourier transforms. This leads to signif i cant 
advantages as compared to earlier approaches: 
��� conceptual advantages (see also [76,81,98,108,115]): 
��� The phase-space distribution function is given as a quantum-mechanical 
expectation value. This form nicely i ts with the experimental recon- 
struction of quantum states [7,14,46,68,81,93,107]. 
��� All the complexity from integral transformations (etc.) is condensed 
into the parity operator ����. 
��� The dependence on the distribution �� and the particular phase space 
is separated from the displacement D(��). 
��� computational advantages: 
��� The repeated and expensive computation of integral transformations 
(etc.) in earlier approaches is avoided as ����has to be determined 
only once. Also, the ef f ect of the displacement D(��) is relatively 
easy to calculate.

In this regard, the current work can also be seen as a continuation of [81] 
where the parity operator approach has been emphasized, but mostly for 
i nite-dimensional quantum systems. Moreover, we connect results from quan- 
tum optics [22,23,59,88], quantum harmonic analysis [30,37���40,43,44,74,118], 
and group-theoretical approaches [21,54,90,100]. It is also our aim to narrow 
the gap between dif f erent communities where phase-space methods have been 
successfully applied.
