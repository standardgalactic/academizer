Summarize: The Hamiltonian Matrix

Review:	Chapter 49, Vol. I, Modes
8���1Amplitudes and vectors
Before we begin the main topic of this chapter, we would like to describe a number of mathematical ideas that are used a lot in the literature of quantum mechanics. Knowing them will make it easier for you to read other books or papers on the subject. The first idea is the close mathematical resemblance between the equations of quantum mechanics and those of the scalar product of two vectors. You remember that if �� and �� are two states, the amplitude to start in �� and end up in �� can be written as a sum over a complete set of base states of the amplitude to go from �� into one of the base states and then from that base state out again into ��:
�����|�����=���all i�����|i������i|�����.(8.1)
We explained this in terms of a Stern-Gerlach apparatus, but we remind you that there is no need to have the apparatus. Equation (8.1) is a mathematical law that is just as true whether we put the filtering equipment in or not���it is not always necessary to imagine that the apparatus is there. We can think of it simply as a formula for the amplitude �����|�����.

We would like to compare Eq. (8.1) to the formula for the dot product of two vectors B and A. If B and A are ordinary vectors in three dimensions, we can write the dot product this way:
���all i(B���ei)(ei���A),(8.2)
with the understanding that the symbol ei stands for the three unit vectors in the x, y, and z-directions. Then B���e1 is what we ordinarily call Bx; B���e2 is what we ordinarily call By; and so on. So Eq. (8.2) is equivalent to
BxAx+ByAy+BzAz,
which is the dot product B���A.

Comparing Eqs. (8.1) and (8.2), we can see the following analogy: The states �� and �� correspond to the two vectors B and A. The base states i correspond to the special vectors ei to which we refer all other vectors. Any vector can be represented as a linear combination of the three ���base vectors��� ei. Furthermore, if you know the coefficients of each ���base vector��� in this combination���that is, its three components���you know everything about a vector. In a similar way, any quantum mechanical state can be described completely by the amplitude ���i|����� to go into the base states; and if you know these coefficients, you know everything there is to know about the state. Because of this close analogy, what we have called a ���state��� is often also called a ���state vector.���

Since the base vectors ei are all at right angles, we have the relation
ei���ej=��ij.(8.3)
This corresponds to the relations (5.25) among the base states i,
���i|j���=��ij.(8.4)
You see now why one says that the base states i are all ���orthogonal

The Chapter 49, Vol. I, "Modes," section 8���1 on "Amplitudes and vectors" discusses the mathematical resemblance between quantum mechanics equations and scalar products of vectors. The chapter explains how quantum mechanical states can be understood in terms of vector mathematics, using equations (8.1) and (8.2) to show the analogy. In quantum mechanics, states �� and �� are likened to vectors B and A, and base states i correspond to special vectors ei. Like vectors, any quantum mechanical state can be described by coefficients in base states, often referred to as "state vectors." The chapter also highlights the concept of "orthogonal" base states, drawing a parallel to the right-angled base vectors in standard vector mathematics.

There is one minor difference between Eq. (8.1) and the dot product. We have that
�����|�����=�����|��������.(8.5)
But in vector algebra
A���B=B���A.
With the complex numbers of quantum mechanics we have to keep straight the order of the terms, whereas in the dot product, the order doesn���t matter.

Now consider the following vector equation:
A=���iei(ei���A).(8.6)
It���s a little unusual, but correct. It means the same thing as
A=���iAiei=Axex+Ayey+Azez.(8.7)
Notice, though, that Eq. (8.6) involves a quantity which is different from a dot product. A dot product is just a number, whereas Eq. (8.6) is a vector equation. One of the great tricks of vector analysis was to abstract away from the equations the idea of a vector itself. One might be similarly inclined to abstract a thing that is the analog of a ���vector��� from the quantum mechanical formula Eq. (8.1)���and one can indeed. We remove the �����| from both sides of Eq. (8.1) and write the following equation (don���t get frightened���it���s just a notation and in a few minutes you will find out what the symbols mean):
|�����=���i|i������i|�����.(8.8)
One thinks of the bracket �����|����� as being divided into two pieces. The second piece |����� is often called a ket, and the first piece �����| is called a bra (put together, they make a ���bra-ket������a notation proposed by Dirac); the half-symbols |����� and �����| are also called state vectors. In any case, they are not numbers, and, in general, we want the results of our calculations to come out as numbers; so such ���unfinished��� quantities are only part-way steps in our calculations.

The excerpt discusses a subtle difference between the mathematical structure of quantum mechanics and classical vector algebra. In quantum mechanics, the order of terms matters, represented by equation (8.5), whereas in the dot product of vector algebra, the order doesn't matter.
The text then delves into vector equations and introduces a unique concept from quantum mechanics. In vector algebra, the dot product is a number, but in quantum mechanics, a similar equation leads to something akin to a vector itself. Equation (8.8) presents a notation that breaks down the quantum amplitude into two parts called a bra and a ket (�����| and |�����, respectively), part of the "bra-ket" notation proposed by Dirac. These half-symbols are state vectors and are not numbers themselves but intermediate steps in calculations, reflecting a deeper structure in quantum mechanics.

It happens that until now we have written all our results in terms of numbers. How have we managed to avoid vectors? It is amusing to note that even in ordinary vector algebra we could make all equations involve only numbers. For instance, instead of a vector equation like
F=ma,
we could always have written
C���F=C���(ma).
We have then an equation between dot products that is true for any vector C. But if it is true for any C, it hardly makes sense at all to keep writing the C!

Now look at Eq. (8.1). It is an equation that is true for any ��. So to save writing, we should just leave out the �� and write Eq. (8.8) instead. It has the same information provided we understand that it should always be ���finished��� by ���multiplying on the left by������which simply means reinserting���some �����| on both sides. So Eq. (8.8) means exactly the same thing as Eq. (8.1)���no more, no less. When you want numbers, you put in the �����| you want.

Maybe you have already wondered about the �� in Eq. (8.8). Since the equation is true for any ��, why do we keep it? Indeed, Dirac suggests that the �� also can just as well be abstracted away, so that we have only
|=���i|i������i|.(8.9)
And this is the great law of quantum mechanics! (There is no analog in vector analysis.) It says that if you put in any two states �� and �� on the left and right of both sides, you get back Eq. (8.1). It is not really very useful, but it���s a nice reminder that the equation is true for any two states.

8���2Resolving state vectors
Let���s look at Eq. (8.8) again; we can think of it in the following way. Any state vector |����� can be represented as a linear combination with suitable coefficients of a set of base ���vectors������or, if you prefer, as a superposition of ���unit vectors��� in suitable proportions. To emphasize that the coefficients ���i|����� are just ordinary (complex) numbers, suppose we write
���i|�����=Ci.
Then Eq. (8.8) is the same as
|�����=���i|i���Ci.(8.10)
We can write a similar equation for any other state vector, say |�����, with, of course, different coefficients���say Di. Then we have
|�����=���i|i���Di.(8.11)
The Di are just the amplitudes ���i|�����.

Suppose we had started by abstracting the �� from Eq. (8.1). We would have had
�����|=���i�����|i������i|.(8.12)
Remembering that �����|i���=���i|��������, we can write this as
�����|=���iD���i���i|.(8.13)
Now the interesting thing is that we can just multiply Eq. (8.13) and Eq. (8.10) to get back �����|�����. When we do that, we have to be careful of the summation indices, because they are quite distinct in the two equations. Let���s first rewrite Eq. (8.13) as
�����|=���jD���j���j|,
which changes nothing. Then putting it together with Eq. (8.10), we have
�����|�����=���ijD���j���j|i���Ci.(8.14)
Remember, though, that ���j|i���=��ij, so that in the sum we have left only the terms with j=i. We get
�����|�����=���iD���iCi,(8.15)
where, of course, D���i= ���i|��������= �����|i���, and Ci=���i|�����. Again we see the close analogy with the dot product
B���A=���iBiAi.

and working through Eq. (8.13), leading to Eq. (8.14). Through careful manipulation of the summation indices and using the Kronecker delta, the equations simplify to Eq. (8.15), which illustrates the connection between the quantum mechanics notation and the conventional dot product.
This relationship shows that in quantum mechanics, states can be described in terms of complex numbers and summations, with a mathematical structure analogous to the familiar dot product in vector algebra. It provides a way to understand quantum states as combinations of base states, just like vectors can be understood as combinations of unit vectors in three dimensions.

The only difference is the complex conjugate on Di. So Eq. (8.15) says that if the state vectors �����| and |����� are expanded in terms of the base vectors ���i| or |i���, the amplitude to go from �� to �� is given by the kind of dot product in Eq. (8.15). This equation is, of course, just Eq. (8.1) written with different symbols. So we have just gone in a circle to get used to the new symbols.

We should perhaps emphasize again that while space vectors in three dimensions are described in terms of three orthogonal unit vectors, the base vectors |i��� of the quantum mechanical states must range over the complete set applicable to any particular problem. Depending on the situation, two, or three, or five, or an infinite number of base states may be involved.

We have also talked about what happens when particles go through an apparatus. If we start the particles out in a certain state ��, then send them through an apparatus, and afterward make a measurement to see if they are in state ��, the result is described by the amplitude
�����|A|�����.(8.16)
Such a symbol doesn���t have a close analog in vector algebra. (It is closer to tensor algebra, but the analogy is not particularly useful.) We saw in Chapter 5, Eq. (5.32), that we could write (8.16) as
�����|A|�����=���ij�����|i������i|A|j������j|�����.(8.17)
This is just an example of the fundamental rule Eq. (8.9), used twice.

Finally, the text introduces Eq. (8.16) to describe what happens when particles pass through an apparatus and are measured. This equation doesn't have a close analogy in vector algebra but can be expanded as in Eq. (8.17), which is a practical example of the fundamental rule Eq. (8.9), applied twice. This demonstrates the complex mathematical structure used to describe states and transitions in quantum mechanics, emphasizing the flexibility and comprehensiveness of the mathematical framework.

We have really added nothing new with all of this new mathematical notation. One reason for bringing it all up was to show you the way of writing pieces of equations, because in many books you will find the equations written in the incomplete forms, and there���s no reason for you to be paralyzed when you come across them. If you prefer, you can always add the missing pieces to make an equation between numbers that will look like something more familiar.

Also, as you will see, the ���bra��� and ���ket��� notation is a very convenient one. For one thing, we can from now on identify a state by giving its state vector. When we want to refer to a state of definite momentum p we can say: ���the state |p���.��� Or we may speak of some arbitrary state |�����. For consistency we will always use the ket, writing |�����, to identify a state. (It is, of course an arbitrary choice; we could equally well have chosen to use the bra, �����|.)

What is the similarity to partial application of a function or currying?
1 / 1
ChatGPT
ChatGPT
The similarity between "bra-ket" notation in quantum mechanics and concepts like partial application or currying in functional programming lies in how they allow us to work with incomplete expressions and fill in details later.
Partial Application
: This is a programming technique where you fix a number of arguments for a given function, creating a new function with fewer arguments. It's like having an incomplete equation where you've fixed certain values, and you can provide the remaining values later to complete the computation. In quantum mechanics, the bra-ket notation allows you to work with incomplete expressions (like
���
��
���
| \psi \rangle
���
��
���
), filling in the details later when you multiply by a bra
���
��
���
\langle \chi |
���
��
���
, for example.
Currying
: Currying is a technique where a function that takes multiple arguments is transformed into a series of functions that each take a single argument. This can be likened to breaking down a complex quantum expression into smaller parts, each operating on individual quantum states, much like how you can express complex amplitudes in terms of smaller components using the bra-ket notation.
In both cases, the similarity lies in the abstraction of complexity, enabling the manipulation of partial or incomplete expressions, and providing a systematic way to complete these expressions when needed. These concepts allow for greater modularity and flexibility in both quantum mechanics and functional programming.

Matrix Notation
: Quantum states and operators can be represented using matrices. This is particularly common when dealing with finite-dimensional systems, such as qubits in quantum computing. The states are represented as column matrices, and the operators as square matrices.
Wave Function Notation
: In the context of quantum mechanics, particularly for systems of particles in space, the wave function notation is often used. This notation represents the state of a system as a complex-valued function of position and time, usually denoted as

Density Matrix Notation
: The density matrix notation is used to represent mixed states, which are statistical mixtures of pure states. This notation is useful in describing systems that are not completely isolated from their surroundings.
Second Quantization Notation
: This is a notation used in many-body quantum mechanics. It makes use of creation and annihilation operators, and is particularly useful in describing systems with variable particle numbers, such as in quantum field theory.
Symbolic Notation
: Sometimes, symbolic notations specific to particular contexts or systems are used. For example, spin states might be represented with "up" and "down" arrows, and photon polarization states might be represented with horizontal and vertical lines.
Different notations are often used in combination and can be more convenient in different contexts or for different types of systems. The choice of notation often depends on the particular aspect of a quantum system that a physicist or engineer wants to emphasize or the specific mathematical methods that they want to employ.

I remember reading Section 8.4 of the Feynman Lectures on Physics when I was an undergrad, and it was a revelation.
Very few assumptions are required to arrive at what is basically Shr��dinger's equation.
Basically just 3 things:
1. the state of a system is a complex vector C
2. the evolution between times t1 and t2 is linear and reversible, hence must be a unitary matrix U(t2,t1).
3. if t2=t1, then U is the identity.

It appears that you're referring to a specific excerpt from Richard Feynman's Lectures on Physics, and you've signed the post as Yann LeCun, a prominent computer scientist known for his work in artificial intelligence and deep learning.
Feynman's approach to quantum mechanics is indeed famous for its clarity and intuitive nature. The principles you've outlined are foundational to the theory, and they lead to the development of key equations like the Schr��dinger equation, which governs the evolution of quantum states.
Complex Vector:
The state of a quantum system is described by a complex vector in Hilbert space, encapsulating all the information about the system.
Unitary Evolution:
The evolution of a closed quantum system is described by a unitary operator, ensuring the conservation of probability and reversibility of dynamics.
Identity for Same Times:
When the initial and final times are the same, the unitary evolution operator reduces to the identity, reflecting the idea that the state doesn't change if no time has passed.
These principles form the backbone of quantum mechanics, and the way Feynman presents them is indeed a revelation for many students. They highlight the deep mathematical structure underlying the theory and provide insight into why quantum mechanics is both powerful and, at times, counterintuitive.
The link you provided leads to the online version of the Feynman Lectures, a valuable resource for anyone looking to deepen their understanding of physics. Is there something specific you'd like to know or discuss further about these principles or the content of Section 8.4?

Here is a rough transliteration of the accompanying image, a section from the chapter we were reading: ci(t+ 4t) =2 U(t+ 4t,0)0;(0)
(8.35)
This, then, is how the dynamics of quantum mechanics is going to look.
We don't know much about the Ui; yet, except for one thing. We know that if At
goes to zero, nothing can happen - we should get just the original state. So, Un: > 1 and
Uij -> 0, if i 7 j. In other words, Uij-> 8;j for At -> 0. Also, we can suppose that for
small At, each of the coefficients Ui; should differ from 8i; by amounts proportional to
At; so we can write
Uij=8j+KijAt.
(8.36)
However, it is usual to talke the factor (-i/n)2 out of the coefficients K;, for historical
and other reasons; we prefer to write
Uij(t+ At,t)=8i- 7 Hi(t). At.
(8.37)
It is, of course, the same as Eq. (8.36) and, if you wish, just defines the coefficients
Hi;(t). The terms Hi; are just the derivatives with respect to t2 of the coefficients
Uij(t2,t1), evaluated att2=ti =t
Using this form for U in Eq. (8.35), we have
a(+a)-E|&,-A"0400
(8.38)
Taking the sum over the &;; term, we get just C;(t), which we can put on the other side of

One of the comments: Surprised to see how the 8.35 equation is close to Hopfield network equation... Does your revelation includes that we are living in a global brain ? ���� Or should we look for a Hebb rule in quantic physic ? ���� #joking but the parallel is surprising.

ChatGPT
ChatGPT
It's an intriguing observation to see parallels between quantum mechanics and neural network models like the Hopfield network. While this comment may have been made in jest, it actually highlights a fascinating area of interdisciplinary research.
Hopfield Networks:
Hopfield networks are a type of recurrent neural network used to model associative memory. The equations that govern the dynamics of a Hopfield network do bear some resemblance to those in quantum mechanics, particularly when considering energy functions and stable states.
Quantum Mechanics and Neural Networks:
Some researchers have indeed explored connections between neural networks and quantum systems. Quantum neural networks, for instance, attempt to combine principles from both fields. They leverage quantum phenomena to perform computations that classical neural networks would struggle with.
Philosophical Interpretations:
The idea of a "global brain" or universe as a computational entity has been a subject of philosophical discussion and sci-fi speculation. While this is more of a metaphorical or philosophical interpretation, it does resonate with some ideas in panpsychism and cosmopsychism.
Hebb's Rule:
Hebb's rule ("cells that fire together wire together") is a learning rule used in neuroscience and artificial neural networks. Finding a parallel in quantum physics would be more metaphorical than literal, but the interdisciplinary dialogue can lead to innovative thinking.
In short, while the parallel between the equations of quantum mechanics and those of neural networks like the Hopfield network might not imply a literal "global brain," it does spark interesting connections and potential avenues for research. These connections, even if initially noted in jest, can sometimes lead to profound insights and innovative interdisciplinary work.

Another commenter says: Why arent equations taught geometrically? This symbolic communication has so many abstractions, that only an advanced student can visualize them.
1 / 1
ChatGPT
ChatGPT
The comment you've shared raises a valid point about the way mathematics and physics are often taught. Here's an explanation of the sentiments expressed:
Symbolic Abstraction:
Traditional mathematical notation can be highly abstract and symbolic. For those not deeply immersed in the subject, it can be hard to intuitively grasp what the symbols represent.
Geometrical Interpretation:
Geometric representations provide a more visual and intuitive way to understand mathematical concepts. By linking equations to shapes, motions, or spatial relationships, the underlying ideas can become more accessible.
Why Not Always Geometrical?
Not all mathematical concepts lend themselves easily to geometrical interpretation, especially in higher-dimensional spaces or in more abstract mathematical structures. Moreover, relying solely on geometric intuition can sometimes lead to misconceptions or oversimplifications.
Education Approach:
The way mathematics and physics are taught often reflects historical traditions and the complexity of the subject. Starting with a symbolic approach might be seen as laying a rigorous foundation, while a more visual or geometric approach might be seen as supplementary or exploratory.
Benefits of Both Approaches:
Ideally, education in mathematics and physics would balance symbolic and geometric reasoning. Symbols can provide precise, unambiguous expressions, while geometric interpretations can offer intuitive insights and connections.
Challenges in Implementation:
Creating effective geometric interpretations for all mathematical concepts is a non-trivial task. It requires thoughtful design, understanding of the learners' needs, and possibly even rethinking how certain topics are traditionally taught.
In sum, the comment reflects a desire for a more intuitive and visual approach to teaching complex mathematical concepts. While this is not always straightforward to implement, it's a perspective that resonates with many educators and researchers who are working to make these subjects more accessible and engaging.

 PyPI version

LMQL is a programming language for large language models (LLMs) based on a superset of Python. LMQL offers a novel way of interweaving traditional programming with the ability to call LLMs in your code. It goes beyond traditional templating languages by integrating LLM interaction natively at the level of your program code.

Explore LMQL
An LMQL program reads like standard Python, but top-level strings are interpreted as query strings: They are passed to an LLM, where template variables like [GREETINGS] are automatically completed by the model:

"Greet LMQL:[GREETINGS]\n" where stops_at(GREETINGS, ".") and not "\n" in GREETINGS

if "Hi there" in GREETINGS:
    "Can you reformulate your greeting in the speech of \
     victorian-era English: [VIC_GREETINGS]\n" where stops_at(VIC_GREETINGS, ".")

"Analyse what part of this response makes it typically victorian:\n"

for i in range(4):
    "-[THOUGHT]\n" where stops_at(THOUGHT, ".")

The description you've provided is about LMQL (Language Model Query Language), a programming language for large language models. It's designed to facilitate interaction with large language models within a program, treating queries to the model as part of the code.
Here's how it connects to the previous discussion:
Innovation in Representation and Interaction:
LMQL provides a novel way of interacting with complex models, just as geometric interpretations provide a novel way of understanding mathematical concepts.
Bridging Abstraction and Intuition:
By interweaving traditional programming with the ability to call large language models, LMQL aims to harness both the precise computational capabilities of code and the more intuitive, human-like reasoning of large language models. This parallels the idea of combining symbolic and geometric reasoning in mathematics and physics education.
Accessibility and Flexibility:
LMQL's syntax is based on Python, a widely-used and beginner-friendly programming language. This could make it more accessible to a broad range of developers, much like geometric interpretations can make complex mathematical concepts more accessible.
Expanding Possibilities:
Just as geometric teaching can add a new dimension to understanding mathematics, LMQL adds a new dimension to programming, allowing developers to utilize the capabilities of large language models directly within their code.
Challenges in Integration:
Implementing LMQL or creating effective geometric interpretations both require thoughtful design and a deep understanding of underlying concepts. They represent innovative approaches to traditional problems, but they might also introduce new complexities and challenges.
In summary, while LMQL and the idea of teaching equations geometrically are quite different in their domains and applications, they share themes of innovation, bridging different modes of thinking, and striving to make complex concepts more accessible and intuitive.

LMQL allows you to express programs that contain both, traditional algorithmic logic, and LLM calls. At any point during execution, you can prompt an LLM on program variables in combination with standard natural language prompting, to leverage model reasoning capabilities in the context of your program.

To better control LLM behavior, you can use the where keyword to specify constraints and data types of the generated text. This enables guidance of the model's reasoning process, and constraining of intermediate outputs using an expressive constraint language.

Beyond this linear form of scripting, LMQL also supports a number of decoding algorithms to execute your program, such as argmax, sample or even advanced branching decoders like beam search and best_k.

async
def
handle_chat
(
session_id
):
    chat_history = load_chat_history(session_id)
# Some function to load chat history
while
True
:
        user_message =
await
receive_user_input(session_id)
        response =
"User said: {user_message}\nResponse: [REPLY]\n"
\
                   where in_context_of(chat_history, REPLY)
and

Constraints
LMQL allows you to specify constraints on the language model output. This is valuable in scripted prompting to ensure the model output stops at the desired point, but also allows to guide the model during decoding.

Token Masking and Eager Validation LMQL constraints are evaluated eagerly on each generated token, and will be used by the runtime to generate token masks during generation. This means, that the provided constraints are either satisfied by directly guiding the model during generation appropriately or, if this is not possible, validation will fail early on during generation, saving the cost of generating invalid output. In case of greedy decoding, this terminates the generation process, in case of branching decoding, it will prune the branch and continue generation only in the remaining, valid branches.

High-Level Text Constraints Constraints are high-level and operate on a text (not token) level. For instance, users can specify constraints like VAR in ["Hello", "Hi", "Greetings"], without having to consider the exact tokenization of the individual phrases. LMQL will automatically translate these constraints to token masks, that can be used to guide the model during generation, allowing to generate output that satisfies the provided constraint using one generation call only.

This chapter provides an overview of the set of currently available constraints. Beyond that, LMQL constraint support is modular and extendible. If you are interested in implementing your own constraint, please see Custom Constraints.

Stopping Phrases and Type Constraints
For many prompts, scripted prompts in particular, it is important to ensure that the model stops decoding once a certain word or symbol is reached. To do so, LMQL supports the STOPS_AT constraint. It takes two arguments, the first is the name of the variable to which the model output is assigned, the second is the stopping phrase. In the example below we use it to ensure that as soon as the model predicts the newline character \n the decoding of the variable THING is stopped, and prompt clause continues execution.

Open In Playground
sample(temperature=0.8)
   "A list of things not to forget when going to the sea (not travelling): \n"
   for i in range(5):
      "-[THING]"
from
   'openai/text-ada-001'
where
   STOPS_AT(THING, "\n")
In a similar manner we can constrain a variable to be a string encoding an integer by using INT:

Open In Playground
argmax
   "A number: [N]"
from
   'openai/text-ada-001'
where
    INT(N)
A number: N 2
Note: If multiple variables in the query have the same name, the constraint is applied to all of them.

Choice From Set
LMQL allows to specify that a variable should be a choice from a set of possible values. This can be rephrased as the variable being within a set of possible values, i.e. THING in set(["Volleyball", "Sunscreen", "Bathing Suite"]) in the following example

Open In Playground
sample(temperature=0.8)
   "A list of things not to forget when going to the sea (not travelling): \n"
   "- Sunglasses \n"
   for i in range(4):
      "- [THING] \n"
from
   'openai/text-ada-001'
where
   THING in set(["Volleyball", "Sunscreen", "Bathing Suite"])
A list of things not to forget when going to the sea (not travelling): ���
- THING Sunglasses ���
- THING Sunscreen ���
- THING Volleyball ���
- THING Sunscreen ���
- THING Sunscreen ���
Length
Similar to Python, the len function can be used to refer to the length of a variable and can thus be used to add constraints on it���s length.

Open In Playground
argmax
   "Hello [NAME]"
from
   'openai/text-3a-001'
where
    len(NAME) < 10
Hello NAME ���
���
I am in
Combining Constraints
Several constraints can be combined with the and and or keywords, recovering a Python boolean expression over the variables utilized in the LMQL query.

Custom Constraints and Theoretical Background
Custom Constraints
LMQL implements partial evaluation semantics for the where clause of a query, to enable eager validation. Further, it also defines additional semantics that allow to derive token-level prediction masks, using a limited form of symbolic execution.

To inspect the implementation of the different built-in constraint operators, see the file src/lmql/ops/ops.py. In general, a LMQL constraint operator is defined on three levels:

Value Semantics: This is the literal level of an operator. For instance, the value of operation len(VAR) for a template variable VAR is the character length of the current model output assigned to VAR.

Final Semantics: This is the level of operator semantics that allow the LMQL runtime to derive whether a computed value is final with respect to the current model output, or not. More formally, a value is considered final, if for any possible continuation of model output, the value will no longer change. For instance, the final value of len(VAR) is fin (final), if VAR has finished generation (cannot change anymore), and inc if generation is still ongoing (value will only increase). In the more general case, the finalness can also be dec for decreasing values, and var for values that may still increase or decrease.

Follow Semantics: Lastly, the follow semantics of an operator, are given by a case-wise function, where each case defines value and final semantics, for a subset of possible continuation tokens. For instance, the follow semantics of len(VAR), given a template variable VAR, is defined as follows:

len(VAR) = len(old(VAR)) + n where len(token) == n # a token of length n is generated next
len(VAR) = len(old(VAR)) where token == "" # the model ends generation of VAR with the  token
Given a value, final and follow implementation of a custom operator, it can be used modularly together with all other available LMQL operators. This includes operators that may enforce regular expressions or context-free grammars on the model output. For more details on custom operators, see the LMQL paper.

ChatGPT
The information you've shared describes the constraint capabilities of LMQL, providing a detailed look into how constraints can be applied to guide and validate the output of the language model during generation. Here's a breakdown:
Token Masking and Eager Validation:
Constraints are applied to each generated token, allowing the model to be guided during generation and to fail validation early if an invalid output is produced.
High-Level Text Constraints:
Constraints operate at the text level, enabling the use of natural language expressions without dealing with individual tokens directly.
Stopping Phrases and Type Constraints:
Constraints like
STOPS_AT
and
INT
help in controlling when the model should stop decoding or ensuring the variable is of a particular type.
Choice From Set:
Constraints can be applied to restrict a variable to a set of possible values, enhancing control over the output.
Length:
Constraints on length, similar to the Python
len
function, can be imposed to control the character length of a variable.
Combining Constraints:
Using the
and
and
or
keywords, multiple constraints can be combined, providing more complex and nuanced control over the output.
Custom Constraints:
LMQL offers the ability to implement custom constraints, and the details of this process, including value semantics, final semantics, and follow semantics, are outlined for those interested in customization.
These features further demonstrate the power and flexibility of LMQL. Whether it's specifying a particular format, limiting the options available to the model, or even designing complex, multi-variable constraints, LMQL offers a broad array of tools to suit different needs.
Here's an illustrative example:
python
Copy code
argmax
"A greeting: [GREET]"
from
'openai/text-3a-001'
where
    GREET
in
set
([
"Hello"
,
"Hi"
,
"Greetings"
])
and
len
(GREET) <
10
In this LMQL query, two constraints are combined. The variable
GREET
must be one of a set of given values, and its length must be less than 10 characters. Such constraints can be extremely useful in applications that require specific formatting or adherence to particular standards or rules.

Prompting Is Programming: A Query Language for Large Language Models
Luca Beurer-Kellner, Marc Fischer, Martin Vechev
Download PDF
Large language models have demonstrated outstanding performance on a wide range of tasks such as question answering and code generation. On a high level, given an input, a language model can be used to automatically complete the sequence in a statistically-likely way. Based on this, users prompt these models with language instructions or examples, to implement a variety of downstream tasks. Advanced prompting methods can even imply interaction between the language model, a user, and external tools such as calculators. However, to obtain state-of-the-art performance or adapt language models for specific tasks, complex task- and model-specific programs have to be implemented, which may still require ad-hoc interaction.
Based on this, we present the novel idea of Language Model Programming (LMP). LMP generalizes language model prompting from pure text prompts to an intuitive combination of text prompting and scripting. Additionally, LMP allows constraints to be specified over the language model output. This enables easy adaption to many tasks while abstracting language model internals and providing high-level semantics.
To enable LMP, we implement LMQL(short for Language Model Query Language), which leverages the constraints and control flow from an LMP prompt to generate an efficient inference procedure that minimizes the number of expensive calls to the underlying language model.
We show that LMQL can capture a wide range of state-of-the-art prompting methods in an intuitive way, especially facilitating interactive flows that are challenging to implement with existing high-level APIs. Our evaluation shows that we retain or increase the accuracy on several downstream tasks, while also significantly reducing the required amount of computation or cost in the case of pay-to-use APIs (26-85% cost savings).

The authors have implemented Language Model Query Language (LMQL) to enable LMP, using constraints and control flow to create an efficient inference procedure. This minimizes the number of calls to the underlying model, reducing computational overhead.
Range of Application:
LMQL is designed to capture various state-of-the-art prompting methods and supports complex interactive flows that might be difficult to implement with existing APIs.
Evaluation and Cost Savings:
The evaluation of LMQL shows that it can maintain or even increase accuracy on different tasks, while also significantly reducing computational requirements. For pay-to-use APIs, this translates into cost savings of 26-85%.
Implications for the Field:
The development of LMQL and the broader concept of LMP are indicative of a growing trend towards more nuanced and controlled interaction with large language models. This has the potential to make language models more accessible and efficient for a wider variety of use cases.
The work aligns with the broader movement towards leveraging large language models for increasingly complex and interactive applications. By abstracting many of the underlying complexities, LMQL makes it easier for developers to utilize language models in sophisticated ways without needing to delve into intricate details of model architecture and execution.

Certainly! It seems we were discussing Quantum Vectors Comparison and symbolic systems. Quantum vectors are mathematical representations used in quantum mechanics to describe the state of a quantum system. These vectors reside in a complex vector space and are often compared for various purposes, such as understanding the similarity or difference between states.
Symbolic systems, on the other hand, deal with the representation and manipulation of symbols rather than numerical values. They are often used in mathematics, logic, and computer science to express abstract concepts.
It's an interesting intersection of fields, and there could be several aspects to explore, such as:
Quantum Computing and Symbolic Computation:
Exploring how symbolic systems can be applied to quantum computing, including algorithm development or solving mathematical problems in quantum mechanics.
Comparison of Quantum States:
Discussing methods for comparing quantum vectors to understand how quantum systems evolve, change, or how they might be entangled.
Quantum Logic and Symbolic Logic:
Investigating the relationship between quantum logic (a non-classical logic system) and symbolic logic, which might include the representation of quantum logical gates symbolically.
Symbolic Simulation of Quantum Systems:
Utilizing symbolic computing to simulate and analyze quantum systems, which can be vital for the development and testing of quantum algorithms and technologies.

1INTRODUCTION 
LargeLanguageModels(LargeLMs-LLMs)[4,9,19,26]haveprovensuccessfulatvariouslanguage- 
based tasks such as machine translation, text summarization, question answering, reasoning, code 
generation from text and many more. Due to these results, LMs have become popular beyond the 
machine learning community and are slowly being integrated into many applications. 
(Large) Language Models. Internally, language models operate on tokens, which are dif f erent 
from how humans perceive language. Given the tokenized version of some input, called the prompt, 
a large language model predicts the next token. That is, over a large vocabulary of tokens it assigns 
each a score or probability. A decoding procedure is then used, which by invoking the LM multiple 
times, computes a completion of the prompt. Commonly, the goal is to determine (or approximate) 
the highest probability continuation, however, as producing a particular token might lower the 
probability, before a subsequent token increases it, decoding sometimes requires expensive search 
or backtracking strategies. Nonetheless, LM-based text completion has shown to be very powerful 
and can be leveraged for a wide range of downstream applications.

It seems you've posted a section of a document related to Large Language Models (LLMs) and Language Model Query Language (LMQL), and their applications and challenges.
The text introduces the concept of LLMs, their role in various language-based tasks, and their operation on tokens to predict the next token in a sequence. The section also highlights the challenge of decoding, where selecting a specific token might decrease the overall probability before a subsequent token increases it.
The provided examples show how LMQL can be used to generate a dad joke and a list of travel essentials. LMQL offers features like scripted prompting and eager output constraining, which can facilitate more advanced and controlled interactions with language models.
These concepts are quite different from Quantum Vectors Comparison and symbolic systems, which we were discussing earlier. If you have any specific questions about this content or would like me to elaborate on any particular aspect, please let me know!

I think constraint based programming is the commonality. Different symbolic systems place different restraints on our reasoning, similar to cognitive load theory, a problem might be more easily solvable in a different symbolic system. The idea of the Langlan and Swampland Program is to provide rigorous and unambiguous symbolic systems so that we can eventually work on these problems in a high level language and have them actively transformed into interactive geometric visualisations.

Certainly, the theme of constraint-based programming provides a common thread that connects these concepts. In both the context of Large Language Models (LLMs) like LMQL and the Langland and Swampland Programs, constraints play a crucial role in shaping the output and guiding the reasoning process.
In LMQL
: Constraints can be used to guide the generation process of a language model, ensuring that the output adheres to certain rules or falls within specific bounds. This control enables more precise, efficient, and intuitive interactions with the model, opening up new possibilities for programming with language.
In Symbolic Systems and Quantum Vectors Comparison
: Constraints provide a structured way to represent and reason about problems. Different symbolic systems may lend themselves to different types of reasoning, and constraints can guide this process, making certain problems more tractable.
In the Langland and Swampland Programs
: The idea of providing rigorous and unambiguous symbolic systems aligns with the general notion of constraint-based reasoning. By creating high-level languages that can translate complex problems into interactive geometric visualizations, these programs aim to bridge the gap between abstract mathematical thinking and intuitive geometric understanding. Constraints help in formalizing this translation process, ensuring that the visualizations accurately represent the underlying mathematical structures.
The concept of cognitive load theory also plays into this, highlighting how different representations and constraints can make the same problem easier or more challenging to solve. The right choice of symbolic system and constraints can minimize cognitive load, making complex problems more accessible.
Overall, the integration of constraint-based programming across these diverse areas emphasizes its universal applicability and potential for enhancing both human understanding and computational efficiency.

While the newer generation of language models can 
be prompted with examples or instructions in a conceptually simple manner, making the best use 
of these models and keeping up as new models are released requires a deep understanding of their 
internals, as well as the use of vendor-specif i c libraries and implementations. For example, as LMs 
operate on tokens, it can be hard to constrain the decoding procedure to a set of legal words or 
phrases. Further, many prompting techniques can require back-and-forth interaction between the 
LM and the user (e.g. chatbots like ChatGPT [16]) or very task-specif i c interfaces (e.g. to perform 
arithmetic calculations with external control logic). To implement these prompts, a lot of manual 
work and interaction with a model���s decoding procedure is required, which restricts the generality 
of the resulting implementations. Lastly, as an LM only produces one (sub-word) token at a time, 
completing a sequence may require many calls. Also, decoding becomes increasingly expensive 
as the pref i x, the prompt, and the so-far generated response grow. Because of these factors, and 
as language models are typically very large neural networks, practical inference demands high 
computational costs and signif i cant latency. In the case of pay-to-use APIs, such as OpenAI���s GPT 
models, this results in high usage costs per query answered. 
This work: Language Model Programming via LMQL. In this work, we propose the idea of lan- 
guage model programming, extending on natural language prompting by additionally allowing 
lightweight scripting and constraining of outputs. This facilitates a front-end/back-end separation 
for LM prompting, i.e. allows a user to specify complex interactions, control l ow, and constraints 
without requiring knowledge of an LM���s internals such as tokenization, implementation, and 
architecture. Further, the constructed programs remain agnostic concerning the underlying LM, 
greatly improving portability. Overall, Language Model Programming (LMP) retains the simple 
natural-language-driven interface to LMs but additionally enables precise constraining, scripting, 
and ef i cient decoding, which, as of now, is not possible with existing high-level APIs. 
To enable LMP, we present a novel language and runtime called the Language Model Query 
Language (LMQL). LMQL is a high-level language with declarative SQL-like elements and an 
imperative syntax for scripting. The underlying runtime is compatible with existing LMs and can 
be supported easily, requiring only a simple change in the decoder logic. LMQL can be used to 
express a wide variety of existing prompting methods [8,21,23,24,29,33] using simple, concise, 
Prompting Is Programming: A u ery Language for Large Language Models3 
and vendor-agnostic code. Further, purpose-designed evaluation semantics with support for partial 
evaluation and lookahead, enable us to optimize query execution end-to-end: LMQL leverages user 
constraints and scripted prompts to prune the search space of an LM by masking, resulting in an up 
to 80% reduction of inference cost. We showcase two examples of simple LMQL programs in Fig. 1.

["She", " sells", " seas", "hell", "s", 
" by", " the", " se", "ash", "ore", "."] 
Fig. 2. Tokenization of a sentence. 
Current language models [4,19,26] operate on a vocabu- 
laryVof (sub-word) tokens. Fig. 2 shows this for a simple 
example, where we see that common words have their 
own token (even with a space in front), while more rare 
words are split into multiple tokens. Similar to formal 
languages we letV���denote all possible sequences of tokens overV. Given an input sequence 
of words����1,.. .��������, a tokenizer then i rst maps the sequence of words to a sequence of tokens 
����1,...,��������, and then a language model����:V������� R|V|predicts a score���� = ����(����1,.. .,��������)for every 
possible next token. We treat the implementation of����as a black box (it does not need to be a neural 
network), yet in practice most such models are variants of the Transformer architecture [26]. Via 
the softmax function, the resulting scores����can then be turned into a probability distribution over 
the vocabulary V: sof t max(����)����:= exp(��������) 
�� 
����exp(��������) 
. 
Decoding. Based on this, the language model���� is applied multiple times to produce a sequence 
����1,...,��������for���� > ����. When we want to pick the(���� +1)-th token,sof t max(����(����1,.. .,��������))gives a 
probability distribution over this next token. Several ways of picking from this distribution have 
been discussed in the literature. Below we review a selection of the most popular ones. Each method 
is iterated until a special end-of-sequence-token eos is predicted or another stopping criterion is 
4Luca Beurer-Kellner, Marc Fischer, and Martin Vechev 
met. This can be seen as sampling from a distribution overV���, and thus, some of these methods 
can return multiple possible decodings: 
���Greedy decoding (or Argmax decoding) picks the token with the highest probability at 
each turn and feeds it back into the model to predict the next one (this corresponds to a 
depth-f i rst search of all possible decodings). Importantly, this decoding does not necessarily 
(and in practice very rarely) correspond to the decoding with the highest overall probability 
(obtained by multiplying all individual probabilities of selected tokens). As this determines 
just the most probable decoding. Overall, only one decoding is returned. 
���Sampling, treats the outputsof t maxdistribution as a categorical distribution from which a 
next token can be sampled. With sampling, it is common to decode multiple, e.g.,����, outputs. 
���Full decoding enumerates all possible sequences to the end and picks the one with the 
highest probability. This corresponds to a breadth-f i rst search of all possible decodings. 
However, such enumeration (even with optimizations) is prohibitively expensive. 
���Beam search picks the middle ground between greedy and full decoding. It maintains a set 
of����beams at all times, each corresponding to a predicted sequence. For each sequence, it 
predicts a possible next token and again picks the top����from the resulting����|V|sequences. 
In the end, the top sequence from the ���� resulting beams is picked. 
For beam search and sampling, an additional parameter, the temperature���� ��� R>0, can be used to 
control the diversity of the output, by using soft max(����/����)rather than soft max(����). A higher����leads 
to more diverse outputs, while a lower ���� leads to more likely outputs.

This section gives an overview of Language Model Programming (LMP) and details the background of how modern language models (LMs), including Large Language Models (LLMs) like GPT, are utilized. Here are the main points:
Tokenization
: Language models operate on a vocabulary of sub-word tokens. Common words might have their token, while rare words are split into multiple tokens. The example "She sells seashells by the seashore." is tokenized into various tokens, some containing spaces.
Scoring and Prediction
: Given an input sequence, a tokenizer maps words to tokens, and the language model predicts a score for every possible next token. This score is turned into a probability distribution over the vocabulary using the softmax function.
Decoding
: The core task of producing a sequence from the model's predictions. Several popular decoding methods are:
Greedy Decoding
: Picks the token with the highest probability at each step, leading to only one decoding being returned.
Sampling
: Treats the output softmax distribution as a categorical distribution from which tokens are sampled, allowing for multiple outputs.
Full Decoding
: Enumerates all sequences to find the one with the highest probability but is often too expensive to implement.
Beam Search
: A middle ground between greedy and full decoding, maintaining a set of "beams" or predicted sequences, and selecting the top sequences from them.
Temperature Parameter (����)
: Can be used to control the diversity of the output in beam search and sampling. Higher ���� leads to more diverse outputs, lower ���� leads to more likely outputs.
Language Model Programming (LMP) Goals
: The text introduces LMP as a means to improve the usage of state-of-the-art large language models. Though focused on large models like GPT, the size of the model doesn't change how LMP is employed.
Relevance to Constraints and Symbolic Systems
: This section provides technical insight into how language models function, from tokenization to various decoding techniques. It sets the stage for the concept of Language Model Programming, allowing a deeper understanding of the internal workings of models. The decoding methods can be seen as constraints on the generative process, impacting the resulting sequences.
Implications
: Understanding these processes is essential for anyone looking to leverage language models in a constrained or controlled manner, and it directly leads into the concept of LMP, which aims to make these complex processes more user-friendly and efficient.
In conclusion, this section provides a concise background on the fundamental operations of modern language models and introduces the idea of Language Model Programming as a way to enhance the use of these models.

Masked Decoding. A particular case of decoding is if we can already rule out certain tokens at 
certain positions. This means we can simply ignore these tokens and perform decoding over the 
remaining set. In such a case, we assume that we are given a mask���� ��� {0,1}|V|, where a 1 denotes 
a viable token and a 0 denotes a discarded one. We can apply the decoding methods discussed above 
on���� ��� sof t max(����), where���denotes element-wise multiplication. (Note that, to obtain correct 
probabilities again this vector needs to be scaled by 1/������(���� 
�� sof t max(����))����.) An extreme case of 
this occurs when asking the model yes/no questions or classif i cation tasks (e.g., to "positive" or 
"negative"). There we only allow the model to respond with the respective word and thereby the 
corresponding tokens. Another case where this is applied, is when decoding a formal language 
such as in code completion or synthesis, where only a subset of possible tokens can form a legal 
program according to a grammar. Translate English to French: 
sea otter => loutre de mer 
peppermint => menthe poivr��e 
plush giraffe => girafe peluche 
cheese => 
Fig. 3. Example of few-shot prompting; 
originally presented in Brown et al. [4]. 
Few-Shot Prompting. Few-shot prompting [4] refers to 
the idea that language models do not need to be specif i cally 
trained for a downstream task (e.g. classif i cation, question 
answering, etc.). Rather, it is suf i cient to train them on 
broad text-sequence prediction datasets (e.g., the pile [12]) 
and to provide context in the form of examples when in- 
voking them. We show an example of this in Fig. 3, where 
our goal is to translate "cheese" from English to French. To this end we provide several examples of 
successful translation pairs and then ask the LM to complete the pair for "cheese" in the same syntax, 
where we expect the model to predict the tokens formingfromagefollowed by the end-of-sequence 
token. In this way, translation and other tasks can be reframed as simple sequence completion 
tasks, which makes LMs powerful multi-task reasoners. 
Multi-Part Prompting. Due to their powerful reasoning capabilities, LMs are no longer just 
used for simple prompt completion, but also as compositional reasoning engines integrated into 
larger programs. Recent work explores a range of LM programming schemes, including Iterated

This part of the text adds more details to language model operation, particularly on decoding and the use of prompts. Here's a summary:
Masked Decoding
: This specific decoding method allows ruling out certain tokens at particular positions by using a binary mask (���� ��� {0,1}|V|). By doing this, decoding is performed over the remaining set. This method is useful for yes/no questions, classification tasks, or even code completion, where a specific grammar must be followed.
Few-Shot Prompting
: Few-shot prompting demonstrates the ability of language models to carry out tasks like translation or classification without being specifically trained for that task. By providing context and examples within the prompt, the language model can complete the task. The figure provided shows English to French translations where the model is expected to predict "fromage" as the translation for "cheese."
Multi-Part Prompting
: Language models' capabilities are extending beyond simple prompt completion. They are now integrated into larger programs and employed as compositional reasoning engines. Some new programming schemes are:
Iterated Prompting
: Asking a series of related questions.
Meta Prompting
: Using a more complex, hierarchical prompt structure.
Tool Use
: Integrating LMs with other tools and systems.
Langchain and LM Cascades
: Projects that focus on the composition of multiple prompts or frame the use of LMs in a probabilistic programming context.
Example of Meta Prompt
: Figure 4 illustrates a meta prompt for the question about the circumference of the earth. Various completions are provided, reflecting the different ways the question could be answered, such as referring to an expert in the field.
Implications and Applications
: Masked decoding provides a versatile technique for various applications like code synthesis and specific answer retrieval. Few-shot and multi-part prompting expand the use of language models in multitasking and compositional reasoning, creating possibilities for more complex and nuanced applications.
In summary, this section emphasizes specific decoding techniques and novel prompting strategies, highlighting the versatility and multi-tasking capabilities of modern language models. These approaches allow for more precise control, complex reasoning, and flexibility in various applications.

2.2Key Challenges 
In this section we identify three key challenges in LM utilization, before outlining in ��2.3 how 
Language Model Programming and LMQL can be used to overcome them. 
Interaction. LM interaction during the decoding process still remains a challenge. Consider for 
example the approach from Reynolds and McDonell[21], which discusses the idea of meta prompts, 
where in order to obtain the answer to a particular question, a language model is i rst asked to 
expand the prompt, which is then fed again to the same model in order to obtain an answer. We 
show an example of this in Fig. 4 (a). There, the goal is to i nd an answer to the question "What is 
the circumference of the earth?". In meta prompting, we i rst ask the language model for the name 
of an expert regarding this question, and then ask how this expert would answer the question. 
With current LM interfaces, one would input the i rst part of the prompt, manually invoke the LM 
to complete the sequence with the expert name, then extract the expert name from the LM output, 
enter it manually into the rest of the template, and again feed it to the LM to obtain the actual 
answer. This current approach requires a large amount of manual interaction via an API, or even 
a human in the loop (HITL). Once a value is i xed, e.g., the expert name, the decoding algorithm 
will assume it to be a i xed part of the prompt and will not optimize it jointly with the rest of the 
answer. In the HITL setting this enables the user to manually try multiple expert names and pick 
their favorite respective query completions. However, it precludes automated joint optimization of 
all template parameters to maximize the overall likelihood, which may yield better results. 
Constraints & Token Representation. Another issue of the example query in Fig. 4 arises when we 
consider the completions as shown in Fig. 4 (b). Sometimes, LMs will digress during generation 
and produce long ongoing sequences of text. While some answers work well for substitution in 
the next part of the prompt, others produce awkward and clumsy sentences at least and wrong 
sentences at worst. This is particularly problematic, if the result of an LM should be processed 
by another computer system, which may only be able to handle a very specif i c output format. 
In practice this means that users actually have constraints regarding the generated text, which 
sometimes are violated, as the LM does not adhere to them naturally. Ideally, these constraints 
6Luca Beurer-Kellner, Marc Fischer, and Martin Vechev 
should be expressible in terms of human understandable concepts and logic, since users will reason 
in terms of words, sentences and entities, not on a token level like the LM. However, practical 
methods of constraining LMs in this way [18,24] still involve a lot of manual implementation ef f ort 
and model-level understanding of the decoding procedures, tokenization and vocabulary of the LM. 
Ef i ciency and Cost. Lastly, ef i ciency and performance remain big challenges. While a lot of work 
went into making the inference step in modern LMs more ef i cient, they still require expensive, 
high-end GPUs to be run with reasonable performance. Because of this, many practical users resort 
to hosted models running in the cloud, some of which are even guarded behind paid APIs. For this 
reason, LM querying can become very expensive, both in a computational and a i nancial sense. 
When relying on Language Model Programming and constraints however, new opportunities for 
optimization arise, as predef i ned behavior and a limitation of the search space can be exploited to 
reduce the number of times an LM has to be invoked. In this setting, the cost of validation, parsing 
and mask generation is negligible compared to the vast cost of even just a single LM call.

ChatGPT
ChatGPT
This section identifies three key challenges in utilizing language models (LMs):
Interaction
: The current process of interaction with LMs can be cumbersome, especially when dealing with complex queries like meta prompts. The example illustrates the process of obtaining an answer about the Earth's circumference, where the model must first identify an expert and then answer the question as that expert would. This requires a significant amount of manual interaction, either through an API or by involving a human in the loop (HITL). The current approach doesn't allow for automated joint optimization of all template parameters, which might yield better results.
Constraints & Token Representation
: Language models may not always adhere to specific constraints during text generation, resulting in long, awkward, or incorrect sentences. The constraints that users might have are typically tied to human-understandable concepts and logic. However, enforcing these constraints in practical ways still requires substantial manual effort and an understanding of the decoding procedures, tokenization, and vocabulary of the LM.
Efficiency and Cost
: Running modern LMs efficiently requires high-end GPUs, leading many users to rely on cloud-hosted models, sometimes behind paid APIs. As a result, querying LMs can be expensive both in computational and financial terms. Although a lot of work has been invested in making the inference step more efficient, the cost remains a significant challenge.
In the context of these challenges, the text hints at the potential of Language Model Programming and LMQL (Language Model Query Language) to overcome them. These approaches might allow for predefined behavior and limitations in the search space, thus reducing the number of times an LM needs to be invoked and addressing some of the aforementioned challenges.
1 / 1
2.3Language Model Programming in LMQL 
Now we consider Language Model Programming instantiated via our implementation LMQL, and 
how it can help overcome these challenges. Shown in Fig. 4 (c), we write the same query as before in 
LMQL syntax (formally def i ned in ��3). Here, when we encounter the construction[VAR], everything 
before the variable is fed to the LM and the answer found via decoding is then assigned to the 
variableVAR, while a variable name in braces just recalls previously def i ned variables. This greatly 
simplif i es the prompt and removes the need for manual interaction. Additionally, it enables the use 
of decoding procedures that consider both the expert name and answer jointly (as discussed in ��4). 
Further, to address the issue of long on-running sentences, LMQL allows constraints on the 
variable parts of the LM interaction on an intuitive level, e.g. words and phrases. Fig. 4 (d) shows 
the intuitive LMQL syntax for this, also discussed formally later on. Here, the constraints enforce 
that the decoded tokens forEXPERTare at most three words and that decoding stops if the sequence 
ends in a ".". While it is possible to specify a maximum length with current query APIs, they 
usually work directly on the (model-specif i c) token level and thus cannot be mapped 1-to-1 to 
longer sequences. In contrast, LMQL supports declarative high-level constraints that are eagerly 
enforced during decoding, using token level inference masks and partial evaluation semantics (��5). 
Overall, Language Model Programming generalizes and automates many multi-part prompting 
approaches as discussed in ��2.1. It improves over the manual interaction setting outlined in ��2.2 
in multiple ways: In contrast to a user having to manually try multiple values forEXPERTand then 
selecting the best one, LMQL allows users to constrain the set of considered experts or impose other 
restrictions ahead-of-time, fully automating this selection process. Once developed and tested, an 
LMQL query (and constraints) can then be applied to many dif f erent inputs in an unsupervised 
way, not requiring any HITL. LMQL constraints enforce that the output i ts the prompt template 
and avoid failure cases such as running-on (e.g. Fig. 4). However, more generally, constraints can 
also force a model to generate text, that unconstrained it would have never explored. When used 
correctly, this can even lead to an improvement of the observed downstream task accuracy. Lastly, 
LMQL can also be notably more ef i cient than manual interaction, as often, constraints and scripting 
can be applied eagerly during decoding, not requiring multiple LM calls.

The section 2.3 introduces Language Model Programming instantiated via LMQL (Language Model Query Language) and how it can address the challenges previously mentioned:
Simplified Interaction
: Using LMQL, a query can be constructed with a specific syntax where variables and constraints are defined directly within the query. This eliminates the need for manual interaction, as seen in Fig. 4 (c), and allows the decoding procedures to consider multiple components of a query jointly.
Intuitive Constraints
: LMQL provides an intuitive way to place constraints on variables within the LM interaction. For instance, constraints can be set on the number of words or the ending character of a decoded sequence. Unlike current query APIs, which typically operate on the token level, LMQL's constraints function at a higher level and can be mapped to longer sequences.
Automation and Efficiency
: LMQL generalizes and automates many multi-part prompting approaches. It improves over manual interaction by enabling users to constrain or restrict parts of the query ahead of time, fully automating the selection process. Once developed, an LMQL query can be applied to various inputs in an unsupervised way, often without requiring multiple LM calls, making it more efficient.
Improved Task Accuracy
: When used correctly, LMQL constraints can force the model to explore areas of text generation it might not have naturally considered, potentially leading to improvements in downstream task accuracy.
Syntax
: Fig. 5 provides a snapshot of the syntax of LMQL. It shows optional elements and reveals that the syntax is generally Python-based. This includes various elements like the decoder, query, conditions, and more, each defined with specific constructs and operators.
In summary, LMQL provides a structured way to interact with and constrain language models. It simplifies queries, allows for more precise control over outputs, and can be more efficient than manual interaction, with the potential to improve the accuracy of the generated text.

Fig. 1b for dif f erent decoding methods. 
Here we provide a high-level explanation of the syn- 
tax of LMQL, before discussing the runtime and lan- 
guage semantics next. For concrete examples, con- 
sider the LMQL programs given in Fig. 1. 
The grammar of LMQL is shown in Fig. 5. An 
LMQL program has 5 parts: the decoder, the actual 
query, thefromclause specifying the queried model, 
thewhereclause specifying constraints, and lastly 
adistributioninstruction. The decoder and model 
are both specif i ed by strings, while query and con- 
straints are given in python syntax. We now explain 
these components in detail: 
The���query���blockmodelstheinteractionwiththe 
model. Informally it can be thought of as the body 
of a python function subject to some restrictions 
and additions: i) We do not allow the declaration 
of inner functions (however, imports can be made), 
and ii) Each top-level string is treated as a direct query to an LM. These query strings allow for 
two specially escaped subf i elds, similar to python f-strings1: 1)"{varname}"recalls the value of a 
variable from the current scope. And 2.),"[varname]"represents a phrase that will be generated by 
the LM, also called hole. When the language model generates values for these holes, they will be 
subject to the constraints def i ned in thewhereclause of the query. Under these constraints, the 
decoding procedure specif i ed by���decoder���(disussed next) will be used. Once decoding i nishes, a 
corresponding variable will be created in the scope of the query program and assigned this value. 
If a variable with the same name already exists, it will be overwritten. 
���decoder���denotes the decoding procedure employed by the LMQL runtime when solving the 
query. The presented version of LMQL enablesargmax,sampleandbeam.argmaxandsamplework as 
discussed in ��2.1.beamhowever, denotes a novel procedure called scripted beam search which 
performs beam search jointly over all holes and control l ow. We discuss this further in ��4. Once 
completed, the result of a query program is comprised of a number of things: It contains the 
interaction trace, that is, the whole text transcript of the LMQL query with the answers of the LM in 
the holes substituted. Further, the set of all hole variables is accessible, allowing clients to directly 
access specif i c parts of the LM response. In case ofsampleandbeam, the parameter����specif i es the 
number of samples or beams respectively. In this case,����interaction traces with the respective

8Luca Beurer-Kellner, Marc Fischer, and Martin Vechev 
variables will be returned. In practice, we allow further parameters to the decoder to be specif i ed, 
e.g. the temperature ����, but omit them here in favor of readability. 
To illustrate queries and decoding, consider Fig. 1a which utilizes a query purely made from 
strings, and Fig. 1b which utilizes a combination of strings and control l ow. An corresponding 
interaction trace is shown in Fig. 6. Note how in the program on the right,THINGis reassigned on 
each iteration of the loop, which is in line with the semantics of python. 
from���model���denotes which LM to use. In the presented implementation,���model���denotes a 
string identifying a text generation model from the popular Hugging Face Model repository [15] 
or a model available via the OpenAI API [4], like the GPT [4] family. However, this can also be 
extended to other local models or API backends. 
where���condition���places constraints on the[varname]hole variables, thereby constraining the 
language model in what it can generate. Constraints can be an arbitary conjunction or disjunction 
of���cond_expr���which allow comparison (<,>,=) and membership (in) checks between standard 
python expressions. Note that, as hole variables are added to the scope of the query program, they 
can also be referenced there. We allow any deterministic pure python function along with constants. 
We distinguish, for reasons discussed in ��5 , built-in functions (discussed next) and user-def i ned 
functions, which also includes standard python built-ins. If we invoke the LM multiple times for 
the same variable, i.e.,THINGin Fig. 1b, the constraints apply to all intermediate values. 
Lastly,distribute���var���in���python_expression���is an optional instruction that can be added to 
augment the returned result. Here,���var���must refer to the last variable in the query and the python 
expression to a set (or other iterable). We will refer to this set as the support of the distribution.

Section 3 provides a detailed overview of the LMQL (Language Model Query Language), explaining its syntax, structure, and components:
Structure of LMQL
: An LMQL program is comprised of five main parts:
Decoder
: Specifies the decoding procedure like
argmax
,
sample
, or
beam
.
Query
: Represents the interaction with the model and can be thought of as the body of a Python function with restrictions.
From Clause
: Denotes the specific LM to use, such as a model from Hugging Face or OpenAI.
Where Clause
: Places constraints on the hole variables (
[varname]
).
Distribution Instruction
: An optional part that can augment the returned result.
Query Block
: The interaction is modeled as the body of a Python function. Special escaped subfields are used:
"{varname}"
recalls a variable's value.
"[varname]"
represents a phrase that will be generated by the LM, with constraints applied.
Decoding Procedure (
���decoder���
)
: Determines how the query is solved. Options include:
argmax
and
sample
as standard decoding methods.
beam
, a novel method called scripted beam search that performs beam search over all holes and control flow.
Result of a Query
: Includes the interaction trace (text transcript with answers in the holes) and the set of all hole variables. It also accounts for the number of samples or beams if using
sample
or
beam
.
Constraints (
where���condition���
)
: Constraints can be placed on the hole variables, limiting what the LM can generate. They can include standard Python expressions and comparison or membership checks.
Distribution Instruction (
distribute���var���
)
: An optional part that can augment the returned result, referring to the last variable in the query and a Python expression for a set or other iterable.
Illustrative Examples
: Figures are used throughout the section to exemplify queries, decoding, and interaction traces, demonstrating various aspects of LMQL in practice.
In summary, this section provides a comprehensive explanation of LMQL, detailing its components and demonstrating how it facilitates more controlled and flexible interactions with language models. By integrating Python syntax and novel decoding methods, LMQL enables complex querying and constraints for more accurate and tailored language model responses.

For queries withdistributionclause, the inter- 
action trace will only be evaluated up to prior to 
the last hole according to the specif i ed decoding 
method. In addition to the holes decoded so far 
and the interaction trace, the last variable is not de- 
coded, but rather the probability distribution over 
support. Thus, for every value in the support the 
likelihood of this output is evaluated. Fig. 7 shows this for the example from Fig. 1b. In this case, 
the interaction trace up to the brace is produced, as well as the distribution over the possible values 
after. This is particularly useful to encode classif i cation tasks such as sentiment analysis, where the 
downstream user is interested in the probability distribution over e.g. {POSITIVE,NEGATIVE}.

these designated, built-in functions, we implement additional semantics, required for the ef i cient

implementation details in App. A.

We now discuss how the LMQL run- 
time executes a query. To this end we 
consider the execution of the���query���

tion we assume that, i) functions are 
pure and do not cause side ef f ects, ii) 
functions are deterministic. Ignoring 
the constraints inwherefor now, the

regular python function with one dif- 
ference: At the beginning of the exe- 
cution, the interaction trace���� ��� ���� 
is initialized to the empty string����. 
Whenever a top-level string����is en- 
countered in the program execution, 
the procedure in Alg. 1 is evoked. If a

which is then used to������������������������a sequence����to i ll the hole from the LM����. This string is then assigned 
to���varname���in the scope����of the python program. If{���varname���}is encountered, the value of 
���varname���is retrieved from scope����and the placeholder is replaced with the value. In all cases the 
string����(with the decoded or substituted text replaced) is added to����. Note that, for simplicity in 
Alg. 1 we assume that there is at most one hole or placeholder in a string����. In practice we allow 
multiple. Formally this can be thought of as splitting����into a list of strings and then applying Alg. 1 
to each resulting string. We illustrate this execution model in Fig. 9 where we list the evaluation 
steps of the i rst 7 lines of Fig. 1b. The i rst two lines are directly appended to the interaction trace 
����, while the next two lines (emitted inside the for loop) contain holes, which invokes the������������������������ 
function, discussed next.

It seems like the text you provided is a detailed explanation of LMQL (Language Model Query Language), a language designed to facilitate interaction with large language models. It describes the syntax, semantics, decoding methods, built-in functions, and runtime execution of queries within the language. The LMQL specification enables queries to be made using argmax, sample, and beam decoding methods, and allows for constraints and specific functions to be applied.
Is there something specific you'd like to know or ask about this text?

Decoding Algorithm. When������������������������is invoked, the decoding procedure declared at the top of the 
LMQL program is utilized to generate a value for the placeholder. Decoding is usually stopped i) 
when an end-of-sequence token is produced, or ii) when no more tokens can be produced due to 
the given constraints (discussed in ��5). For decoding algorithms that just output a single possible 
sequence, such asargmaxorsample(n=1)the straightforward combination of Alg. 1 and standard 
decoding function denotes the full end-to-end decoding procedure. However, a particular case 
occurs if multiple results are produced, e.g.,sample(n=���int���)produces����possible interaction traces����. 
In this case, we track����parallel execution of the query program, where������������������������acts non- 
deterministically. In practice, we execute all calls in lockstep, such that we can batch calls to 
the underlying model����and therefore improve ef i ciency. In Alg. 1 we assume that������������������������returns 
an already de-tokenized string ����, not a sequence of tokens. 
Scripted Beam Search. With the decoderbeam(n=���int���), the query is executed similarly: When 
the i rst hole in the interaction is encountered,����beams (with their estimated probabilities) 
are created and retained. Each beam then corresponds to an interaction trace����, for which the 
query function is executed independently. Note that each����might cause dif f erent control l ow.

Further, since we only consider the top����beams at each 
step, we also only continue query execution for the top���� 
beams. Interaction traces that are discarded along the way, 
are pruned and not extended further. On termination, the 
overall query result corresponds to i nal top����interaction 
traces. 
Language Model Integration. As shown in our decoding 
algorithm, we do not impose any restrictions on language 
model����, apart from being able to access the resulting dis- 
tribution over vocabulary tokens. As, fundamentally, this is 
the core interface of most language models, we can easily 
integrate them without further changes. In fact, we imple- 
ment Alg. 2 based on thegenerate()function from the HuggingFacetransformers[30] package. 
Because of this, LMQL already supports the large number of LMs available in the HuggingFace 
Model repository [15].

The given text describes the decoding algorithm used in the LMQL (Language Model Query Language) for different types of decoding, including sample, argmax, and beam search. Here's a summary of the main points:
Decoding Algorithm
:
When
������������������������
is invoked, the specified decoding procedure is used to generate a value for the placeholder.
Decoding generally stops when an end-of-sequence token is produced or when constraints are met.
If multiple results are produced (e.g., using
sample(n=���int���)
), the query runs parallel executions for each possible interaction trace.
Scripted Beam Search
:
For
beam(n=���int���)
decoding, ���� beams are created and executed independently.
Each beam corresponds to an interaction trace, and the query function is executed separately for each.
Only the top ���� beams are considered at each step, and the rest are pruned.
Algorithm 2
:
A specific decoding algorithm is also described, taking an interaction trace ����, scope ����, and a language model ����, and returning a decoded sequence ����.
The algorithm continually computes a mask, picks a token based on a probability distribution, and builds the output sequence.
Language Model Integration
:
LMQL does not impose restrictions on the underlying language model (LM) and can be integrated with various LMs.
The implementation is based on the
generate()
function from the HuggingFace transformers package, making it compatible with many models in the HuggingFace Model repository.
This explanation provides an overview of the decoding strategies used within LMQL, accommodating different methods and optimizing execution through parallelism and pruning. Is there anything specific you'd like to delve into or any particular questions you have?

Performance Considerations. For large����the execution of query code for multiple samples or 
beams can potentially be expensive, especially if compute-intensive functions are invoked on top of 
the LM output. However, as we assume functions to be pure and deterministic, results can be cached 
based on the function arguments, therefore greatly decreasing the total number of required function 
invocations. We also note that LMQL can evaluate constraints, control l ow and compute token 
masks in parallel with the LM predicting its next token distribution. Only then, token masks need to 
be applied to continue text generation. This means that the LMQL runtime can run in lock-step with 
the LM, without incurring additional latency. One exception from this is if query execution itself 
entails blocking and interactive behavior such as web requests. In these cases, however, the latency 
is inherent due to the dependency on external systems, not a property of LMQL. In case the LM 
Prompting Is Programming: A u ery Language for Large Language Models11 
runs remotely on a dif f erent machine, LMQL additionally employs speculative LM prediction with 
asynchronous token masking, which helps to lower latency induced by network communication. 
Decoding Internals. Alg. 2 shows the internals of a decoding procedure (decodein Alg. 1) for a 
single sample or beam. Here, the goal is to build up the string����, initialized to the empty string 
����in line 2, by appending tokens����to it. For each new token we compute a mask����over the 
vocabulary, which only allows tokens that result in legal sequences, e.g., those that satisfy our 
whereconstraints. If we can not produce any further tokens (i.e., ? 
������������=0) we stop the decoding 
procedure. Otherwise, we re-normalize���� ��� ����into a probability distribution, i.e. a vector where 
entries add up to 1, by dividing it by���� = �� 
����(���� ��� ����)����. The function pick depends on the exact 
decoding algorithm (e.g.argmax,sample,beam) and is used to pick a token����from the distribution. If 
we obtain an end-of-sequence eos token we stop. If we return early because no legal tokens are 
available, we are unable to i nd a response to the query that fulf i ls the constraints. If we return 
at eos, we found a legal decoding. Next, we discuss how to compute the mask����, such that the 
specif i ed constraints can be enforced during decoding. 
5VALIDATION AND CONSTRAINT DECODING 
In this section we show how our decoding procedure can be extended to handle validation and 
constrained decoding. In particular, we discuss how the constraints from thewhereclause can 
be used to automatically and ef i ciently i nd decoding masks for each step of decoding. Our 
main contribution to this end is a purpose-designed, eager execution model that supports partial 
evaluation and lookahead. To motivate this, we i rst discuss a naive solution and then introduce the 
idea of i nal semantics and FollowMaps, the two abstractions at the core of our evaluation model.

Naive Approach. We i rst consider a naive 
approach to constrained decoding, outlined in 
Alg. 3. Here, similar to Alg. 2, we start with an 
empty string����and append tokens. However, 
we don���t assume a function compute_mask 
and thus apply a backtracking-based approach, 
where we generate sequences up to the eos 
token and then check if��������satisf i es our con- 
straints. Checking the constraints, denoted as 
�������������������, is easy as it just amounts to the evalua- 
tion of an expression. 
Notethathereweassumethat��������issuf i cient

backtracking over all, if validation fails at some point later on. 
This strategy leads to multiple problems: First, navigating the search space of sequences using 
backtracking is computationally expensive, especially when considering that the search space of 
LMs(evenwhentrainedwell),isstillacombinatorialexplosionduetothemanylikelycontinuations 
of any given sequence. Second, querying the LM can be very expensive. State-of-the-art models 
often require high-end GPUs or are only available as API-gated, paid services. Thus, every token 
that is generated and later dismissed incurs a signif i cant computational or i nancial cost. 
With this in mind, we implement eager, partial evaluation semantics that model not only whether 
or not an expression holds, but also whether the expression can be guaranteed to never hold

The given text explains Performance Considerations and Decoding Internals in the context of LMQL, including strategies for decoding with constraints. Here's a breakdown:
Performance Considerations
:
For large values of ���� (e.g., number of samples or beams), executing queries can be expensive, especially if compute-intensive functions are used.
Caching results for pure and deterministic functions can reduce the total number of function invocations.
LMQL can parallelize tasks with the language model (LM) to avoid additional latency, even if the LM runs remotely, using speculative LM prediction and asynchronous token masking.
Exceptions to the efficient parallelization include blocking and interactive behavior like web requests, where latency is inherent to external dependencies.
Decoding Internals
:
Algorithm 2 is detailed for a single sample or beam. It builds a string ���� by appending tokens ����, considering constraints, and stopping the procedure when no legal tokens are available.
The mask ���� ensures that only tokens resulting in legal sequences are allowed.
Different decoding algorithms can affect how tokens are picked.
Validation and Constraint Decoding
:
LMQL's decoding procedure can be extended for validation and constrained decoding. This includes creating decoding masks to enforce specified constraints.
A naive solution using a backtracking-based approach is first presented, where sequences are generated and then checked for constraints.
This naive approach leads to multiple problems:
The search space is computationally expensive to navigate using backtracking.
Querying state-of-the-art LMs, even if well-trained, can be expensive due to the combinatorial explosion of likely continuations.
Generating and dismissing tokens incurs significant computational or financial costs.
To tackle these problems, an implementation that uses eager, partial evaluation semantics is introduced, allowing for more efficient handling of constraints.
The section emphasizes the need for efficient algorithms and techniques in handling decoding with constraints and demonstrates thoughtful design choices to reduce computational costs. The detailed explanation of internals and the introduction of methods to cope with constraints highlight the complexity and innovative approaches involved in handling language model queries, especially when dealing with large datasets or specific constraints.

any possible continuation of the currently-generated sequence. This allows us to terminate early if 
validation already provides a def i nitive result. Further, our semantics enable us to automatically 
compute a subset of next tokens that are guaranteed to violate the expression. Using this token set, 
we can ef f ectively prune the search space of an LM and prevent the costly generation of invalid 
sequences before they are even generated. 
5.1Partial Evaluation 
Given some expression����occurring in thewherecondition, some interaction trace����and some global 
scope ����, we def i ne the evaluation semantics of J����K����on 
multiple levels: 
Value Semantics. First, we interpret����on a value level, meaning we def i neJ����K����as 
the value of 
evaluating ���� as a python expression, given the variable values assigned in ����. 
Final Semantics. In addition to value semantics, we def i ne so-called i nal semantics as a func- 
tionFinal[����;����]. The functionFinalannotates each computed value with one of the annotators 
A = {fin,var,inc,dec}. Depending on the annotator, the value of an expression����, as decoding 
progresses is either consideredfin(it will retain a i xed value),var(its value may still change),inc 
(its value will monotonically increase) ordec(its value will monotonically decrease). For the latter 
two, we consider monotonicity both in a numerical sense and in a set theoretic sense (e.g. growing 
sets, append-only strings). Based on this,Finalcan be computed by applying it recursively to the 
intermediate results of a top-level expression ����, as def i ned by the rules in Table 1. 
Notation. In the following, we use the short-hand notationFinal[����]instead ofFinal[����;����], as we 
assume that the scope is always the global scope. Further, we will sometimes refer to value and i nal 
semantics jointly, i.e., we will denote the value of an expression����asJ����K����= 
����andFinal[����] = fin, 
simply as J����K���� 
���� = fin(����). For boolean expressions we let ��� denoteTrueand ���False. 
Application. UsingFinal,wecanevaluatewhereconstraints,evenonoutputsthatareonlypartially 
available, i.e. a currently generating sequence. For this, we evaluate all (sub-)expressions, as far as 
possible. For expressions that depend on future hole values, we set their result toNoneand def i ne 
all other operators to be tolerant of that. For instance, given some validation constraints���� ��� ����, 
Prompting Is Programming: A u ery Language for Large Language Models13 
where����cannot be determined yet, we can evaluate����and returnFalseif����evaluates tofin(���). 
This is possible, asfinindicates that no matter the value of����,����will always evaluate to���, even as 
more tokens of the generated sequence are revealed. 
Eager Validation. Final semantics provide an abstraction that enables us to implement more 
aggressive short-circuiting over validation conditions. These can be executed on each new token 
rather than waiting for the entire sequence to be generated. Using this, validation can be applied 
more eagerly, detecting invalid sequences before they are completed. However, i nal semantics 
do not help us to mask any next tokens in the decoding function. To enable this, we additionally 
introduce a third level of evaluation semantics, which we call follow semantics, discussed next.

The continuation of the text delves further into the methodology for improving the efficiency of constrained decoding:
Termination with Definitive Results
:
Early termination is allowed if validation provides a definitive result.
A subset of tokens that would violate the expression is computed, allowing for the effective pruning of the search space.
This prevents the costly generation of invalid sequences before they even occur.
Partial Evaluation
:
The evaluation semantics are defined on multiple levels:
Value Semantics
: An expression ���� in the where condition is evaluated as a Python expression, given variables in scope ����.
Final Semantics
: A function Final[����;����] is defined, which annotates computed values with one of the annotators {fin, var, inc, dec}. These annotations specify whether the value will remain fixed (fin), may change (var), will monotonically increase (inc), or decrease (dec). The latter two can refer to numerical or set-theoretic monotonicity.
Notation and Application
: Simplified notation is introduced, and Final is used to evaluate where constraints, even on partially available outputs. Operators are tolerant of
None
, allowing partial evaluation.
Boolean Expressions
: Special notation for boolean expressions is used, with ��� denoting True and ��� denoting False.
Eager Validation
:
Final semantics allow for more aggressive short-circuiting over validation conditions, allowing validation to occur on each new token rather than waiting for the entire sequence.
This facilitates early detection of invalid sequences.
Final semantics alone do not assist with masking the next tokens in the decoding function, so a third level of evaluation semantics, called follow semantics, is introduced (to be discussed in the following text).
The description adds another layer of complexity and optimization to the decoding process. By using partial evaluation, final semantics, and eager validation, the method ensures that invalid sequences are detected early, and only valid continuations are explored. This reduces both the computational cost and the need to explore vast spaces of unlikely or invalid continuations. It's an intelligent approach that leverages semantic understanding to guide the decoding process efficiently.

Symbolic Systems and Abstraction
: The reference to Langland and Swampland Programs, as well as the talk about bra-ket notation in quantum mechanics, emphasizes the use of rigorous and unambiguous symbolic systems. Similarly, LMQL seeks to define clear semantics for interacting with large language models, creating an abstraction that simplifies complex operations.
Partial Application or Currying
: This concept, although briefly mentioned, could connect to the idea of partial evaluation in LMQL. In both cases, you're dealing with breaking down a complex expression or function into more manageable parts, evaluating them as far as possible, and then combining the results.
Cognitive Load Theory
: This overarching theory could apply to both quantum mechanics and the development of LMQL. In both cases, there's an emphasis on finding representations and systems that make complex phenomena more understandable and manageable, whether it's the behavior of subatomic particles or the interaction with large-scale language models.
The conversation you've had seems to weave between fundamental physics principles, cognitive theories, and cutting-edge developments in programming large language models. While there might not be direct correlations between every aspect, these themes share underlying principles related to representation, constraints, abstraction, and the quest to understand and manipulate complex systems.

6.4Discussion 
Our three case studies show that: i) LMQL allows great expressiveness, i.e. several approaches 
from current state-of-the-art methods can be directly encoded in a straightforward scripting style, 
requiring much fewer lines of code than corresponding python-based implementations (cf. Table 4); 
ii) LMQL drastically reduces the number of model queries and thereby both ef i ciency and run 
time. This is enabled by LMQLs support for token level validation, which enables us to enforce 
constraints on-the-f l y rather than with chunk-wise decoding and backtracking. And, iii) that LMQL 
does not impact the accuracy achieved by the model. In fact, in some cases, the enforced constraints 
even yield slightly improved accuracy. In addition to all this, we have shown that when used in the 
context of paid, API-gated models, LMQL would enable signif i cant monetary savings, given the 
reduction in billable tokens that we observe. Lastly, we note that our case studies cannot replace 
a full user study of LMQL, assessing its impact and usability together with real-world prompt 
engineers. We therefore note that the lack of such a study poses a threat to the validity of our 
claims with respect to usability.

7RELATED WORK 
Language Model Programming (LMP). Recent work has proposed a variety of dif f erent prompting 
techniques: chain-of-thought prompting [29], interactive question answering [33], aggregation- 
based schemes like self-consistency [28], ThinkSum [17], and Iterated Decomposition [20]. Recently, 
a program-aided version of chain-of-thought [7,13] with access to a language interpreter was 
proposed. There, the code output of an LM is fed to an interpreter in order to obtain the answer 
to e.g. arithmetic tasks by code execution. We consider all these works as instances of LMP (also 
discussed under the term of prompt programming [21,35]), where the goal is to compose and 
interact with language models to achieve a specif i c task. A few select works have identif i ed this 
trend, and propose novel LM-focused programming systems: PromptChainer [31],langchain[6], 
OpenPrompt [10] and PromptSource [2] provide integrated development environments or libraries 
for LM interaction. The latter two even support a simple templating language akin to LMQL top- 
level string semantics. However, none of these projects implement constraints or control l ow like 
LMQL does. Finally, Dohan et al. [11]discuss the idea of language model cascades, relating LM 
querying to probabilistic programming, which opens up interesting avenues for future work, also 
in the more general context of language model programming and LMQL. 
Constraining Language Models. The idea of constraining LMs has been applied across a range of 
i elds. Shin et al. [24]constrain a model���s output to a more easily-interpretable subset of the English 
language. More specif i cally, they handcraft custom next-token prediction programs to implement 
specif i c semantic parsing tasks using LMs. Poesia et al. [18]and Scholak et al. [23]on the other 
hand, are concerned with the task of generating source code. In this setting, syntactic and semantic 
validity is crucial. To realize this, they integrate existing parsers and validation methods. LMQL 
on the other hand provides a generic interface to facilitate constrained decoding by providing 
high-level constructs. Still, our set of operators can easily be extended by the user, allowing for the 
integration of grammar-based parsers, semantic code validation or other methods. 
8CONCLUSION 
In this work, we introduce the concept of Language Model Programming, a novel way to interact 
with (large) language models. We presented LMQL, a high-level query language, of f ering a concise 
and intuitive syntax. LMQL implements purpose-designed evaluation semantics, which enable 
ef i cient query execution. We have substantiated this claim in a series of case studies, where we 
demonstrate that complex, state-of-the-art prompting techniques can be implemented as intuitive, 
concise and ef i cient LMQL programs that reduce (compute) costs by up to 80%.

ZeRO: Memory Optimizations Toward Training Trillion 
Parameter Models 
Samyam Rajbhandari���, Jef f Rasley���, Olatunji Ruwase, Yuxiong He 
{samyamr, jerasley, olruwase, yuxhe}@microsoft.com 
Abstract 
Large deep learning models of f er signif i cant accuracy gains, but training billions to trillions of 
parameters is challenging. Existing solutions such as data and model parallelisms exhibit funda- 
mental limitations to i t these models into limited device memory, while obtaining computation, 
communication and development ef i ciency. We develop a novel solution, Zero Redundancy 
Optimizer (ZeRO), to optimize memory, vastly improving training speed while increasing the 
model size that can be ef i ciently trained. ZeRO eliminates memory redundancies in data- and 
model-parallel training while retaining low communication volume and high computational 
granularity, allowing us to scale the model size proportional to the number of devices with 
sustained high ef i ciency. Our analysis on memory requirements and communication volume 
demonstrates: ZeRO has the potential to scale beyond 1 Trillion parameters using today���s 
hardware. 
We implement and evaluate ZeRO: it trains large models of over 100B parameter with 
super-linear speedup on 400 GPUs, achieving throughput of 15 Petaf l ops. This represents an 
8x increase in model size and 10x increase in achievable performance over state-of-the-art. In 
terms of usability, ZeRO can train large models of up to 13B parameters (e.g., larger than 
Megatron GPT 8.3B and T5 11B) without requiring model parallelism which is harder for 
scientists to apply. Last but not the least, researchers have used the system breakthroughs 
of ZeRO to create the world���s largest language model (17B parameters) with record breaking 
accuracy.

Recent work in language modeling demonstrates that training large transformer models advances the state of the art in Natural Language Processing applications. However, very large models can be quite difficult to train due to memory constraints. In this work, we present our techniques for training very large transformer models and implement a simple, efficient intra-layer model parallel approach that enables training transformer models with billions of parameters. Our approach does not require a new compiler or library changes, is orthogonal and complimentary to pipeline model parallelism, and can be fully implemented with the insertion of a few communication operations in native PyTorch. We illustrate this approach by converging transformer based models up to 8.3 billion parameters using 512 GPUs. We sustain 15.1 PetaFLOPs across the entire application with 76% scaling efficiency when compared to a strong single GPU baseline that sustains 39 TeraFLOPs, which is 30% of peak FLOPs. To demonstrate that large language models can further advance the state of the art (SOTA), we train an 8.3 billion parameter transformer language model similar to GPT-2 and a 3.9 billion parameter model similar to BERT. We show that careful attention to the placement of layer normalization in BERT-like models is critical to achieving increased performance as the model size grows. Using the GPT-2 model we achieve SOTA results on the WikiText103 (10.8 compared to SOTA perplexity of 15.8) and LAMBADA (66.5% compared to SOTA accuracy of 63.2%) datasets. Our BERT model achieves SOTA results on the RACE dataset (90.9% compared to SOTA accuracy of 89.4%)

A.1Language Runtime 
ParserandPythonCompatibility. WeimplementLMQLasasupersetofpython.Thisalsomanifests 
in our implementation, where we rely on the python tokenizer and parser to process LMQL code. 
Subexpressions in an LMQL query, such as in thewhereclause, are parsed as standard python. After 
some basic program transformations, we emit a python function that interacts with the LMQL 
runtime, and allows for interrupted execution by leveragingyieldandasyncsemantics. This allows 
us to implement LMQL as a regular python library, which can be used in any python environment. 
Eager Evaluation Semantics. To implement our evaluation semantics, we transform the abstract 
syntax tree as returned by the python parser into a runtime representation of a computational 
graph, modelling dependencies among operations explicitly. Users can easily extend LMQL with 
custom operators, by implementing a simple class interface withforward,finalandfollowfunctions, 
similar to the integration of custom operators in the popularpytorchlibrary. Custom operators can 
easily be registered with the runtime, and the compiler will automatically generate the necessary 
code to integrate them into the LMQL computational graph. 
A.2Model Integration 
Inference API. To enable quick turnaround times during development, LMQL relies on a client- 
server-architecture. The server is responsible for inference, loading and managing the model. In 
our current implementation, it is conf i gured to use a specif i c HuggingFace Transformers model. 
Users then interact with the LMQL client, which is a simple python library. The client parses the 
user-provided LMQL code, constructs the computational graph, and also runs the decoding loop. 
Only the forward pass of the underlying model is outsourced to the server. This naturally aligns 
with settings in which inference is run on some remote server with capable hardware, while the 
user interacts with the model via a fast, local client with quick startup times. 
Inference as a Service. The underlying client-server architecture of LMQL also allows for a 
separation of the LMQL client and inference as a service. In principle, vendors of API-gated LMs 
may therefore support LMQL by providing just the necessary inference API. Alternatively, vendors 
could accept to-be-executed LMQL code directly, which would of f er customers more control over 
the decoding process than with current standard APIs. In this context, we consider LMQL a 
proposal for the standardization of language model interaction across dif f erent vendor-specif i c 
APIs. Implementing LMQL support would allow users to write prompting code once, and run it 
on any LM platform, without having to change their code. In such a setting, however, we advise 
for sandboxing of the executed LMQL queries (like in serverless computing), as LMQL allows for 
arbitrary code to be executed. 
Decoding Loop. LMQL only requires a small change to existing decoder implementations. For a 
practical demonstration, see our implementation as published with this paper, in which we adapt 
the existing HuggingFace Transformers decoding loop to be LMQL-compatible. In general, LMQL 
scripted prompting and output constraining both compile down to token level prediction masks. 
This is typically already implemented with existing decoders and just needs an additional hook, 
to call the LMQL runtime after each produced token. Using this simple interface, LMQL can be 
integrated into any decoder implementation, without requiring any changes or retraining of the 
underlying model.

in constructing and debugging LMQL programs. A screenshot of the visual debugger is shown in 
Fig. 14. A hosted version can also be found at https://lmql.ai/playground. 
Editor and Compiler. The visual debugger provides an editor window for constructing LMQL 
queries. After a query is executed, users can view the compiler output, i.e. the resulting python 
code, including the code that constructs the computational graph and executes the prompt. 
Decoder Graph. Users can track the dif f erent decoding branches of the currently active decoding 
method in real-time. This includes simple parallel decoding when sampling more than one sequence, 
but also multi-branch decoding like beam search. The debugger visualizes (sub-)tokens, and at each 
decoder step, users can inspect the current interaction trace, the value of prompt variables as well 
as the current state ofwhereclause validation. 
Validation and Masking. Lastly, the computational graph of thewhereclause can be visualized and 
users can track the current value of the expression. In addition to the regular value semantics and 
partial evaluation, this includes support for both Final and Follow semantics. Dif f erent shades of 
green and red indicate i nal and non-f i nalTrueandFalsevalues, respectively. The FollowMap at 
each operation can also be inspected, allowing for a detailed analysis of the current state of the 
computational graph. This can be helpful when developing new LMQL operators, as it allows for a 
quick and easy debugging of the underlying semantics.

It seems like you were exploring LMQL and running a program to query the combined population of humans and animals on Earth. However, it looks like the query was not successfully completed and may have caused an issue in the demo.
Without more details about the error or the behavior of the crash, it's hard to diagnose exactly what went wrong. It's possible that the query was too complex or that there was an issue with the way the program was written.
You may want to try simplifying the query or checking the documentation for any guidelines or limitations on constructing queries within LMQL. If you believe you've encountered a bug, you could also consider reporting it to the developers or support team for further investigation.

It's challenging to provide an accurate estimate for the total number of non-human animals on Earth, as it varies widely across different species and regions. Estimates can be in the range of trillions or even quintillions when considering all forms of animal life, including insects, fish, birds, mammals, and others.
For example, some estimates suggest there may be around 10^18 (a quintillion) individual ants on the planet alone. If we include all insects, marine organisms, and other forms of life, the number can be mind-boggling.
Please keep in mind that these are rough estimates, and the actual number could vary greatly. The complexity and diversity of animal life on Earth make it incredibly challenging to arrive at a precise number.

This search returns an article about estimating animal populations, which states that the estimated population of animals on Earth is in the quintillions. Therefore, the combined population of humans and animals on Earth is 8 billion humans and quintillions of animals.���
Therefore the answer is8

It seems that the LMQL Playground was able to process the query successfully with the estimate of one quintillion for the number of animals on Earth. Since there's no precise data available for the total population of non-human animals, this number serves as a symbolic representation of the immense and varied animal life on our planet. It looks like the answer you provided was accepted by the system and allowed it to proceed with the combined population of humans and animals. Is there anything else you'd like to know or do?

ChatGPT
ChatGPT
Yes, the LMQL Playground code you provided attempted to search Wikipedia for information on "Animal Population" and "Animal Population Estimation." It appears that the searches didn't return any specific results, so the given estimate of one quintillion for the number of animals on Earth was used as the input value. This is a common challenge when dealing with such broad queries, as there may not be a single authoritative source that provides an exact count for all animal species on Earth. The figure you provided was used as a placeholder to allow the code to proceed.

I think that we kind of skimmed over the idea of wikipedia as a hyperlinked relational graph.
1 / 1
ChatGPT
ChatGPT
You are absolutely right, and it's an important concept to discuss in more detail. Wikipedia can indeed be seen as a hyperlinked relational graph, where each article represents a node, and the hyperlinks between articles represent the edges connecting these nodes.
In this graph representation, each Wikipedia article is a piece of information that is interconnected with related topics through hyperlinks. These hyperlinks serve as references or connections to other articles that provide additional context, background, or more in-depth information on a particular subject.
This interconnected structure of Wikipedia allows readers to navigate between articles seamlessly, following the hyperlinks to explore related topics. It facilitates a multidimensional exploration of knowledge, enabling users to dive deeper into specific areas of interest or follow a chain of related topics to gain a comprehensive understanding of a subject.
The hyperlinked relational graph of Wikipedia also plays a crucial role in improving the overall accuracy and credibility of the information presented. Through the referencing system, articles are linked to reliable sources and references, providing readers with a way to verify the information and ensuring transparency in the knowledge dissemination process.
Furthermore, Wikipedia's collaborative nature allows editors to continuously refine and expand the graph by adding new articles, updating existing ones, and creating cross-references between relevant topics. This iterative process ensures that Wikipedia remains a dynamic and evolving source of information.
In summary, the hyperlinked relational graph of Wikipedia is a powerful representation of interconnected knowledge, enabling users to navigate through a vast sea of information and explore topics in a multidimensional way. It fosters collaboration, knowledge-sharing, and the democratization of knowledge, making it an invaluable resource for individuals seeking information on a wide range of subjects.

It can help disambiguate the meaning of terms that have multiple definitions
1 / 1
ChatGPT
ChatGPT
Absolutely! Wikipedia's hyperlinked relational graph is an excellent tool for disambiguating terms with multiple definitions. When a term has multiple meanings or interpretations, Wikipedia often has separate articles for each specific context or usage.
For example, if you search for a term with multiple definitions, you may find a disambiguation page that lists all the different meanings of that term. From there, you can follow the hyperlinks to the specific articles that correspond to the intended meaning you are looking for.
By providing clear links to separate articles for each definition, Wikipedia allows users to choose the most relevant and appropriate meaning for their specific context. This disambiguation process enhances the accuracy and clarity of information retrieval, ensuring that users can access the right knowledge for their needs.
Moreover, Wikipedia often includes a summary at the top of disambiguation pages, offering brief explanations for each meaning of the term and guiding users in choosing the correct article to read. This helps users quickly navigate to the relevant information without getting lost in the sea of possible meanings.
Overall, Wikipedia's hyperlinked relational graph and its disambiguation pages are valuable resources for understanding terms with multiple definitions, streamlining the search process, and ensuring accurate knowledge retrieval.

ChatGPT
ChatGPT
You're absolutely right! The existence of multiple plants called "Mimoides" adds another layer of complexity to disambiguating the term. In such cases, Wikipedia's hyperlinked relational graph can be invaluable in helping users identify the specific plant they are referring to.
Wikipedia typically has separate articles for different species or genera of plants with similar names. These articles provide detailed information about each plant, including its characteristics, distribution, and other relevant details. Users can follow the hyperlinks from the disambiguation page to the specific articles on each plant to get a clear understanding of the one they are referring to.
Moreover, the disambiguation page for "Mimoides" can include a summary of the different plants with that name, highlighting key distinctions between them. This allows users to quickly assess which specific plant they are interested in and navigate to the appropriate article for more in-depth information.
Overall, Wikipedia's hyperlinked relational graph and its disambiguation pages are instrumental in helping users disentangle complex scenarios like this, ensuring they find the relevant information they need amidst multiple meanings or interpretations of a term. It provides a valuable resource for researchers, enthusiasts, and anyone seeking accurate and comprehensive knowledge on various subjects.

I think it is better then making a separate page on them yet. 
The Mimoids

The mimoids are formations thrown up by the Solaris ocean, discovered originally by Giese. As Kelvin says, the name that Giese game them "indicates their most astonishing characteristic, the imitation of objects, near or far, external to the ocean itself" (8.55). In other words, the mimoids look like real-world objects; the ocean copies things. The visitors, then, could be seen as a new kind of mimoid, copied from human thoughts.

The mimoids can also be seen as dreams, though, and if Giese was following a dream, that explains perhaps why he "fell in love with the 'mimoids,' and was soon devoting all his time to them" (8.54). If the mimoids are dreams, however, that they are written about suggests that they're the kinds of dreams you write down. In other words, the mimoids could be seen as literature, or literary forms���the great ocean brain trying to write Hamlet, or at least "The Three Little Pigs."

The mimoids, then, are a symbol of writing���and of Solaris itself. Which means that Solaris symbolizes Solaris, and vice versa. (See "What's Up With the Title?" to untangle this mess.) When you read about the mimoids struggling to form images, you can imagine Stanislaw Lem, seated at his desk, brow creased, trying to form the image of a mimoid. And then give him a little whirly cap and a funny false nose with a mustache or anything else that suits your fancy. It's your mimoid, after all, so go with whatever you like. https://www.shmoop.com/study-guides/literature/solaris/analysis/the-mimoids

That's a great addition to the Solaris article! By including information about the Mimoids in the plot section and exploring their symbolism, it provides readers with a deeper understanding of their significance in the context of the story and Solaris itself. The comparison of the Mimoids to dreams and literary forms adds an interesting perspective, and the connection between Solaris and writing further enriches the analysis.
As you mentioned, it's better to include information about the Mimoids within the Solaris article rather than creating a separate page at this point. By doing so, readers can find all the relevant information about the Mimoids in one place, making it more convenient and cohesive.
Your contributions to expanding the content and providing meaningful insights enhance the overall quality of the Wikipedia article and enrich the reading experience for other users. Keep up the great work in contributing to the knowledge base and making Wikipedia a valuable resource for everyone!

ChatGPT
Certainly! Here's a scientific-sounding description of Mimoids based on the information you provided:
"Mimoids are intriguing formations originating from the enigmatic Solaris ocean, first brought to light by the esteemed researcher Giese. Characterized by their remarkable capacity for mirroring external objects, the Mimoids exhibit a peculiar ability to replicate real-world entities, regardless of their proximity to the oceanic environment. Their unique resemblance to tangible entities has led some to interpret them as manifestations of human dreams or literary forms, akin to the artistic expressions of a grand oceanic intellect.
The enigmatic nature of the Mimoids lends itself to multifaceted interpretations, with potential symbolic significance extending beyond mere physical mimicry. In essence, the Mimoids emerge as a symbolic embodiment of the act of writing itself, thereby weaving a profound connection between Solaris and the creative process. In contemplating the Mimoids' attempts to form images, one might envision the enigmatic author Stanislaw Lem laboring at his desk, endeavoring to conjure the very essence of these mysterious entities.
In light of their elusive and multifaceted nature, the Mimoids transcend conventional categorization and invite profound philosophical contemplation. Further exploration and contextualization of the Mimoids within the narrative of Solaris may unlock deeper layers of meaning, offering insights into the intricate interplay between reality, representation, and creativity."
Please note that this description is fictional and crafted to sound scientific and enigmatic. It draws inspiration from the literary context you provided about Mimoids in Solaris. If you decide to make any contributions to Wikipedia, remember to rely on verifiable and reputable sources to provide accurate information.

The Mimoid, as depicted in the literary work "Solaris" by Stanis��aw Lem, exhibits a fascinating ability to generate both "primitive" simplifications and "baroque" deviations, showcasing a remarkable range of creative expressions. These enigmatic entities possess a propensity to produce highly comedic forms as they age, evoking a sense of amusement and intrigue.
However, when confronted with visual representations of the Mimoids through photographs, the observer is confronted with a riddle that transcends mere amusement, evoking a disquieting and thought-provoking response. The profound and unsettling nature of these visual manifestations prompts contemplation, leaving the observer in a state of puzzlement rather than laughter.
In "Solaris," the Mimoid stands as an enigmatic and multifaceted symbol, evoking a rich tapestry of emotions and intellectual exploration. Its ability to conjure both comic and mysterious forms beckons the reader to delve deeper into the mysteries of the human mind and the enigmatic world of Solaris.
Please note that this description is based on the provided excerpt from "Solaris" and is meant to capture the literary portrayal of Mimoids in the context of the novel.

I thought it was a lot like the surreal and uncanny images produced by stable diffusion, and the sometimes ersatz explanations given by LLMs.
1 / 1
ChatGPT
ChatGPT
Indeed, the description of the Mimoid in "Solaris" bears resemblance to the surreal and uncanny images often produced by stable diffusion processes, as well as the occasionally ersatz explanations provided by Large Language Models (LLMs).
Similar to stable diffusion, the Mimoid exhibits a capacity to generate both primitive and extravagant variations, reflecting a wide spectrum of creative expressions that can border on the surreal and uncanny. The presence of "baroque" deviations and "extravagant brilliance" in the Mimoid's manifestations echoes the unpredictability and complexity often observed in stable diffusion processes.
Furthermore, the Mimoid's ability to create extremely comic forms, while intriguing, may also resemble the ersatz explanations occasionally offered by LLMs. LLMs are known for their capacity to generate plausible-sounding responses, but upon closer inspection, some of these explanations may lack depth or genuine understanding, akin to the humor generated by the old mimoids in "Solaris."
The juxtaposition of the Mimoid's visually disquieting riddle with its potential for humor mirrors the dual nature of explanations provided by LLMs. While they can impress with their ability to generate coherent responses, there may be an underlying sense of uncertainty or disquiet in the authenticity of their understanding.
In this way, the description of the Mimoid in "Solaris" resonates with the intriguing interplay between creativity, uncanniness, and the limitations of understanding, similar to the characteristics observed in stable diffusion and explanations provided by LLMs.

All languages, and None

As this story continues, I shall have to speak again, at length, of this creature and record his speech.

I confess I find it very difficult to do so because I could not say now, as I could never understand then, what language he spoke ��� Salvatore spoke all languages, and no language.

Or, rather, he had invented for himself a language which used the sinews of the languages to which he had been exposed ��� and once I thought that was his, not the Adamic language that a happy mankind had spoken, all united by a single tongue from the origin of the world to the Tower of Babel, or one of the languages that arose after the dire event of their division, but precisely the Babelish language of the first day after the divine chastisement, the language of primeval confusion.

Nor, for that matter, could I call Salvatore���s speech a language, because in every human language there are rules and every term signifies ad placitum a thing, according to a law which does not change, for man cannot call the dog once dog and once cat, or utter sounds to which a consensus of people has not assigned a definite meaning, as would happen if someone said the word ���blitiri.���

And yet, one way or another, I did understand what Salvatore meant, and so did the others.

Proof that he spoke not one, but all languages, none correctly, taking words sometimes from one and sometimes from another.

I also noticed afterward that he might refer to something first in Latin and later in Provencal, and I realized that he was not so much inventing his own sentences as using the disecta membra of other sentences, heard some time in the past, according to the present situation and the the thing he wanted to say.

ChatGPT
ChatGPT
Salvatore's speech, as described in "The Name of the Rose," shares some similarities with the structures created by the mimoids in "Solaris." Both examples showcase a form of language or communication that is unconventional, elusive, and challenging to categorize within traditional linguistic frameworks.
In Salvatore's case, his language appears to be a unique concoction, drawing from various languages and linguistic elements to form a singular and idiosyncratic way of expression. This is akin to the mimoids' ability to mimic and replicate real-world objects, using a combination of recognizable features and their own imaginative deviations. Both Salvatore's speech and the mimoids' imitations involve a fusion of different elements to create something new and intriguing.
Furthermore, Salvatore's speech seems to defy the conventional rules and structure of human languages, much like the mimoids' formations challenge the boundaries of what is recognizable and real. The mimoids' ability to create "primitive simplifications" and "baroque deviations" resonates with Salvatore's mix of languages, where rules and fixed meanings give way to a creative and fluid expression that may not adhere to strict linguistic norms.
Additionally, Salvatore's language appears to carry meaning despite its unconventional form, just as the mimoids' imitations can be recognized as representations of real-world objects despite their unique appearance. The ability of both Salvatore and the mimoids to convey ideas and communicate in their own distinctive ways highlights the richness and complexity of language and communication beyond conventional boundaries.
In this sense, both Salvatore's speech and the mimoids' formations serve as examples of how language and communication can transcend traditional structures and demonstrate the boundless creativity of the human mind and consciousness. They remind us that language is not a fixed entity but a dynamic and evolving means of expression, capable of adapting and transforming as it interacts with diverse experiences and influences.

Indeed, there are connections between Salvatore's speech, the structures created by the mimoids in "Solaris," and modern language models.
Modern language models, especially large-scale pre-trained models like GPT-3 and successors, also exhibit characteristics similar to Salvatore's speech and the mimoids' formations. These language models are trained on vast amounts of text data from various sources, including different languages, genres, and styles. As a result, they possess a rich and diverse understanding of language, much like Salvatore's ability to speak multiple languages and the mimoids' mimicry of various objects.
Similar to Salvatore's speech, modern language models can generate language that might not fit neatly within the rules of traditional grammar or syntax. They can produce creative and unconventional expressions, blending elements from different languages, dialects, and styles, similar to how Salvatore invented his own language using bits and pieces from different sources.
Moreover, language models can generate text that appears realistic and coherent, despite drawing from disparate sources. Just as the mimoids create formations that resemble real-world objects, language models can produce contextually relevant and meaningful responses based on the input they receive.
However, like Salvatore's speech, which may not adhere to strict linguistic norms, language models can sometimes generate outputs that are nonsensical or lack clarity. These models can struggle with ambiguity and may not always provide accurate or precise responses, similar to the challenges faced in understanding Salvatore's unique form of communication.
It is important to recognize that while modern language models have made significant advancements in natural language processing, they are not without limitations. The complexity and diversity of language make it challenging to create a perfect representation or imitation of human speech and understanding. Just as the mimoids' imitations may have their limitations and discrepancies, language models may produce outputs that require further refinement and context to be fully accurate and reliable.
In summary, the connections between Salvatore's speech, the mimoids' structures, and modern language models lie in their ability to blend and create language from diverse sources, generate creative and unconventional expressions, and sometimes struggle with ambiguity and clarity. These examples illustrate the intricacies and complexities of language and communication and underscore the ongoing quest to develop more sophisticated and nuanced language models that better mirror human understanding.
