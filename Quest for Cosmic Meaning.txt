1. The Human Context
The human desire for meaning finds vivid expression in the stories we tell, diaries we keep, and in our deepest hopes and fears. According to twentieth century Freudian psychoanalyst Bruno Bettelheim, ���our greatest need and most difficult achievement is to find meaning in our lives��� (Bettelheim 1978: 3). Holocaust survivor and psychiatrist Viktor Frankl said that the human will to meaning comes prior to either our will to pleasure or will to power (Frankl 2006: 99).

Questions about meaning arise and take shape within varied contexts: when struggling to make an important decision about what to do with our lives, when trapped in a job we hate, when wondering if there is more to life than the daily hum-drum, when diagnosed with a terminal illness, when experiencing the loss of a loved one, when feeling small while looking up at the night sky, when wondering if this universe is all there is and why it is even here in the first place, when questioning whether life and love will have a lasting place in the universe or whether the whole show will end in utter and everlasting desolation and silence.

Lurking behind many of our questions about meaning is our capacity to get outside of ourselves, to view our lives from a wider standpoint, a standpoint from which to understand the setting for our lives and question the ���why?��� of what we do. Humans possess self-awareness, and can take an observational, self-reflective viewpoint on our lives. In this, we are able to shift from mere automatic engagement to observation and evaluation. We do more than simply respond to streams of stimuli. We step back and question who we are and what we do. Shifting our focus to the widest standpoint���sub specie aeternitatis (literally, from the perspective of eternity; a universal perspective)���we wonder how such infinitesimally small and fleeting creatures like ourselves fit in the grand scheme of things, within vast space and time. We worry about whether a reality of such staggering magnitude, at the deepest level, cares about us (for related discussions, see Fischer 1993; Kahane 2013; Landau 2011; Nagel 1971, 1989; and Seachris 2013).

That our concerns about meaning are often cosmically-focused is instructive. Despite the current theoretical emphasis in analytic philosophy on the more terrestrially-focused idea of meaning in life, questions about meaning are very often cosmic in scope. In the words of sociologist Peter Berger, in seeking life���s meaning, many are attempting to locate it ���within a sacred and cosmic frame of reference��� of trying to plumb the connection ���between microcosm and macrocosm��� (Berger 1967: 27). This is an important reason why God, transcendence, and other ideas embodied and expressed in religion are so often thought to be relevant to life���s meaning.

It's from The Meaning of Life: Contemporary Analytic Perspectives
Depending on whom one asks, the question, ���What is the meaning of life?��� is either the most profound question of human existence or else nothing more than a nonsensical request built on conceptual confusion, much like, ���What does the color red taste like?��� or ���What is heavier than the heaviest object?��� Ask a non-philosopher, ���What do philosophers discuss?��� and a likely answer will be, ���The meaning of life.��� Ask the same question of a philosopher within the analytic tradition, and you will rarely get this answer. The sources of suspicion about the question within analytic philosophy, especially in earlier periods, are varied. First, the question of life���s meaning is conceptually challenging because of terms like ���the��� ���meaning��� and ���life,��� and especially given the grammatical form in which they are arranged. Second, it is often asked with transcendent, spiritual, or religious assumptions at the fore about what the world ���should��� be like in order for there to be a meaning of life. In so far as the question is entangled with such ideas, the worry is that even if the concept of a meaning of life is coherent, there likely is not one.

Despite such suspicions and relative disinterest in the question of life���s meaning among analytic philosophers for a large part of the twentieth century, there is a growing body of work on the topic over roughly the last two decades. Much of this work focuses on developing and defending theories of meaning in life (see Section 2.d. for more on the distinction between meaning in life and the meaning of life) via conceptual analyses of the necessary and sufficient conditions for meaningful life. A smaller, though no less important, subset of work in this growing field focuses on why we even use ���meaning��� in the first place to voice our questions and concerns about central facets of the human condition.

This article surveys important trajectories in discussions of life���s meaning within contemporary analytic philosophy. It begins by introducing key aspects of the human context in which the question is asked. The article then investigates three ideas that illumine what meaning means in this context: sense-making, purpose, and significance. The article continues by surveying important topics that provide a greater understanding of what is involved in our requests for meaning. After briefly surveying theories of meaning in life, it concludes with discussions of death and futility, followed by important areas of research that remain under-investigated.

The passage you shared offers an insightful overview of how contemporary analytic philosophy approaches the concept of life's meaning. It addresses several key points:
Perceptions of the Meaning of Life
: There's a contrast in how the question "What is the meaning of life?" is perceived. Among the general public, it's seen as a profound existential question. However, within analytic philosophy, especially historically, there has been skepticism and reluctance to engage with this question, partly due to its conceptual complexity and assumptions about transcendence, spirituality, or religion.
Challenges in Conceptualizing 'Meaning of Life'
: The difficulty lies in the ambiguous nature of terms like "meaning" and "life" and the way they are used together. This complexity has led to some skepticism within the philosophical community.
Shift in Analytic Philosophy
: Despite historical disinterest or skepticism, the last two decades have seen a growing body of work within analytic philosophy focused on the meaning of life. This includes exploring theories of what constitutes a meaningful life and why the concept of 'meaning' is so central to human concerns.
Focus Areas of Contemporary Discussion
: The article outlines the structure of contemporary discussions on life's meaning in analytic philosophy. It begins with the human context and explores three key aspects: sense-making, purpose, and significance. It then delves into theories of meaning in life, the role of death and futility, and areas that need further investigation.
Meaning in Life vs. The Meaning of Life
: An important distinction is noted between 'meaning in life' (which seems to be more about personal fulfillment and purpose) and 'the meaning of life' (a broader, more existential question).
Overall, the passage indicates a nuanced shift in the analytic philosophical landscape, moving from skepticism to a more active engagement with the question of life's meaning. This shift involves not only developing theories but also understanding why the concept of 'meaning' is so integral to our understanding of the human condition.

2. The Contemporary Analytic Context: Prolegomena
Relatively speaking, not too long ago many analytic philosophers were suspicious that the question of life���s meaning was incoherent. Such views found expression in popular culture too, for example, in Douglas Adams��� widely read book The Hitchhiker���s Guide to the Galaxy. The story���s central characters visit the legendary planet Magrathea and learn about a race of hyper-intelligent beings who built a computer named Deep Thought. Deep Thought���s purpose was to answer the ultimate question of life, the universe, and everything, that answer being a bewildering 42. Deep Thought explained that this answer was incomprehensible because the beings who designed it, though super-intelligent, did not really know what they were asking in the first place. Asking for life���s meaning might be like this, in which case 42 is as good of an answer as any other.

Some analytic philosophers in the twentieth century, in the wake of logical positivism, shared Deep Thought���s suspicion. They were particularly weary of the traditional formulation���What is the meaning of life? Meaning, it was thought, belongs in the linguistic realm. Words, sentences, and other linguistic constructions are the proper bearers of meaning, not objects, events, or states of affairs, and certainly not life itself. Some philosophers thought that in asking for life���s meaning, we use an ill-chosen expression to voice something real, perhaps an emotional response of awe or wonder at the staggering fact that anything exists at all. Yet, experiencing such feelings and asking a meaningful question are two different things altogether.

Asking what something means, though, need not be a strictly semantic activity. We ask for the meanings of all kinds of things and employ ���meaning��� in a wide variety of contexts in everyday life, only some of which are narrowly linguistic. Paying careful attention to the meanings of ���meaning��� provides important clues about what life���s meaning is all about. Three connotations in particular are instructive here: sense-making, purpose, and significance.

This section, "The Contemporary Analytic Context: Prolegomena," from your text, presents an insightful look at the evolution of thought regarding the meaning of life within the field of analytic philosophy. Key points include:
Historical Skepticism in Analytic Philosophy
: Originally, many analytic philosophers viewed the question of life's meaning as potentially incoherent. This skepticism was influenced by movements like logical positivism, which emphasized that meaning is primarily a linguistic concept applicable to words and sentences rather than to life or existence itself.
Cultural Reflections
: The skepticism about life's meaning in philosophy found echoes in popular culture, as illustrated by the reference to Douglas Adams��� "The Hitchhiker���s Guide to the Galaxy." In this story, the answer to the ultimate question of life is humorously given as "42," suggesting the absurdity or incomprehensibility of the question itself.
Linguistic Focus of Traditional Philosophy
: Earlier philosophers focused on the linguistic aspects of meaning, arguing that meaning is attributed to language rather than to objects, events, or existential states. This viewpoint led to the idea that the question of life's meaning might be a misuse of language to express a deep emotional response like awe or wonder.
Expanding the Concept of Meaning
: The text suggests that the concept of 'meaning' should not be limited to linguistic semantics. In everyday life, 'meaning' is applied in various contexts, not all strictly linguistic. This broader understanding can provide insights into what life's meaning might entail.
Key Connotations of 'Meaning'
: Three particular connotations of 'meaning' are highlighted as important for understanding life's meaning: sense-making (how we understand or interpret experiences), purpose (the intention or goal behind actions or existence), and significance (the importance or value attributed to aspects of life).
This section seems to set the stage for a more nuanced understanding of the question of life's meaning, moving beyond the constraints of linguistic analysis and embracing a broader, more existential perspective. It marks a transition from traditional skepticism to a more open and exploratory approach in contemporary analytic philosophy.

a. The Meanings of ���Meaning���
Meaning-talk is common in everyday discourse. Most ordinary uses of ���meaning��� tend to cluster around three basic ideas: (1) sense-making (which can include the ideas of intelligibility, clarification, or coherence), (2) purpose, and (3) significance (which can include the idea of value). The following list of statements and questions captures the richly varied ways in which we employ the concept of meaning on a regular basis.

Meaning as Sense-Making

What you said didn���t mean a thing.
What did you mean by that statement?
Do you know what I mean?
What did you mean by that face? (overlaps with purpose)
What is the meaning of that book? (what is it about?)
What is the meaning of this? (for example, when asked upon returning home to find one���s house ransacked)
Meaning as Purpose

What did you mean by that face? (overlaps with intelligibility)
The tantrum is meant to catch his dad���s attention.
What is the meaning of that book? (why was it written?)
I really mean it!
I didn���t mean to do it. I promise!
Meaning as Significance

That was such a meaningful
This watch really means something to me.
That is a highly meaningful event in the life of that city.
What do his first six months in office mean for the country (likely overlaps with intelligibility)
That is a meaningful
That is a meaningless
You mean nothing to me.

This section, "The Meanings of 'Meaning'," outlines how the concept of 'meaning' is used in everyday language, emphasizing its diversity and complexity. It identifies three primary ways in which the term is commonly used:
Meaning as Sense-Making
: This involves understanding, clarifying, or finding coherence in something. Examples include trying to grasp what someone meant by their words or actions, interpreting the content or message of a book, or seeking an explanation for a puzzling situation (like a ransacked house).
Meaning as Purpose
: Here, 'meaning' relates to intention or goal. It can refer to the reason behind someone's behavior (like a tantrum meant to attract attention), the purpose of an action (such as the intended message or effect of a gesture), or the author's intent in writing a book.
Meaning as Significance
: In this context, 'meaning' involves the importance, value, or emotional resonance something has. This could be the personal significance of an object (like a cherished watch), the importance of an event (for a city or country), or the emotional impact of a relationship or action (something being meaningful or meaningless).
The section demonstrates that 'meaning' is a versatile concept applied in various ways in our daily lives. It's not just a philosophical or abstract term; it's deeply embedded in how we communicate and understand our world. This multifaceted use of 'meaning' in everyday language provides a foundation for exploring its more complex philosophical dimensions, especially regarding the meaning of life.

i. Sense-Making
This category is an important ordinary sense of meaning and connotes ideas like intelligibility, clarification, and coherence. Something has meaning if it makes sense; it lacks meaning if it does not. One way of understanding sense-making is through the idea of proper fit. Words, concepts, propositions, but also events and states of affairs, make sense and are meaningful if and when they fit together properly; if they lack such fit, they make no sense and are meaningless. This applies narrowly. For example, it makes no sense to ask, ���What is brighter than the brightest light source?��� It does not fit with the concept brightest to ask what is brighter, but it has a broader application too. We say things like:

It does not make sense for the president to send in troops given the geopolitical situation in the region.
Asking philosophy students to perform long-division on their midterm makes no sense.
In each of these situations, we perceive a lack of fit���a lack of fit between a decision and circumstances surrounding that decision or between reasonable expectations about what one will find on a philosophy exam and what one actually finds. There is a kind of absurdity here. Perceiving this weaker lack of fit will be a product of beliefs, norms, and other epistemic, evaluative, and social commitments. Therefore, determining whether or not something, in fact, involves a lack of fit in this broader sense often will be a messier task than in cases of narrow sense-making.
ChatGPT
ChatGPT
The "Sense-Making" category, as described in your text, refers to an essential aspect of how we perceive and interpret meaning in various contexts. This concept involves several key ideas:
Intelligibility, Clarification, and Coherence
: Sense-making is about understanding something in a coherent and clear manner. If an idea, statement, or event is intelligible and fits together logically, it is considered meaningful. Conversely, if it lacks coherence or clarity, it is seen as meaningless.
Concept of Proper Fit
: The idea of 'proper fit' is central to sense-making. This means that for something to make sense, its components or aspects must align or fit together logically. This applies to words, concepts, propositions, events, and states of affairs.
Narrow and Broader Applications
: Sense-making can be applied both narrowly and broadly. Narrowly, it refers to logical consistency within specific concepts, such as the incoherence of asking "What is brighter than the brightest light source?" Broadly, it applies to situations or decisions where there's a perceived lack of fit between actions and the context or expectations, like an inappropriate decision by a president or an unexpected task in a philosophy exam.
Absurdity and Lack of Fit
: When there's a lack of fit, especially in the broader sense, it can lead to a perception of absurdity. This misalignment can be between actions and their contexts, or between expectations and reality.
Influence of Beliefs, Norms, and Commitments
: In the broader application of sense-making, determining whether something makes sense often involves considering various beliefs, norms, and social commitments. This makes the process of identifying a lack of fit more complex and subjective compared to narrow sense-making.
In essence, sense-making is about evaluating whether things align logically and coherently within a given context, whether linguistic or situational. It's a fundamental way in which we ascribe meaning to our experiences and the world around us.

4. Death, Futility, and a Meaningful Life
Life���s meaning is closely linked with a cluster of related issues including death, futility, and endings in general. These are important themes in the literature on meaning, and are found in a wide array of sources ranging from the Old Testament book of Ecclesiastes to Tolstoy to Camus to contemporary analytic writing on the topic. Worries that death, as conceived on naturalism, threatens meaning lead into discussions about futility. It is a commonly held view that life is futile if all we are and do eventually comes to nothing. If naturalism is true and death is the end . . . period . . . then life is futile, so the argument goes. Left undeveloped, it is not entirely clear what people mean by this, though the sentiment behind the idea is intense and prevalent.

In order to explore the worry further, it is important to get clearer on what is meant by futility. In ordinary cases, something is futile when the accomplishment or fulfillment of what is aimed at or desired is impossible. Examples of futility include:

It is futile for a human being to try to both exist and not exist at the same time and in the same sense.

It is futile to try and jump to Mars.

It is futile to try and write an entire, 300-page novel, from start to finish, in one hour.

On the preceding account of futility, the existential angst that accompanies some instance of futility is proportional to how one feels about what it is that is futile. The extent to which one is invested���for example, emotionally and relationally���in attempting to reach some desired end will affect how she responds to real or perceived futility (���perceived��� because one could be wrong about whether or not something is, in fact, futile). Imagine that a person has a curiosity to experience flying as a falcon flies. It would be futile to attempt to fly as a falcon flies. Though this person might be minimally distressed as a result of not being able to experience this, it is doubtful he would experience soul-crushing angst. Contrast this with a situation where one has trained for years to run an ironman triathlon, but one week prior to the event, she is paralyzed from the neck down in a tragic automobile accident. To now try and compete in the triathlon without mechanical assistance would be futile. Given the importance of this goal in the person���s life, she would appropriately feel significant existential angst at not being able to compete. Years of training would be unrewarded. Deep hopes would be dashed. A central life goal is now forever unfulfilled. The level of existential angst accompanying futility, then, is proportional to the level of one���s investment in some desired end and the relative desirability of that end.

The preceding analysis is relevant to futility and life���s meaning. What might people have in mind when they say that life itself is futile if naturalism is true and death is the last word of our lives and the universe? The discrepancy here from which a sense of futility emerges is between central longings of the human heart and a world devoid of God and an afterlife, which is a world incapable of fulfilling such longings. There is a stark incongruity between what we really want (even what we might say we need) and a completely and utterly silent universe that does not care. There is also a discrepancy between the final state of affairs where quite literally nothing matters, and the current state of affairs where many things seem to matter (e.g., relationships, personal and cultural achievements, and scientific advancements, among others). It seems hard to fathom that things with such existential gravitas are but a vapor in the grand scheme of things. We might also call this absurd, since absurdity and futility are connected, both of which are partly encapsulated in the idea of a profound incongruity or lack of fit.

Futility, in this way, connects to hope and expectations about fulfillment and longevity. In some circumstances, we are inclined to think that something is characterized by futility if it does not last as long as we think it should last given the kind of thing that it is. If you spend half a day building a snow fort and your children destroy it in five minutes, you will be inclined to think that your efforts were futile even though you accomplished your goal of building the fort. You will not, however, think your efforts were futile if the fort lasts a few days and provides you and your children with several fun adventures and a classic snowball fight. It needs to last long enough to serve its purpose.

Some say that an average human lifetime with average human experiences is sufficient to satiate core human longings and for us to accomplish central purposes (see Trisel 2004). Others, however, think that only eternity is long enough to do justice to those aspects of the human condition of superlative value, primarily and especially, happiness and love, the latter understood roughly as commitment to the true good or well-being of another. Some things are of such sublime character that for them to be extinguished, even after eons upon eons, is truly tragic, so the thinking goes. Anything less than forever is less than enough time, and leads to a sense of futility. We want the most important things in life���especially happiness, love and relationships���to last indefinitely. But if naturalism is true, all will be dissolved in the death of ourselves and the universe; it will be as if none of this ever happened. If the important stuff of life that we are so invested in lasts only a short while, many worry that life itself is deeply and ultimately futile.

Futility, then, is sometimes linked with how something ends. With life���s meaning in view, many worry that its meaning is jeopardized if, in the end, all comes indelibly to naught. Such worries have been articulated in what some call Final Outcome Arguments (see Wielenberg 2006). A final outcome argument is one whose conclusion is that life is somewhat or wholly meaningless or absurd or futile because of a ���bad��� ending. Such arguments can have weaker and stronger conclusions, ranging from a ���bad��� ending only slightly mitigating meaning all the way to completely destroying meaning. What they all have in common, however, is that they give the ending an important say in evaluating life���s meaning.

Why think that endings have such power? Many have argued that giving them this power arbitrarily privileges the future over the past. Thomas Nagel once said that ���. . . it does not matter now that in a million years nothing we do now will matter��� (Nagel 1971: 716). Why should we think the future is more important than, or relevant at all to the past and the present? But perhaps Nagel is mistaken. There may, in fact, be good reasons to think that how life ends is relevant for evaluating its meaning (see Seachris 2011). Whichever conclusion one adopts, principled reasons must be offered to settle the question of which viewpoint���the distant future or the immediate present���takes priority in appraisals of life���s meaning.

5. Underinvestigated Areas
Within value theory, an under-investigated area is how meaning fits within the overall normative landscape. How is it connected, if at all, with ethical, aesthetic, and eudaimonistic value, for example? What sorts of relationships, conceptual, causal or otherwise, exist between the various values? Do some reduce to others? Can profoundly unethical lives still count as meaningful? What about profoundly unhappy lives? These and other questions are on the table as a growing number of researchers investigate them.

Another area in need of increased attention is the relationship between meaning and suffering. Suffering intersects with our attempts to make sense of our lives in this universe, motivates our questions about why we are here, and gives rise to our concerns about whether or not we ultimately matter. We wonder if there is an intelligible, existentially satisfying narrative in which to locate���make sense of���our visceral experience of suffering, and to give us solace and hope. Evil in a meaningful universe does not cease from being evil, but it can be more bearable within these hospitable conditions. Perhaps the problem of meaning is more fundamental than the problem of evil. Also relevant is what can be called the eschatological dimension of the problem of evil���is there any hope in the face of pain, suffering, and death, and if so, in what does this hope consist? Addressing future-oriented considerations of suffering will naturally link to perennial meaning of life topics like death and futility. Additionally, it will motivate further discussion over whether the inherent human desire for a felicitous ending to life���s narrative, including, for example, post-mortem survival and enjoyment of the beatific vision or some other blessed state is mere wishful thinking or a cousin to our desire for water, and thus, a truly natural desire that points to an object capable of fulfilling it.

Equally under-investigated is how the concept of narrative (and meta-narrative) might shed light on the meaning of life, and especially what talk of life���s meaning is often all about. Historically, most of the satisfying narratives that in some way narrated the meaning of life were also religious or quasi-religious. Additionally, many of these narratives count as narratives in the paradigmatic sense as opposed to non-narrative modes of discourse. However, with the rise of naturalism in the West, these narratives and the religious or quasi-religious worldviews embedded within them, began to lose traction in certain sectors. Out of this milieu emerged more angst-laden questioning of life���s meaning accompanied by the fear that a naturalistic meta-narrative of the universe fails to be existentially satisfying. More work is needed by cognitive scientists, theologians, and philosophers on our narrative proclivities as human beings, and how these proclivities shape and illumine our pursuit of meaning.

Finally, a number of pressing practical and ethical questions, especially focusing on marginalized populations, deserve more careful attention. For example, how might the actual lives and experiences of persons with disabilities inform and constrain theories of meaning in life? Do their lives call into question certain theories of meaning? What does the practice of solitary confinement reveal about the human need of meaning? Does the profound lack of meaning in such circumstances provide a reason to impose stricter limitations on its use? How might the human need for meaning (see Bettelhiem 1978; Frankl 2006) be leveraged to understand and then address systemic societal issues like homelessness and opioid addiction? How can understanding seemingly pathological expressions of our yearning for meaning help make sense of and respond to nationalism and terrorism?

Analytic philosophy, once deeply skeptical of and indifferent to the meaning of life, is now the source of important and interesting new theorization on the topic. There is even something of a subfield emerging, consisting of researchers devoting significant time and energy to understanding conceptual and practical aspects of life���s meaning. The topic is being approached with an analytic rigor that is leading to progress and opening exciting avenues for promising new breakthroughs. The philosophical waters, though still murky, are clearing

ChatGPT
ChatGPT
Yes, Jaak Panksepp was a renowned neuroscientist and psychobiologist known for his pioneering work on the neural mechanisms of emotions. He is especially famous for his research into primary emotional systems in the brain, which he termed "affective neuroscience." Panksepp identified several core emotional systems in mammals, including humans, such as SEEKING, FEAR, RAGE, LUST, CARE, PANIC/GRIEF, and PLAY. These systems are thought to be the neurobiological basis for the feelings and motivations fundamental to animal behavior.
One of Panksepp's most notable contributions was the concept of the SEEKING system, a neural network that underlies the motivation to seek out resources and experiences. This system is considered foundational for understanding behaviors related to desire, enthusiasm, and exploration.
Panksepp's work has had a profound impact on the fields of psychology, psychiatry, and neuroscience, offering insights into the biological underpinnings of emotions and suggesting ways these insights could be applied to treat psychiatric disorders. His research emphasizes the importance of emotions in guiding human behavior and decision-making, highlighting the evolutionary continuity between humans and other animals in the basic mechanisms of emotion.

I was more interested in the fact that he studied animal homologues.
ChatGPT
ChatGPT
Jaak Panksepp's work indeed focused significantly on identifying and understanding animal homologues of human emotional systems. He conducted extensive research on the neural circuits and neurotransmitters that underlie emotional behaviors in animals, aiming to draw parallels between these systems in animals and their counterparts in humans. By studying how animals express and experience emotions, Panksepp sought to uncover the evolutionary origins of human emotions and provide a basis for understanding the neurobiological roots of psychiatric disorders.
One of the most compelling aspects of Panksepp's research was his study of the PLAY system in rats. He observed that rats engage in play behavior, such as joyfully chasing and frolicking with one another, and that this behavior was accompanied by high-frequency chirping sounds that he interpreted as analogous to human laughter. This discovery was groundbreaking because it suggested that the capacity for joy and playfulness is deeply rooted in the brain's evolutionary biology, shared across species.
Panksepp's investigations into the CARE system, which involves nurturing and attachment behaviors, also highlight the importance of studying animal models to understand complex emotional states in humans. By examining the biological basis of maternal care in animals, for example, he contributed to a deeper understanding of attachment, bonding, and social affiliation across species.
His work on the PANIC/GRIEF system, exploring how separation distress calls in animals relate to feelings of loneliness and grief in humans, further illustrates the value of studying animal homologues to elucidate the neural and evolutionary underpinnings of human emotional experiences.
Panksepp's emphasis on animal homologues of human emotions has underscored the continuity between human and animal emotional experiences, suggesting that many aspects of human emotional life have deep evolutionary roots. This perspective has not only advanced the field of affective neuroscience but also has implications for developing more effective treatments for emotional and mood disorders by targeting these fundamental emotional systems.
