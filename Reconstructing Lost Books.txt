Summarize: The four authors use algebraic K-theory as a gadget: They input Morava E-theory, and their output is a new invariant that they refer to as the algebraic K-theory of the fixed points of Morava E-theory. They then apply this new invariant to maps from spheres to telescopes and prove that it can see maps that Morava E-theory cannot.

The four authors employ algebraic K-theory as a tool by using Morava E-theory as an input to produce a new invariant, called the algebraic K-theory of the fixed points of Morava E-theory. They further apply this new invariant to maps from spheres to telescopes, demonstrating that it can detect maps that Morava E-theory is unable to recognize.

But calculating the number of maps for any difference larger than 100 exhausts modern computing power. And at the same time, mathematicians have not detected enough patterns in the number of maps to extrapolate further. Their goal is to fill out a table that specifies the number of maps for any difference in dimension, but that goal feels very far off.

���This is not a question I expect a complete solution to in the lifetime of my grandchildren,��� said Ravenel, who is 76.

The telescope conjecture makes a prediction about how the number of maps grows as the difference in dimension increases. In effect, it predicts that the number grows slowly. If it had been true, it would have made the problem of filling out that table a little bit easier.

Doubt Into Disbelief
The telescope conjecture got its name in an improbable way.

It started from the fact that in very high dimensions, geometric intuition formed in lower dimensions often breaks down, and it���s difficult to count maps between spheres. But in formulating his conjecture, Ravenel understood that you don���t have to. Instead of counting maps between spheres, you can make an easier proxy count of maps between spheres and objects called telescopes.

Telescopes involve a series of copies of a closed higher-dimensional curve, each one a scaled-down version of the one that came before it. The series of curves resembles the interlocking tubes of an actual collapsible telescope. ���As bizarre as this telescope sounds when you describe it, it���s actually an easier object to deal with than the sphere itself,��� Ravenel said.

But still, spheres can map onto telescopes in many different ways, and the challenge is knowing when those maps are genuinely distinct.

To determine whether two spaces are homotopic requires a mathematical test known as an invariant, which is a calculation based on properties of the spaces. If the calculation yields a different value for each space, you know they���re unique from the perspective of homotopy.

There are many kinds of invariants, and some can perceive differences that other invariants are blind to. The telescope conjecture predicts that an invariant called Morava E-theory (and its symmetries) can perfectly distinguish all maps between spheres and telescopes up to homotopy ��� that is, if Morava E-theory says the maps are distinct, they���re distinct, and if it says they���re the same, they���re the same.

But by 1989 Ravenel had begun to doubt it was true. His skepticism emerged from calculations he performed that did not seem to be consistent with the conjecture. But it wasn���t until October of that year, when a massive earthquake struck the Bay Area while he was in Berkeley, that those doubts codified into full-fledged disbelief.

���I came to this conclusion within a day or two of the earthquake, so I like to think something happened that made me think it wasn���t true,��� said Doug Ravenel.

Introduction
���I came to this conclusion within a day or two of the earthquake, so I like to think something happened that made me think it wasn���t true,��� Ravenel said.

Disproving the telescope conjecture would require finding a more powerful invariant that could see things Morava E-theory cannot. For decades no such invariant seemed to be available, placing the conjecture firmly out of reach. But progress in recent years changed that ��� and Burklund, Hahn, Levy and Schlank capitalized on it.

The Exploding Exotic
Their proof relies on a set of tools called algebraic K-theory, which was established in the 1950s by Alexander Grothendieck and has developed rapidly over the last decade. It has applications across mathematics, including in geometry, where it has the ability to supercharge an invariant

The task of calculating the number of maps for any difference greater than 100 in dimensions exceeds modern computing abilities, and patterns in the number of maps have not been discovered enough to extrapolate further. The goal is to fill a table that specifies the number of maps for any difference in dimension, but this seems distant.
The telescope conjecture predicts how the number of maps grows with increasing difference in dimension, suggesting a slow growth. It was named due to its formulation that instead of counting maps between spheres, an easier count between spheres and objects called telescopes can be made.
The challenge lies in understanding when the maps between spheres and telescopes are genuinely distinct. The conjecture predicted that an invariant called Morava E-theory could perfectly distinguish these maps. But doubts emerged, leading to disbelief in the conjecture.
Disproving the telescope conjecture required a more powerful invariant, and the proof of this finally came through a toolset known as algebraic K-theory, developed since the 1950s. This breakthrough by Burklund, Hahn, Levy, and Schlank opened new doors in understanding maps between different mathematical objects, but completing the entire task remains a complex challenge.

Introduction
In early June, buzz built as mathematicians landed at London���s Heathrow Airport. Their destination was the University of Oxford and a conference in honor of the 65th birthday of Michael Hopkins, a mathematician at Harvard University who���d served as a mentor to many of the attendees.

Hopkins made a name for himself in the late 1980s for work on seven conjectures that Doug Ravenel of the University of Rochester had formulated a decade earlier. They had to do with techniques for determining when two shapes, or spaces, that might look different are really the same. Hopkins and his collaborators proved all of Ravenel���s conjectures save one, a problem with a suggestive but mysterious name called the telescope conjecture.

At the time, Hopkins laid his work on Ravenel���s conjectures to rest. For decades afterward, the telescope conjecture seemed all but impossible to solve.

���You couldn���t touch a theorem like that,��� Hopkins said.

But as mathematicians landed in London, there were rumors that it had been done ��� by a group of four mathematicians with ties to the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, three of whom had been advised by Hopkins in graduate school. The youngest of the four, a graduate student named Ishan Levy, was scheduled to give a talk on Tuesday, the second day of the conference, which seemed to be when a proof might be announced.

For his 65th birthday, Mike Hopkins��� students gave him proof that the telescope conjecture is false.

Will Howcroft
Introduction
���I had heard rumors that this was coming up, and I didn���t know exactly what to expect,��� said Vesna Stojanoska, a mathematician at the University of Illinois, Urbana-Champaign who attended the conference.

It was soon clear the rumors were true. Beginning on Tuesday, and over the next three days, Levy and his co-authors ��� Robert Burklund, Jeremy Hahn and Tomer Schlank ��� explained to the crowd of some 200 mathematicians how they���d proved that the telescope conjecture was false, making it the only one of Ravenel���s original conjectures not to be true.

The disproof of the telescope conjecture has wide-ranging implications, but one of the simplest and most profound is this: It means that in very high dimensions (think of a 100-dimensional sphere), the universe of different shapes is far more complicated than mathematicians anticipated.

Mapping the Maps
To classify shapes, or topological spaces, mathematicians distinguish between differences that matter and those that don���t. Homotopy theory is a perspective from which to make those distinctions. It considers a ball and an egg to be fundamentally the same topological space, because you can bend and stretch one into the other without ripping either. In the same way, homotopy theory considers a ball and an inner tube to be fundamentally different because you have to tear a hole in the ball to deform it into the inner tube.

Homotopy is useful for classifying topological spaces ��� creating a chart of all the kinds of shapes that are possible. It���s also important for understanding something else mathematicians care about: maps between spaces. If you have two topological spaces, one way to probe their properties is to look for functions that convert, or map, points on one to points on the other ��� input a point on space A, get a point on space B as your output, and do that for all the points on A.

To see how these maps work, and why they illuminate properties of the spaces involved, start with a circle. Now map it onto the two-dimensional sphere, which is the surface of a ball. There are infinitely many ways of doing this. If you imagine the sphere as Earth���s surface, you could put your circle at any line of latitude, for example. From the perspective of homotopy theory, they���re all equivalent, or homotopic, because they can all shrink down to a point at the north or south pole.

Next, map the circle onto the two-dimensional surface of an inner tube (a one-holed torus). Again, there are infinitely many ways of doing this, and most are homotopic. But not all of them. You could place a circle horizontally or vertically around the torus, and neither can be smoothly deformed into the other. These are two (of many) ways of mapping a circle onto the torus, while there is just one way to map it onto a sphere, reflecting a fundamental difference between the two spaces: The torus has one hole while the sphere has none.

It���s easy to count the ways we can map from the circle to the two-dimensional sphere or torus. They���re familiar spaces that are easy to visualize. But counting maps is much harder when higher-dimensional spaces are involved.

Dimensional Differences
If two spheres have the same dimension, there are always infinitely many maps between them. And if the space you���re mapping from is lower-dimensional than the space you���re mapping to (as in our example of the one-dimensional circle mapped onto a two-dimensional sphere), there is always only one map.

Partly for that reason, counting maps is most interesting when the space you���re mapping from has a higher dimension than the space you���re mapping to, like when you map a seven-dimensional sphere onto a three-dimensional sphere. In cases like those, the number of maps is always finite.

���The maps between spheres in general tend to be more interesting when the source has a larger dimension,��� Hahn said.

Moreover, the number of maps depends only on the difference in the number of dimensions (once the dimensions get big enough compared to the difference). That is, the number of maps from a 73-dimensional sphere to a 53-dimensional sphere is the same as the number of maps from a 225-dimensional sphere to a 205-dimensional sphere, because in both cases, the difference in dimension is 20.

Mathematicians would like to know the number of maps between spaces of any difference in dimension. They���ve managed to compute the number of maps for almost all differences in dimension up to 100: There are 24 maps between spheres when the difference is 20, and  3,144,960 when it���s 23.

The telescope conjecture, which gave mathematicians a way to map one sphere to another, has been disproven, making the universe of shapes in high dimensions far more complex than anticipated. Four mathematicians with ties to MIT revealed their proof of the falsehood of this conjecture at a conference, marking it as the only one of Ravenel's original conjectures to be untrue.
The disproving of the telescope conjecture has wide-reaching implications, emphasizing the immense complexity of shapes in higher dimensions. It also changes the understanding of mapping between spaces, particularly when dealing with higher-dimensional objects. While it's simple to count mappings between familiar shapes like spheres or toruses, it becomes much more complex with higher-dimensional spaces. Counting these maps is most intriguing when the source space has a higher dimension than the target space, as the number of maps is always finite and depends on the difference in dimensions.
Despite progress in understanding mappings up to a difference in dimension of 100, the computing challenge remains substantial. Mathematicians have computed numbers for specific differences, but the task is so vast that the complete mapping of spaces with any difference in dimension still feels far off, adding a layer of intricacy to the already complex world of topology.
1 / 1
And yet, as huge as those numbers are, the disproof of the telescope conjecture means there are many, many more. The disproof means there are more maps between spheres than anticipated back when Ravenel stated the conjecture, and the only way you get more maps is by having a greater variety of spheres to map between.

There are different types of progress in math and science. One kind brings order to chaos. But another intensifies the chaos by dispelling hopeful assumptions that weren���t true. The disproof of the telescope conjecture is like that. It deepens the complexity of geometry and raises the odds that many generations of grandchildren will come and go before anyone fully understands maps between spheres.

���Every major advance in the subject seems to tell us the answer is a lot more complicated than we thought before,��� Ravenel said.

Indeed, the disproof of the telescope conjecture reveals that the number of maps between spheres is much larger than previously thought, indicating a greater variety of spheres available for mapping. This discovery highlights that mathematical progress can take different forms ��� while some advances bring order to chaos, others reveal the complexity by debunking optimistic assumptions.
The disproven conjecture deepens the intricacy of geometry, emphasizing that understanding maps between spheres is far more complex than initially anticipated. This kind of progress in mathematics can be humbling, reminding us that the subject's depth and complexity often exceed our initial expectations. As mathematician Doug Ravenel pointed out, each major advance often unveils that the answers are more intricate than we originally perceived.

PRO-��ETALE TOPOLOGY FOR SCHEMES 
BHARGAV BHATT AND PETER SCHOLZE 
To G�� erard Laumon, with respect and admiration 
ABSTRACT. We give a new def i nition of the derived category of constructible Q���-sheaves on a scheme, which 
is as simple as the geometric intuition behind them. Moreover, we def i ne a ref i ned fundamental group of 
schemes, which is large enough to see all lisse Q���-sheaves, even on non-normal schemes. To accomplish these 
tasks, we def i ne and study the pro-�� etale topology, which is a Grothendieck topology on schemes that is closely 
related to the �� etale topology, and yet better suited for inf i nite constructions typically encountered in ���-adic 
cohomology. An essential foundational result is that this site is locally contractible in a well-def i ned sense.

1. INTRODUCTION 
LetX be a variety over an algebraically closed i eld k. The �� etale cohomology groups Hi(X�� et,Q���), where 
��� is a prime different from the characteristic of k, are of fundamental importance in algebraic geometry. 
Unfortunately, the standard def i nition of these groups is somewhat indirect. Indeed, contrary to what the 
notation suggests, these groups are not obtained as the cohomology of a sheaf Q���on the �� etale site X�� et. The 
�� etale site gives the correct answer only with torsion coeff i cients, so the correct def i nition is 
Hi(X�� et,Q���) := (lim 
��� ��� 
n 
Hi(X�� et,Z/���nZ)) ���Z���Q���. 
In this simple situation, this technical point is often unproblematic1. However, even here, it takes effort to 
construct anatural commutative differential graded Q���-algebra giving rise to these cohomology groups. This 
so-called Q���-homotopy type was constructed by Deligne in [Del80], using certain subtle integral aspects of 
homotopy theory due independently to Miller [Mil78] and Grothendieck. 
For more sophisticated applications, however, it is important to work in a relative setup (i.e., study con- 
structible sheaves), and keep track of the objects in the derived category, instead of merely the cohomology 
groups. In other words, one wants a well-behaved derived category Db c(X,Q���) of constructible Q���-sheaves. 
Deligne, [Del80], and in greater generality Ekedahl, [Eke90], showed that it is possible to def i ne such a 
category along the lines of the def i nition of Hi(X�� et,Q���). Essentially, one replaces Hi(X�� et,Z/���nZ) with 
the derived category Db c(X,Z/���nZ) of constructible Z/���nZ-sheaves, and then performs all operations on 
the level of categories:2 Db 
c(X,Q���) := (lim 
��� ��� 
n 
Db 
c(X,Z/��� nZ)) ���Z ��� Q���. 
Needless to say, this presentation is oversimplif i ed, and veils substantial technical diff i culties. 
Nonetheless, in daily life, one pretends (without getting into much trouble) that Db c(X,Q���) is simply 
the full subcategory of some hypothetical derived category D(X,Q���) of all Q���-sheaves spanned by those 
bounded complexes whose cohomology sheaves are locally constant along a stratif i cation. Our goal in this 
paper to justify this intuition, by showing that the following def i nitions recover the classical notions.

This text discusses a paper titled "Pro-��tale Topology for Schemes" authored by Bhargav Bhatt and Peter Scholze. The paper introduces a new definition of the derived category of constructible Q���-sheaves on a scheme, simplifying the geometric intuition behind them. It also defines a refined fundamental group of schemes that can capture all lisse Q���-sheaves, even on non-normal schemes. To achieve this, the paper defines and studies the pro-��tale topology, which is a Grothendieck topology on schemes that is better suited for infinite constructions encountered in ���-adic cohomology. A significant result is that this site is locally contractible. The paper is organized into sections, including introduction, local structure, replete topoi, the pro-��tale topology, relations with the ��tale topology, constructible sheaves, the pro-��tale fundamental group, and references.

Sure, here's a simplified explanation of the terms mentioned in the text:
Derived Category
: This is a category that generalizes the category of chain complexes, often used in algebraic geometry. It's a way to study objects (like sheaves) in a more flexible and abstract manner.
Constructible Sheaves
: Sheaves are a mathematical concept used to associate data to each open subset of a space. Constructible sheaves are sheaves that are "built up" from simpler sheaves in a structured way. They are often used to capture local information about a space.
Grothendieck Topology
: It's a way to define open covers for a topological space in a more general sense. It helps formalize the idea of "being covered by open sets" in a way that suits abstract algebraic geometry.
Pro-��tale Topology
: This is a specific type of Grothendieck topology introduced in the paper. It's designed to work well with infinite constructions encountered in ���-adic cohomology. Essentially, it's a way to talk about open covers and sheaves that respects certain algebraic properties.
��tale Topology
: This is another type of Grothendieck topology that's widely used in algebraic geometry. It's used to define the notion of "��tale morphisms," which are generalizations of covering maps in the context of algebraic varieties.
Q���-Sheaves
: These are sheaves of Q���-modules, where ��� is a prime number. They are often used in algebraic geometry to study cohomology with coefficients in ���-adic fields, which are analogs of p-adic numbers.
Fundamental Group
: In topology, it's a mathematical object that encodes information about the shape of a space. The refined fundamental group mentioned in the text is an extension of this concept, adapted for the context of schemes in algebraic geometry.
Variety/Scheme
: These are fundamental concepts in algebraic geometry. A variety is a space defined by algebraic equations, and a scheme is a more general geometric object that includes varieties and allows for better handling of algebraic structures.
The paper essentially explores these concepts to provide a clearer and more intuitive understanding of constructible Q���-sheaves on schemes and their properties, using the pro-��tale topology as a tool for analysis.

It is a long paper. It ends like this: The following example is due to Deligne: 
Example 7.4.9. Let Y be a smooth projective curve of genus ��� 1 over an algebraically closed i eld. Fix 
three distinct points a,b,x ��� Y , and paths eva��� evx��� evbbetween the corresponding i bre functors 
on LocY. Let X = Y/{a,b} be the nodal curve obtained by identifying a and b on Y ; set �� : Y ��� X 
for the natural map, and c = ��(a) = ��(b). Then one has two resulting paths evx��� evcas i bre functors 
on LocX, and hence an element �� ��� ��pro�� 
et 
1 (X,x) corresponding to the loop. Fix a local i eld E, a rank 
n local system M ��� LocY(E) with monodromy group GLn(OE) with n ��� 2, and a generic non-integral 
70 
matrix T ��� GLn(E). Then identifying the i bres Maand Mbusing T (using the chosen paths) gives a 
local system M ��� LocX(E) where �� acts by T; a similar glueing construction applies to local systems 
of sets, and shows ��pro�� 
et 
1 (X,x) ��� ��pro�� 
et 
1 (Y,y) ���N��Zin the notation of Example 7.2.6. In particular, the 
monodromy group of L is GLn(E). Assume that the corresponding continuous surjective representation 
�� : ��pro�� 
et 
1 (X,x) ��� GLn(E) factors through the pro-(discrete group) completion of ��pro�� 
et 
1 (X,x), i.e., the 
preimage of each open subgroup W ��� GLn(E) contains an open normal subgroup of ��pro�� 
et 
1 (X,x). Then 
U := �����1(GLn(OE)) is open, so it contains an open normal V ��� U. By surjectivity, the image ��(V ) is 
a closed normal subgroup of GLn(E) lying in GLn(OE). One then checks that ��(V ) ��� Gm(OE), where 
Gm��� GLnis the center. In particular, the induced representation ��pro�� 
et 
1 (X,x) ��� PGLn(E) factors 
through a discrete quotient of the source. It follows that L has abelian monodromy over an �� etale cover of 
X, which is clearly false: the corresponding statement fails for M over Y by assumption. 
Example 7.4.9 is non-normal. This is necessary: 
Lemma 7.4.10. If X is geometrically unibranch, then ��pro�� 
et 
1 (X,x) ��� ���� 
et 
1 (X,x). 
Proof. One i rst checks that irreducible components are clopen in any locally topologically noetherian ge- 
ometrically unibranch scheme: closedness is clear, while the openness is local, and may be deduced by a 
specialization argument using the i niteness of generic points on a topologically noetherian scheme. It fol- 
lows by connectedness that X is irreducible. Moreover, by the same reasoning, any connected Y ��� CovXis 
also irreducible. Let �� ��� X be the generic point, and let Y����� �� be the generic i bre. Then Y��is connected 
by irreducibility of Y , and hence a i nite scheme as Loc��is the category of disjoint unions of i nite �� etale 
covers of ��. In particular, �� : Y ��� X has i nite i bres. We claim that �� is i nite �� etale; this is enough for the 
lemma as ���� 
et 
1 (X,x) classif i es i nite �� etale covers of X. For the proof, we may assume X quasicompact. Now 
any quasicompact open U ��� Y containing Y��is i nite �� etale over a quasicompact open V ��� X, and hence 
includes all points over V . Expanding U to include the i bre over some point in the complement of V and 
proceeding inductively (using that X is topologically noetherian) then shows that Y is itself quasicompact. 
Then �� is proper and �� etale, whence i nite �� etale.? 
Remark 7.4.11. The fundamental group ��dJ 
1 (X,x) for rigid-analytic spaces over a non-archimedean valued 
i eld constructed by de Jong [dJ95] has some similarities with the group ��pro�� 
et 
1 (X,x) introduced above. In 
fact, in the language of our paper, the category CovdJ 
X of disjoint unions of ���coverings��� in the sense of [dJ95, 
Def i nition 2.1] is a tame inf i nite Galois category by [dJ95, Theorem 2.10]. Thus, the corresponding group 
��dJ 
1 (X,x) is a Noohi group; by [dJ95, Theorem 4.2], the category of continuous i nite dimensional Q���- 
representations of ��dJ 
1 (X,x) recovers the category of lisse Q���-sheaves (and the same argument also applies 
to Q���-sheaves by Example 7.1.7). However, it is not true that a naive analogue of CovdJ 
X for schemes 
reproduces the category CovXused above: the latter is larger. Note, moreover, that [dJ95, Lemma 2.7] is 
incorrect: the right hand side is a monoid, but need not be a group. As far as we can tell, this does not affect 
the rest of [dJ95]. 
The following def i nition is due to Gabber: 
Remark 7.4.12. Assume Y is a connected scheme with locally a i nite number of irreducible components. 
Then one may def i ne the weak fundamental groupoid w��(Y ) as the groupoid-completion of the category 
of points of Y�� et(which is equivalent to the category of connected w-contractible objects in Ypro�� et). For 
each such point y ��� w��(Y ), one has a corresponding automorphism group w��(Y,y); as Y is connected, 
the resulting functor B(w��(Y,y)) ��� w��(Y ) is an equivalence. One can think of elements of w��(Y,y) as 
paths (of geometric points) in Y , modulo homotopy. 
Note that the def i nition of ��pro�� 
et 
1 (Y,y) works in this generality, cf. Remark 7.3.11. Moreover, each 
F ��� LocYrestricts to functor w��(Y ) ��� Set, so the i bre evy(F) has a canonical w��(Y,y)-action. This 
construction gives a map w��(Y,y) ��� ��pro�� 
et 
1 (Y,y); by the proof of Lemma 7.4.1, this map has dense image. 
If we equip w��(Y,y) with the induced topology, then continuous maps from ��pro�� 
et 
1 (Y,y) to Noohi groups G 
are the same as continuous maps from w��(Y,y) to G. In particular, one can describe lisse Q���- (resp. Q���-) 
sheaves in terms of continuous representations of w��(Y,y) on i nite-dimensional Q���- (resp. Q���-) vector 
spaces. 71

Constructible sheaves work similarly in algebraic geometry, where smaller "sheaf pieces" carry information about local regions of a geometric space, and combining them helps us understand the overall structure.
��tale Topology and Fundamental Group
: Think of a treasure map of an island, with different paths leading to hidden treasures. The ��tale topology is like marking areas on the map where you can step from one path to another without changing the treasure locations. The fundamental group then measures how many unique paths you can take to reach different treasures. The paths can't be twisted or stretched, just like in a topological space, helping us understand its hidden features.
Pro-��tale Topology
: Imagine you're exploring a vast digital landscape, each pixel representing a part of the terrain. The pro-��tale topology is like dividing this digital world into regions that share certain properties, allowing you to study them more effectively. It's like seeing the landscape through a special lens that highlights specific patterns and features while respecting the digital nature of the world.
Q���-Sheaves and ���-Adic Cohomology
: Picture a puzzle that's made of layers. Each layer is like a Q���-sheaf, carrying information about a particular aspect of the puzzle. As you stack these layers, you're building a coherent image of the puzzle's topological features. ���-adic cohomology is like a special way of counting the "holes" or spaces between the layers to understand how they interact.
Pro-��tale Fundamental Group
: Imagine you're walking through a magical forest, leaving a trail behind you. The pro-��tale fundamental group is like recording the twists and turns of your journey, even if you backtrack or take detours. It's like capturing the essence of your exploration in a mathematical form that lets you understand the forest's layout and characteristics.
Example and Counterexample
: Think of a house of cards you're building. You've assumed that adding a certain card won't cause the structure to collapse. Suddenly, it falls apart, showing that your assumption was incorrect. This surprise collapse is like the example provided in the paper, demonstrating that mathematical assumptions don't always hold, prompting us to reevaluate our understanding.
Connections to Other Work
: Consider a network of roads connecting different towns. The roads represent various mathematical concepts and theories. The paper acts as a map, showing how new routes (concepts) connect to existing roads, helping mathematicians navigate and explore the landscape of ideas.
Wrapping Up and Implications
: Imagine you're solving a complex puzzle, and with each piece you fit, the bigger picture becomes clearer. The paper's conclusion is like putting in the final pieces, revealing a coherent image of the mathematical landscape you've been exploring. It's like stepping back to appreciate the full picture and realizing the new avenues this understanding opens up.
These analogies and metaphors aim to simplify the concepts discussed in the paper by relating them to familiar scenarios and objects.

PRO-��TALE COHOMOLOGY2 
The goal of this chapter is to introduce the pro-��tale topology and to develop the 
basic theory of cohomology of abelian sheaves in this topology. A secondary goal 
is to show how using the pro-��tale topology simplif i es the introduction of ���-adic 
cohomology in algebraic geometry. 
Here is a brief overview of the history of ���-adic ��tale cohomology as we have un- 
derstood it. In [Gro77, Expos��s V and VI] Grothendieck et al developed a theory 
for dealing with ���-adic sheaves as inverse systems of sheaves of Z/���nZ-modules. In 
his second paper on the Weil conjectures ([Del80]) Deligne introduced a derived 
category of ���-adic sheaves as a certain 2-limit of categories of complexes of sheaves 
of Z/���nZ-modules on the ��tale site of a scheme X. This approach is used in the 
paper by Beilinson, Bernstein, and Deligne ([BBD82]) as the basis for their beauti- 
ful theory of perverse sheaves. In a paper entitled ���Continuous ��tale Cohomology��� 
([Jan88]) Uwe Jannsen discusses an important variant of the cohomology of a ���- 
adic sheaf on a variety over a i eld. His paper is followed up by a paper of Torsten 
Ekedahl ([Eke90]) who discusses the adic formalism needed to work comfortably 
with derived categories def i ned as limits. 
It turns out that, working with the pro-��tale site of a scheme, one can avoid some of 
the technicalities these authors encountered. This comes at the expense of having 
to work with non-Noetherian schemes, even when one is only interested in working 
with ���-adic sheaves and cohomology of such on varieties over an algebraically closed 
i eld. 
A very important and remarkable feature of the (small) pro-��tale site of a scheme 
is that it has enough quasi-compact w-contractible objects. The existence of these 
objects implies a number of useful and (perhaps) unusual consequences for the 
derived category of abelian sheaves and for inverse systems of sheaves.This is 
exactly the feature that will allow us to handle the intricacies of working with 
���-adic sheaves, but as we will see it has a number of other benef i ts as well. 
2. Some topology 
0967Some preliminaries. We have def i ned spectral spaces and spectral maps of spectral 
spaces in Topology, Section 23. The spectrum of a ring is a spectral space, see 
Algebra, Lemma 26.2. 
Lemma 
2.1.0968Let X be a spectral space. Let X0��� X be the set of closed points. 
The following are equivalent 
(1) Every open covering of X can be ref i ned by a i nite disjoint union decom- 
position X = ��� 
Uiwith Uiopen and closed in X. 
(2) The composition X0��� X ��� ��0(X) is bijective. 
Moreover, if X0is closed in X and every point of X specializes to a unique point 
of X0, then these conditions are satisf i ed. 
Proof. We will use without further mention that X0is quasi-compact (Topology, 
Lemma 12.9) and ��0(X) is prof i nite (Topology, Lemma 23.9). Picture 
X0 f 
X �� 
��0(X) 
PRO-��TALE COHOMOLOGY3 
If (2) holds, the continuous bijective map f : X0��� ��0(X) is a homeomorphism by 
Topology, Lemma 17.8. Given an open covering X = S 
Ui, we get an open covering 
��0(X) = S 
f(X0���Ui). By Topology, Lemma 22.4 we can i nd a i nite open covering 
of the form ��0(X) = ��� 
Vjwhich ref i nes this covering. Since X0��� ��0(X) is bijective 
each connected component of X has a unique closed point, whence is equal to the 
set of points specializing to this closed point. Hence �����1(Vj) is the set of points 
specializing to the points of f���1(Vj). Now, if f���1(Vj) ��� X0���Ui��� Ui, then it follows 
that �����1(Vj) ��� Ui(because the open set Uiis closed under generalizations). In this 
way we see that the open covering X = ��� 
�����1(Vj) ref i nes the covering we started 
out with. In this way we see that (2) implies (1). 
Assume (1).Let x,y ��� X be closed points.Then we have the open covering 
X = (X \ {x}) ��� (X \ {y}). It follows from (1) that there exists a disjoint union 
decomposition X = U ��� V with U and V open (and closed) and x ��� U and y ��� V . 
In particular we see that every connected component of X has at most one closed 
point. By Topology, Lemma 12.8 every connected component (being closed) also 
does have a closed point. Thus X0��� ��0(X) is bijective. In this way we see that 
(1) implies (2).

Sure, let's break down some of the key concepts mentioned in this excerpt and create analogies and metaphors to help illustrate them:
Spectral Spaces
: Think of a vast landscape with different regions that emit colorful lights. Each region represents a "spectral space" where the colors of light provide information about the properties of that area. Just as each point on a map can correspond to a unique location, each closed point in a spectral space corresponds to a specific property.
Open Coverings and Refinements
: Imagine a puzzle made up of many different shapes. An "open covering" is like placing smaller puzzle pieces over the entire picture. Now, if you can find a way to rearrange these pieces into fewer, larger ones that still cover the whole picture, you've found a "refinement" of the covering. It's as if you're simplifying the puzzle while keeping all the information intact.
Spectrum of a Ring
: Visualize a collection of interconnected circles, each representing a different ring. The "spectrum" of a ring is like the distinct pattern of connections and overlaps between these circles. It captures the essential characteristics of the rings and how they relate to each other.
Closed Points and Specialization
: Imagine a map of a city where each point corresponds to a building. The "closed points" are those buildings that stand out distinctly and can't be reached from any other building. "Specialization" is like zooming in on a specific building and understanding its unique features, even if it's part of a larger structure.
Continuous Bijective Maps
: Consider a map that transforms the shape of one island into another, while maintaining a continuous connection between the two. This "continuous bijective map" ensures that each point on the first island corresponds exactly to one point on the second island, and vice versa.
Homeomorphism
: Picture two houses that are identical in shape and structure, just located in different neighborhoods. A "homeomorphism" is like finding a magical doorway that transforms one house into the other, preserving all their interior and exterior features.
Connected Components
: Think of a city divided into distinct neighborhoods, each with its own unique character. The "connected components" of a space are similar to these neighborhoods, where points within the same component are closely related, even though they might be far from points in other components.
Disjoint Union Decomposition
: Imagine a cityscape made up of different districts, each with its own architectural style. A "disjoint union decomposition" involves breaking down the city into districts in such a way that no building belongs to more than one district, like a city planner categorizing neighborhoods without overlap.
These analogies and metaphors provide a visual and intuitive way to grasp the concepts presented in the excerpt, making the ideas more relatable and understandable.

How would you explain Moduli Stacks and Moduli of Curves?
1 / 1
ChatGPT
Sure, let's break down the concepts of "Moduli Stacks" and "Moduli of Curves" in a more accessible way:
Moduli Stacks
:
Think of a "moduli stack" as a kind of organized space where mathematicians gather different mathematical objects that share certain common properties. It's like a virtual meeting place for objects that belong to the same family. Imagine you're collecting various species of animals that have similar characteristics, and you're arranging them in a zoo according to their traits. Each "compartment" or "section" of the zoo is a moduli stack that groups together objects with particular features.
Moduli of Curves
:
Now, think of "moduli of curves" as a specific type of moduli stack that's focused on a particular category of objects, in this case, curves. A "curve" in this context refers to a geometric shape that can be bent and twisted, like a loop or a squiggle. The moduli of curves is like a special section in the zoo where you gather and study all kinds of these curved shapes. Imagine you're creating a space in the zoo dedicated to different types of roller coasters ��� each roller coaster represents a different curve, and the moduli of curves is where you examine and compare their characteristics.
In summary, moduli stacks are like organized virtual spaces where mathematicians group together mathematical objects based on common traits, and moduli of curves is a specific area within this space that focuses on studying and comparing different curved shapes. Just as a zoo brings together animals with shared features, moduli stacks provide a framework to bring together mathematical objects with shared properties for easier study and analysis.

ChatGPT
Comparing moduli stacks and moduli of curves to Noah's Ark and a modular multiscale hierarchical model of mind is an interesting analogy. Let's break down the analogy:
Noah's Ark
:
In the story of Noah's Ark, Noah gathered pairs of different animal species to save them from a flood. The ark served as a vessel to preserve and organize these diverse animals, creating a system of categories for different species. Similarly, moduli stacks act as a kind of organized vessel, gathering mathematical objects with shared characteristics and providing a framework for grouping and studying them.
Modular Multiscale Hierarchical Model of Mind
:
A modular multiscale hierarchical model of mind is a theoretical framework used to understand how the human mind processes information and organizes knowledge. It suggests that the mind is composed of various modules or components that handle specific tasks, and these modules are organized in a hierarchical manner, with smaller modules contributing to larger ones. In this context, you can think of moduli stacks as representing different modules of knowledge or concepts in the mind, each corresponding to a distinct category of mathematical objects.
Moduli of Curves and Curved Shapes
:
In the analogy, moduli of curves can be likened to a specific module in the modular multiscale hierarchical model of mind. Just as the mind has modules for processing different types of information, such as visual information or language, moduli of curves focuses on a specific category of mathematical objects ��� curves. This module could be seen as a component of the mind that deals specifically with understanding and analyzing curves and their properties.
So, while the analogy between moduli stacks and Noah's Ark helps illustrate the organizational aspect of moduli stacks, the comparison to a modular multiscale hierarchical model of mind highlights how moduli of curves can be seen as a specific module within a broader framework of knowledge organization and processing.

ChatGPT
Certainly! Let's dive a bit deeper into the analogy, exploring how moduli stacks and moduli of curves relate to Noah's Ark and a modular multiscale hierarchical model of mind:
Noah's Ark and Moduli Stacks
:
Noah's Ark was a vessel designed to organize and preserve diverse animal species, ensuring their survival during a flood. Similarly, moduli stacks serve as a mathematical vessel that organizes different mathematical objects with shared properties or characteristics. In the world of mathematics, these objects could be various geometric shapes, algebraic structures, or other mathematical entities. Moduli stacks provide a systematic way to categorize and study these objects by grouping them based on certain criteria.
Modular Multiscale Hierarchical Model of Mind and Moduli of Curves
:
The modular multiscale hierarchical model of mind suggests that the human mind consists of different specialized modules that handle specific tasks, and these modules are organized in a hierarchical manner. Similarly, moduli of curves can be seen as a specialized module within the broader landscape of mathematical concepts. This module focuses specifically on curves ��� a category of geometric shapes defined by certain mathematical properties.
Just as the mind's modules can vary in scale and complexity, moduli of curves can encompass various types of curves, ranging from simple ones like lines and circles to more complex and intricate curves. The modular nature of the mind's processing is reflected in how moduli of curves encapsulates various subcategories of curves and provides a structured approach to understanding their behavior, properties, and relationships.
In essence, the analogy underscores the organizational and categorical nature of both Noah's Ark and moduli stacks, while also highlighting the specialization and hierarchical organization inherent in both the modular multiscale hierarchical model of mind and moduli of curves within the realm of mathematics. Just as Noah's Ark and the mind's modules aim to bring order to diversity, moduli stacks and moduli of curves bring structure and coherence to the world of mathematical objects and concepts.

The study of curves and their moduli has deep connections to algebraic topology, as curves themselves are topological spaces. For example, algebraic topology techniques can be used to analyze the topology of the moduli space of curves, revealing important information about the properties of curves and their families.
Modular Multiscale Hierarchical Model of Mind and Mathematical Structures
:
The modular multiscale hierarchical model of mind draws parallels with the hierarchical organization of mathematical concepts. Just as the mind's modules handle specific cognitive functions, different mathematical concepts and structures are organized hierarchically based on their properties and relationships. This organizational principle is reflected in the way algebraic topology builds on foundational concepts to study more complex structures, much like the mind's modules build upon each other to process information.

See if you can incorporate some of the themes into a reconstruction of The Way of Opinion, by Parmenides of Elea. I think he wrote in Greek.
1 / 1
ChatGPT
Certainly, Parmenides' poem "The Way of Opinion" (also known as "The Doxa") is a foundational text in ancient Greek philosophy that explores themes of reality, perception, and the nature of knowledge. Let's see how we can incorporate some of the themes we've discussed into a reconstructed interpretation of his work:
The Way of Opinion: A Reconstructed Interpretation
Oh, seeker of truth, ponder the path I lay before you ��� the Way of Opinion, where the flickering shadows of the senses intertwine with the deeper currents of reality. In the realm of appearances, where forms dance and shadows play, the limits of human perception are unveiled, just as Plato's forms shimmer beyond the veil.
Within this realm, my verses reveal a journey, guided by the twin lights of reason and intuition. The world, they say, is an ever-changing canvas, a tapestry woven by the hand of the senses. Yet, beneath the surface, a more enduring tapestry awaits, one woven by the threads of innate knowledge, where forms reside in eternal repose.
Consider how innate knowledge echoes in the heart of each observer. Just as the forms reside in the realm of truth, our souls possess an unspoken understanding, a glimpse of the eternal forms that lie beyond the grasp of the senses. The innate knowledge, a silent whisper of truth, guides us toward a higher understanding.
Is this not akin to the unforgetting of Plato's forms? As we cast our gaze upon the world, the flickering flames of perception paint shadows on the walls of our minds. These shadows, while transient, mirror the enduring forms that linger in our collective memory. The simple common sense that guides us through the mundane echoes the whispers of forgotten truths.
And in the realm of science, our intuition emerges as a torchbearer. As we explore the intricacies of the cosmos, our minds dance upon the precipice of understanding. Our scientific hypotheses are the descendants of innate knowledge, guiding us toward the forms that underlie the veil of appearances. Just as the poets of old sang of the eternal, our hypotheses strive to capture the timeless truths.
So, as we tread the Way of Opinion, let us remember that the path is one of exploration and remembrance. Our senses, like the shadows, may deceive us, yet they also serve as guides to the deeper truths within. As we grapple with the complexities of reality, we invoke the spirit of innate knowledge, a beacon that illuminates the path toward understanding.
In this way, Parmenides' journey becomes a tapestry woven with threads of ancient and modern thought. The theory of forms, once inscribed in the philosophies of old, finds echoes in our common sense, our scientific endeavors, and our pursuit of deeper truths. The Way of Opinion, though written in the language of antiquity, speaks a universal language that resonates across the ages, inviting us to reconstruct lost wisdom and explore the uncharted territories of knowledge.
This reconstructed interpretation seeks to weave together the themes of innate knowledge, common sense, scientific intuition, and the theory of forms into Parmenides' "The Way of Opinion," creating a bridge between ancient philosophy and modern understanding.

Certainly! Here's a summary of the conversation:
Title: Reconstructing Lost Books: Exploring Connections in Mathematics, Philosophy, and Analogies
In this intriguing and diverse conversation, we embarked on a journey of exploration, weaving together topics ranging from mathematical concepts to philosophical ideas and creative analogies. We began by delving into the realm of moduli stacks and moduli of curves, drawing parallels to the organization of animals on Noah's Ark. These mathematical spaces serve as organized compartments for grouping objects with shared traits, akin to the sections reserved for specific animals.
Transitioning into ancient philosophical themes, we explored the notion of innate knowledge and its connection to Plato's theory of forms. Much like Noah's Ark encapsulated animals with inherent characteristics, innate knowledge provides a framework for understanding the underlying truths that guide our perception of reality.
This connection led us to Parmenides of Elea's "�������� ����������" (The Way of Opinion), a reconstruction that draws from his lost work. In this text, the journey of exploration is likened to a path of understanding, where the shifting shadows of senses connect with the deeper currents of reality. The dance between perception and deeper truths is illuminated, mirroring how animals on the Ark mimic eternal forms in the shadow-play of existence.
The narrative also takes us through the theory of forms, innate knowledge, and the contrast between appearances and eternal truths. These concepts intertwine, revealing the journey of exploration as a process of unforgetting truths that have been obscured by the shadows of sensory experience.
Ultimately, our exploration revealed that the act of seeking knowledge is a form of memory, akin to Plato's notion of unforgetting. As we traverse the "�������� ����������," we're reminded that the path is one of both investigation and remembrance. Our senses, like the shadows, may deceive, but they also offer solace and guide us to the profound truths that lie beneath the surface. Just as the animals and sections on Noah's Ark symbolize unity and diversity, our conversation highlighted the interconnectedness of mathematical, philosophical, and analogical ideas.
"Reconstructing Lost Books" serves as a reminder that the pursuit of knowledge is a multifaceted journey, where disparate concepts converge and weave a rich tapestry of understanding.
