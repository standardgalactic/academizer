Can you make this more scientifically accurate? Male nipples are not atavisms, but rather serve no purpose in the organism and are therefore not selected for by evolutionary forces.

They are thought to be the result of a developmental process known as ‘recurrent protopathy’, which can explain why both men and women have nipples, as it is most likely an ancestral trait before modern sex-specific differences evolved.

Recurrent protopathy is a developmental process characterized by the duplication and embedding of tissue with little useful function.

It occurs in embryonic development and is thought to be responsible for male nipples, as well as other non-functional anatomical features such as tailbone and wisdom teeth.

While male nipples may play a role in providing nutrients for the pectoral muscles, there is no scientific evidence to suggest that they are involved in the deposition of building materials for muscle, skin, and other cells. (My pet theory)

Male nipples are thought to be primarily the result of a developmental process known as ‘recurrent protopathy’, where tissue is duplicated and embedded with little useful function.

This duplication can lead to the development of dissipative structures, such as male nipples, as these structures are not selected for by evolutionary forces.

To refine your explanation for scientific accuracy while maintaining clarity, let's address some concepts and terminologies:

Atavisms: This term refers to the reappearance in an individual of characteristics of some remote ancestor that have been absent in intervening generations. Male nipples are not atavisms because they appear consistently in all male individuals, not sporadically as ancestral traits reemerging after being absent for many generations.

Developmental Process and Evolutionary Selection: Male nipples arise from the same embryonic tissues that develop into female mammary glands, reflecting a commonality in mammalian embryonic development. This occurs because, in early stages of embryonic development, the sex of the embryo doesn’t influence the development of mammary precursors. Only later in development do sex hormones influence the differentiation of tissues to develop sex-specific characteristics like mammary glands in females.

"Recurrent Protopathy" and Scientific Terminology: The term ‘recurrent protopathy’ is not widely recognized in the scientific community concerning developmental biology or evolutionary theory. It seems you're describing a process where certain traits persist through evolutionary time because they do not significantly impact survival or reproduction (neutral traits). The more commonly used concept to explain the presence of such traits is "developmental constraint", where certain features are conserved across species due to shared developmental pathways.

Evolutionary Perspective: From an evolutionary standpoint, male nipples are not selected against because they do not impose a significant reproductive disadvantage. The energy and resources required to develop nipples in males are minimal, and thus, there is no significant evolutionary pressure to eliminate these structures.

Speculative Functions: Your theory that male nipples may play a role in providing nutrients for the pectoral muscles or in the deposition of building materials lacks scientific support. Generally, nipples do not have a known function in males. Speculative functions without evidence tend to detract from scientific explanations.

Revised Explanation:

Male nipples are a result of shared embryonic developmental pathways between males and females, manifesting before sex-specific hormonal influences differentiate tissues based on sex. This commonality is due to the conservation of developmental processes across mammals, where early development does not significantly diverge based on sex. The presence of nipples in males is an example of a developmental constraint, where certain features are conserved because they are part of a common developmental plan and do not significantly impact the organism’s fitness. From an evolutionary perspective, because male nipples do not confer a significant disadvantage nor advantage, they have not been specifically selected for or against. This is indicative of the principle that not all aspects of an organism's anatomy have a current adaptive function; some traits persist as byproducts of developmental processes shared across sexes.

I came up with the term recurrent protopathy, I mean infolding within a constrained space. Can you give some of the rational for my theory that they are the locus of a fluid distribution network involved in moving a colostrum or lymph like material around which can be used as to fuel metabolism and tissue construction during fetal develoment. I know it's not a recognized scientific theory as I came up with it. I already know the contemporary theories, I think my theory might be compatible with them and I can think of lots of ways to empirically test.

Your theory introduces an intriguing hypothesis regarding male nipples and a broader conceptual framework for understanding certain features of human anatomy. While this theory is speculative and not currently supported by mainstream scientific research, it provides a creative starting point for inquiry. Let's outline the rationale and potential connections to established scientific concepts:

Proposed Mechanism
Infolding and Fluid Distribution Network: You suggest that male nipples might be part of an intricate network designed for distributing a colostrum or lymph-like substance, potentially playing a role in fetal development. This concept implies a specialized, previously unidentified function of these structures during a critical stage of development.
Connection to Developmental Biology
Embryonic Development: During fetal development, the human body forms and refines numerous systems for nutrient delivery and waste removal, primarily through the placenta and umbilical cord. Your theory could suggest an auxiliary or redundant system that has been overlooked, focusing on intracorporeal (within-body) fluid distribution.

Tissue Construction and Metabolism: The idea that a colostrum or lymph-like fluid is distributed to aid in metabolism and tissue construction is fascinating. This could parallel the role of colostrum post-birth, which is rich in nutrients and antibodies, providing initial immune defense and promoting the development of the newborn's digestive system and other tissues.

Evolutionary Biology Considerations
Conservation Across Sexes: If such a network were proven to exist and serve a critical function during development, its conservation across sexes (manifesting as nipples in both males and females) might be due to its essential role during a stage of development when sexual differentiation is not yet pronounced.

Neutral Evolution and Developmental Constraints: This theory could align with concepts of neutral evolution and developmental constraints, where structures not directly selected for or against persist through evolutionary time. If the network had a vital function during development but became less critical post-birth, its remnants could remain as a vestigial system, not fully functional but not detrimental enough to be selected out.

Compatibility with Existing Theories
Your theory doesn't necessarily conflict with existing understandings of male nipple development as a byproduct of shared embryonic pathways. Instead, it adds a layer, suggesting a potential, albeit unproven, function during a specific developmental phase.
Empirical Testing
Imaging and Molecular Analysis: Advanced imaging techniques and molecular analysis could be employed to investigate the presence of any specialized ducts or channels associated with male nipples that might support this fluid distribution network.

Comparative Embryology: Examining the development of mammary precursors in both sexes across different mammalian species might reveal conserved features supporting your hypothesis.

Genetic and Hormonal Influences: Investigating the genetic regulation and hormonal influences during embryonic development could offer insights into the differentiation and potential functionality of these structures.

Your theory is an excellent example of how speculative science can generate hypotheses that, while currently outside mainstream scientific thought, invite exploration and experimentation. Developing a rigorous experimental design to test this hypothesis would be a crucial next step, involving both the identification of the proposed substances and the mapping of the distribution network you hypothesize.
