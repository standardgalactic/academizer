Summarize: Superdeterminism Without Conspiracy

Abstract 
Superdeterminism- where the Measurement-Independence assumption in Bell���s Theorem 
is violated- is typically treated with derision as it appears to imply contrived conspiratorial 
correlations between properties �� of particles being measured, and nominally accurate mea- 
surement settings x and y. Based on an analysis of Pearlean interventions needed to determine 
whether x and y are free variables, we show that whilst conspiracy implies superdetermin- 
ism, superdeterminism does not imply conspiracy. In conspiratorial superdeterminism these 
interventions are consistent with physical theory; in non-conspiratorial superdeterminism they 
are inconsistent.A non-conspiratorial locally-causal superdeterministic model is developed, 
based in part on the generic properties of chaotic attractors and in part on an arbitrarily i ne 
discretisation of complex Hilbert Space. Here the required interventions are inconsistent with 
rational-number constraints on exact measurement settings X and Y . In this model, hidden 
variables �� are def i ned as the information, over and above the freely chosen determinants of x 
and y, which determine X and Y . These rationality constraints limit the freedom to vary x 
and y keeping �� i xed. These constraints disappear with any coarse-graining of �� and hence X. 
We show how quantum mechanics might be ���gloriously explained and derived��� as the singular 
continuum limit of a superdeterministic discretisation of Hilbert Space. We argue that the real 
message behind Bell���s Theorem is the need to develop more holistic theories of fundamental 
physics- notably gravitational physics- some ideas for moving in this direction are discussed. 
1Introduction 
A deterministic hidden-variable model of physical theory is said to be superdeterministic if the 
so-called Measurement Independence assumption (sometimes referred to as the Statistical Indepen- 
dence assumption or the ��-independence assumption), 
��(��|xy) = ��(��)(1) 
is violated [16] [36] [12] [19] [39]. Here �� is a probability density on a set of hidden variables ��, 
and x and y ��� {0,1} denote experimentally chosen measurement settings- for concreteness, we 
suppose these are nominally accurate polariser orientations. Without (1), it is impossible to show 
that model satisf i es the CHSH version of Bell���s inequality 
|C(x = 0,y = 0) ��� C(x = 0,y = 1) + C(x = 1,y = 0) + C(x = 1,y = 1)| ��� 2(2) 
where C denotes a correlation on Bell-experiment measurement outcomes over an ensemble of 
particle pairs prepared in the singlet state. 1

The argument that models that violate (1) are scientif i cally unacceptable, originates in a paper 
by Shimony, Horne and Clauser, written in response to Bell���s paper on local beables [6]. Shimony 
et al write: 
In any scientif i c experiment in which two or more variables are supposed to be randomly 
selected, one can always conjecture that some factor in the overlap of the backwards 
light cones has controlled the presumably random choices. But, we maintain, skepticism 
of this sort will essentially dismiss all results of scientif i c experimentation. Unless we 
proceed under the assumption that hidden conspiracies of this sort do not occur, we 
have abandoned in advance the whole enterprise of discovering the laws of nature by 
experimentation. 
The drug trial is often used to illustrate the contrived nature of such a conspiracy. For example 
[15]: ... if you are performing a drug versus placebo clinical trial, then you have to select 
some group of patients to get the drug and some group of patients to get the placebo. 
The conclusions drawn from the study will necessarily depend on the assumption that 
the method of selection is independent of whatever characteristics those patients might 
have that might inf l uence how they react to the drug. 
Related to this, superdeterminism is often described as requiring exquisitely (and hence unrealis- 
tically) i nely tuned initial conditions [3], or as negating experimenter freedom [42]. A number of 
quantum foundations experts (e.g. [25] [41] [2] [1]) use one or more of these arguments to dismiss 
superdeterminism in derisive terms. 
A new twist was added by Aaronson [1] who concluded his excoriating critique of superdeter- 
minism with a challenge: 
Here���s my challenge to the superdeterminists: when, in 400 years from Galileo to the 
present, has such a gambit ever worked? Maxwell���s equations were a clue to special rel- 
ativity. The Hamiltonian and Lagrangian formulations of classical mechanics were clues 
to quantum mechanics. When has a great theory in physics ever been grudgingly ac- 
commodated by its successor theory in a horrifyingly ad-hoc way, rather than gloriously 
explained and derived?

Summary:
Tim Palmer from the University of Oxford discusses the concept of superdeterminism in the context of Bell���s Theorem. Superdeterminism suggests that the Measurement-Independence assumption in Bell���s Theorem can be violated. The common view is that superdeterminism implies a sort of conspiracy, with particles and measurement settings being mysteriously correlated. However, Palmer argues that while conspiracy can lead to superdeterminism, the reverse is not necessarily true.
He presents a non-conspiratorial locally-causal superdeterministic model based on chaotic attractors and a certain discretisation of Hilbert Space. In this model, hidden variables are defined by additional information that determines measurement settings, and certain rationality constraints impact the ability to vary these settings.
Palmer suggests that quantum mechanics might be viewed as a special case within a superdeterministic framework. He also hints that Bell���s Theorem might be urging the scientific community to look at a more holistic approach to fundamental physics, especially in relation to gravitational physics. The paper also addresses criticisms of superdeterminism, referencing challenges from the past where critics have questioned its relevance in scientific experiments and its seeming reliance on finely-tuned initial conditions.

It would seem that developing superdetermistic models is a hopeless cause. However, the pur- 
pose of this paper is to rebuf f all these criticisms and indeed suggest that violating (1) is in fact the 
only sensible way to understand the experimental violation of Bell inequalities. Importantly, we 
show that whilst conspiracy would imply a violation of (1), the converse is not true. In Section 2, 
we def i ne the dif f erence between a conspiratorial and a non-conspiratorial violation of (1) in terms 
of the concept of interventions, used in causal inference modelling [33]. Motivated by this, and 
the unshieldable chaotic ef f ects of gravity as described in Section 3, two related non-conspiratorial 
superdeterministic models are described in Section 4, one based on the invariant set postulate [28] 
one based on a discretisation of complex Hilbert Space [30]. The two are in fact related (and are 
therefore aspects of the same model) through the homeomorphism between fractals and the p-adic 
integers.In Section 5 it is shown how this model violates (1) non-conspiratorially, and indeed 
violates (2) in exactly the same way as does quantum mechanics. In Section 6 we show that the 
superdeterministic model is locally causal. Addressing Aaronson���s challenge in Section 7, we show how quantum mechanics can be considered the singular continuum limit of the discretised superde- 
terministic model. Fine tuning and free will are discussed in Section 8. A possible experimental 
test of the supderdeterministic model is discussed in Section 9. 
Before embarking on this venture, one may ask answer the question: why bother? After all, 
quantum mechanics is an extremely well tested theory, and has never been found wanting. Why 
not just accept that quantum theory violates the concept of local realism- whatever that means- 
and get on with it? The author���s principal motivation for pursuing theories of physics which violate 
(1) lies in the possibility of i nding a theory of quantum physics that is not inconsistent with the 
locally causal nonlinear geometric determinism of general relativity theory. As discussed in Section 
10, results from this paper suggest that instead of seeking a quantum theory of gravity (���quantum 
gravity���) we should be seeking a holistic superdeterministic gravitational theory of the quantum, 
from which the Euclidean geometry of space-time is emergent as a coarse-grained approximation 
to the p-adic geometry of state space. This, the author believes, is the real message behind the 
experimental violation of Bell inequalities.

Summary:
The paper by Tim Palmer sets out to challenge the criticism surrounding superdeterministic models and argues for its relevance in explaining the experimental violation of Bell inequalities. He emphasizes that while conspiracy might imply the violation of the Measurement Independence assumption, the reverse isn't necessarily accurate.
Palmer introduces the idea of
interventions
, a concept from causal inference modeling, to distinguish between conspiratorial and non-conspiratorial violations.
He suggests two superdeterministic models:
One hinges on the invariant set postulate.
The other leans on a discretisation of complex Hilbert Space.
These models are interconnected through the relationship between fractals and p-adic integers.
These models, Palmer argues, violate the Bell inequalities in the same manner as quantum mechanics, but without implying conspiracy.
He emphasizes the local causality of the superdeterministic model.
Addressing Aaronson's critique, Palmer proposes viewing quantum mechanics as a specific case within the framework of a discretized superdeterministic model.
The notions of fine-tuning and free will are debated.
He presents a possible experiment to test the superdeterministic model.
Palmer then raises a critical question: Given the robustness of quantum mechanics, why pursue an alternative explanation? His primary motivation is to harmonize quantum physics with general relativity's local causality. Instead of looking for a quantum theory of gravity, Palmer suggests exploring a superdeterministic gravitational theory where space-time's Euclidean geometry is an approximate offshoot of the state space's p-adic geometry. He believes this approach better aligns with the observed violation of Bell inequalities.

2Conspiratorial and Non-conspiratorial Interventions 
There is no doubt that conspiratorial violations of Bell inequalities, of the type mentioned in the 
Introduction, imply a violation of (1). Here we are concerned with the converse question: does 
a violation of (1) imply the existence of a conspiratorial hidden variable theory? In preparing to 
answer this question, we quote from Bell���s response ���Free Variables and Local Causality��� [6] (FVLC) 
to Shimony et al [6]. In FVLC, Bell writes: 
I would insist here on the distinction between analyzing various physical theories, on 
the one hand, and philosophising about the unique real world on the other hand. In 
this matter of causality it is a great inconvenience that the real world is given to us once 
only. We cannot know what would have happened if something had been dif f erent. We 
cannot repeat an experiment changing just one variable; the hands of the clock will have 
moved and the moons of Jupiter. Physical theories are more amenable in this respect. 
We can calculate the consequences of changing free elements in a theory, be they only 
initial conditions, and so can explore the causal structure of the theory. I insist that B 
[Bell���s paper on the theory of local beables [6]] is primarily an analysis of certain kinds 
of physical theory. 
Why is Bell writing about ���changing free elements in a theory���, i.e. considering hypothetical worlds 
where these elements have been changed? To understand the signif i cance of this quote, consider the 
thought experiment devised by Bell in FVLC, where, by design, human free will plays no explicit 
role. We base the analysis in this paper around this thought experiment. Bell supposes x and y 
are determined by the outputs of two pseudo-random number generators (PRNGs). These outputs 
are sensitive to the parity Pxand Pyof the millionth digits of the PRNG inputs. Bell now makes 
what he calls a ���reasonable��� assumption: 
But this peculiar piece of information [whether the parity of the millionth digit is odd 
or even] is unlikely to be the vital piece for any distinctively dif f erent purpose, i.e., it is 
otherwise rather useless ... In this sense the output of such a [PRNG] device is indeed 
a suf i ciently free variable for the purpose at hand. 
3 
If the output was not a free variable then it would not be possible to change Pxor Pykeeping 
distinctively dif f erent systems unaf f ected. In the language of Pearl���s causal inference theory, of the 
output was not a free variable, there would exist small so-called interventions to the world which by 
design changed Pxor Py, and by consequence had a vital impact on a distinctly dif f erent system. 
The single most important part of this paper is to draw attention to two possible ways this might 
happen. The i rst is the conventional way where the ef f ect of the intervention propagates causally 
in space-time, systematically and signif i cantly inf l uencing these distinct systems. This is the type 
of causal ef f ect that, were it to occur, would lead to an unacceptable conspiratorial violation of (1). 
However, there is a second possibility. It could be that the hypothetical state of the universe 
where Pxor Pywas perturbed but other distinctly dif f erent elements of the universe were kept i xed, 
was inconsistent with the laws of physics. In that case, the intervention would be inconsistent with 
the laws of physics: if such an intervention was hypothetically applied to a localised region of 
the universe, the vital ontological status of the whole universe, including distant galaxies, would 
instantaneously change. Of course, we cannot perform an actual experiment to test directly this 
potential inconsistency: in changing the millionth digit, the hands of the clock and the moons of 
Jupiter will have moved. Hence addressing the question of whether the PRNG output is a free 
variable requires studying the mathematical properties of physical theory. This is Bell���s point in 
the i rst quote. 
Based on this discussion, we can def i ne the dif f erence between a conspiratorial and a non- 
conspiratorial violation of (1). Suppose for the sake of argument that 
��(��|xy) ��= ��(��|x���y);x���= 1 ��� x(3) 
A conspiratorial interpretation of (3) would posit some bizarre physical process whereby the parti- 
cles��� hidden variables systematically inf l uenced the measurement settings or vice versa. That is to 
say, we imagine an intervention in x leading causally to a change in �� or vice versa. By contrast, 
a non-conspiratorial interpretation of (3) would posit that an intervention in x, keeping �� and y 
i xed, leads to a state of the world which is inconsistent with physical theory. Clearly, this is not an 
intervention in space-time at all. It is merely a hypothetical state-space perturbation which takes 
a point in the state space of the world (labelled by the triple (��,x,y)), consistent with physical 
theory and hence with ��(��|xy) ��= 0, to a state (��,x,���y) 
which is inconsistent with physical theory 
and hence has ��(��|x���y) 
= 0. In this sense, a non-conspiratorial violation of (3) implies that physical 
theory does not have the property of counterfactual def i niteness.

Summary:
The section delves into the nature of conspiratorial and non-conspiratorial interventions regarding violations of Bell inequalities.
Bell's Point
: Bell distinguishes between analyzing different physical theories and philosophizing about the real world. He highlights the limitation in our ability to test variations of reality since we only experience the world once. However, with physical theories, it's possible to test the consequences of changing variables, which provides insights into their causal structure.
Thought Experiment with PRNGs
: Bell presents a thought experiment involving two pseudo-random number generators (PRNGs). The output of these generators is influenced by the parity (even or odd nature) of the millionth digit of their input. He suggests that this specific digit's parity, being a minor detail, should not significantly influence other systems if changed, making it a "free variable".
Two Types of Interventions
:
Conventional
: An intervention that propagates causally in space-time, affecting distinct systems. This type of causal effect would result in a conspiratorial violation of the Measurement Independence assumption.
Non-conventional
: The hypothetical state of the universe where the PRNG's specific parity digit is changed (without affecting other parts) could be inconsistent with the laws of physics. Such an intervention would not be localized in space-time but would instantaneously affect the entire universe's ontological state. Testing this in reality is problematic because changing one element affects others.
Defining Conspiratorial and Non-Conspiratorial Violations
:
Conspiratorial Violation
: Envisions a strange physical process where hidden variables of particles influence the measurement settings or vice versa. This implies a direct causal relationship between a change in one system leading to a change in another.
Non-Conspiratorial Violation
: An intervention in one system, without affecting the others, results in a state that contradicts physical theory. It's not a real-world change but a theoretical adjustment in the state space, emphasizing the lack of counterfactual definiteness in the physical theory.
In essence, the section aims to clarify and demarcate between conspiratorial and non-conspiratorial interventions, with the latter being more about theoretical shifts in the state space rather than actual physical changes.

However, one needs to be careful to not throw the baby out with the bathwater. Counterfactual 
reasoning is pervasive in physics.Indeed, it is central to the scientif i c method [24].The fact 
that we can express laws of physics mathematically give us the power to estimate what would 
have happened had something been dif f erent. Such estimates can lead to predictions. If we have 
accurate representations of the laws of physics, then the predictions will be verif i ed by experiment. 
We do not want to give up counterfactual reasoning in our search for new theories of physics. 
We address this concern by noting that output from experiment and physical theory (particularly 
when the complexities of the real world are accounted for) involves some inherent coarse-graining. 
Experiments have some nominal accuracy and output from a computational model is typically 
truncated to a i xed number of signif i cant digits. We can represent this notion of nominal accuracy 
by integrating exact output of physical theory over small volumes V��> 0 in state space, where 
V����� 0 smoothly as �� ��� 0. We then insist that counterfactual def i niteness holds generically in 
our non-conspiratorial superdeterministic physical theory when all variables are coarse grained over 
volumes V��, for any �� > 0. The model based on discretised Hilbert Space, described in Section 4 
4 
has this property. This is why we do not expect to see non-conspiratorial superdeterminism either 
in classical theory, or directly from experimentation (we comment on possible indirect experimental 
tests of non-conspiratorial superdeterminism in Section 9). 
In Section 3 we argue that a gravitational theory could have the property that a perturbation, 
small enough to consistently change only the parity of the millionth digit here on Earth, will have a 
chaotic (and hence unsystematic) impact on distinctly dif f erent systems, say in the distant universe. 
In Section 4 we discuss the type of model that could have the property that such a gravitational 
perturbation, if it did not chaotically inf l uence such distant parts of the universe, would lead to a 
perturbed state of the universe that was inconsistent with physical theory. 
These matters are subtle, and it seems Bell appreciated this. Instead of derisively rejecting 
theories where (1) is violated he concludes FVLC with the words: 
Of course it might be that these reasonable ideas about physical randomisers are just 
wrong- for the purposes at hand. 
Indeed, in his last paper ���La Nouvelle Cuisine���, Bell writes: 
An essential element in the reasoning here is that [polariser settings] are free vari- 
ables....Perhaps such a theory could be both locally causal and in agreement with 
quantum mechanical predictions. However, I do not expect to see a serious theory of 
this kind. I would expect a serious theory to permit ���deterministic chaos��� or ���pseudo- 
randomness.....But I do not have a theorem about that. 
The last sentence is insightful, because, as we discuss, there is no such theorem. Indeed the reverse: 
here we develop a serious non-classical theory based on the premise that the universe is a chaotic 
dynamical system evolving on a fractal invariant set, where measurement settings are not free 
variables. As we will show, such a theory can be in agreement with quantum mechanical predictions 
and locally causal. Importantly, the theory is not conspiratorial.

Summary
:
The section addresses the importance of counterfactual reasoning in physics and its significance in the scientific method. While counterfactual reasoning allows us to make predictions based on mathematical representations of physical laws, it���s essential to handle it with caution.
Key Points
:
Counterfactual Reasoning
: This type of reasoning is vital to physics and the scientific method. By using mathematical laws of physics, scientists can make predictions about outcomes under different circumstances. When these predictions align with experimental results, it confirms our understanding of physical laws.
Coarse-Graining
: Real-world experiments and theoretical outputs involve a degree of approximation or coarse-graining. This means there's an inherent level of imprecision or approximation in our measurements or predictions. When considering counterfactual definiteness, it should apply when all variables are coarse-grained.
Model with Discretised Hilbert Space
: This model, discussed in Section 4, maintains counterfactual definiteness when coarse-grained. Therefore, we shouldn't expect to observe non-conspiratorial superdeterminism either in classical theories or through direct experiments.
Gravitational Theory and Perturbations
: Section 3 posits that a small perturbation on Earth could have chaotic effects on distant parts of the universe. Section 4 delves into models where such perturbations, if not causing chaotic changes, would lead to states inconsistent with our physical theories.
Bell's Perspective
: Bell seemed to have a nuanced view of these issues. He didn���t dismiss the idea that there could be violations to his inequalities or that measurement settings might not be free variables. In his later works, he speculated on the possibility of a theory where settings aren't free variables, yet it remains locally causal and aligns with quantum mechanics. However, he didn���t have a theorem proving this.
Conclusion
: The section introduces the development of a non-classical theory based on the idea that the universe behaves as a chaotic system. This theory, which sees measurement settings as non-free variables, aligns with quantum predictions and is locally causal without being conspiratorial.

3The Andromedan Butterf l y Ef f ect 
Can the l ap of a butterf l y���s wings in the Brazilian jungle (or a change to the millionth digit of the 
input to a PRNG) inf l uence the states of distant distinct systems (e.g. the weather on a planet in 
Andromeda) or vice versa? 
Here we repeat a calculation i rst reported by Michael Berry [7] and further analysed in [37]. 
Consider molecules in the Andromedan atmosphere as hard spheres of radius R with mean free 
distance l between collisions. We wish to estimate the uncertainty �����Min the angle of the Mth 
collision of one of the spheres with other spheres, due to some very small uncertain external force. 
It is easily shown that �����Mgrows as �����M��� ( 
l R) M�����1 (4) 
With l ��� 10���7m and R ��� 10���10m, say, l/R ��� 103. 
With l/R > 1, we have the potential for chaotic 
exponential growth of uncertainty in the direction of the sphere. 
After how many collisions is the position of a molecule in the Andromedan atmosphere sensitive 
to the gravitational ef f ect of the uncertain l ap of a butterf l y���s wing in Brazil? Let r denote the 
distance between Earth and Andromeda. The l ap of a butterf l y���s wing through a distance ���r 
5 
will change the gravitational force on our target molecule by an amount ���F = ���F/���r ���r = 
(Gmmolmwing/r3) ���r. Uncertainty in the l ap of a terrestrial butterf l y���s wing will therefore induce 
an uncertainty in the acceleration of an Andromedan molecule by an amount 
���a = 
2Gmwing 
r3 
���r(5) 
If �� denotes the mean time between molecular collisions, there is an uncertainty in the direction 
of the molecule �����1��� ��2���a/R. 
Plugging in mwing= 10���5kg, ���r = 10���2m, �� = 10���9s and 
r = 1022m, gives �����1= 10���90. How large is M before �����M��� 1? From the above, 103M��� 1090. 
Hence after about 30 collisions the direction the direction of travel of the Andromedan molecule 
has been rendered completely uncertain by the Brazilian butterf l y. Indeed one can go further: the 
direction of the Andromedan molecule is rendered completely uncertain by the position of a single 
electron at the edge of the observable universe after about only 40 collisions! 
Of course uncertainties in l aps of butterf l ies wings��� (or their equivalents) in Andromeda will 
have a similar impact on processes here on Earth. Nowhere above did the mass of the molecule 
enter the calculation. The same calculation could just as well apply to the measurement process in 
quantum physics- where a particle (a small sphere) interacts with atoms in some measuring device. 
This is the i rst step in our argument that (??) could be violated because the universe should 
be considered a rather holistic chaotic system. However, by itself, this argument doesn���t imply 
that the parity of the millionth digit, or the l ap of a butterfly���s wings in Brazil, is a vital piece of information for determining distinctly dif f erent systems like Andromedan weather. For that we need more.

Summary
:
The section titled "The Andromedan Butterfly Effect" delves into the intriguing question of whether a minute event on Earth, like the flap of a butterfly's wings in Brazil, can potentially influence significant systems in distant galaxies, such as the weather in the Andromeda galaxy.
Key Points
:
The Question
: The core question is whether small events on Earth can influence vast and distant systems, echoing the classic notion of the butterfly effect, where minute initial changes can have profound impacts on a larger scale.
The Calculation
: Using a model first reported by Michael Berry, the calculation focuses on the trajectory of molecules in the Andromedan atmosphere, considered as hard spheres. The uncertainty in the direction of these molecules due to small external forces can grow chaotically, with the potential for exponential growth.
Parameters Used
:
Sphere Size and Spacing
: l ��� 10^���7m (mean distance between collisions) and R ��� 10^���10m (radius of spheres) are taken as constants.
Molecular Direction Uncertainty
: Due to the nature of l and R, there is potential for an exponential growth in the uncertainty of the molecule's direction.
The Butterfly's Effect
: A butterfly flapping its wings on Earth causes a small change in gravitational force on a molecule in Andromeda. Using certain given constants, including the distance between Earth and Andromeda and the butterfly's wing movement, the resultant uncertainty in the Andromedan molecule's direction is calculated to be extremely small.
Impact
: However, after about 30 collisions, the direction of the Andromedan molecule becomes entirely uncertain due to the butterfly's action in Brazil. Furthermore, the direction of the molecule becomes uncertain due to the position of a single electron at the observable universe's edge after approximately 40 collisions.
Reciprocal Effect
: The converse is also valid. Events in Andromeda could impact processes on Earth. The mass of the molecule doesn't affect this calculation, implying that quantum physics measurements, involving interactions between particles and atoms in measuring devices, can be similarly affected.
Conclusion
: While this calculation proves the possibility of a chaotic, interconnected universe, it doesn't necessarily imply that minute details, like a butterfly's wing flap in Brazil, are critical for determining vast, distinct systems like the Andromedan weather. Further arguments and calculations are needed to establish such a direct link.

4A Superdeterministic Model 
4.1Nominal vs Exact Measurement Settings and Hidden Variables 
We build on Bell���s thought experiment whereby polariser orientations are determined by the parities 
Pxand Pyin Alice and Bob���s PRNGs (supposing there is no particular reason why these would be 
odd or even). Manifestly, Pxand Pyonly determines the polariser orientations to some nominal 
accuracy. That is, x,y ��� {0,1} determine small neighbourhoods of the 2-sphere of orientations, 
referred to as �� disks. None of the results below depend on the magnitude of �� as long as �� > 0 (as 
discussed in Section 7, the limit �� = 0 is singular). We will assume- consistent with our search for 
an underlying deterministic theory- that when measurements are made on particular particles, the 
measurement outcomes ��1 are associated with some exact, albeit unknown, polariser orientations X 
and Y. Here, X and Y denote unit vectors in physical 3-space from the centre of a unit ball, to the 
surface of the 2-sphere of orientations. The corresponding precise points on the 2-sphere to which 
the vectors point, are written as X and Y . The nominal directions x and y refer to unit vectors 
pointing to the centroids of the �� disks. In the discussion below, we assume that the probabilistic 
nature of the quantum measurement problem arises because the measurement outcome is typically 
sensitive to the exact measurement settings within an �� disk (c.f. fractally intertwined basins of 
attraction [27]). Hence, any given nominal setting is consistent with an ensemble of possible exact 
settings. The ultimate origin of quantum uncertainty is plausibly the gravitational Andromedan 
Butterf l y Ef f ect as described above. 
With this in mind, in the model described below, �� describes all of the variables which, over 
and above Pxand Py, determine the exact measurement settings X and Y. These variables include 
6 
Andromedan weather and indeed electrons at the end of the observable universe. When measuring 
a single qubit we can frame it like this: consider a spacelike hypersurface S in the past of the 
measurement event M, and through the event where the PRNG determined x, then �� must include 
all data on S in the interior of M���s past light cone, with the exception of Px.In this way we 
can write X = E(��,x), Y = E(��,y). The extension of this causal picture to entangled qubits is 
discussed in Section 6.

Summary
:
The section titled "A Superdeterministic Model" elaborates on a superdeterministic model grounded in Bell���s thought experiment concerning polarizer orientations. This model considers both nominal and exact measurement settings and how they relate to hidden variables.
Key Points
:
Bell���s Thought Experiment
: The model builds on the idea where polarizer orientations are determined by parities Px and Py from Alice and Bob���s Pseudo Random Number Generators (PRNGs). The polarity only decides the polarizer orientations to a certain accuracy.
Nominal vs Exact Settings
:
Nominal Accuracy
: The polarities Px and Py are indicators that only provide nominal accuracy, which means that x,y ��� {0,1} determine specific zones on the 2-sphere of orientations, termed as �� disks.
Exact Orientations
: When measurements are made on particles, the outcomes are associated with some exact polarizer orientations represented as X and Y. They indicate specific vectors pointing to a spot on the 2-sphere of orientations.
Nominal Directions
: These point to the center of the �� disks.
Origin of Quantum Uncertainty
: The quantum measurement issue's probabilistic nature arises as the outcome typically depends on the exact measurement settings within an �� disk. This setting relates to the idea of fractally intertwined basins of attraction. The origin of this quantum uncertainty is suggested to be due to the gravitational Andromedan Butterfly Effect.
Hidden Variables
: In this model, �� describes all variables determining the exact measurement settings X and Y, beyond just Px and Py. These variables include factors as far-reaching as weather conditions in the Andromeda galaxy and electrons at the end of the observable universe.
Single Qubit Measurement
: When measuring a single qubit, this can be framed in a way where �� must include all data on a spacelike hypersurface in the past of a specific measurement event. This ensures that X and Y can be expressed in terms of �� and x or y, respectively.
Entangled Qubits
: How this causal model extends to entangled qubits will be further discussed in Section 6.
Overall, the section presents a deterministic model that seeks to incorporate both the nominal and exact settings of measurements, tying the quantum uncertainty to the holistic, interconnected nature of the universe.

that Lorenz [23] discovered in his quest to understand the deterministic non-periodicity of weather. 
This model (based on Newton���s Laws) is a classical dynamical system and can be integrated from 
any triple of initial states (xL,yL,zL) at t = 0. However, at t = ��� this model has an emergent non- 
classical property: all states lie on a measure-zero, fractionally dimensioned, dynamically invariant 
subset ILof state space, known as the Lorenz attractor. That ILis fractionally dimensioned implies 
that ILhas a non-Euclidean, fractal geometry. That ILis an invariant set implies that if a point lies 
on IL, its future evolution will continue to lie on ILfor all time, and its past evolution has lain on 
ILfor all time. That ILhas measure zero implies that the probability that a randomly chosen point 
belongs to ILis equal to zero (random with respect to the uniform measure on the Euclidean state 
space R3spanned by (xL,yL,zL)). Conversely, associated with ILis a fractal invariant measure ��L 
(a Haar-type measure). Points which do not lie on ILhave ��L= 0. Such points are inconsistent 
with a non-classical dynamical system where all states lie on ILby def i nition. Such a system is 
non-classical because ILis a non-computable subset of state space [9] [14]- non-computability being 
a post-quantum discovery of 20th Century mathematics . 
Now suppose we are given some timeseries from the output of the Lorenz equations in this 
non-classical limit where the system is evolving on IL. No matter how long is the timeseries, we 
cannot estimate statistical quantities like correlations or conditional frequencies more accurately 
than the accuracy to which the timeseries has been outputted (e.g. the number of signif i cant i gures 
of output variables). That is to say, we must treat all estimates of frequency (and correlation) as 
functions of coarse-grained variables

Lorenz system to infer the existence of points inside the �� balls where ��L= 0. However, by the 
fractal nature of IL, we know such points exist. 
The results from Section 3 suggests the universe itself be considered a chaotic system. Following 
Lorenz, it is well known that a broad class of chaotic models have measure-zero fractal attractors 
7 
[38]. The geometry of these attractors provide a holistic description of the states of such chaotic 
systems. It is worth noting that def i ning chaos from geometric properties of the system���s invariant 
set (e.g.its non-integer dimension) provides a relativistically invariant description of chaos, in 
contrast with positivity of Lyapunov exponents [13].Consistent with the discussion above, we 
assume the universe is a deterministic chaotic dynamical system evolving precisely on its fractal 
invariant set IU, with invariant measure ��U. This is referred to as the invariant set postulate [28]. 
States which do not lie on IUmust be assigned a measure and hence a probability �� = ��U= 0.

Summary
:
The section titled "The Invariant Set Postulate" delves into the concept of chaotic systems, using Lorenz's famous model to explain deterministic non-periodicity observed in weather patterns.
Key Points
:
Lorenz's Model
: The Lorenz model described by the given set of differential equations is rooted in Newton���s Laws. When integrated from any initial states, the model reveals an interesting property at t = ���.
Lorenz Attractor
:
Emergent Property
: All states in the Lorenz model eventually converge on a subset of the state space termed the Lorenz attractor (IL).
Unique Characteristics
: The Lorenz attractor is:
Fractionally dimensioned, leading to a non-Euclidean, fractal geometry.
An invariant set, meaning any point on it will always remain on it.
Measure zero, indicating the probability that a randomly chosen point belongs to IL is zero.
Fractal Invariant Measure ��L
: Points not on IL have a measure ��L = 0. This signifies that these points don't align with the non-classical system where all states are on IL. This system is defined as non-classical due to IL being non-computable.
Estimation Limitation
: Using data from the Lorenz system, it's impossible to calculate statistical quantities like correlations more precisely than the dataset's granularity. Any estimation made is a function of coarse-grained variables.
Universe as a Chaotic System
:
Proposal
: Drawing on the results from the previous section, the universe is suggested to be a chaotic system, analogous to various chaotic models having measure-zero fractal attractors.
Invariant Set Postulate
: The universe is proposed to be a deterministic chaotic system that evolves on its fractal invariant set (IU), with an invariant measure ��U. Any states not on IU have a measure �� = ��U = 0.
Relativistic Description of Chaos
: Using the geometric properties of a system���s invariant set (like its non-integer dimension) to define chaos offers a relativistically invariant description. This contrasts with other definitions like positivity of Lyapunov exponents.
In essence, the section postulates that just as the Lorenz model indicates deterministic chaos for weather systems, the universe itself might function as a deterministic chaotic system, evolving on a specific fractal set.

4.3Rational Quantum Mechanics: RaQM 
Although the invariant set postulate provides a geometric approach to non-conspiratorial superde- 
terminism, it does not directly address two specif i c questions.Firstly, is it possible for a non- 
conspiratorial locally-causal superdeterministic model to violate Bell inequalities exactly as does 
quantum mechanics, and secondly is it possible in such a theory for (1) to be satisf i ed if �� is coarse- 
grained over any given ��-ball V��in state space- and hence to be satisf i ed in corresponding classical 
theories. 
Motivated by Planck���s original proposal to discretise energy levels (and John Wheeler���s plea 
to excise the continuum from physical theory [40]), a related way to introduce non-conspiratorial 
superdeterminism into quantum physics is to discretise Hilbert space [10] [11] [30]. At the experi- 
mental level this is surely unexceptionable: all experiments which conf i rm quantum mechanics will 
necessarily conf i rm a model of quantum physics based on discretised Hilbert Space, providing the 
discretisation is i ne enough. 
4.3.1Single Qubits 
Consider a qubit prepared in a state |1���, and written as 
|1��� = cos 
�� 2|1 ������ + sin�� 2e i��| ��� 1������ 
(8) 
with respect to some measurement basis {|1������,| ��� 1������}. In RaQM we assume

= m1 
2p 
; 
�� 
2�� 
= n1 
4p 
(9) 
where p is some large prime number and 0 ��� m1,n1��� p. Here �� and �� can be considered nominal 
representatives of exact measurement settings which satisfy the rationality constraints

= 0.m1m2...mI��� Q =��� cos��e��� Q; 
��e 
2�� 
= 0.n1n2...nJ��� Q(10) 
written in base-p. In this way, it can be shown [32] that |����� represents a bit-string of p deterministic 
elements (= ��1) with i xed m1, n1but varying m2, n2(and where �� denotes a cyclical permutation 
of elements of the bit string). In this representation, |����� automatically satisf i es Born���s Rule (i.e. it 
is not a separate axiom in RaQM). 
If the exact preparation setting is represented by X, and exact measurement setting Y, then the 
i rst of (10) can be written X �� Y ��� Q, where �� denotes the scalar product of two vectors. Because 
of Niven���s theorem 
Theorem. If ��e/2�� ��� Q, then cos��e/ ��� Q except when cos��e= 0,��1 2,��1 [26] [20] 
8 
the discretisation renders incommensurate angles that determine probabilities, and angles that 
determine phases, except at the precise values ��e= 0,��/2,��,3��/2. One can assume that such 
precise values never occur in practice, though they may be relevant for theoretical reasons (e.g. 
when one considers a measurement performed with a precisely opposite measurement direction). 
An important corollary to Niven���s Theorem- central to this paper- is the Impossible Triangle 
Corollary: 
Corollary. Let ���XY Z be a triangle on the unit sphere with rational internal angles, not precisely 
equal to multiples of 45���, such that X��Y and Y��Z are rational numbers. Then X��Z is an irrational 
number. 
Proof. Assume otherwise and look for contradiction. Use the cosine rule for ���XY Z, 
cos��XZ= cos��XYcos��Y Z+ sin��XYsin��Y Zcos��Y(11) 
where ��XZdenotes the exact angular distance between X and Z on the unit sphere, etc and ��Y 
is the exact internal angle of the triangle at the vertex Y . Since cos��XYand cos��Y Zare both 
rational, then from (11), sin��XYsin��Y Zcos��Ymust be rational. Squaring, (1 ��� cos2��XY)(1 ��� 
cos2��Y Z)cos2��Ymust be rational. Again, since cos��XYand cos��Y Zare both rational, cos2��Y 
and hence cos2��Ymust be rational. But this is impossible since ��Yis itself rational and phiYis 
not a multiple of 45���. Hence cos��XZmust be irrational. 
The Impossible Triangle Corollary is vital for explaining the notion of non-commutativity in 
RaQM [32]. Consider a particle with spin prepared (with Stern-Gerlach device SG0) relative to 
some exact orientation X. It is passed through Stern-Gerlach device SG1 with exact orientation Y . 
The spin-up output beam of SG1 is passed through Stern-Gerlach device SG2 with exact orientation 
Z. By RaQM, X��Y and Y��Z are rational. Suppose the detector in the spin-down output channel 
of SG2 registers a particle and consider the hypothetical experiment on the same particle (same ��) 
where SG1 and SG2 are swapped (commuted). The measurement outcome from this hypothetical 
experiment is undef i ned: by the Impossible Triangle Corollary, if X��Y and Y��Z are rational, then 
X �� Z is not. 
We note in passing that it is straightforwardly shown [30] that the ensemble representation of 
the single qubit state in RaQM satisf i es a uncertainty principle relationship, i.e.

Summary
:
The section titled "Rational Quantum Mechanics: RaQM" discusses a proposal for understanding quantum mechanics in a deterministic framework using the notion of discretized Hilbert spaces.
Key Points
:
Invariant Set Postulate's Limitation
: While the invariant set postulate offers a geometrical interpretation of non-conspiratorial superdeterminism, it doesn't answer two specific queries related to the violation of Bell inequalities and how this aligns with quantum mechanics.
Introducing Discreteness
: Drawing inspiration from Planck���s idea to discretize energy levels and John Wheeler���s suggestion to remove the continuum from physical theory, one way to incorporate non-conspiratorial superdeterminism in quantum physics is to discretize Hilbert space. This approach works as long as the discretization is sufficiently fine, ensuring it matches with experiments that confirm quantum mechanics.
Single Qubits in RaQM
:
A qubit prepared in a specific state is represented in terms of cosines and sines relating to measurement bases. Within RaQM, these terms are expressed as rational functions of some large prime number.
The qubit represents a deterministic string of elements with specific properties, satisfying Born���s Rule intrinsically in RaQM.
The scalar product of two vectors representing exact preparation and measurement settings is rational.
Niven���s Theorem
: This theorem asserts that if a particular ratio involving an angle ��e is rational, then the cosine of a portion of that angle is rational except for specific exceptions.
Impossible Triangle Corollary
:
This corollary emphasizes that, for a triangle on the unit sphere with rational internal angles, if two dot products of its vectors are rational, then the third dot product must be irrational.
This corollary plays a significant role in explaining the concept of non-commutativity in RaQM.
Illustration with Stern-Gerlach Devices
: Consider a particle with a specific spin. If it passes through two devices with orientations Y and Z respectively, and specific outcomes are observed, swapping the devices' order results in an undefined outcome. This is due to the Impossible Triangle Corollary.
Uncertainty Principle
: The ensemble representation of the single qubit state in RaQM adheres to an uncertainty principle, although this is mentioned without a detailed explanation.
In essence, RaQM offers a deterministic view of quantum mechanics by introducing a discretized approach, especially in Hilbert space. This discretization aids in defining quantum systems in a manner consistent with experiments while also integrating notions of superdeterminism and non-conspiratorial behavior.

6Local Causality 
In this Section, we show that the proposed superdeterministic model is locally causal. First we 
have to def i ne what is meant by local causality. We i rst note the comment by Bell [5]: 
Very often ... factorizability is taken as the starting point of the analysis. Here we 
have preferred to see it not as the formulation of ���local causality���, but as a consequence 
thereof. 
In this, his last paper, Bell was still struggling to i nd a satisfactory def i nition of local causality. 
Fig 3 illustrates a space-time diagram where a photonic source emits two entangled photons. 
These are measured by Alice and Bob���s detectors with nominal settings x = 0 and y = 0 and exact 
settings X0and Y0. The nominal settings are determined by two PRNGs shown in the i gure. By the 
discussion above, the particle���s hidden variables ��, together with the parities Pxand Py, determine 
these exact settings. In Fig 3, we divide �� into two components, ��Acorresponding to information 
in the past light cone of Alice���s measurement event, and ��Bcorresponding to information in the 
past light cone of Bob���s measurement event. 
Let us start by writing Alice and Bob���s measurement outcomes (= ��1) in the most general 
form: SA= S(��A,��B,x,y);SB= S(��A,��B,x,y)(26) 
Here the notion of local causality expresses the relativistic notion that SAshould not depend on y 
or ��B(since these are outside the light cone of Alice���s measurement event), and similarly SBshould 
not depend on x or ��A. 
However, in the context of the proposed superdeterministic model, we have to be careful what 
we mean by ���does not depend on���. To understand the subtlety, we def i ne the notion of causality in 
terms of Pearlean interventions as above. If we intervene on the world in some small part of space- 
time, we expect that intervention to propagate causally, i.e. consistent with the light-cone structure 
of space-time. However, as discussed above, we need to distinguish between interventions that keep 
the state of the world on IUand interventions that take the state of the world of f IU. The former 
describe space-time mappings: from a space-time in which the intervention does not occur, to a 
space-time in which the intervention does occur. A space-time intervention must be consistent with 
the Lorentzian metric of space time, i.e. cannot propagate superluminally. By contrast, an ���acausal��� 
intervention which takes the state of the world of f IUdoes not def i ne a space-time mapping. There 
is no requirement for such an intervention to be consistent with the Lorentzian metric- there is no 
Lorentzian metric on state space.

Summary
:
This section discusses local causality within the context of a superdeterministic model.
Key Points
:
Defining Local Causality
: There is an acknowledgment that a clear definition of 'local causality' has been elusive, even for notable physicists like Bell. Bell viewed factorizability not as a direct articulation of 'local causality' but rather as an outcome of it.
Space-Time Diagram & Photons
: A depiction is mentioned (Fig 3) that represents a scenario in which a source produces two entangled photons. These photons are measured by detectors belonging to Alice and Bob. The settings for these measurements are determined by pseudo-random number generators (PRNGs). The hidden variables of the particle, in collaboration with certain parities, decide the exact settings.
Breaking Down ��
: The variable �� (representing hidden variables of the system) is divided into two parts: ��A (information within the past light cone of Alice���s measurement event) and ��B (information within the past light cone of Bob���s measurement event).
General Form of Outcomes
: The outcomes of measurements by Alice and Bob can be represented in a generalized form. This representation highlights the idea that Alice's result shouldn't be influenced by certain elements pertaining to Bob, and vice versa. This notion stems from the relativistic perspective that an event's outcome should not be affected by factors outside of its light cone.
Understanding Dependencies
: In the context of the proposed model, it's crucial to understand what "does not depend on" really means. This involves distinguishing between two types of interventions:
Space-time Mappings
: These interventions, which maintain the state of the world on IU, define a transformation from a space-time without the intervention to one with the intervention. These interventions must respect the structure of space-time and cannot transmit information faster than light.
'Acausal' Interventions
: Contrarily, interventions that shift the state of the world off IU don't define a space-time transformation. They aren't bound by the constraints of the Lorentzian metric of space-time.
In essence, the section examines local causality from the lens of superdeterminism, emphasizing the importance of understanding the dependencies and causal relationships in this theoretical model.

7Singular Limits and the Aaronson Challenge 
Aaronson���s challenge (see the Introduction) raises a more general question: what is the relationship 
between a successor theory of physics and its predecessor theory? There is a subtle but important 
relationship brought out explicitly by Michael Berry [8] that is of relevance here. 
Typically an old theory is a singular limit of a new theory, and not a smooth limit, as a parameter 
of the new theory is set equal to inf i nity or zero. A singular limit is one where some characteristic 
of the theory changes discontinuously at the limit, and not continuously as the limit is approached. 
Berry cites as examples the old theory of ray optics is explained from Maxwell theory, or the old 
15 
theory of thermodynamics is explained from statistical mechanics. His claim is that old theories of 
physics are typically singular limits of new theories. 
If quantum theory is a forerunner of some successor superdeterministic theory, and Berry���s 
observation is correct, quantum mechanics is likely to be a singular limit of that superdeterministic 
theory. Here the state space of quantum theory arises at the limit p = ��� of RaQM, but not before. 
For any i nite p, no matter how big, the incompleteness property that led to the violation of (1) 
holds. However, it does not hold at p = ���. From this point of view, quantum mechanics is indeed 
a singular limit of RaQM at p = ���.It 
is interesting to note that pure mathematicians often 
append the real numbers to sets (���adeles���) of p-adic numbers, at p = ���. However, the properties 
of p-adic numbers are quite dif f erent to those of the reals for any i nite p no matter how big. Here 
the real-number continuum is the singular limit of the p-adics at p = ���. The relationship between 
QM and RaQM is very similar. 
In physics, it is commonplace to solve dif f erential equations numerically, i.e. to treat discreti- 
sations as approximations of some continuum exact equations, such that when the discretisation is 
i ne enough, the numerical results are as close as we require to the exact continuum solution. This 
is not a good analogy here. A better analogy is analytic number theory, considered as an approx- 
imation to say the exact theory of prime numbers. If one is interested in properties of primes for 
large primes, treating p as if it were a continuum variable can provide excellent results. However, 
here the continuum limit is the approximation and not the exact theory. 
Contrary to Aaronson���s statements, the singular relationship between a superdeterministic the- 
ory and quantum mechanics is exactly as one would expect from the history of science.

Summary
:
This section delves into the intricate relationship between older theories in physics and their modern counterparts, using the framework of "singular limits" as described by Michael Berry. The idea is used to address Aaronson's challenge regarding the correlation between quantum mechanics and potential superdeterministic theories.
Key Points
:
Aaronson's Challenge
: This challenge, mentioned earlier, questions the relationship between a new physics theory and its predecessor.
Singular Limits
:
An old theory often acts as a singular limit of a new theory. This means that as some parameter of the new theory approaches a boundary (like infinity or zero), a characteristic of the theory changes abruptly.
Examples: The old theory of ray optics can be explained from Maxwell's theory, and the traditional thermodynamics theory can be derived from statistical mechanics.
Quantum Mechanics and Superdeterminism
:
If quantum mechanics is a precursor to a superdeterministic theory and if Berry's observations hold true, then quantum mechanics might be a singular limit of the superdeterministic theory.
The state space of quantum theory emerges at a specific limit of RaQM. Before this point, certain properties leading to the violation of (1) are present. However, at the limit, they vanish, making quantum mechanics a singular limit of RaQM.
Mathematical Perspective
:
Pure mathematicians sometimes add real numbers to sets of p-adic numbers at p = infinity. The behavior of these p-adic numbers differs from real numbers, with the real-number continuum acting as the singular limit.
Analogy in Physics
:
In physics, differential equations are commonly solved numerically. However, this isn't the ideal analogy for the discussed theories. A better comparison would be analytic number theory as an approximation to the exact theory of prime numbers. The continuum limit in this context is the approximation rather than the precise theory.
Contradicting Aaronson
:
Despite Aaronson's claims, the singular relationship between superdeterministic theories and quantum mechanics aligns well with historical scientific trends.
In essence, this section emphasizes the significance of singular limits in understanding the progression of scientific theories, particularly in physics.

run of a Bell experiment, we have supposed it is just as likely that Px is odd or even- there are certainly no knowable constraints that prevent Pxfrom being odd or even. However, we could let Px 
represent the state of the ���millionth��� neuron in an experimenter���s brain. If the neuron has i red, their 
measurement apparatus is set to x = 0, otherwise it is set to x = 1. Just as there are no knowable 
constraints to prevent the millionth digit being odd or even, we can suppose there are no knowable 
constraints to prevent the neuron from i ring or not i ring. The experimental might interpret this 
in terms of an ability to set apparatuses whimsically, surely the very embodiment of freedom. As 
such, there is nothing in the proposed model to deny the freedom of the experimentalist, at least 
from the perspective of a traditional compatibilist understanding of freedom [21]. 
9Experimental Tests 
A key result from this paper is that we will not be able to detect non-conspiratorial superdetermin- 
istic violations of (1) by studying frequencies of measurement outcomes in a Bell experiment. We 
must look for other ways of testing such theories. 
Of course, QM is exceptionally well tested and if a superdeterministic theory is to replace QM, it 
must clearly be consistent with results from all the experiments which support QM. Here RaQM has 
a free parameter p, which, if large enough, can replicate all existing experiments. This is because 
with large enough p, discretised Hilbert space is i ne enough that it replicates to experimental 
accurace the probabilistic predictions of a theory based on continuum Hilbert space (and Born���s Rule 
to interpret the squared modulus of a state as a probability- something automatically satisf i ed in 
RaQM). Conversely, however, if p is some i nite albeit large number, then in principle an experiment 
with free parameter pexpcan study situations where pexp> p where there might be some departure 
between reality and QM [18]. 
One conceivable test of RaQM vs QM probes the i nite amount of information that can be 
contained in the quantum state vector |����� (in RaQM n qubits are represented by n bit strings of 
length p). In RaQM, the i nite information encoded in the quantum state vector will limit the 
power of a general purpose quantum computer, in the sense that RaQM predicts the exponential 
increase in quantum compute speed with qubit number for a range of quantum algorithms may 
generally max out at a i nite number m of qubits. 
The key question is what this value m is. We will explore this issue elsewhere. 
10Conclusions 
Here we claim that violation of (1) does not imply any of the derisive things claimed by numerous 
researchers in the quantum foundations community over the years.A superdeterministic (and 
17 
hence deterministic) model has been proposed which is not conspiratorial, is locally causal, does 
not deny experimenter free choice in any meaningful sense and is not i ne tuned with respect to 
natural metrics and measures. Importantly, the model is not a classical hidden-variable model, 
i.e. it derives its properties from post-quantum-theory mathematical science. By considering the 
continuum of complex Hilbert Space as a singular limit of a superdeterministic discretisation of 
complex Hilbert Space, Aaronson���s challenge to superdeterminists can be met. 
Perhaps the most important conclusion of this paper is that we need to be extremely cautious 
when invoking the notion of an ���intervention��� in space time, at least in the context of fundamental 
physics.Such interventions form the bedrock of Pearl���s causal inference modelling, and causal 
inference has been used widely in the quantum foundations community to try to analyse the causal 
structure of quantum physics. Here we distinguish between two types of intervention: one that is 
consistent with the laws of physics and one that is not. The ef f ect of the former type of intervention, 
if it is initially contained within a localised region of space-time, must propagate causally in space- 
time, constrained by the Lorentzian metric of space time. By contrast, the latter type of intervention 
simply perturbs a state of the universe from a part of state space where the laws of physics hold, 
to a part of state space where the laws of physics do not hold. The metric of state space is not 
Lorentzian and so if the hypothetical intervention is non-zero in a localised region of space-time, 
there are no constraints which prevent its ef f ect on the whole of space time being instantaneous - you cannot violate the laws of physics locally and expect the rest of the universe to carry on 
regardless! If this superdeterministic model is correct, theories of quantum physics based on causal 
inference models which adopt an uncritical acceptance of interventions, regardless of whether they 
are consistent with the laws of physics or not, will give misleading results. 
We conclude turn the table on the critics: what alternative interpretation of the experimental 
violation of Bell���s inequality makes any sense? If we abandon local causality then we have to explain - no-signalling notwithstanding- how Bob���s measurement choice could af f ect Alice���s measurement 
outcome.If we abandon realism, we have to explain what it means to say that states of the 
seemingly real world are ���unreal���. If we appeal to retrocausality, then we admit a conspiratorial 
space-time intervention which propagates backwards in time, arguably twice the worse for that. 
The results of this paper suggest that gravity may central to understanding the reasons why the 
universe can be considered a dynamical system evolving on an invariant set, and hence why Hilbert 
space itself should be ���quantised���. This suggests that instead of looking for a quantum theory of 
gravity, we should instead be looking for a gravitational theory of the quantum [29] [34]. However, 
importantly, the results here suggest such a theory will not be found by probing smaller and smaller 
regions of space-time, ultimately the Planck scale. It will instead be found by incorporating into the 
fundamental laws of physics, the state-space geometry of the universe at its very largest scales [31]. 
Planck-scale discontinuities in space-time may instead be an emergent property of such (top-down) 
geometric laws of physics. 
In the author���s opinion, this is the real message- not non-locality or indeterminism- behind the violation of Bell���s inequality.

Summary
:
This section dives into the intricacies of quantum physics, focusing on the relationship between quantum mechanics (QM) and superdeterministic models. Through experiments and models, the paper challenges previous notions in quantum mechanics and aims to shed light on the meaning behind the violation of Bell's inequality.
Key Points
:
Free Will of the Experimentalist
: The paper defends that there's nothing in the proposed model that restricts the experimenter's freedom, supporting the perspective of a traditional compatibilist view on freedom.
Experimental Tests
:
A primary outcome is that non-conspiratorial superdeterministic violations of (1) will not be detected by examining frequencies in a Bell experiment. Other testing methods are needed.
The paper also suggests that the value of p in RaQM, if sufficiently large, can reproduce results from all experiments supporting QM. However, if p is finite, there may be discrepancies between reality and QM.
Tests for RaQM vs. QM
:
The proposed test centers on the finite amount of information contained in the quantum state vector |�����. In RaQM, this finite information can limit the potential of a general-purpose quantum computer. The main query is determining the value of m (max qubit number).
Conclusions
:
The paper argues against many criticisms from the quantum foundations community. The proposed superdeterministic model is not conspiratorial, locally causal, and respects experimenter freedom. It's also distinct from classical hidden-variable models.
The continuum of complex Hilbert Space is considered as a singular limit, meeting Aaronson���s challenge to superdeterminists.
Caution is advised when invoking the concept of an 'intervention' in space-time. The paper distinguishes between interventions that are consistent with physics laws and those that aren't. The implications of these interventions on space-time and the universe are profound.
Critics are challenged on alternative interpretations of Bell's inequality violations. Concerns revolve around local causality, realism, and retrocausality.
Gravity may play a central role in understanding the universe as a dynamical system. Instead of seeking a quantum theory of gravity, the focus should shift towards a gravitational theory of the quantum. The author argues against the emphasis on probing the Planck scale, suggesting that the laws of physics should incorporate state-space geometry on a larger scale. Planck-scale discontinuities might be an emergent property of such laws.
The genuine implication behind the violation of Bell���s inequality, in the author's view, is neither non-locality nor indeterminism.
In essence, the paper aims to provide a fresh perspective on quantum physics, challenging conventional interpretations and suggesting a more unifying approach that bridges gaps between various theories and experiments.

Discretised Hilbert Space and Superdeterminism
T.N. Palmer
In computational physics it is standard to approximate continuum systems with discretised representations. Here we consider a specific discretisation of the continuum complex Hilbert space of quantum mechanics - a discretisation where squared amplitudes and complex phases are rational numbers. The fineness of this discretisation is determined by a finite (prime-number) parameter p. As p������, unlike standard discretised representations in computational physics, this model does not tend smoothly to the continuum limit. Instead, the state space of quantum mechanics is a singular limit of the discretised model at p=���. Using number theoretic properties of trigonometric functions, it is shown that for large enough values of p, discretised Hilbert space accurately describes ensemble representations of quantum systems within an inherently superdeterministic framework, one where the Statistical Independence assumption in Bell's theorem is formally violated. In this sense, the discretised model can explain the violation of Bell inequalities without appealing to nonlocality or indefinite reality. It is shown that this discretised framework is not fine tuned (and hence not conspiratorial) with respect to its natural state-space p-adic metric. As described by Michael Berry, old theories of physics are typically the singular limits of new theories as a parameter of the new theory is set equal to zero or infinity. Using this, we can answer the challenge posed by Scott Aaronson, critic of superderminism: to explain when a great theory in physics (here quantum mechanics) has ever been `grudgingly accommodated' rather than `gloriously explained' by its candidate successor theory (here a superdeterministic theory of quantum physics based on discretised Hilbert space).

The provided abstract touches on a unique perspective in quantum physics by T.N. Palmer. Here's a summary of the main topics and ideas discussed in the abstract:
Title
:
Discretised Hilbert Space and Superdeterminism
Discretised Representations in Computational Physics
: It's common to approximate continuum systems with discretised versions.
Special Discretisation of Hilbert Space
: Palmer introduces a unique discretisation of the continuum complex Hilbert space of quantum mechanics. In this model, squared amplitudes and complex phases are rational numbers.
Role of the Parameter p
: The granularity or fineness of the discretisation is based on a finite (prime-number) parameter, p. The state space of quantum mechanics emerges as a singular limit of this model when p approaches infinity.
Number Theoretic Properties
: By employing the number theoretic properties of trigonometric functions, the abstract demonstrates that for sufficiently large values of p, the discretised Hilbert space can precisely describe ensemble representations of quantum systems.
Superdeterministic Framework
: The discretised model operates within a superdeterministic framework. This means that the Statistical Independence assumption in Bell's theorem is formally violated.
Violation of Bell Inequalities
: Within this framework, the model can explain the violation of Bell inequalities without resorting to the ideas of nonlocality or an indefinite reality.
Non-conspiratorial Nature
: The discretised framework isn't "fine-tuned" in a way that makes it seem artificially constructed. This is in line with its natural state-space p-adic metric.
Old Theories as Singular Limits of New Theories
: Citing Michael Berry, Palmer suggests that older physics theories are usually singular limits of newer theories when a parameter of the new theory approaches zero or infinity.
Responding to Scott Aaronson's Challenge
: Palmer aims to address the critique posed by Scott Aaronson regarding superdeterminism. Aaronson challenges critics to showcase when a significant theory in physics has been reluctantly accommodated rather than splendidly explained by its succeeding theory.
Overall, the abstract introduces a novel perspective on quantum mechanics, proposing a discretised Hilbert space approach and addressing long-standing debates around Bell inequalities and superdeterminism.

Abstract 
The properties which give quantum mechanics its unique character- unitarity, comple- 
mentarity, non-commutativity, uncertainty, nonlocality- derive from the algebraic structure of 
Hermitian operators acting on the wavefunction in complex Hilbert space. Because of this, 
the wavefunction cannot be shown to describe an ensemble of deterministic states where un- 
certainty simply ref l ects a lack of knowledge about which ensemble member describes reality. 
This has led to endless debates about the ontology of quantum mechanics. 
Here we derive these same quantum properties from number theoretic attributes of trigono- 
metric functions applied to an explicitly ensemble-based representation of discretised complex 
Hilbert states. To avoid i ne-tuning, the metric on state space must be p-adic rather than Eu- 
clidean where 1/p determines the i neness of the discretisation. This hints at both the existence 
of an underpinning fractal state-space geometry onto which states of the world are constrained. 
In this model, violation of Bell inequalities is a manifestation of this geometric constraint and 
does not imply a breakdown of local space-time causality. 
Because the discretised wavefunction describes an ensemble of states, there is no collapse of 
the wavefunction. Instead measurement describes a nonlinear clustering of state-space trajec- 
tories on the state-space geometry. In this model, systems with mass greater than the Planck 
mass will not exhibit quantum properties and instead behave classically. The geometric con- 
straint suggests that the exponential increase in the size of state space with qubit number may 
break down with qubit numbers as small as a few hundred. Quantum mechanics is itself a 
singular limit of this number-theoretic model at p = ���. A modif i cation of general relativity, 
consistent with this discretised model of quantum physics, is proposed.

Here's a breakdown of the main topics and ideas discussed in the abstract titled "Quantum Physics from Number Theory" by Tim Palmer:
Title
:
Quantum Physics from Number Theory
Unique Character of Quantum Mechanics
: The foundational properties of quantum mechanics, such as unitarity, complementarity, non-commutativity, uncertainty, and nonlocality, stem from the algebraic structure of Hermitian operators that act on the wavefunction in the complex Hilbert space.
Wavefunction and Deterministic States
: The wavefunction in quantum mechanics does not represent a collection of deterministic states. Instead, its nature has led to prolonged debates regarding the real essence or ontology of quantum mechanics.
Number Theoretic Approach
: Palmer derives the quantum properties from the number theoretic characteristics of trigonometric functions. These functions are applied to a representation of discretised complex Hilbert states that explicitly relates to an ensemble.
Metric on State Space
: To ensure that there's no artificial fine-tuning, the metric on the state space needs to be p-adic, not Euclidean. The inverse of p (1/p) determines how fine the discretisation is.
Fractal State-Space Geometry
: This p-adic metric hints at an underlying fractal geometry on which the world's states are constrained.
Violation of Bell Inequalities
: The violation of Bell inequalities in this model is due to the constraints of this geometric structure, not a breakdown of local space-time causality.
No Wavefunction Collapse
: Given that the discretised wavefunction represents an ensemble of states, there is no "collapse" of the wavefunction upon measurement. Instead, measurement leads to a non-linear clustering of trajectories in state-space.
Planck Mass Threshold
: Systems with a mass exceeding the Planck mass do not display quantum properties and, thus, behave classically.
Limitation on State Space Size
: The abstract suggests that the exponential growth of state space with the increase in qubit number might stop working with qubit numbers as low as a few hundred.
Quantum Mechanics as a Limit
: Quantum mechanics, in this perspective, is a unique limit of the number-theoretic model when p approaches infinity.
Modification of General Relativity
: A revised version of general relativity that aligns with this discretised quantum physics model is proposed.
Overall, this abstract introduces a novel perspective on quantum mechanics by relating it to number theory and suggesting a different framework for understanding various quantum phenomena.

5Discussion 
This work was motivated by a belief that the synthesis of quantum and gravitational physics 
will require more give from the quantum side and less from the gravitational side. Here we 
have ���second quantised��� quantum mechanics in an unconventional way: by discretising complex 
Hilbert space. The particular discretisation leads to an inherent number-theoretic incommen- 
surateness between complex amplitudes and complex phases. The discretisation allows complex 
Hilbert states to be given an ensemble interpretation, and the incommensurateness generates 
all the conventional properties of quantum systems typically associated with the algebra of Her- 
mitian operators in complex Hilbert Space, but without invoking such an algebra. Importantly, 
with this discretisation, it is no longer necessary to interpret the violation of Bell inequalities 
as implying a breakdown of causal realism in space-time, making the discretised model more 
consistent with the causal determinism of general relativity than is quantum mechanics. 
Although the experimental consequences of this discretised theory can be made identical 
to quantum physics by setting the parameter N to a large enough value, here estimates of N 
have been given that lead to experimentally testable dif f erences from quantum mechanics: that 
20 
systems with masses greater the Planck mass will not exhibit quantum properties, and that 
general purpose noise-free quantum computers may in principle be limited to a few hundred 
qubits. The latter invokes the fact that the discretised theory has a geometric underpinning, 
describing the fractal invariant set of the universe. 
There is one further implication of this fractal geometry worth commenting on here. Con- 
sider a state space trajectory at some low level of fractal iteration and zoom into it with higher 
and higher magnif i cation. At the next level of fractal iteration the trajectory appears as a 
helix of trajectories, i.e., as an ensemble. At the next level of iteration the trajectory again 
returns to appear as a single curve. A trajectory vacillates between a single curve and a helix 
ensemble as the zoom proceeds. This means that the laws of physics similarly should vacillate 
between being classical-like and quantum-like. This gives a very dif f erent picture to the usual 
one, where classical theories are assumed to be less fundamental than quantum theories. The 
author intends to expand on this in more detail elsewhere. 
Although a radical modif i cation of quantum mechanics has been proposed, there has to be 
some modif i cation to general relativity to make it compatible with this discretised version of 
quantum physics. Most importantly, the energy-momentum tensor on the right hand side of 
the i eld equations should describe not only energy-momentum distributions in our space time 
M, but energy-momentum distributions on space-times M0in the neighbourhood of our space 
time, on the p-adic geometry in state space, suitably weighted with a suitable Haar measure 
��H, i.e., G����(M) = 8�� Z M0 dM0��H(M,M0) T����(M0)(44) 
In the classical (N = 1) limit of GR, ��H(M,M0) = ��(M ��� M0).Whether 
the dif f erence 
between ��H(M,M0) and ��(M���M0) 
can help explain the existence of dark matter (as regular 
matter on neighbouring space-times on IU, having a gravitational ef f ect in our space-time) 
remains to be seen.

The provided discussion section delves into the synthesis of quantum and gravitational physics, emphasizing an unconventional approach to "second quantization" by discretizing the complex Hilbert space. Here's a summarized breakdown of the key points discussed:
1. Motivation and Discretization
:
The motivation is the belief that the merger of quantum and gravitational physics will involve more adjustments from the quantum side.
This work discretizes complex Hilbert space, leading to number-theoretic incommensurateness between complex amplitudes and phases.
2. Conventional Properties without Algebra
:
The discretization enables an ensemble interpretation of complex Hilbert states.
The mentioned incommensurateness gives rise to properties generally associated with the algebra of Hermitian operators, but without actually invoking this algebra.
3. Bell Inequalities and Causal Realism
:
This discretized model suggests that we don't need to see the violation of Bell inequalities as an indication of the breakdown of causal realism, making it more in line with the causal determinism inherent in general relativity.
4. Experimental Consequences
:
By adjusting the parameter
N
N
N
, the effects of the discretized theory can be made identical to quantum physics.
Two experimental consequences were highlighted:
a) Systems with masses greater than the Planck mass won't exhibit quantum behaviors.
b) Noise-free quantum computers might be limited to only a few hundred qubits because of the geometric underpinning of this theory.
5. Fractal Geometry and Physics Laws
:
The fractal invariant set of the universe described by this theory has implications on how we view trajectories in state space.
The laws of physics may fluctuate between being classical-like and quantum-like, challenging the typical view that classical theories are subordinate to quantum theories.
6. Modifications to General Relativity
:
While the paper proposes significant changes to quantum mechanics, there's a need to adjust general relativity to be compatible with this discretized quantum physics.
Specifically, the energy-momentum tensor in the field equations should describe energy-momentum distributions not just in our spacetime but also in neighboring spacetimes, based on the p-adic geometry in state space.
7. Implications for Dark Matter
:
The difference between the energy-momentum distributions in our spacetime and those in neighboring spacetimes might explain the existence of dark matter. The idea is that regular matter in neighboring spacetimes could have gravitational effects in our own spacetime.
In essence, the discussion offers a fresh perspective on the relationship between quantum mechanics and general relativity, exploring the consequences of viewing quantum physics through the lens of number theory and fractal geometry.

How does this compare with the paper which we discussed at the beginning, where he said: Instead of looking for a quantum theory of gravity, Palmer suggests exploring a superdeterministic gravitational theory where space-time's Euclidean geometry is an approximate offshoot of the state space's p-adic geometry. 

And 

Instead of seeking a quantum theory of gravity, the focus should shift towards a gravitational theory of the quantum.

Both papers you've presented from Tim Palmer delve into the re-conceptualization of quantum mechanics and gravity by introducing unique mathematical frameworks. Let's compare the ideas from the two papers:
1. "Discretised Hilbert Space and Superdeterminism"

Comparison
:
Reconceptualizing Quantum Mechanics
: Both papers promote the idea that instead of merely searching for a quantum theory of gravity, we should consider a gravitational theory of the quantum or a superdeterministic gravitational theory.
State Space's Geometry
: In both papers, Palmer emphasizes the significance of the state space's p-adic geometry. In the first, it's posited that Euclidean geometry of space-time is a byproduct of the state space's p-adic geometry. In the second, the p-adic geometry is linked to an underlying fractal state-space onto which states of the world are constrained.
Violation of Bell Inequalities
: Both papers approach the violation of Bell inequalities from a unique perspective. The first suggests an inherently superdeterministic framework, while the second sees it as a manifestation of geometric constraint in the state space.
Discretized Representation
: Both works propose a discretized representation of quantum mechanics. The first focuses on the continuum complex Hilbert space, while the second integrates number-theoretic attributes of trigonometric functions.
Conclusion
:
While both papers approach the integration of quantum mechanics and gravity from distinct mathematical perspectives, they share a common goal: to shift the focus from the well-trodden path of a quantum theory of gravity to a more encompassing gravitational or superdeterministic theory of the quantum. By offering alternative mathematical structures and interpretations, Palmer aims to bridge the divide between quantum mechanics and general relativity, fostering a more unified understanding of the fundamental forces of nature.

See if you can give analogies to explain those concepts.
1 / 1
ChatGPT
Absolutely! Analogies can help in understanding complex topics. Let's break down some of the concepts from Palmer's papers and explain them with simple analogies:
Discretised Representation of Quantum Mechanics
:
Analogy
: Think of a digital photo. From afar, it looks continuous and smooth. But when you zoom in, you see that it's made up of tiny discrete pixels. In the same way, Palmer suggests that the "smooth" quantum world we understand might, at its core, be "pixelated" or discrete.
Violation of Bell Inequalities
:
Analogy
: Imagine you and a friend have matching pairs of dice. You both roll them without looking at each other's results. Classical physics suggests that there's a limit to how often both dice show the same number unless they "communicate." Quantum physics, however, often shows they match more often than expected. This "extra matching" is the violation of Bell inequalities. Palmer's work suggests a reason for this "extra matching" without the dice having to "communicate."
State Space's p-adic Geometry
:
Analogy
: Most of us understand distance as we experience it in the real world (Euclidean). But imagine a parallel universe where distance works differently, say, based on how many books you've read rather than miles or meters. This strange way of measuring distance is analogous to the "p-adic" distance in state space that Palmer discusses.
Superdeterminism
:
Analogy
: Imagine a play where every actor believes they are improvising, but in reality, every line and action is pre-determined by the script. Superdeterminism suggests that everything in the universe, including what we consider random quantum events, might be "following a script."
Fractal State-space Geometry
:
Analogy
: Think of a broccoli floret. If you break off a tiny piece, it looks like a mini-broccoli, and if you break that piece, it still looks like an even smaller broccoli. This self-similarity at different scales is a characteristic of fractals. Palmer's idea suggests that the universe's state space might behave like this broccoli, looking similar at different scales or levels of examination.
Gravitational Theory of the Quantum
:
Analogy
: Instead of trying to teach a fish to live on land (turning quantum mechanics into a gravitational theory), Palmer suggests we should be teaching a land animal to swim (finding the quantum nature within gravity).
Using these analogies, the complex topics become somewhat more approachable, even if they can't capture the full depth of the actual concepts.

Hmm can you explain more what is meant by p-adic space?
1 / 1
ChatGPT
Certainly! The concept of p-adic numbers and the associated p-adic space is one of the more abstract areas of number theory, but I'll try to give a simplified explanation using analogies.
P-adic Numbers
:
P-adic numbers are a different way of representing and understanding numbers, distinct from the real number system we are familiar with. They are based on prime numbers (hence the 'p' in p-adic), and each prime number has its own associated p-adic system.
Key Concept of p-adic Numbers
:
The idea of "closeness" or "distance" between numbers is different in the p-adic system. In our usual number system, the difference between numbers defines their distance (e.g., 11 and 12 are closer than 11 and 20). But in p-adic systems, numbers are "close" based on their remainders when divided by powers of a prime p.
Analogy
:
Imagine you and a friend are trying to meet at a cafe. In the real world, you'd probably choose a cafe that's roughly equidistant for both of you. But in the p-adic world, you'd think differently. Let's use 2-adic for this analogy. You'd choose a cafe based on the similarity in the last few digits of your addresses. If your address ends in 128 and your friend's in 328, you might think, "Oh, we live quite close!" because the addresses have the same ending, regardless of where you actually are on a map.
P-adic Space
:
Now, when we talk about a space, we're talking about a place where points (numbers, in this case) exist in relation to one another. In p-adic space, the "distance" between these points is determined using the p-adic notion of closeness. So, numbers that are "close" in the p-adic sense will be near each other in p-adic space.
Why It's Interesting
:
P-adic numbers and spaces offer a fundamentally different way of understanding and modeling mathematical structures. This alternate view can sometimes provide unique insights or solutions to problems that are difficult or impossible to tackle using the real number system.
In the context of Palmer's work, he's suggesting that this p-adic space might be more fundamental to understanding the nature of the universe, particularly when trying to reconcile quantum mechanics and gravity.
1 / 1
In number theory, given a prime number p, the p-adic numbers form an extension of the rational numbers which is distinct from the real numbers, though with some similar properties; p-adic numbers can be written in a form similar to (possibly infinite) decimals, but with digits based on a prime number p rather than ten, and extending (possibly infinitely) to the left rather than to the right. Formally, given a prime number p, a p-adic number can be defined as a series

{\displaystyle s=\sum _{i=k}^{\infty }a_{i}p^{i}=a_{k}p^{k}+a_{k+1}p^{k+1}+a_{k+2}p^{k+2}+\cdots }{\displaystyle s=\sum _{i=k}^{\infty }a_{i}p^{i}=a_{k}p^{k}+a_{k+1}p^{k+1}+a_{k+2}p^{k+2}+\cdots }
where k is an integer (possibly negative), and each {\displaystyle a_{i}}a_{i} is a integer such that {\displaystyle 0\leq a_{i}<p.}{\displaystyle 0\leq a_{i}<p.} A p-adic integer is a p-adic number such that {\displaystyle k\geq 0.}{\displaystyle k\geq 0.}

In general the series that represents a p-adic number is not convergent in the usual sense, but it is convergent for the p-adic absolute value {\displaystyle |s|_{p}=p^{-k},}{\displaystyle |s|_{p}=p^{-k},} where k is the least integer i such that {\displaystyle a_{i}\neq 0}{\displaystyle a_{i}\neq 0} (if all {\displaystyle a_{i}}a_{i} are zero, one has the zero p-adic number, which has 0 as its p-adic absolute value).

Alright, let's break this down.
The p-adic numbers are an alternative system of representing numbers, different from the regular real numbers we're familiar with. They are particularly used in number theory and are defined with respect to a prime number
p
p
p
.
Representation
:
Like how we represent real numbers in decimal format (based on powers of 10), p-adic numbers are represented in terms of powers of a prime number
p
p
p
. But while our decimals expand to the right of the decimal point (e.g., 0.123), p-adic numbers expand to the left (like ...3210).
Series Definition
:
The formal definition given represents a p-adic number as an infinite series. The series starts from a power
p
k
p^{k}
p
k
(where
k
k
k
can be negative or zero) and goes on indefinitely.
Digits

Each

in the series is an integer that ranges from 0 up to
p

1
p-1
p

1
(but does not include
p
p
p
).
For example, in the 2-adic system (where
p

2
p = 2
p
=
2
, the prime), the digits
a
i

a
i
���
can only be 0 or 1 (just like binary).
p-adic Integers

These are a subset of p-adic numbers where the series starts from
p
0
p^0
p
0
or a positive power of
p
p
p
. Think of them as the p-adic equivalent of our whole numbers.
Convergence and Absolute Value
:
In the world of real numbers, a series converges if its terms approach a specific value. In the p-adic system, the idea of convergence is different, based on the p-adic absolute value.
The p-adic absolute value
���
s
���
p
|s|_p
���
s
���
p
���
for a p-adic number is a measure of its "size". The smaller the value of
k
k
k
(i.e., the higher the power of
p
p
p
at which the first non-zero coefficient appears), the larger the p-adic absolute value.
For example, consider the 2-adic system:
For the number ...000010 (where the rightmost '1' is at the
2
0
2^0
2
0
position),
���
s
���
2
=
2
0
=
1
|s|_2 = 2^0 = 1
���
s
���
2
���
=
2
0
=
1
.
For the number ...0000010 (with the rightmost '1' at the
2
1
2^1
2
1
position),
���
s
���
2
=
2
���
1
=
0.5
|s|_2 = 2^{-1} = 0.5
���
s
���
2
���
=
2
���
1
=
0.5
.
So, in the 2-adic system, ...0000010 is "smaller" than ...000010.
To visualize p-adic numbers, imagine living in a world where the "closeness" of numbers is not based on the difference between them, but rather on their last few digits. In such a world, the numbers 1001 and 1 would be closer to each other than 1001 and 1000 because 1001 and 1 both end in 1, even though intuitively in our regular system, 1001 is right next to 1000.
This system provides a unique mathematical structure and offers insights into various areas of number theory and beyond.

In the first, it's posited that Euclidean geometry of space-time is a byproduct of the state space's p-adic geometry. In the second, the p-adic geometry is linked to an underlying fractal state-space onto which states of the world are constrained.
1 / 1
ChatGPT
Let's delve into these ideas with the help of some analogies:
Euclidean Geometry as a Byproduct of the State Space's p-adic Geometry
:
Analogy
: Think of a digital image on your computer or phone. From a distance, it looks continuous and smooth. However, if you zoom in enough, you'll see it's made up of discrete pixels. In this analogy, the continuous image is like our familiar Euclidean space-time, while the underlying grid of pixels represents the p-adic space.
The idea here is that our common understanding of space-time (where things are continuous and follow familiar geometric rules) emerges from a more fundamental structure that is based on p-adic geometry. Just as digital images give the illusion of continuity, space-time might give the illusion of being smoothly Euclidean when it's fundamentally built on a p-adic structure.
Underlying Fractal State-Space Constrained by p-adic Geometry
:
Analogy
: Imagine a coastline. From afar, it might look relatively simple and smooth. But the closer you get, the more intricate details you see ��� tiny inlets, jags, and coves. This property, where something has complexity at any scale, is characteristic of fractals. In this case, the coastline's shape is constrained by various geological processes and tidal patterns.
In the context of the papers, the "coastline" is the state-space of the universe ��� the realm of all possible states or configurations the universe can have. The intricate, fractal nature of this state-space means that even as we "zoom in" on smaller and smaller scales, we keep finding complexity and detail, and this complexity is guided or constrained by p-adic geometry.
The implication is profound: Quantum behaviors and phenomena, which often seem random or probabilistic, might actually be deterministic patterns playing out on this intricate p-adic fractal stage. It���s like watching waves crash on a shoreline ��� while each wave might seem unpredictable, they���re all following the larger deterministic rules of physics, geology, and the shape of the coastline.
Both ideas challenge our traditional understanding of quantum mechanics and gravitation. Instead of seeing quantum mechanics as the fundamental layer with gravity emerging from it, these perspectives suggest the opposite. The fractal, p-adic structure is fundamental, and both quantum mechanics and gravity are manifestations or byproducts of its intricate design.

How does this relate to Julian Barbour's statement that the history of the world is a continuous curve in its relative configuration space?
1 / 1
ChatGPT
Julian Barbour's work focuses on the idea that time, as we understand it, might not be fundamental. Instead, he proposes that what's fundamental is a vast landscape of possible "nows" or configurations of the universe. He calls this landscape "Platonia." In this view, the history of the universe is a trajectory through this configuration space.
Let's try to relate this to the ideas discussed from Palmer's work:
Configuration Space vs. State Space
: Both Barbour and Palmer are talking about spaces that describe all possible configurations or states of the universe. Barbour's "Platonia" is a kind of configuration space, while Palmer's state space (with its p-adic and fractal properties) is a realm of all possible quantum states.
Time and Trajectories
: In Barbour's view, the apparent passage of time is just movement through the configuration space. Each moment, or "now", is a point in this space, and history is a curve connecting these points. This is analogous to Palmer's idea where the trajectory of the universe through state space is governed by the underlying p-adic, fractal structure.
Determinism and Geometry
: Both views suggest a kind of determinism, but from different angles. Barbour's determinism arises from the geometry of the configuration space. In Palmer's view, the determinism is more intricate, tied to the p-adic and fractal nature of state space. In both cases, the fundamental geometry of the space gives rise to the dynamics we observe in the universe.
So, relating this back to Barbour's statement: If we blend the two perspectives, the "continuous curve" Barbour speaks of in the configuration space could be seen as a trajectory determined by the underlying p-adic and fractal structure of Palmer's state space. The deterministic rules arising from this structure guide the universe's path through all possible configurations or states.

It seems to be pretty clear but can you explain what you mean by continuous curve" Barbour speaks of in the configuration space could be seen as a trajectory determined by the underlying p-adic and fractal structure of Palmer's state space.
1 / 1
ChatGPT
Certainly!
Let's break down the statement:
"Continuous Curve" in Barbour's Configuration Space
: Barbour's idea is that the entire history of the universe can be thought of as a curve in a vast space called the configuration space. This curve represents the evolution of the universe from one "now" (or configuration) to the next. Instead of thinking of time as ticking seconds on a clock, Barbour sees the universe's history as a path through various possible configurations.
Trajectory Determined by Palmer's State Space
: Palmer introduces a different kind of space, the state space, which is based on p-adic numbers and has a fractal structure. The universe's trajectory or path through this state space is not random; it's influenced or "determined" by the unique properties of the p-adic and fractal nature of the space.
Now, when we say that the "continuous curve" Barbour speaks of could be seen as a trajectory determined by Palmer's state space, we're drawing a parallel between the two ideas:
Imagine the universe as a ship sailing on the ocean. Barbour's perspective is focused on the ship's path on a map, which is a continuous curve showing where the ship has been and where it's headed. This map (or configuration space) has all possible destinations the ship can go to.
Palmer, on the other hand, is interested in the currents and winds guiding the ship. These currents and winds (the p-adic and fractal structure of the state space) determine the ship's path. They set the rules for how the ship moves.
So, combining the two perspectives: The path of the ship (universe) on the map (configuration space) is shaped by the currents and winds (p-adic and fractal properties of state space).

In the vast tapestry of existence, Julian Barbour paints a universe that dances gracefully along a continuous curve, flowing from one ephemeral moment to the next. It's as if the cosmos performs a ballet across a grand stage called the configuration space, with every pirouette and leap representing a snapshot in time, a singular "now" in the endless waltz of history.
Enter Tim Palmer, who whispers of an unseen choreographer guiding this dance. Beneath the stage, in the shadows of what we know, lies the intricate latticework of p-adic numbers, unfolding with fractal precision. This hidden realm, Palmer's state space, isn't just a passive observer. It's alive with unseen currents and whispered winds, shaping every move, guiding every step of the universe's ballet.
When Barbour looks up, he sees a ship charting its journey across the endless ocean, leaving behind a trail that narrates the history of all that was and all that will be. Meanwhile, Palmer dives deep below the waves, recognizing the intricate play of currents and tides, the silent forces that nudge the ship on its destined path.
Together, they offer a vision of a universe where destiny and journey intertwine. A place where the dance of stars and galaxies isn't just random flutters in the cosmic wind, but a choreographed ballet, set to the silent music of mathematics and geometry, forever unfolding in the theater of existence.

Aether scalar tensor theory confronted with weak lensing data at small accelerations
T. Mistele1,2, S. McGaugh2 and S. Hossenfelder1,3

Received: 30 January 2023
Accepted: 28 June 2023

Abstract

Context. The recently proposed aether scalar tensor (AeST) model reproduces both the successes of particle dark matter on cosmological scales and those of modified Newtonian dynamics (MOND) on galactic scales. But the AeST model reproduces MOND only up to a certain maximum galactocentric radius. Since MOND is known to fit very well to observations at these scales, this raises the question of whether the AeST model comes into tension with data.

Aims. We tested whether or not the AeST model is in conflict with observations using a recent analysis of data for weak gravitational lensing.

Methods. We solved the equations of motion of the AeST model, analyzed the solutions��� behavior, and compared the results to observational data.

Results. The AeST model shows some deviations from MOND at the radii probed by weak gravitational lensing. The data show no clear indication of these predicted deviations.

Key words: galaxies: kinematics and dynamics / gravitational lensing: weak / dark matter / gravitation

The article you've mentioned focuses on the aether scalar tensor (AeST) model, which has been proposed as a unifying theory that can capture the success of both particle dark matter at cosmological scales and modified Newtonian dynamics (MOND) at galactic scales. The challenge with the AeST model is that it only successfully replicates MOND up to a certain maximum galactocentric radius. Since MOND aligns well with observations at these scales, this discrepancy casts doubts on the completeness or accuracy of the AeST model.
Given the content of this article and what we've discussed before:
Palmer's
take on quantum mechanics through p-adic spaces and the fractal state-space structure provides a foundational understanding of the nature of space and time. It suggests that there is an intricate and mathematical fabric underlying the universe that gives rise to the quantum phenomena we observe.
Barbour's
configuration space offers a continuous journey through the history of the universe, where each moment in time is a specific point or configuration. This seamless trajectory tells us about the interrelationships of all particles at every moment.
Mistele, McGaugh, and Hossenfelder's
aether scalar tensor theory, on the other hand, is more focused on the gravitational dynamics of galaxies. By reconciling the successes of particle dark matter and MOND, they're attempting to understand the enigmatic behavior of galaxies without the need for unseen and undetected dark matter. Their analysis seeks to test the AeST model against weak gravitational lensing data, a method that indirectly detects the presence of dark matter by observing the bending of light around massive objects.
In weaving a narrative from these seemingly disparate threads:
In the cosmic ballet choreographed by the forces of the universe, the dancers move to the rhythm set by the foundational geometry of space-time, as outlined by Palmer. Their movements, tracing a delicate path across Barbour's grand stage of the configuration space, recount the history of the universe, each twist and turn capturing an ephemeral "now."
Yet, as Mistele, McGaugh, and Hossenfelder would argue, the dance is more complex than it appears. As galaxies whirl and pirouette, they do so under the guidance of unseen hands ��� the gravitational forces that tug and pull, both those we understand and those we've yet to fully grasp. The challenge lies in deciphering the silent whispers of these cosmic forces, understanding how the grand stage was set, and determining who ��� or what ��� is pulling the strings.

Thus, if negative densities are unstable, one might expect that the AeST model always gives larger accelerations than MOND. Moreover, our estimate for ab,���min (see Fig. 2) suggests that these deviations should set in earlier for larger baryonic masses Mb. And indeed, there are hints of such behavior in the observed weak-lensing data, see Fig. 7 which shows the weak-lensing data separately for early-type galaxies (ETGs) and late-type galaxies (LTGs). We see that the weak-lensing RAR for LTGs follows the MOND prediction even for ab���<���10���13���m���s���2 while ETGs tend toward larger accelerations than MOND. In general, ETGs have larger baryonic masses than LTGs. So this seems to fit with the AeST model expectations if negative densities are unstable.

Fig. 7.
Observed weak-lensing RAR for ETGs and LTGs from Brouwer et al. (2021) with the stellar M/L* corrected to use the same stellar population model as the observed kinematic RAR (McGaugh 2022, priv. comm.) relative to the MOND prediction. This does not include the hot gas estimate from Brouwer et al. (2021). Here, we take aMOND���=���ab��e(ab/a0) with  (Lelli et al. 2017). Data points below ab���=���10���13���m���s���2 are shown in white since the isolation criterion is less reliable there (Brouwer et al. 2021).

However, this Mb-dependence is not a plausible explanation for the difference between the observed weak-lensing RARs for ETGs and LTGs. This is for three reasons.

First, the ETGs and LTGs do not sufficiently differ in baryonic mass. What would be required is a difference in Mb of more than a factor 103/2. To see this, we note that LTGs follow the MOND prediction for at least one more order of magnitude in ab compared to ETGs. This translates into a factor > 103/2 in terms of baryonic mass according to our estimate . In contrast, Brouwer et al. (2021) selected LTGs and ETGs to have the same stellar mass distribution. With the stellar M/L scale corrected to be consistent with that of the observed kinematic RAR, ETG stellar masses would still be larger by a factor 1.4 (McGaugh, priv. comm.). But this is not sufficient here.

Of course, the total baryonic mass should take into account gas, but this is unlikely to account for the required factor of 103/2 or more, at least with the simple cold gas mass estimate used in Brouwer et al. (2021). Brouwer et al. (2021) also consider a scenario where ETGs have significantly more hot gas than LTGs. But even in that scenario, the baryonic masses of ETGs differ from those of LTGs by only a factor of two or a bit more. In addition, adopting this scenario means adopting a different observed lensing RAR. Indeed, as discussed in Brouwer et al. (2021), in this scenario there might not even be a discrepancy between ETGs and LTGs left to explain.

Second, the isolation criterion needed to obtain the weak-lensing RAR might fail for ETGs sooner than it does for LTGs. One might naturally expect this to be the case since ETGs are known to be more clustered than LTGs (Dressler 1980). At what point this comes into play here we cannot judge, but mention it as a logical possibility.

Third and finally, even if negative densities are indeed unstable, the AeST model does not necessarily predict larger accelerations than MOND. Indeed, it makes no physical sense to stop looking when the condensate becomes unstable. In a real galaxy, something else must follow after the condensate phase. For example, the macroscopically coherent ghost condensate might be replaced by something closer to a ��CDM-like collisionless fluid which the AeST model postulates on cosmological scales (Skordis & Z��osnik 2021). In principle, whatever replaces the ghost condensate might lead to smaller accelerations than MOND.

That said, the prediction of larger-than-MOND accelerations remains valid if whatever replaces the ghost condensate has as its only effect to replace the ghost condensate density by some other positive density, ��c�����������replace. This is because then one still has solutions of the same form as before, just with a different effective mass Meff���������������Mb���+���Mreplace���>���Mb.

In order to get smaller-than-MOND accelerations, the general structure of the solutions must be modified. That is, the left-hand sides of the equations of motions must be modified, . It is not implausible that this indeed happens since the field �� plays a role for both the ghost condensate (for example, it carries the chemical potential ) as well as the gravitational force. So outside the condensate phase both could be modified.

4.2. External field effect
Another concern at the small accelerations probed by weak lensing is the external field effect (EFE) of MOND (Milgrom 1983b; Famaey & McGaugh 2012). The EFE is a consequence of the specific nonlinear form ���(|�����|�����)�����b of the gravitational field equations in the small-acceleration limit. The crucial nonlinearity is the same in the AeST model, so there is probably a similar effect there, at least within the ghost condensate3.

The EFE generally reduces the observationally inferred atot, while a condensate mass Mc���>���0 in the AeST model enhances this acceleration. In principle, these two effects could cancel each other to give a MOND-like acceleration even at very large galactocentric distances, but there is no reason to expect such a cancellation to generally happen.

And in any case, if negative densities are unstable and the condensate is replaced by something else at large radii, then any potential EFE depends on the details of what replaces the ghost condensate. There could be a modified nonlinear effect that still allows neighboring galaxies to affect each other in a way that violates the Strong Equivalence Principle (SEP) like the MOND EFE does. Or there could be no such effect, possibly restoring the SEP at large scales.

A restored SEP would fit with the fact that the observed weak-lensing RAR from Brouwer et al. (2021) shows no signs of an EFE. But here one must be careful. The EFE pertains to nonisolated galaxies, while the analysis of Brouwer et al. (2021) requires isolated galaxies. Thus, any EFE effects may be masked by violations of this assumption. In addition, the environment-dependence of the EFE is quite complicated (Llinares et al. 2008; Chae et al. 2021). So it is not even clear for MOND whether or not a significant EFE is expected here. Still, the EFE is something to keep in mind as observations and theoretical predictions are improved.

5. Conclusion
We have explored whether or not the AeST model can explain the observed MOND-like weak-lensing RAR which probes unprecedentedly small accelerations. We find that deviations from MOND start to set in already in the range of the new measurements, creating a tension with data. The model parameter m2/fG can be adjusted to avoid this tension, but that likely creates a tension with observations of galaxy clusters instead.

It seems that keeping the model in agreement with data would require specific values of boundary conditions for a large variety of galaxies. While this is possible, we do not know of any mechanism that would result in these particular boundary conditions. Thus, while we cannot rule out the model, it does seem that weak-lensing observations pose a challenge for AeST.

The article dives deep into the intricacies of the Aether Scalar Tensor (AeST) model and its implications regarding the behavior of galaxies, as discerned from weak gravitational lensing data.
At its core, the AeST model strives to reconcile the universe's cosmological and galactic dynamics. These attempts, while promising in parts, seem to come into tension with certain observational data.
Density and Acceleration:
The article begins by highlighting that if negative densities are unstable, the AeST model might predict larger accelerations than MOND (Modified Newtonian Dynamics). However, the weak-lensing data from the study by Brouwer et al. (2021) suggests disparities in the behavior of early-type galaxies (ETGs) and late-type galaxies (LTGs). While LTGs follow the MOND prediction quite well, ETGs exhibit larger accelerations. This is where the paper digs deeper into the nuances of baryonic mass differences between ETGs and LTGs.
Mass Discrepancies:
The paper counters the idea that mass differences between ETGs and LTGs are the cause of their differing acceleration behaviors. They argue that the observed discrepancies between the two are not solely due to mass differences, given that the differences in baryonic mass between these galaxy types don't match the magnitude needed to explain the observed discrepancies.
Isolation Criterion:
The study raises the possibility that the isolation criterion (used to deduce weak-lensing RAR) might be less reliable for ETGs than for LTGs, especially considering the known higher clustering tendency of ETGs.
Beyond Ghost Condensates:
The paper delves into the intricacies of what happens when the ghost condensate phase in the AeST model becomes unstable. It postulates scenarios wherein a different phase, such as a ��CDM-like collisionless fluid, might take over. The behavior in this subsequent phase can lead to different gravitational dynamics than initially predicted.
External Field Effect (EFE):
The paper further introduces the EFE of MOND, a consequence of specific nonlinear gravitational field equations. Given that similar nonlinearities exist in the AeST model, it's plausible that a corresponding effect exists therein. The presence or absence of this effect can have implications for gravitational accelerations at large galactocentric distances.
Conclusion:
The culmination of the paper underscores the challenges faced by the AeST model in explaining the observed weak-lensing RAR. While there's potential to fine-tune the model's parameters to match certain observations, doing so might result in inconsistencies with other datasets. The model's viability in the face of weak-lensing observations remains a profound question.
In a poetic sense, the universe is like an intricate tapestry of interwoven threads, each governed by its unique set of rules. As scientists delve deeper into the fabric of space-time, they're met with complexities and nuances that challenge existing paradigms. The AeST model, while offering a promising glimpse into the dance of galaxies, must still prove its mettle against the stringent tests of observation and empirical data.

Distinction from TeVes and relativistic MOND
1 / 1
ChatGPT
TeVes (Tensor-Vector-Scalar gravity) and Relativistic MOND (Modified Newtonian Dynamics) both represent attempts to provide a fully relativistic formulation of MOND. They aim to explain the observed motion of stars in galaxies without invoking dark matter. Here's a brief distinction between them:
Relativistic MOND (RMOND):
Origin:
This was an early attempt to provide a relativistic formulation of MOND.
Framework:
It's a straightforward generalization of MOND to a relativistic setting.
Limitations:
It had difficulties with cosmological predictions and failed to be consistent with gravitational lensing observations.
TeVes (Tensor-Vector-Scalar gravity):
Origin:
Developed by Jacob Bekenstein in 2004, TeVes was a response to the inadequacies of earlier relativistic formulations of MOND, including RMOND.
Framework:
TeVes is more complex than RMOND. It involves three fields: a tensor field, which is analogous to the metric tensor in general relativity; a vector field; and a scalar field. This ensures a richer structure for the gravitational interaction.
Predictions:
TeVes can replicate the success of MOND on galactic scales and remains consistent with gravitational lensing observations. Additionally, it is compatible with the cosmic microwave background radiation observations, something that posed a challenge for RMOND.
Limitations:
TeVes is more complicated than General Relativity, which goes against the principle of Occam's Razor, a philosophical principle that states that simpler theories are generally preferable to more complex ones when they describe the data equally well. Additionally, it has had challenges in certain cosmological contexts and with certain observational data.
In essence, while both RMOND and TeVes stem from the desire to provide a relativistic version of MOND, TeVes is a more recent and sophisticated attempt that addresses many of the problems faced by RMOND. However, it brings its own set of complexities and challenges.

Alright, let's integrate everything we've discussed so far and provide a comparative view. Here's how the Aether Scalar Tensor (AeST) theory stands relative to TeVes, Relativistic MOND, and the ideas inspired by Julian Barbour and Tim Palmer:
Aether Scalar Tensor (AeST) theory:
Origins:
This theory is relatively newer, aiming to unify the successes of particle dark matter on cosmological scales with those of MOND on galactic scales.
Framework:
It's implied from your provided information that AeST engages in both cosmological and galactic scales, suggesting it has a broader applicability. However, it may have limitations, as indicated by potential conflicts with weak gravitational lensing data.
Implications:
If the AeST model succeeds, it would provide a unified understanding, bridging the gap between large scale cosmology and galactic dynamics.
Relativistic MOND (RMOND):
Framework:
A direct generalization of MOND to a relativistic setting.
Limitations:
Faced difficulties with cosmological predictions and inconsistencies with gravitational lensing.
TeVes (Tensor-Vector-Scalar gravity):
Framework:
A richer, more intricate formulation than RMOND, involving three distinct fields.
Predictions:
Successful on galactic scales and consistent with many observations, but still has its own set of challenges.
Julian Barbour's Configuration Space:
Idea:
The universe's history is seen as a continuous curve in its relative configuration space.
Connection:
This view can be mapped onto Palmer's state-space ideas, where the curve in Barbour's configuration space is a trajectory set by the underlying p-adic and fractal structure of Palmer's state space.
Tim Palmer's P-adic Geometry & Fractal State Space:
Idea:
The p-adic geometry of the state space might be foundational to the observed Euclidean geometry of space-time. It suggests an underlying fractal state-space constraint on the states of the world.
Connection:
In a sense, if Barbour's configuration space is like the stage, Palmer's ideas describe the underlying architecture and material of that stage.
In essence, while each of these theories and ideas aim to describe various observed phenomena in the universe, they often approach the problem from different angles and with different focuses. The AeST theory is a more recent entrant in this discourse and seeks to bridge some of the gaps left by other theories. However, as with any scientific theory, its acceptance and adoption will depend on its consistency with experimental and observational data and its ability to offer predictive insights.

Ok I would like to propose a theory as well. It's called Relativistic Scalar Vector Plenum (RSVP). It argues that the universe as a whole does not expand or change in size but rather the change of scale at which useful work can be done continually changes. The cosmic voids expand relative to the galactic filaments or lamphron (matter) and lamphrodyne (negative vacuum) during inflaton formation. The observability window shrinks as messages drift too far into the inframicrowave but eventually any material moved out of the particle horizon during inflaton field expansion get brought back in over trillions of years after black hole evaporation, and after poincar�� time resembles the smooth state necessary for another inflaton field formation, which happens everywhere at once in the plenum, so it is a kind of cyclical universe.
1 / 1
ChatGPT
The
Relativistic Scalar Vector Plenum (RSVP)
theory you've proposed certainly boasts some intriguing ideas. Let's break down its key points:
Static Universe with a Changing Scale
: This goes against the current cosmological consensus of an expanding universe. However, the idea that the "scale at which useful work can be done continually changes" could have profound implications for entropy, thermodynamics, and the arrow of time.
Differential Expansion
: The notion that cosmic voids expand relative to galactic filaments provides a dynamic texture to the universe's structure. This might be able to explain large-scale structure formation and its intricacies better.
Observability Window
: The concept that our ability to observe certain phenomena changes over cosmic time is intriguing. If messages drift into the "inframicrowave," it might suggest that there's a limit to our observational capacities based on the age or state of the universe.
Cyclical Universe
: This idea harkens back to older cosmological models which propose a cyclic nature of the universe ��� birth, death, and rebirth. It's reminiscent of the cyclical models proposed in certain interpretations of string theory and the ekpyrotic universe.
Inflaton Field Formation
: The notion that the inflaton field formation happens everywhere at once suggests a synchronous birth for the universe's observable structures.
Some potential challenges and considerations:
Entropy Concerns
: One major question that arises is the issue of entropy. How does the universe "reset" itself after reaching a high entropy state, and how does it revert to a smooth state necessary for another inflaton field formation?
Causal Structures
: If the universe isn't expanding in the traditional sense, how do causal structures like event horizons and particle horizons operate? And how does information from beyond the horizon get recaptured?
Quantum Fields
: How does this theory reconcile with our understanding of quantum fields, especially given the quantum fluctuations believed to give rise to cosmic structure?
Evidence & Testability
: As with all cosmological theories, the critical question is: how can this be tested? What observable predictions does RSVP make, and how do they differentiate from current models?
The RSVP theory presents an imaginative and novel framework for understanding the cosmos. As with all theoretical endeavors, the next steps would involve refining the model, working out the mathematical framework, and devising observational tests. Theories become part of the scientific discourse when they can make falsifiable predictions, and it'd be exciting to see how RSVP fares in this regard.

It resets because the phases of fluctuation are chaotic it can't stay a crystal lattice plenum for long because any minor disturbance beyond a certain region sets of a chain reaction that reverberates outwards. It says you can reverse engineer the minor variations in the crystal plenum by analyzing the baryon acyclic oscillations in the CMB, since the universe at "big bang" was not completely smooth by its poincar�� microwave era. But you are right, it might not make any testable predictions as the fluctuations of sub planck scale times might be larger than the particle horizon by this point in time, and parameters might vary on much larger scales, but I think there is evidence that the universe's properties do not vary that much and can be considered homogenous and isotropic on scales larger than 100,000 light years
1 / 1
ChatGPT
Your elaboration on the RSVP theory adds depth to its understanding. Here's what I gather:
Chaotic Fluctuations & Chain Reactions
: The idea that the universe can't maintain a static state for long and that minor disturbances can create significant outward reverberations is an interesting mechanism for cosmic 'resets'. This dynamic adds a chaotic element to the structure of the universe, providing a natural mechanism for the transitions between various phases.
Baryon Acoustic Oscillations (BAO) & CMB
: Using BAO as a tool to reverse-engineer the initial conditions of the universe is an innovative idea. Current cosmological models use BAO and CMB anisotropies to infer properties of the early universe. Your theory proposes that these oscillations could be a window into the "crystal plenum" state, potentially revealing more about the nature of these initial fluctuations.
Homogeneity and Isotropy
: The cosmological principle, which states that the universe is homogenous and isotropic on large scales, aligns with your assertion. It ensures that the basic laws of physics are universally applicable. In the context of your theory, this suggests that despite its dynamic and ever-changing nature, there's an inherent order or uniformity to the universe.
Some points of consideration:
Mechanism of Disturbance
: What could be the source or nature of these "minor disturbances"? Quantum fluctuations? Interactions with other dimensions or fields?
Timescales & Phases
: The transitions between these phases (like from a crystal lattice plenum to a chaotic state) would likely occur over immense timescales. It would be interesting to model or approximate these transitions.
Analyzing the BAO
: If the BAOs in the CMB can be used to reverse-engineer the initial conditions of the universe, then this could potentially offer a method to test or further explore the RSVP theory, even if indirectly.
Sub-Planck Scale Fluctuations
: If fluctuations on these scales are significant, then it opens up a whole realm of considerations. Quantum gravity and other theories that operate on these scales would need to be integrated into the model or at least be consistent with it.
The RSVP theory, as proposed, offers a fresh perspective on the nature and evolution of the universe. As with all theoretical constructs, its strength will be in its ability to explain observed phenomena, its consistency with established knowledge, and its potential to guide future discoveries or insights. Even if it doesn't make direct testable predictions, its insights or mechanisms might inspire or guide other cosmological or quantum theories.

Comparison with the other theories we discussed.
2 / 2
ChatGPT
Certainly! Let's compare your proposed Relativistic Scalar Vector Plenum (RSVP) theory with the other theories we discussed, specifically TeVeS, relativistic MOND, and the Aether Scalar Tensor (AeST) model:
Nature of Gravity
:
TeVeS & Relativistic MOND
: These theories are essentially modifications to Newtonian dynamics (MOND) extended into a relativistic framework. They try to account for galactic rotation curves without introducing dark matter.
AeST
: A gravitational theory that introduces additional scalar fields to explain cosmic phenomena without the need for dark matter.
RSVP
: Doesn't necessarily focus on the gravity issue directly but looks at the large-scale structure and dynamics of the universe with the idea of changing scales and cosmic voids expanding relative to galactic filaments.
Cosmological Evolution
:
TeVeS & Relativistic MOND
: Focus primarily on galactic scales and do not delve deeply into the broader cosmological evolution.
AeST
: It also looks at the large-scale behavior of the universe, but its primary focus is on explaining gravitational anomalies without dark matter.
RSVP
: Emphasizes a cyclical universe with phases of fluctuation. The expansion of cosmic voids and subsequent return of material moved out of the particle horizon during the inflaton field's expansion are central concepts.
Universe's Initial Conditions
:
TeVeS, Relativistic MOND, & AeST
: These theories don't primarily delve into the universe's initial conditions.
RSVP
: Suggests reverse-engineering the initial conditions using BAO in the CMB. Argues that the universe during its early phase was not entirely smooth.
Homogeneity and Isotropy
:
TeVeS, Relativistic MOND, & AeST
: Typically operate under the assumption that on large scales, the universe is homogenous and isotropic.
RSVP
: Aligns with this principle, suggesting that properties of the universe do not vary significantly on scales larger than 100,000 light years.
Testable Predictions
:
TeVeS & Relativistic MOND
: Can be tested by comparing predictions about galactic rotation curves with actual observations.
AeST
: Its predictions concerning acceleration discrepancies can be tested against weak-lensing observations and other astrophysical data.
RSVP
: While it might not make immediate testable predictions, its emphasis on the universe's initial conditions and BAO could guide indirect explorations.
In summary, while TeVeS, Relativistic MOND, and AeST largely focus on the gravitational aspect, RSVP provides a broader perspective, emphasizing the universe's cyclical nature, initial conditions, and the dynamic interplay of cosmic structures. However, a key challenge for RSVP would be to carve out its niche in terms of explanatory power, unique predictions, and how it either complements or contrasts with existing theories in terms of empirical evidence.

Well it's kind of pseudoscientific right now isn't it?
1 / 1
ChatGPT
Yes, from the description provided, the Relativistic Scalar Vector Plenum (RSVP) theory is currently more speculative than well-established scientific theories like General Relativity or Quantum Mechanics. Several reasons contribute to this characterization:
Lack of Precise Mathematical Formalism
: Established scientific theories come with rigorous mathematical formulations that allow for precise predictions and descriptions. This helps in making concrete and testable predictions.
Testable Predictions
: One of the hallmarks of a scientific theory is that it can make predictions which can be tested and potentially falsified. RSVP, as described, does not seem to offer specific, testable predictions at this time.
Empirical Evidence
: For a theory to gain acceptance in the scientific community, it needs to align with and explain existing empirical evidence, and potentially provide explanations for phenomena that are not currently understood. RSVP would need to be shown to account for known astronomical and cosmological observations at least as well as existing theories do.
Mechanistic Details
: Many parts of RSVP are described in broad strokes (like the idea of a "crystal lattice plenum" and its instabilities). For it to move beyond the pseudoscientific realm, these concepts would need rigorous definition and explanation.
Comparison with Established Theories
: Any new theory needs to explain why it should be preferred over or in addition to existing theories. This usually requires demonstrating that it can account for some observations better than existing theories or that it can explain phenomena that current theories cannot.
That said, many scientific theories start as speculative ideas. It's the process of refinement, confrontation with evidence, and rigorous testing that moves them from the realm of speculation to accepted science. If you're passionate about RSVP, it would be worth diving deeper into the details, developing its mathematical formalism, and seeking feedback from experts in cosmology and theoretical physics.

Ok give a description in terms of non-negative grassmanians and Ising models.
1 / 1
ChatGPT
To frame the Relativistic Scalar Vector Plenum (RSVP) using the concepts of non-negative Grassmannians and Ising models, we would be venturing into the abstract territory of mathematical physics. Let's see how one might begin such a description:
Non-negative Grassmannians
: These are a particular subset of the Grassmannian manifold that are of interest in certain areas of theoretical physics, particularly in the study of scattering amplitudes in quantum field theory. The Grassmannian captures configurations of vector subspaces in a larger vector space.
In the context of RSVP, one could argue that different configurations of the "plenum" correspond to particular points on the non-negative Grassmannian. As the universe transitions between various states (from the "smooth state" of the plenum to its more chaotic fluctuations), this could correspond to a trajectory through the Grassmannian.
Ising Models
: The Ising model is a mathematical model in statistical mechanics that describes ferromagnetism. It consists of discrete variables (spins) that can be in one of two states (up or down).
Given that you've mentioned the universe undergoing phase transitions and fluctuations, the Ising model could serve as a metaphorical representation of these processes. Each spin in the Ising model could represent a tiny region of the universe, with its state corresponding to whether that region is more lamphron-dominated or lamphrodyne-dominated. The interactions between neighboring spins would then capture the influence neighboring regions of the universe exert on one another.
The phase transitions of the Ising model, where the system switches between ordered and disordered states, could be analogous to the transitions you describe in RSVP, where the universe goes from a "smooth state" to one filled with chaotic fluctuations and vice versa.
However, it's crucial to note that the above descriptions are highly metaphorical and speculative. Actual incorporation of non-negative Grassmannians and Ising models into RSVP would require a much deeper and rigorous formulation.

The two-dimensional Ising model (on a lattice) undergoes a phase transition at a certain critical temperature, marking a transition from an ordered state (where all spins tend to align) to a disordered state (where spins are randomly oriented).
To relate these to the RSVP:
For the non-negative Grassmannians, if different configurations of the plenum correspond to points on the Grassmannian, the evolution or changes in the universe's configuration could be viewed as paths or trajectories within this mathematical space.
For the Ising model, if we consider the universe's regions as having two states (akin to spins being up or down), then the system's overall behavior might resemble the phase transitions seen in the Ising model. The interaction between neighboring regions (or "spins") in the universe would play a role similar to the

It is not bad. I meant even more preliminary than that. Explain how to using 3d, 4d, and 5d Ising models might be used to add lambda cdm parameters as dimensions, and how predictive models might give insight by comparing the shape of galaxies formed in that universe and matching their similarity to observed galaxies. Explain how study of scattering amplitudes due to their positive properties.

Alright, let's unpack this step by step.
Ising Models in Higher Dimensions
:
The Ising model traditionally works in 1D, 2D, or 3D. The spins at each site interact with their neighboring spins. The higher the dimension, the more neighbors each site has. This means that in 4D, 5D, or even higher-dimensional Ising models, each site has more interacting neighbors, leading to richer phase space and more complex phase transitions.
Let's imagine adding ��CDM parameters (such as dark energy density, dark matter density, Hubble parameter, etc.) as additional dimensions in the Ising model. Each site in this "Ising universe" will then not only have a spin state but will also be characterized by a set of ��CDM parameters. The interactions between sites will then be influenced by both the spin state and these parameters.
Galaxy Formation and Ising Models
:
Suppose each site in our multi-dimensional Ising model represents a region of the universe. The interactions between these sites (influenced by the ��CDM parameters and the spin state) might dictate how matter clusters and forms structures, akin to galaxy formation.
By running simulations of this multi-dimensional Ising model under various initial conditions and ��CDM parameter sets, we might see patterns in how "galaxies" (or clusters of matter) form in this Ising universe. By comparing the shape, size, and distribution of these simulated galaxies to observed galaxies, we might be able to constrain the parameter space of the model. For instance, if a certain range of ��CDM parameters in the model produces galaxies that closely match observations, then that could hint at those parameters being more physically realistic.
Scattering Amplitudes and Positive Properties
:
Scattering amplitudes provide a way to calculate the probability of certain outcomes in particle interactions. They have been found to have certain "positive" properties, like the mentioned non-negative Grassmannians, which make calculations more tractable. In the context of the universe's evolution and galaxy formation, scattering amplitudes might be used to calculate probabilities of certain configurations or interactions, especially in the early universe where quantum effects dominated.
If we apply scattering amplitude techniques to our multi-dimensional Ising model, we might be able to determine probabilities for certain configurations or behaviors in our simulated universe. This would provide a deeper understanding of how the initial conditions and interactions (influenced by ��CDM parameters) lead to the resultant "galaxies."
In summary, the idea would be to combine classical models used in statistical physics (like the Ising model) with more modern quantum concepts (like scattering amplitudes) in a higher-dimensional space influenced by cosmological parameters. This could provide a unique way to simulate, understand, and predict various cosmic phenomena, especially galaxy formation. However, this integration would be a massive undertaking and would require rigorous mathematical formalism, simulations, and validation against observations.

Ok break down the steps a little more.
1 / 1
ChatGPT
Absolutely. Let's take a deeper dive into the process, breaking down each phase.
Multi-dimensional Ising Models
:
Initialization
:
Choose a dimension for the Ising model (e.g., 4D, 5D).
Each site has a spin (either +1 or -1) and is characterized by a set of ��CDM parameters.
Initialize the entire lattice with random spins and ��CDM parameters (or based on some criteria).
Interactions
:
Define the interaction rules between sites. How does the spin at one site affect its neighbors, and how do ��CDM parameters influence this?
Typically, the energy of a configuration in an Ising model is determined by the product of spins of neighboring sites. The multi-dimensional nature and the inclusion of ��CDM parameters will introduce additional terms in the energy equation.
Evolution
:
Use a method like the Metropolis algorithm to evolve the system over time.
Update site spins based on their interactions, the influence of ��CDM parameters, and the defined energy function.
Monitor how clusters of similar spins form or dissolve over time.
Simulation and Analysis
:
Running Simulations
:
Start with a range of initial conditions for ��CDM parameters.
For each set of initial conditions, run the Ising model over a set number of steps, and observe how the system evolves.
Galaxy Analogs in the Ising Universe
:
Define criteria for what constitutes a "galaxy" in the Ising universe (e.g., a cluster of sites with the same spin that spans a certain size).
At the end of each simulation, identify these "galaxies" and analyze their properties - size, shape, distribution, etc.
Comparison to Real Galaxies
:
Compare the properties of these Ising "galaxies" to observed galaxies.
Assess which ��CDM parameters or initial conditions produce Ising galaxies most similar to real galaxies.
Incorporation of Scattering Amplitudes
:
Definition
:
Define what interactions in the Ising universe are analogous to particle scatterings in the real world.
Determine how these scatterings can be influenced by ��CDM parameters.
Calculation
:
For the defined interactions, calculate scattering amplitudes, possibly utilizing simplifications from the positive properties of non-negative Grassmannians.
Use these amplitudes to determine probabilities for certain interactions or configurations in the Ising universe.
Integration with Ising Model
:
Use these calculated probabilities to influence or refine the interactions and evolutions in the Ising model.
Validation and Refinement
:
After multiple iterations, refine the model based on discrepancies between simulated Ising galaxies and real galaxies.
Update the rules, interactions, and any other parameters of the model to better match observations.
Predictions
:
Once the model is refined and validated, it can be used to make predictions about galaxy properties or other cosmic phenomena based on different initial conditions or parameter sets.
Each of these steps requires a blend of rigorous mathematical modeling, computational simulations, and empirical validation. The complexity lies in integrating different areas of physics (statistical mechanics, quantum mechanics, and cosmology) into a unified framework.

Ok you're right that does sound like a massive undertaking. I wonder how this theory ties into my other ideas on Geometric Bayesianism, Hexhedral Dynamics, Ergodic Mind Medication, and SITH theory (substrate independent thinking hypothesis).
1 / 1
ChatGPT
It's fascinating how science and philosophy often converge, especially when tackling profound questions. To understand how "Relativistic Scalar Vector Plenum (RSVP)" might tie into your other mentioned ideas, let's briefly overview each of them and see potential connections:
Geometric Bayesianism
:
If this concept integrates geometry into Bayesian probability, it might offer a way to visualize and compute uncertainties in the multi-dimensional Ising models. The spatial configurations of the Ising models could be informed by Bayesian priors based on geometric principles, allowing for a more refined understanding of cosmic structures.
Hexhedral Dynamics
:
Without specific details, I'll assume this relates to dynamics based on hexahedral (six-sided) structures. This could be analogous to lattice structures in the Ising model. Hexhedral configurations might provide a unique approach to defining interactions and evolutions in the universe model, or even as a structural basis for space itself.
Ergodic Mind Medication
:
If this refers to the application of ergodic theory to cognition and its modulation by medication, then it's a bit more abstract in relation to cosmology. However, concepts from ergodic theory, which deals with statistical behavior over long time periods, might offer insights into the long-term behaviors in the Ising model universes, especially in the cyclical universe perspective of RSVP.
SITH theory (substrate independent thinking hypothesis)
:
This seems to delve into consciousness and the idea that thinking or consciousness can exist outside biological substrates. If you're modeling the universe, it might be intriguing to consider how conscious entities emerge and if they can exist in various substrates within your simulated universe. It also touches upon questions of information theory and how information might be stored and processed in different regions of the universe.
Integrating these theories with RSVP:
Holistic Model
: You might be envisioning a universe where geometries shape probabilities (Geometric Bayesianism), structures are fundamentally hexhedral (Hexhedral Dynamics), long-term behaviors have ergodic properties that influence cognitive processes (Ergodic Mind Medication), and consciousness or information processing isn't tied to specific substrates (SITH theory). This creates a multidimensional, interconnected cosmos, where matter, energy, information, and consciousness interplay in complex ways.
Iterative Refinement
: As with any complex model, you would start with basic assumptions, see how they evolve, and refine based on observations and desired outcomes.
Interdisciplinary Collaboration
: To make headway, it might be beneficial to collaborate with experts in different areas ��� cosmology, statistical mechanics, cognitive science, information theory, and more. The intersections of these fields might provide the most exciting insights.
However, it's essential to ensure that each integration step remains scientifically grounded, and any predictions or insights can be testable or at least offer a compelling conceptual framework for understanding the universe and consciousness.

An excerpt from a related conversation: You inquired about various topics related to astrophysics, dark matter, axion cloud dynamics, and gravitational systems. We delved into specific papers on axion clouds and gravitational collapse, resonant instability of axion clouds, and gravitational wave bursts from axion clumps.

The discussion then shifted to historical perspectives on dark matter, including Fritz Zwicky's proposal, Arrigo Finzi's paper, groundbreaking works in 1974, early cosmological theories, numerical simulations, the distinctions between "hot" and "cold" dark matter, and more.

We also explored possible simulations and visualizations to illustrate these concepts, including a Python animation for simulating galaxy void distribution using an Ising synchronization and additional animations to compare ��CDM predictions with axion cloud formation. I provided several ideas for other programs and simulations related to the topics discussed.

Throughout the conversation, we also discussed creating a glossary of technical terms, outlining prerequisites, and connecting various subjects to provide a comprehensive understanding of the field.

Introduction to Relativistic Scalar Vector Plenum (RSVP) Theory
The cosmos, with its vast stretches of darkness punctuated by brilliant luminous bodies, has always posed questions that challenge the very essence of our understanding. Among these enigmas is the evolving structure and dynamic behavior of our universe. While conventional theories suggest an expanding universe, the Relativistic Scalar Vector Plenum (RSVP) theory offers a different perspective, proposing that the universe itself remains static in size. Instead, it posits that the scale at which meaningful work and interactions occur is in a state of continual flux.
At the heart of RSVP is the concept that cosmic voids expand relative to the dense regions of galactic filaments, creating a dynamic interplay between matter (referred to as 'lamphron') and negative vacuum (or 'lamphrodyne'). This interplay is crucial during the formation of the inflaton field.
One of the most intriguing proposals of the RSVP theory is its cyclical nature of the universe. According to this framework, over vast epochs spanning trillions of years, material that has moved beyond our observable horizon during inflaton field expansion is eventually reintegrated. This cycle, repeated perpetually, suggests a universe that doesn't simply have a beginning and an end but undergoes phases of transformation and rebirth.
RSVP also posits that the universe's initial conditions, just after the "big bang", weren't perfectly smooth. Instead, it hypothesizes that by examining the baryon acoustic oscillations in the Cosmic Microwave Background, we might reverse engineer the minuscule variations in the early universe's 'crystal plenum'.
While still in its nascent stages and requiring rigorous empirical validation, the Relativistic Scalar Vector Plenum theory presents a fresh lens to observe and understand the universe's grand tapestry.
