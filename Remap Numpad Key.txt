Remap Numpad Key
Nuspeak Translator
You
An autohotkey trigger to replace + sign key on the numpad to the NumLock key, and remap the NumLk key to toggle off an on the previous command
Nuspeak Translator
To create an AutoHotkey script that remaps the
+
key on the numpad to function as the
NumLock
key, and remaps the
NumLock
key to toggle an AutoHotkey command on and off, you would follow these steps:
Install AutoHotkey
: If you haven't already, install AutoHotkey from
its official website
.
Create the Script
: Right-click on your desktop or in a folder, select "New" > "AutoHotkey Script", and name the file as you like, for example,
RemapKeys.ahk
.
Edit the Script
: Right-click the newly created file and select "Edit Script".
Add the Script Content
: In the script file, you would add the following lines of code:
autohotkey
Copy code
SetNumLockState, AlwaysOff  ; Ensure NumLock is initially off

; Remap + on numpad to NumLock
NumpadAdd::NumLock

; Toggle a specific command with NumLock
$NumLock:: 
Toggle := !Toggle
if (Toggle)
{
    ; Place the command you want to toggle here
    MsgBox, Command is now ON.
}
else
{
    ; Place code to turn off the command here
    MsgBox, Command is now OFF.
}
return
This script will make the
+
key on the numpad behave as the
NumLock
key. Pressing the actual
NumLock
key will toggle an action on and off. In this example, it's just a message box displaying "Command is now ON" or "Command is now OFF". You can replace this part with the actual command you want to toggle.
Save and Run the Script
: Save the file and double-click it to run. Your key remappings should now be active.
Adjust as Needed
: You can modify the script as needed to suit your specific requirements. For example, you can replace the message box with the actual function or command you want to toggle.
Remember, this script will only be active as long as the AutoHotkey script is running. If you want this to be active every time you start your computer, you can place the script in your Startup folder.

I mean the NumLock key should now deactivate the previous hotstring and put the Add back to + , or turn it back on again. I can easily do this using a separate script but I was wondering if there was a simpler way to do it.
Nuspeak Translator
To achieve the functionality where the NumLock key toggles the remapping of the Numpad Add key (
+
) on and off, you can use a variable as a toggle switch within your AutoHotkey script. This will allow you to control the remapping without needing a separate script. Here's how you can modify the script:
Script Setup
: Follow the initial steps from the previous message to create and edit an AutoHotkey script.
Modified Script Content
:
autohotkey
Copy code
toggle := false  ; Initialize the toggle variable

; Check state of toggle and remap NumpadAdd accordingly
#If (toggle)
    NumpadAdd::NumLock
#If

; Toggle the functionality with NumLock
NumLock::
    toggle := !toggle  ; Toggle the state
    if (toggle)
        SetNumLockState, AlwaysOff  ; Optionally, ensure NumLock is off when remapping is active
    else
        SetNumLockState, AlwaysOn   ; Optionally, ensure NumLock is on when remapping is inactive
return
Explanation
:
The
toggle
variable is used to track whether the remapping is active.
When NumLock is pressed, the script toggles the state of
toggle
.
The
#If (toggle)
directive checks the state of
toggle
. If
toggle
is
true
, it remaps the Numpad Add key to NumLock.
When the remapping is active (i.e.,
toggle
is
true
), you can optionally turn off NumLock to prevent it from interfering with the remapping.
Conversely, when the remapping is inactive (i.e.,
toggle
is
false
), NumLock can be turned back on or left as is, depending on your preference.
Save and Run the Script
: Save your changes and run the script. Pressing NumLock will now toggle the remapping of the Numpad Add key on and off.
Adjustments
: Feel free to modify the script to fit your exact requirements, such as adding additional functionality or modifying the behavior of NumLock.
This approach allows you to manage the remapping within a single script, providing a simpler and more integrated solution.

A command to list the last few commits in git
Nuspeak Translator
To list the last few commits in a Git repository, you can use the
git log
command with various options to customize the output. Here's a basic command to list the last few commits:
bash
Copy code
git
log
-n 5
This command shows the last 5 commits. Here,
-n 5
specifies that you want the latest 5 commits. You can change the number
5
to any other number to see more or fewer commits.
If you want a more condensed view of the commits, you can use the
--oneline
option, which will display each commit on a single line:
bash
Copy code
git
log
-n 5 --oneline
This will give you a brief overview of the latest commits, showing the commit hash and the commit message.
For more detailed options and customization, you can consult the Git documentation or use
git log --help
.
You
Can I ask for a diff with the previous commit without the commit number?
Nuspeak Translator
Yes, you can get a diff with the previous commit in Git without specifying the commit number. The command you would use is:
bash
Copy code
git diff HEAD~1 HEAD
In this command:
HEAD
refers to the latest commit in the current branch.
HEAD~1
(or
HEAD^
) refers to the commit before the latest one.
This command will show the differences between the current state of your branch and the state at the previous commit. If you're only interested in the changes made in the most recent commit, this is the command you would use.
Alternatively, you can simply use:
bash
Copy code
git diff HEAD~
This is a shorthand for comparing the latest commit with the one before it.

How to compare one branch with another
Nuspeak Translator
To compare one branch with another in Git, you can use the
git diff
command. This command will show you the differences between the branches in terms of the changes in the files. Here's how you can do it:
Comparing the Current Branch with Another Branch
If you are currently on one branch and want to compare it with another branch, use the following command:
bash
Copy code
git diff [other-branch-name]
For example, if you are on
branch1
and want to compare it with
branch2
, you would use:
bash
Copy code
git diff branch2
This will show the differences from the current branch (
branch1
) to
branch2
.
Comparing Two Specific Branches
If you want to compare two specific branches, regardless of which one you are currently on, use:
bash
Copy code
git diff [branch1-name] [branch2-name]
For example:
bash
Copy code
git diff branch1 branch2
This compares
branch1
with
branch2
.
Comparing Branches for Merged Changes
To see if there are any changes in one branch that have not been merged into another branch, use:
bash
Copy code
git diff --no-commit-id --name-only --no-merges [branch1-name] [branch2-name]
This command lists only the file names that are different between the two branches.
Remember to fetch the latest updates from your remote repository (if applicable) before comparing branches, especially if others are also working on the same repository. You can do this with
git fetch
. This ensures that you are comparing the most recent versions of the branches.
