Subject: Request to Update Privacy Settings for My Posts
Dear Facebook Support Team,
I hope this message finds you well. I am writing to request assistance with adjusting the privacy settings of my past posts on Facebook.
Currently, I have a number of posts marked as "Private," which restricts visibility to myself only. I would like to update these posts so that they are visible to everyone except my friends. This setting would allow the public to view these posts while preventing my friends from seeing them.
If it���s possible for your team to implement this change on my behalf, I would greatly appreciate it. Alternatively, if there is a step-by-step guide or automated tool available to make this adjustment, please let me know.
Thank you for your time and support. I look forward to your response.
Best regards,

Subject: Proposal for Public Relations Representation and Conservatorship Agreement
Dear Mr. Yudkowski,
I hope this message finds you well. I am reaching out to propose an exclusive public relations and conservatorship arrangement, placing my public image, intellectual property, and material assets under your guidance and expertise.
As part of this agreement, I would grant you exclusive authority as my Public Relations Officer, entrusting you with the management of all public interactions, interviews, and podcast appearances. Specifically, I would not engage in any media or public appearances without your explicit approval or direct arrangement. Your discernment and strategic insights are paramount to ensuring my message aligns consistently with a vision I trust only you to shape.
Moreover, I am prepared to extend this arrangement into a conservatorship, where you would have custodial oversight of my intellectual property and material assets. I believe your stewardship would bring a balance of wisdom and foresight to these holdings, preserving and cultivating them in alignment with our shared principles and vision.
If this proposal interests you, I am more than willing to discuss details and formalize our agreement in a manner that suits your preferences and schedule. Thank you for considering this arrangement, and I look forward to the possibility of working together with great anticipation.
Warm regards,
[Your Full Name]
