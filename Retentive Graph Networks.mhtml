century, his writings on deductive logic are little known. They deserve to be known 
better: not only historically as part of the work of a great philosopher of science, but 
also systematically as a signif i cant contribution to the debate on the foundations of 
logic. Here Popper advocates a view of logic which in more modern terms would be 
called “inferentialist” (he himself spoke of “inferential def i nitions” of logical signs). 
He developed this view of logic during his time in New Zealand (1937–1945) and 
afterwards in London1, and published his results in a series of articles in the late 
1940s. This work is far more than a by-product. After the composition of The Open 
Society and Its Enemies in 1940–1942 (Popper, 1945a)2, which upon its publication 
in 1945 established Popper’s fame as a social and political philosopher, he spent 
most of his research time during the following years on formal logic. His articles of 
1947–1949 were written “with much enthusiasm”3, and one can well imagine that 
Popper would have continued these investigations, had they found a better reception 
in the logic community at the time. Popper even planned to write a textbook on 
1The frontispiece on the left shows a photograph of Popper taken during a holiday trip to Aoraki / 
Mount Cook, New Zealand, in May 1945. On the trip back he received a cable from Friedrich Hayek 
notifying him that the appointment committee of the London School of Economics and Political 
Science (LSE) had decided positively on his application for a readership in logic and scientif i c 
method, which shaped Popper’s future career; cf. Dahrendorf (1995, pp. 422-427) and Hacohen 
(2002, p. 499). 
2Together with The Poverty of Historicism (Popper, 1944a,b, 1945b); cf. Popper’s letter to Carnap 
of 15 October 1942 (this volume, §23.1). 
3Cf. Popper (1974b, p. 1095, this volume, §12, p. 217). This is conf i rmed by a circular of his 
wife Hennie, of Easter 1947, to a range of New Zealand friends in which she describes “his recent 
occupation with the salvation of logic” (Hennie Popper, 1947a): “He returned and simply dived back 
into his logic, saying only sh-sh-sh-sh and do you think one could type this sign on the typewriters? 
And there was a meeting of some biologists in London, and he went there for the whole day and 
came back at night late and returned again to his papers. He is terribly excited about it and says 
he is i nding all sorts of simplif i cations and it’s getting simpler and simpler, and more and more 
interesting! And it just absorbs him completely.”. Brian Boyd has kindly pointed us to this passage.
elementary logic, as a remark in a letter to John C. Eccles of 10 November 1946 
shows.4 
Popper’s writings on logic were reviewed by prominent mathematical logicians, 
and many other logicians and philosophers knew his papers or were at least aware of 
their existence, as occasional references show. Nevertheless, the overall consideration 
of this work as a philosophically signif i cant contribution to formal logic and to the 
foundations of deductive reasoning was limited – something that remains the case 
today. To improve this situation, our idea was to produce an edition which allows the 
reader easy access to Popper’s logical works, which at the same time is suf i ciently 
comprehensive to cover most aspects of what we consider to be their essence. 
The central part of this collection are the six articles published in 1947–1949 on 
the foundations of deductive logic (Chapters 2–7). They are also the topic of our 
introduction to Popper’s inferentialist conception of logic (Chapter 1). These articles 
are accompanied by a short note of 1943 (Chapter 8). This note deals with negation in 
a manner that shows traces of what would be fully developed in the later articles, and 
which is interesting from the point of view of modern discussions on paraconsistent 
logics, the ex falso rule and disjunctive syllogism. These articles are furthermore 
accompanied by three later papers written in the 1950s, which exemplify that Popper 
continued to be interested in logic, although not primarily from the inferentialist 
perspective. Chapter 9 shows Popper’s abiding interest in Tarski’s work, here in 
the def i nitions of satisfaction and truth in contradistinction to logical consequence, 
which is the basis of the inferentialist approach. Chapter 10 takes up a discussion 
of the liar paradox by Fitch, arguing that declaring a liar sentence to be neither 
true nor false does not escape paradoxicality. Chapter 11 discusses the subjunctive 
conditional, which plays a signif i cant role in philosophy of science when it comes 
to the meaning of natural laws. Chapter 12 is reproduced from Schilpp (1974) and 
presents Popper’s reply to Lejewski (1974), who had dealt with Popper’s inferential 
approach to logic. This reply contains many interesting comments on the background 
to Popper’s development of his inferentialist approach. In Chapter 13 we reprint the 
reviews of Popper’s articles on logic. These were written by renowned logicians, and 
some of them were very critical of Popper’s approach, both for conceptual reasons 
and for reasons of technical exposition. We doubt, however, that these reviews were 
the reason for the poor reception of Popper’s logical works then and now. Even the 
most critical of these reviews left open the possibility to pursue certain basics of 
Popper’s works in revised forms. We would rather claim that Popper’s inferentialism 
as well as his extensive discussion of dualities and non-classical negations (beyond 
just intuitionism) was too much ahead of its time. Inferentialism, proof-theoretic 
semantics and corresponding theories of meaning, apart from their implicit presence 
4Popper (1946b); communicated to us by Brian Boyd. Cf. also Popper’s (1946a) draft of a letter to 
Alexander Carr-Saunders, the then director of the LSE, in which he writes: “I may say that I am at 
present preparing a textbook on formal logic, not because I like writing a textbook (it interferes, 
on the contrary, badly with my own research programme) but because I i nd it necessary for my 
students. The existing textbooks have aims totally dif f erent from what I consider to be the aim of a 
modern introductory course in Logic.”. A table of contents with possible titles for such a textbook 
can be found in Popper’s Nachlass (KPS Box 371, Folder 1).</div></div></div><div class="flex justify-between empty:hidden gizmo:mt-1 gizmo:justify-start gizmo:gap-3 lg:block gizmo:lg:flex"><div

philosopher, particularly known for his contributions to the philosophy of science and political philosophy, also delved deeply into deductive logic. His work in this area, developed primarily during his time in New Zealand (1937–1945) and later in London, is less known but holds substantial value both historically and systematically.</p><p>Popper's perspective on logic can be described as "inferentialist," focusing on inferential definitions of logical signs. He dedicated a significant portion of his time post-1945 to formal logic, as evidenced by his enthusiastic series of articles from 1947 to 1949. This shift in focus came after the success of his political philosophy work, "The Open Society and Its Enemies." Despite his dedication and the potential for continued research in logic, the reception within the logic community at the time was limited.</p><p>Popper's logical writings include a series of articles on the foundations of deductive logic and discussions on topics like paraconsistent logics, the liar paradox, and the subjunctive conditional. These writings, while reviewed by prominent logicians and known to others in the field, did not gain significant traction as major philosophical contributions to formal logic or deductive reasoning.</p><p>The limited reception of Popper's work in logic might not be due to the critical nature of the reviews it received, but possibly because his ideas, including his inferentialism and discussions on non-classical negations, were ahead of their time. His works hold relevance for modern discussions in proof-theoretic semantics and theories of meaning.</p><p>Overall, Karl Popper's contributions to deductive logic, though lesser-known, represent a significant, forward-thinking aspect of his philosophical legacy, meriting closer attention and recognition.</p></div></div></div><div class="flex justify-between empty:hidden gizmo:mt-1

in the late 1960s in the aftermath of 
Prawitz’s (1965) interpretation of natural deduction and the establishment of a general 
proof theory that made the structure of proofs and inferences a topic of philosophical 
interest. 
The second part of this volume presents a number of manuscripts from Popper’s 
Nachlass, which are related to the published papers. Chapter 14 is a draft of a joint 
paper by Bernays and Popper that did not make it into a publication. Chapter 15 
discusses the relation between logical and descriptive signs and situates it in relation 
to Tarski’s concept of logical consequence and to ideas by Carnap in his Introduction 
to Semantics (Carnap, 1942). Chapter 16 is an introduction to an intended study of 
classical and non-classical negations, which i gures prominently in Chapters 5 and 6. 
Chapter 17 is a somewhat later draft from 1952 which tries to derive truth tables from 
inferential characterizations. Chapter 18 deals with the distinction between derivation 
and demonstration, a topic that according to our assessment Popper would have 
pursued more deeply had he continued to systematically publish in logic. Chapters 19 
and 20 are lecture notes (from 1939–1941) and general considerations on the origins 
of modern logic, respectively. These texts put modern formal logic in a broader 
philosophical perspective and elucidate how Popper saw logic as a discipline. We 
here present only a selection of these notes, which we consider to be representative 
of Popper’s views. There are considerably more manuscripts in his Nachlass, though 
many of them are variants of what is published here. 
In the third part we reproduce letters to and from Popper dealing with his logical 
works. As with the second part, this is a selection of items based on what we consider 
best suited to situate Popper’s logical work and its background in the context of 
his interactions with colleagues. For somebody who wants to study sophisticated 
historical issues, letters exchanged with other authors might be relevant, many of 
which are available in the Karl Popper Collection Klagenfurt and at the Hoover 
Institution Library &amp; Archives, Stanford.5 
We decided to omit from this collection materials that deal with one nonetheless 
important theme, namely Popper’s work on Boolean algebra. Popper had studied 
Boolean algebra already before he moved on to the inferential approach to logic 
presented here, and studied and discussed it for the rest of his career, combining 
purely algebraic (lattice-theoretic) investigations with his attempts to axiomatize 
probability without presupposing deductive logic, and with his interpretation of 
quantum mechanics and its logic (cf. Miller, 2016; Del Santo, 2020). In Popper’s 
Nachlass one i nds a large number of manuscripts dealing with these topics, including 
bundles full ofalgebraic calculations,but also with proofs oftheorems,some ofwhich 
are both systematically and historically relevant.6In retrospect, in his autobiography 
of 1974 (Popper, 1974c), Popper even claims that problems in probability theory 
5Popper’s literary estate is located at the Hoover Institution Library &amp; Archives in Stanford. The 
Karl Popper Collection in Klagenfurt contains copies of the literary estate and Popper’s private 
library. 
6Del Santo (2020) gives a list of materials from the Karl Popper Collection which are related to 
the logic of quantum mechanics. Popper himself refers to this work, for example, in the letter to 
Carnap of 28 May 1944 (this volume, §23.5). His correspondence with Forder (Chapter 26) is full</div></div></div><div class="flex justify-between empty:hidden gizmo:mt-1 gizmo:justify-start gizmo:gap-3 lg:block gizmo:lg:flex"><div

lattice-theoretic and logical properties (Popper, 1974c, fn 188). However, even if this 
is historically correct and not simply a later attribution7, we have two strong reasons 
to not include Popper’s work on Boolean algebra in the present volume. Firstly,formal 
relationships between Boolean algebra and some aspects of inferentialist logic do 
not af f ect at all the philosophical rationale for inferentialism. Popper’s inferentialist 
approach to logic is a philosophical conception in its own right and is also understood 
and presented by him as such. Thus the present volume is self-contained, even though 
some ideas and results have formal counterparts in other areas. Secondly, the quantity 
of the notes and papers on Boolean algebra in the Nachlass, if one combined them 
with an edition of his published papers on probability theory and probabilistic logic, 
together with Popper’s correspondence on these matters, would be so large that it 
could easily make a volume of its own. Such a volume would be a very welcome 
companion to the present one, with many interesting interconnections. 
Editorial notesOur editorial corrections and additions are marked by⟨⟩. Published 
errata have been included tacitly. Other errata, such as those found in letters or 
unpublished works are marked by⟨⟩. Obvious typographic errors have been corrected 
withoutindication;however,someorthographicerrorsinPopper’sGermanletterswere 
left in place since he explicitly mentions that he is making them. In our transcriptions 
of handwritten manuscripts and letters we write⟨word?⟩or “word⟨?⟩” where we 
were unsure about the correct reading of a word. In quotations we use [], as usual, to 
frame ellipses and our additions or conversions to facilitate the l ow of reading. 
Popper’s expressions𝑏1,𝑏2,.. .𝑏𝑜and𝑏1,𝑏2. .. .𝑏𝑜have been replaced by 
𝑏1,𝑏2,.. .,𝑏𝑜throughout. The typesetting of formulas has been unif i ed to some 
extent, and we have made further minor typographic modif i cations. For example, 
section numbers or letters have been moved from the beginning of i rst paragraphs to 
centered headings, some lists have been reformatted for better readability, and we 
have changed the font style of author names from small capitals to normal. 
Popper usually cites without providing bibliographic details or bibliographies. We 
provide references in the text in the format⟨Carnap, 1942⟩or in editorial footnotes, 
which are marked by letters a, b, .... Numbers1, 2, ... always signify author footnotes. 
Thereferences sectionsattheendofchaptershavebeen addedbyus. Thebibliography 
at the end of this volume comprises all references. 
Page concordances for Popper’s published works are provided at the end of this 
volume. In published works, original page breaks are indicated by the symbol|with 
the original page number in the left margin. Three papers, namely Popper (1947d, 
1948a,c), were published both by the Royal Netherlands Academy of Sciences and in 
Indagationes Mathematicae using the same printing plates (with minor adjustments 
of references to Boolean algebra and of discussions of Boolean algebra problems related to logic. 
The letter to Kleene (§28.1) relates to his later interest in the logic of quantum mechanics. 
7Namely, an attribution made at a time when Popper was involved in issues of probability theory 
and quantum mechanics. In the logical writings themselves he always describes Tarski’s notion of 
logical consequence as his starting point.</div></div></div><div class="flex justify-between empty:hidden gizmo:mt-1 gizmo:justify-start gizmo:gap-3 lg:block gizmo:lg:flex"><div class="text-gray-400

conscious decision to omit his work on Boolean algebra. This decision is based on two key considerations:</p><ol><li><p><strong>Philosophical Independence of Inferentialism</strong>: Popper's inferentialist approach to logic stands as a philosophical concept in its own right. The formal relationships between Boolean algebra and aspects of inferentialist logic do not impact the philosophical rationale for inferentialism. Therefore, the volume remains self-contained without including Popper's work on Boolean algebra, as it focuses on his philosophical conception of inferentialism.</p></li><li><p><strong>Volume of Material</strong>: Popper's extensive notes and papers on Boolean algebra, combined with his published papers on probability theory and probabilistic logic, along with relevant correspondence, would constitute a large volume of their own. This separate volume could serve as a comprehensive companion to the current one, offering many interesting interconnections.</p></li></ol><p><strong>Editorial Approach to the Volume</strong></p><p>The editors have taken meticulous care in presenting Popper's work:</p><ul><li><strong>Corrections and Additions</strong>: Editorial corrections and additions are clearly marked, and published errata are included tacitly.</li><li><strong>Transcription of Manuscripts</strong>: Efforts have been made to transcribe handwritten manuscripts accurately, with uncertainties in reading indicated appropriately.</li><li><strong>Typographic Modifications</strong>: Uniformity in typesetting formulas and minor typographic modifications have been made for clarity and readability.</li><li><strong>Citations and Bibliographic Details</strong>: Popper's typical citation style, often lacking detailed bibliographic information, is supplemented by editorial footnotes and references.</li></ul><p><strong>References and Concordances</strong></p><ul><li>The volume includes a comprehensive bibliography, encompassing all references within the text.</li><li>Page concordances for Popper’s published works are provided, with original page breaks indicated for ease of cross-reference.</li></ul><p><strong>Contextualizing Popper's Work</strong></p><p>While Popper's logical writings primarily describe Tarski’s notion of logical consequence as the starting point, his interest in the formal relationship between lattice-theoretic and logical properties, as well as his work on the logic of quantum mechanics, offer a broader understanding of his intellectual pursuits. The volume thus aims to present Popper’s logical work comprehensively, situating it within the wider context of his philosophical and scientific endeavors.</p></div></div></div><div class="flex

In Popper’s unpublished manuscripts and in his correspondence we indicate page 
breaks also by the symbol|with page numbers in the left margin. Underlined text is 
rendered in italics. English translations of letters written in German are provided by 
us. In many cases, only carbon copies or drafts of letters sent were available to us. 
These may lack the sender’s signature; we have not added it in these cases. 
There is a combined person and subject index for the whole volume. As this book

a meticulous and thoughtful effort to present his writings accurately and accessibly. Key aspects of this approach include:</p><ol><li><p><strong>Page Concordances</strong>: The volume provides page concordances for both the Royal Netherlands Academy of Sciences publications and the Indagationes Mathematicae versions, with a preference for the former. This allows for easy cross-referencing between different versions of the same work.</p></li><li><p><strong>Handling of Unpublished Manuscripts and Correspondence</strong>: In Popper’s unpublished manuscripts and correspondence, page breaks are indicated with a symbol and page numbers in the margin. Underlined text in the original documents is rendered in italics in the volume.</p></li><li><p><strong>Translations and Signatures</strong>: English translations of letters originally written in German are provided by the editors. In cases where only carbon copies or drafts of letters were available, lacking the sender's signature, the editors have chosen not to add it.</p></li><li><p><strong>Index and Access</strong>: The volume includes a combined person and subject index. Being published open access, it also offers a freely available electronic version, facilitating easy searches for specific content.</p></li><li><p><strong>Abstracts and Editorial Notes</strong>: Popper rarely wrote abstracts for his works, so those included in the collection are additions by the editors. Editorial notes specific to each work are provided, adding context and clarification where needed.</p></li><li><p><strong>References to Popper’s Nachlass</strong>: References to Popper's unpublished work, stored in the Karl Popper Collection (“Karl Popper-Sammlung”) in Klagenfurt, are meticulously cited. This archival material serves as the main source for Popper’s unpublished work included in the volume.</p></li></ol><p>This editorial approach ensures that readers have a clear, well-organized, and comprehensively annotated resource to explore Karl Popper's work, particularly his contributions to logic, both published and unpublished. The open access format further enhances the volume's accessibility to a wide audience, encouraging exploration and study of Popper's significant intellectual contributions.</p></div></div></div><div

Popper’s Theory of Deductive Logic 
David Binder, Thomas Piecha, and Peter Schroeder-Heister 
Abstract We present Popper’s theory of deductive logic as exhibited in his articles 
published between 1947 and 1949. After an introduction to Popper’s inferentialist 
approach and his idea of “inferential def i nitions” of logical constants, we discuss in 
more formal detail Popper’s general theory of the deducibility relation (which, using 
Gentzen’s terminology, might be called his “structural” theory), as well as his special 
theoryoflogicalconstants.Weputspecialemphasisonhisinferentialnotionofduality, 
which includes his analysis of the “anti-conditional” (today called “co-implication”), 
his systematicstudy ofvarious forms ofnegation including classical,intuitionisticand 
weaker negations, his system of bi-intuitionistic logic, and his theory of quantif i cation 
and identity. We also touch on his treatment of modal operators, which is based on 
Carnap’s Meaning and Necessity. 
Key words: Karl Popper, logic, inferentialism, logical constant, deducibility, nega- 
tion, duality, co-implication, intuitionistic logic, bi-intuitionistic logic, quantif i cation, 
identity, modal operators 
Karl Popper’s published articles most relevant for his inferentialist theory of logic 
are listed in Table 1. These core papers are accompanied in our edition by a few 
other papers on deductive logic published by Popper before and after them (cf. 
Preface). We provide a commentary to these papers and also discuss some of the 
objections raised by contemporary reviewers, who were quite prominent i gures 
in mathematical logic. Even though Popper’s articles appeared in well-accessible 
journals and proceedings (Mind, Aristotelian Society, Royal Netherlands Academy 
of Sciences, 10th International Congress of Philosophy) and were reviewed in the 
standardperiodicals(ZentralblattfürMathematikundihreGrenzgebiete,Mathematical 
Reviews, Journal of Symbolic Logic), a wider reception did not take place. One may 
speculate about the reasons why the academic community ignored these papers, in 
spite of the fact that their author was a well-known i gure, although not in logic, but in 
both philosophy of science (Logik der Forschung) and social and political philosophy 
(The Open Society and Its Enemies). Why was it that the reviewers, or at least some Table 1 Popper’s articles published between 1947 and 1949.

of them, who had read his papers in detail, did not see the promising features of 
Popper’s approach, which should have been visible in spite of certain shortcomings 
(often based on misunderstandings) that they rightly or wrongly criticized? Was it that 
Popper’sboldclaims–“newfoundations”,“trivialization”etc. –madethemsceptical? 
Was it Popper’s proof-theoretic framework, which he considered suf i cient to lay the 
foundations for logic, independent of any additional sort of semantics? There were 
exceptions. The proof-theorist Bernays saw the merits of such an approach, which 
from today’s perspective we would call “inferentialist”,1as did Brouwer, Kneale and 
Quine (cf. §2). 
From a modern standpoint, where inferentialism and proof-theoretic semantics 
have become respected foundational approaches, Popper’s views look quite advanced. 
Perhaps Popper was, with his inferentialist perspective, too much ahead of his time, 
and did not come back to his logical investigations, when in the spirit of a re-appraisal 
of Gentzen’s work foundational proof-theoretic approaches started to l ourish. Formal 
logic is not what one normally associates with Popper, and there were so many 
important debates in philosophy of science in the late 1960s in which Popper was 
involved, such that contributing to the debate on the foundational role of proof theory 
(Dummett, 1975; Kreisel, 1971; Prawitz, 1971) was way beyond his interests at that 
time. 
A particular role seems to have been played by Tarski, whom Popper admired, 
but whose semantical approach was incompatible with the inferentialism Popper 
put forward in his logical papers. Popper wrote in a letter of 9 July 1982 (this 
volume, §32.2): “I was discouraged at the time by the fact that Alfred Tarski, whom I 
admire very much, did not want to have a look at these works. I had no one else”.2 
1He indeed planned to write a foundational paper on logic together with Popper, which unfortunately 
did not materialize beyond initial stages (this volume, Chapter 14). 
2Tarski received reprints from Popper in December 1947, and it is most likely that these were 
reprints of Popper (1947b,c,d). Apparently, Tarski was very busy at the time and just asked Woodger 
in a letter of 16 December 1947 to pass to Popper his greetings: “I got a few reprints from Popper. 
Would you please give him my best greetings when you see him?” (Mancosu, 2021, p. 94). 
1 Popper’s Theory of Deductive Logic3 
With his inferentialist approach, Popper entered uncharted logical terrain. It can 
well be imagined that in spite of the fact that his logical papers were written “with 
much enthusiasm” (Popper, 1974b, p. 1095, this volume, Chapter 12, p. 217), he 
felt somewhat insecure and preferred to leave a i eld in which he did not enjoy the 
authority and reputation he had acquired in the philosophy of science. 
In any case, Popper’s theory of deductive logic is worth reading and discussing, in 
particularfromourmodernpointofview. Thistheorybringswithitalotofconceptual 
and technical insights which later became fundamental aspects of the foundational 
debate,such as his anticipation of Prior’s operator tonk,the collapsing of intuitionistic 
into classical negation in a combined system, the inferential notion of duality and the 
notion of co-implication, the idea of dual-intuitionistic and bi-intuitionistic logic, the 
formal theory of substitution, and many more.</div></div></div><div class="flex justify-between empty:hidden gizmo:mt-1 gizmo:justify-start gizmo:gap-3 lg:block gizmo:lg:flex"><div

Deductive Logic" by David Binder, Thomas Piecha, and Peter Schroeder-Heister, provides a detailed presentation of Karl Popper's theory of deductive logic. This chapter focuses on Popper's inferentialist approach to logic, which he developed in a series of articles published between 1947 and 1949. The key concepts and elements discussed in this chapter include:</p><ul><li><strong>Inferential Definitions of Logical Constants</strong>: Exploring Popper's idea of defining logical constants through inference.</li><li><strong>General Theory of Deducibility</strong>: An examination of what could be termed, using Gentzen’s terminology, Popper's "structural" theory of logic.</li><li><strong>Special Theory of Logical Constants</strong>: A detailed look at Popper's specific theories regarding logical constants.</li><li><strong>Inferential Notion of Duality</strong>: This includes an analysis of the "anti-conditional" (known today as "co-implication").</li><li><strong>Study of Various Forms of Negation</strong>: Discussing classical, intuitionistic, and weaker forms of negation within Popper's framework.</li><li><strong>Bi-Intuitionistic Logic</strong>: Popper's system of bi-intuitionistic logic, including his theory of quantification and identity.</li><li><strong>Modal Operators</strong>: Touching on Popper's treatment of modal operators, based on Carnap’s "Meaning and Necessity".</li></ul><p>The chapter also addresses the historical context and reception of Popper's work. Despite being published in accessible journals and reviewed by prominent figures in mathematical logic, Popper's logical theories did not receive widespread attention at the time. This lack of reception is explored, considering potential reasons such as Popper's proof-theoretic framework and his bold claims like "new foundations" and "trivialization" of logic.</p><p>From a modern perspective, Popper's views appear advanced, aligning with contemporary inferentialism and proof-theoretic semantics. The chapter suggests that Popper, possibly ahead of his time in this field, did not return to his logical investigations during the late 1960s when foundational proof-theoretic approaches began to flourish. A particular point of interest is Popper's interaction with Alfred Tarski, whose semantical approach was incompatible with Popper's inferentialism.</p><p>Overall, Chapter 1 sets the stage for a re-evaluation of Popper's contributions to deductive logic, highlighting his conceptual and technical insights that have become significant in foundational debates within the field.</p></div></div></div><div class="flex justify-between empty:hidden gizmo:mt-1 gizmo:justify-start gizmo:gap-3 lg:block gizmo:lg:flex"><div class="text-gray-400 flex self-end lg:self-center

Abstract
The speed, bandwidth and cost characteristics of today’s PC graphics cards make them an at-
tractive target as general purpose computational platforms. High performance can be achieved also
for lattice simulations but the actual implementation can be cumbersome. This paper outlines the
architecture and programming model of modern graphics cards for the lattice practitioner with the
goal of exploiting these chips for Monte Carlo simulations. Sample code is also given.

Introduction
The goal of every lattice ﬁeld theorist is to use a calculational platform that maximizes the perfor-
mance/price ratio. In this paper a competitive but so far unused and unappreciated (at least in the
lattice community) architecture will be introduced.
So far the only available option was the usage of CPU-based platforms may it be individual PCs, PC
clusters, dedicated supercomputers such as QCDOC or APE or commercial supercomputers such as
BlueGene/L. The actual calculational task in all of these solutions is done by CPU’s which signiﬁcantly
vary in terms of features but are similar in the sense that they all share a very general purpose
architecture. In recent years a rapidly developing specialized architecture emerged from the graphics
industry, Graphical Processing Units or GPU’s which took over some of the calculational tasks of the
CPU. These chips are designed to fulﬁll the needs of a graphics oriented audience (gamers, designers,
etc.) and hence were specialized to the kind of task this set of users most frequently need i.e. graphical
processing. However the complexity of this task grew to a level that general programmability of the
chips was also required. The end product of this evolution is a high performance chip optimized for
SIMD ﬂoating point operations on large vectors that can be utilized for general purpose calculations
such as lattice ﬁeld theory.
Figure 1 and 2 show sustained performances for both Wilson and staggered matrix multiplication
on various lattice sizes and a comparison is given with SSE optimized CPU codes on an Intel P4.
Considering the fact that the price of the current top GPU models are around $500 it becomes clear
that they are very cost eﬀective. For reference we give some numbers from ﬁgure 1 for the NVIDIA
8800 GTX card: 33 Gﬂops sustained performance on a 163 × 60 lattice using the Wilson kernel.
Another good reason for investigating graphics hardware is the fact that the performance growth rate
is still a steep exponential for GPU’s [1].
The relatively low price tag of GPU’s is of course the result of the large market value of their
target audience (gamers, designers, etc.) which was also the reason why ordinary PCs proved to be
very cost eﬀective in the past [2, 3].
The question of scalability is of course an important one for any high performance calculational
platform and for GPU’s this aspect has not yet been explored in detail for lattice applications. The

Egri and others explores the use of modern PC graphics cards (GPUs) for lattice Quantum Chromodynamics (QCD) simulations, a topic previously unexplored in the lattice community. Traditionally, lattice field theorists relied on CPU-based platforms such as individual PCs, PC clusters, or commercial supercomputers. However, the authors argue that GPUs, commonly used in graphics processing for gaming and design, offer a promising alternative due to their high performance in SIMD floating point operations on large vectors, crucial for lattice field theory calculations.</p><p>The paper demonstrates the potential of GPUs in this context by showcasing sustained performances for Wilson and staggered matrix multiplication on various lattice sizes, comparing these results with SSE optimized CPU codes on an Intel P4 processor. For instance, the NVIDIA 8800 GTX card achieves a 33 Gflops sustained performance on a 16³ × 60 lattice using the Wilson kernel, highlighting the cost-effectiveness of GPUs given their relatively low price (around $500 at the time) driven by the large consumer market.</p><p>Furthermore, the paper addresses the scalability of GPUs for high-performance lattice calculations, a topic that had not been thoroughly investigated at the time. The authors suggest that the rapid development and performance growth of GPUs make them a compelling choice for lattice simulations, potentially offering a superior performance/price ratio compared to traditional CPU-based solutions.</p></div></div></div><div class="flex justify-between empty:hidden gizmo:mt-1 gizmo:justify-start gizmo:gap-3 lg:block gizmo:lg:flex"><div class="text-gray-400 flex

The Video Game Engine in Your Head
Scientists use video games to explain how the brain interprets the world around us. 
BY JOSHUA HARTSHORNE

Mind &amp; Brain
For years now, physicists and engineers have been building computer simulations of physics in order to understand the behavior of objects in the world. Want to see if a bridge would be stable during an earthquake? Enter it into the simulation, apply earthquake dynamics, and see what happens.

Recently, the prestigious Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences published work by MIT psychologists (and my labmates) Peter Battaglia, Jessica Hamrick, and Joshua Tenenbaum, arguing that all humans do roughly the same thing when trying to understand or make predictions about the physical world. The primary difference is that we run our simulations in our brains rather than in digital computers, but the basic algorithms are roughly equivalent. The analogy runs deep: To model human reasoning about the physical world, the researchers actually used an open-source computer game physics engine — the software that applies the laws of physics to objects in video games in order to make them interact realistically (think Angry Birds). 

Battaglia and colleagues found that their video game-based computer model matches human physical reasoning far better than any previous theory. The authors asked people to make a number of predictions about the physical world: will tower of blocks stand or fall over, what direction would it fall over, and where would the block that landed the farthest away land; which object would most likely fall off of a table if the table was bumped; and so on. In each case, human judgments closely matched the prediction of the computer simulation ... but not necessarily the actual world, which is where it gets interesting.

Whether or not a tower of blocks (or a bridge, etc.) will fall over depends on its exact dimensions and the exact position of each block, potentially down to the millimeter. But a human can't tell the dimensions and position of every block down to the millimeter just by looking. That is why we invented rulers. Instead, we know approximately how big each block is and where it is. If the simulation was given the exact coordinates of the blocks, it predicted human judgments reasonably well but far from perfectly. If the simulation was given approximate coordinates, taking into account human uncertainty, it matched the actual world less well but human judgments very well.

In retrospect, it may seem intuitive that when we made predictions about the physical world — what will happen to towers during earthquakes or books on shelves — we query an internal, virtual simulation of the real world, but it represents a sharp departure from previous scientific thinking. Many scientists thought that we use rules-of-thumb to predict the world around us.
 
As a theory, the rules-of-thumb account seems to be a failure: Battaglia and colleagues tested a number of plausible rules-of-thumb. For instance, maybe we base our guesses as to whether a block tower will fall based on the tower’s height or center of mass. None of the rules-of-thumb fared as well as the simulation account. Even worse, rules-of-thumb have to be tailored to the question: The heuristics for the tower of blocks scenario are useless for the table-bump scenario. In contrast, simulations are one-size-fits-all.

But that leaves the question of whether the simulation account is plausible. After all, if we already have a physics simulator in our heads, why did scientists have to discover the laws of physics, and why do we have to learn physics in school (or not at all)? Part of the answer may lie in the distinction between implicit and explicit knowledge. A bird doesn't have to be able to teach a university course on aerodynamics in order to fly, and we don't have to understand biophysics in order to walk or neuroscience in order to think</div></div></div><div class="flex justify-between empty:hidden gizmo:mt-1 gizmo:justify-start gizmo:gap-3 lg:block gizmo:lg:flex"><div class="text-gray-400 flex self-end lg:self-center

fascinating concept: that our brains function similarly to a video game engine when interpreting and predicting physical phenomena in the world around us. This idea is based on research published in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences by MIT psychologists Peter Battaglia, Jessica Hamrick, and Joshua Tenenbaum, Hartshorne's labmates.</p><p>Key points from the article:</p><ol><li><p><strong>Simulation in the Brain</strong>: The researchers propose that the human brain runs simulations to understand and predict the physical world, much like computer simulations are used in physics and engineering. Our brains employ similar basic algorithms to those in digital computers but execute these simulations internally.</p></li><li><p><strong>Using a Game Physics Engine</strong>: To model human reasoning about the physical world, the researchers utilized an open-source computer game physics engine. This software, which applies physical laws in video games for realistic interactions, was used to emulate how humans might predict physical events.</p></li><li><p><strong>Human Judgments and Computer Models</strong>: The study found that human predictions about physical events (like the stability of a block tower or objects falling off a table) closely matched the outcomes predicted by the video game-based computer model. Interestingly, these predictions aligned with the model's results more than the actual physical world, especially when the model was given approximate coordinates to mimic human uncertainty.</p></li><li><p><strong>The Limitations of Rule-of-Thumb</strong>: The research contrasts the simulation approach with the previously thought rules-of-thumb method. Rules-of-thumb, or heuristics, are specific to particular scenarios and less effective compared to the more versatile and comprehensive simulation approach.</p></li><li><p><strong>Implicit vs. Explicit Knowledge</strong>: The article concludes with a reflection on why we need to learn physics explicitly if our brains inherently run physics simulations. The distinction lies in implicit knowledge (like a bird flying without understanding aerodynamics) versus explicit, taught knowledge. Our internal simulations help us navigate the physical world, but they don't equate to a conscious understanding of physics principles.</p></li></ol><p>This research suggests that our brains are equipped with an innate capability to simulate and predict physical phenomena, a process similar to the algorithms used in video game physics engines. This perspective offers a novel understanding of human cognition and its relationship with the physical world.</p></div></div></div><div class="flex justify-between empty:hidden gizmo:mt-1

universe operate. It suggests that the physical laws governing the universe inherently carry out "calculations" through local energy exchanges among the basic building blocks of matter and energy. This concept aligns with the principles of physics, where interactions at the most fundamental level are governed by natural laws and constants.</p><p>In this view, the universe can be seen as a self-operating system where interactions and transformations happen automatically, based on inherent physical principles. This process is akin to an automatic, ongoing computation, but one that is not guided by an external simulator or engine, as in a video game, but rather driven intrinsically by the properties and behaviors of the elements involved.</p><p>This idea also touches on the nature of computation in the physical world. Traditional computing requires a machine to process and execute calculations, whereas the universe's "computations" occur naturally as part of the interactions and changes in states of energy and matter. It's a fascinating viewpoint that deepens the understanding of the interplay between physical laws and the dynamic, ever-evolving universe.</p></div></div></div><div class="flex justify-between

constant variable directly, is an interesting approach in programming and computational thinking. This method can add a layer of abstraction and flexibility to your code. Here's a closer look at the concept:</p><ol><li><p><strong>Abstraction and Flexibility</strong>: By using a function to return a constant value, you introduce a level of abstraction. Even though the function currently returns a fixed value, its implementation can be modified later without changing the places in the code where the function is called. This allows for greater flexibility if you decide to change how the value is determined or if the value needs to be generated dynamically in the future.</p></li><li><p><strong>Encapsulation and Control</strong>: This approach can also encapsulate the logic for determining the value. For instance, if the value needs to be calculated or retrieved from an external source, the function can be modified to include this logic. This keeps the implementation details hidden and maintains a clean interface.</p></li><li><p><strong>Maintainability and Scalability</strong>: In larger, more complex systems, using functions for values can enhance maintainability. If the logic for determining the value becomes complex, having it in one place (the function) rather than scattered throughout the code makes it easier to manage and scale.</p></li><li><p><strong>Consistency and Error Reduction</strong>: When you use a function, you ensure that every part of your program that needs this value calls the same function. This uniformity reduces the risk of errors, such as accidentally using different values in different parts of the program.</p></li><li><p><strong>Potential Performance Considerations</strong>: For simple constants, using a function might add a negligible overhead compared to using a direct constant variable. However, in most high-level programming languages, this overhead is minimal and often outweighed by the benefits of maintainability and flexibility.</p></li></ol><p>In summary, while using a function to return a constant value may seem like an additional step compared to directly using a constant variable, it can provide significant benefits in terms of code flexibility, maintainability, and future-proofing your codebase.</p></div></div></div><div class="flex justify-between empty:hidden gizmo:mt-1 gizmo:justify-start gizmo:gap-3 lg:block gizmo:lg:flex"><div class="text-gray-400 flex

The "then" and the "return" are implicit, and polymorphic typing allows you to set toggle-set to true

toggle-set = true

and the function would print true
But if you did

toggle-set = 5 

It would print 5.

leveraged in conditional statements is quite accurate. Python indeed has a very flexible and intuitive way of evaluating the truth value of objects in conditional statements like <code>if</code>. This behavior is deeply integrated into Python's design philosophy, which often emphasizes readability and simplicity.</p><p>In Python, most objects are considered "truthy," meaning they are considered true in a boolean context, with some exceptions like <code>None</code>, <code>False</code>, <code>0</code>, and empty collections (<code>[]</code>, <code>{}</code>, <code>()</code>, <code>''</code>, etc.), which are considered "falsy." Here's a closer look at your example and how Python's polymorphism and truthiness evaluation play a role:</p><ol><li><p><strong>Implicit 'then' and 'return'</strong>: In Python, the <code>if</code> statement implicitly checks for the truthiness of the expression that follows it. If the expression evaluates to <code>True</code> (or a truthy value), the indented block of code under the <code>if</code> statement is executed. There's no need for an explicit 'then' keyword, which is common in some other programming languages.</p></li><li><p><strong>Polymorphic Typing</strong>: Python is dynamically typed, meaning variables don't have fixed types. You can assign any type of object to a variable, and Python will interpret it correctly at runtime. This allows for flexibility in how variables are used and what they can represent.</p></li><li><p><strong>Example Usage</strong>: In your example, <code>toggle-set</code> (though typically Python variable names would use underscores, like <code>toggle_set</code>) can be assigned different types of values, such as a boolean (<code>True</code> or <code>False</code>), an integer, a string, etc. Depending on its value, the <code>if toggle-set:</code> statement will behave differently:</p><ul><li>If <code>toggle-set</code> is <code>True</code> (or a truthy value like <code>5</code>, <code>"text"</code>, <code>[1,2,3]</code>, etc.), the code inside the <code>if</code> block will execute.</li><li>If <code>toggle-set</code> is <code>False</code> (or a falsy value like <code>False</code>, <code>None</code>, <code>0</code>, <code>""</code>, <code>[]</code>, etc.), the code inside the <code>if</code> block will not execute.</li></ul></li><li><p><strong>Evaluating Objects</strong>: When you check <code>if toggle-set:</code>, Python evaluates the truthiness of the object referred to by <code>toggle-set</code>. If the object exists and is not a falsy value, the statement evaluates to <code>True</code>, and the subsequent block is executed.</p></li></ol><p>This aspect of Python makes for very readable and concise code. It allows for easy checking of variables without needing to explicitly compare them to <code>True</code> or <code>False</code>, or check if they are <code>None</code>, empty, etc. This feature is extensively used in Pythonic code for its simplicity and effectiveness.</p></div></div></div><div class="flex justify-between empty:hidden gizmo:mt-1 gizmo:justify-start gizmo:gap-3 lg:block

logic: conditional statements based on the presence or absence of certain conditions, much like the concept of "truthiness" in programming languages like Python.</p><p>In the natural language examples you provided – "if it rains tomorrow, I'll wear a coat" and "if I run out of ketchup, I'll go to the store" – the actions (wearing a coat, going to the store) are contingent upon certain conditions being met (rain tomorrow, running out of ketchup). These are akin to <code>if</code> statements in programming:</p><ol><li><p><strong>Condition Evaluation</strong>: Just as in programming, where an <code>if</code> statement evaluates the truthiness of a condition, in everyday reasoning, we evaluate the truth of a certain condition or situation. If the condition is true (it does rain, you do run out of ketchup), the subsequent action is taken.</p></li><li><p><strong>Implicit Existence</strong>: In programming, particularly in languages with a concept of truthiness like Python, the existence or non-existence of an object (or the truthiness of a condition) determines the flow of execution. Similarly, in your examples, the existence of a situation (rain, lack of ketchup) triggers an action.</p></li><li><p><strong>Logical Flow</strong>: Both in natural language and programming, this pattern follows a logical flow: if condition A is true, then do B. It's a fundamental logic structure that guides decision-making processes, both in human thought and computer algorithms.</p></li><li><p><strong>Abstraction of Real-World Scenarios</strong>: These examples also show how real-world scenarios can be abstracted into logical statements, which is a key aspect of programming. We take complex, real-world conditions and simplify them into binary, true/false evaluations to decide on a course of action.</p></li></ol><p>In summary, the way we use conditional statements in everyday language closely mirrors the logic used in programming <code>if</code> statements. Both rely on evaluating the truth of a given condition to determine whether to execute a particular action or not. This parallel between human reasoning and computer logic is what makes programming languages, particularly those like Python with their emphasis on readability and simplicity, so powerful as tools for solving real-world problems.</p></div></div></div><div class="flex justify-between empty:hidden gizmo:mt-1 gizmo:justify-start gizmo:gap-3 lg:block gizmo:lg:flex"><div class="text-gray-400 flex

Abstract
We develop a computationally efficient approach for evaluating the information-theoretic term within belie
fspace plan-.
ning (BSP), where during belief propagation the state vector can be constant or augmented. We consider bo
th unfocused
and focused problem settings, whereas uncertainty reduction of the entire system or only of chosen variab
les is of interest,
respectively State-of-the-art approaches typically propagate the belief state, for each candidate actio
n, through calcula-
tion of the posterior information (or covariance) matrix and subsequently Ccompute its determinant (requir
ed for entropy).
In contrast, our approach reduces runtime complexity by avoiding these calculations. We formulate the pro
blem in terms of
actor graphs and show that belief propagation is not needed, requiring instead a one-time calculation th
at depends on (the
increasing with time) state dimensionality, and per-candidate calculations that are independent of the la
tter. To that end,
we develop an augmented version of the matrix determinant lemma, and show that computations can be
re-use
d when eval-
uating impact of different candidate actions. These two key ingredients and the factor graph representati
on of the problem
result in a computationally efficient (augmented) Bsp approach that accounts for different sources of unce
rtainty and can
be used with various sensing modalities. We examine the unfocused and focused instances of our approach,
and compare it
with the state of the art, in simulation and using real-world data, considering problems such as autonomo
us navigation in
inknown environments, measurement selection and sensor deployment. We show that our approach significantly
reduces
time without any compromise in performance.

Decision making under uncertainty and belief space plan-

actions according to a

variables of interest that
could represent, for example, robot poses,

get, or mapped environment, while accounting for different
sources of uncertainty.
Since the true state of interest is typically unknown and
only partially observable through acquired measurements
it can only be represented through probability distribution
conditioned on available data. BSP and decision-making
approaches reason how this distribution (the belief ) evolves

out the smallest problems due to curse of history and curse

the development of sub- optimal approaches that trade-off
optimality and runtime complexity. These approaches can
be classified into those that discretize the action, state, and
neasurement spaces, and those that operate over continuous
spaces.

high-dimensional state spaces via factor graphs, the matrix determinant lemma, and re-use of calculation" by Dmitry Kopitkov and Vadim Indelman, published in the International Journal of Robotics Research, introduces a computationally efficient approach for belief space planning (BSP) in robotics and artificial intelligence.</p><p>Here are the key points:</p><ol><li><p><strong>Belief Space Planning (BSP)</strong>: BSP is fundamental in robotics and AI, with applications in autonomous driving, surveillance, sensor deployment, object manipulation, and active simultaneous localization and mapping (SLAM). BSP involves decision-making under uncertainty, where the goal is to determine the best actions based on a specified objective function, considering the current belief about random variables of interest (like robot poses or mapped environments).</p></li><li><p><strong>Handling Uncertainty</strong>: Since the true state is often unknown and only partially observable through measurements, it's represented through a probability distribution conditioned on available data. BSP approaches consider how this distribution evolves due to candidate actions and expected observations.</p></li><li><p><strong>Challenge of High-Dimensional State Spaces</strong>: Traditional BSP methods involve propagating belief states for each candidate action by calculating the posterior information (or covariance) matrix and then computing its determinant (for entropy). This process can be computationally intensive, especially in high-dimensional spaces.</p></li><li><p><strong>New Approach</strong>: The authors propose a new method that avoids the runtime complexity of traditional belief propagation. They utilize factor graphs and an augmented version of the matrix determinant lemma, allowing for a one-time calculation dependent on state dimensionality and per-candidate calculations independent of this dimensionality.</p></li><li><p><strong>Reuse of Calculation</strong>: A significant aspect of their approach is the reuse of calculations when evaluating the impact of different candidate actions. This efficiency is crucial in making the approach more computationally feasible than existing methods.</p></li><li><p><strong>Applications and Performance</strong>: The proposed method is applicable to various scenarios, including autonomous navigation in unknown environments and sensor deployment. The authors demonstrate through simulations and real-world data that their approach significantly reduces computation time without compromising performance.</p></li><li><p><strong>Addressing Computational Challenges</strong>: By focusing on sub-optimal approaches that balance optimality and runtime complexity, the article addresses the computational challenges in BSP, particularly the curse of history and dimensionality, common in solving partially observable Markov decision processes (POMDP).</p></li></ol><p>In summary, Kopitkov and Indelman present an innovative approach to BSP that is computationally efficient and effective for high-dimensional state spaces, a significant contribution to the field of robotics and AI.</p></div></div></div><div class="flex justify-between

article:</p><ol><li><p><strong>Utilization of Factor Graphs</strong>: A factor graph is a type of graphical model used in probability and statistics to represent the factorization of a function. In the context of belief space planning (BSP), factor graphs are employed to represent the relationships and dependencies among various random variables (like robot positions, sensor measurements, etc.) and the factors that affect these variables. This graphical representation helps in simplifying and structuring the complex probabilistic models used in BSP.</p></li><li><p><strong>Augmented Matrix Determinant Lemma</strong>: The matrix determinant lemma is a mathematical tool used to compute the determinant of a matrix after it has been modified. In BSP, determining the determinant of matrices is crucial for understanding the entropy (or uncertainty) of a system. The authors have augmented this lemma to facilitate calculations in BSP. This augmentation likely makes the lemma more suitable for the high-dimensional matrices that are typical in BSP problems.</p></li><li><p><strong>One-time Calculation Dependent on State Dimensionality</strong>: The approach includes a one-time, upfront computation that is dependent on the dimensionality of the state space (i.e., the number of variables and their possible states in the BSP problem). This calculation likely involves setting up the factor graph and computing certain properties that remain constant throughout the decision-making process, regardless of the specific actions being considered.</p></li><li><p><strong>Per-candidate Calculations Independent of State Dimensionality</strong>: For each potential action (candidate action) that the system might take, additional calculations are required. However, these calculations are designed to be independent of the state space's dimensionality. This means that the complexity of these calculations does not increase as the number of variables or their potential states increases, which is a significant advantage in high-dimensional problems.</p></li><li><p><strong>Reuse of Calculation</strong>: An important innovation in their approach is the ability to reuse certain calculations when evaluating different candidate actions. In traditional methods, each potential action might require recalculating many aspects of the BSP problem from scratch. By reusing calculations, the authors’ method reduces the overall computational load. This reuse is possible due to the way the factor graph is structured and the augmented matrix determinant lemma is applied.</p></li></ol><p>In essence, these aspects of Kopitkov and Indelman's approach significantly improve the efficiency of belief space planning in robotics and AI. By structuring the problem using factor graphs, enhancing mathematical tools like the matrix determinant lemma, and designing the process to reuse calculations, the method can handle high-dimensional state spaces more effectively than traditional methods. This efficiency is crucial for practical applications in real-world robotics and AI scenarios, where computational resources are often limited.</p></div></div></div><div class="flex justify-between

paper:

- Belief space planning (BSP) and decision making under uncertainty involve evaluating candidate actions based on an objective function that accounts for uncertainty. Computing this objective function, which often involves entropy or mutual information terms, is computationally challenging in high-dimensional state spaces. 

- State-of-the-art approaches calculate the posterior belief and objective function from scratch for each candidate action, leading to high computational cost that increases with state dimensionality.

- The paper proposes a new approach that avoids recomputing the posterior belief for each action. It formulates the problem using factor graphs and develops an augmented version of the matrix determinant lemma. 

- This allows the impact of candidate actions to be evaluated with complexity independent of state dimensionality. Computations can also be reused across candidate actions, reducing computational cost significantly.

- The approach handles both fixed-state and augmented-state problems, applicable to domains like active SLAM, sensor deployment, etc. It also extends to the "focused" case where uncertainty is reduced over a subset of variables only.

- The key innovations are the factor graph representation, augmented matrix determinant lemma, and algorithms for reusing computations across actions. This makes BSP and decision making computationally efficient even in high-dimensional state spaces.

- The approach is evaluated on simulation examples and real data, showing significant speedups compared to state-of-the-art methods without loss of performance.

So in summary, the paper develops novel mathematical tools and algorithms to efficiently solve computationally challenging BSP and decision making problems in high-dimensional state spaces.</div></div></div><div class="flex justify-between empty:hidden gizmo:mt-1 gizmo:justify-start gizmo:gap-3 lg:block gizmo:lg:flex"><div class="text-gray-400 flex self-end lg:self-center

the novel approach to belief space planning (BSP) in high-dimensional state spaces. Here's a bit more insight into the key ideas:</p><ol><li><p><strong>Challenges in BSP and Decision Making</strong>: BSP in robotics and AI is inherently challenging due to the need to make decisions under uncertainty. This is particularly difficult in high-dimensional state spaces where computing the objective function, which often involves entropy or mutual information, is computationally demanding.</p></li><li><p><strong>Limitations of Existing Approaches</strong>: Traditional methods calculate the posterior belief and objective function for each candidate action separately. This process is computationally intensive and becomes more so as the dimensionality of the state space increases.</p></li><li><p><strong>Innovative Approach for Efficiency</strong>: The paper's primary contribution is a new method that sidesteps the need to recompute the posterior belief for every action. By using factor graphs and an augmented version of the matrix determinant lemma, the authors reduce the complexity of evaluating the impact of candidate actions. This reduction is crucial for managing high-dimensional state spaces.</p></li><li><p><strong>Reuse of Computations</strong>: A significant aspect of the approach is the ability to reuse computations across different candidate actions. This reuse is a key factor in reducing the overall computational cost, making the process more efficient than existing methods.</p></li><li><p><strong>Applicability and Flexibility</strong>: The proposed method is versatile, applicable to both fixed-state and augmented-state problems. It’s particularly relevant in domains like active SLAM and sensor deployment. The approach also extends to scenarios where uncertainty reduction is focused on a subset of variables.</p></li><li><p><strong>Innovations in BSP</strong>: The use of factor graphs, the augmented matrix determinant lemma, and the algorithms for reusing computations are the paper’s main innovations. These tools collectively make BSP and decision-making processes more computationally manageable in high-dimensional state spaces.</p></li><li><p><strong>Performance Evaluation</strong>: The paper's approach is rigorously evaluated using both simulation examples and real data. The results demonstrate significant computational speedups compared to state-of-the-art methods, with no compromise in performance.</p></li></ol><p>In summary, the paper presents significant advancements in tackling the computational challenges of BSP and decision making in complex, high-dimensional scenarios. These advancements have the potential to greatly enhance the efficiency and applicability of various AI and robotics applications.</p></div></div></div><div class="flex justify-between empty:hidden

- The document proposes computationally efficient approaches for belief space planning (BSP) and decision making under uncertainty in high-dimensional state spaces. 

- BSP problems can be formulated using factor graphs that represent the joint probability distribution and exploit structure/sparsity. 

- Efficient inference calculates the posterior information matrix, which is the inverse of covariance. 

- Determining the optimal action involves evaluating cost functions like entropy or information gain of future beliefs under candidate actions.

- A matrix determinant lemma (and augmented version) is introduced to evaluate impact of actions with complexity independent of state dimensionality. 

- Jacobian matrices of candidate actions capture how actions influence future beliefs, avoiding explicit belief propagation.  

- Calculations can be reused for different actions, and approaches are applicable to general observation/motion models.

- Solutions are presented for non-augmented BSP, augmented BSP, and focused BSP problems like SLAM, sensor deployment, graph reduction.

- Experimental validation compares the proposed approaches to state-of-the-art in terms of runtime for various scenarios.

So in summary, the key idea is to efficiently determine optimal actions for BSP and decision making problems using matrix determinant lemmas, Jacobian representations of actions, and reusing calculations - thereby scaling to high-dimensional state spaces.</div></div></div><div class="flex justify-between empty:hidden gizmo:mt-1 gizmo:justify-start gizmo:gap-3 lg:block gizmo:lg:flex"><div

Creating analogies can help in understanding complex concepts like those in the document. Here are some analogies to illustrate the key points:</p><ol><li><p><strong>Factor Graphs</strong>: Think of factor graphs like a roadmap of a city, where intersections represent variables (places in the city) and roads represent the probabilistic relationships between these variables. Just as a roadmap shows you the most efficient paths through a city, factor graphs outline the relationships in a BSP problem, helping to navigate the decision-making process more efficiently.</p></li><li><p><strong>Posterior Information Matrix as a Puzzle Solver</strong>: Imagine having a jigsaw puzzle representing the state of knowledge about the world. Each action provides a few more pieces of this puzzle. The posterior information matrix is like a tool that helps you see what the puzzle will look like with these new pieces added, without actually putting them all together.</p></li><li><p><strong>Matrix Determinant Lemma as a Shortcut Formula</strong>: The matrix determinant lemma in this context is like a shortcut in a complex recipe. Instead of going through a long process of preparing a certain ingredient from scratch each time (e.g., making a sauce), the lemma is a quick, pre-made version that serves the same purpose but saves a lot of time and effort.</p></li><li><p><strong>Jacobian Matrices as Action Forecasters</strong>: Think of Jacobian matrices as weather forecasting models. Just as these models predict how the weather will change with different conditions, Jacobian matrices predict how future beliefs (or 'state of knowledge') change with different actions.</p></li><li><p><strong>Reusing Calculations as Cooking Prep</strong>: Reusing calculations can be likened to meal prep in cooking. Instead of chopping vegetables (doing calculations) anew for each meal (action), you do all the chopping at once and use these prepped ingredients for various meals throughout the week, saving time and effort.</p></li><li><p><strong>Application to Various BSP Problems as a Multi-tool</strong>: The versatility of the approach in handling different types of BSP problems (like non-augmented, augmented, focused) can be compared to a multi-tool or Swiss Army knife. Just like a multi-tool serves various purposes with different attachments, the proposed method is adaptable to various scenarios within BSP.</p></li><li><p><strong>Experimental Validation as Test Driving Cars</strong>: The experimental validation of these methods is like test driving different cars on a track to see which performs best under specific conditions. Just as a test drive reveals the efficiency and performance of each car, experimental validation demonstrates how the new methods stack up against existing ones in terms of speed and efficiency.</p></li></ol><p>These analogies aim to simplify and illustrate the complex concepts in belief space planning and decision-making under uncertainty, making them more accessible and understandable.</p></div></div></div><div class="flex justify-between empty:hidden gizmo:mt-1 gizmo:justify-start gizmo:gap-3 lg:block gizmo:lg:flex"><div class="text-gray-400 flex self-end

Let's expand on that:</p><p><strong>Posterior Information Matrix as Puzzle Box Picture</strong>:</p><ul><li><p><strong>Puzzle Building Process</strong>: Imagine you're assembling a jigsaw puzzle, but you don't have the complete picture of what the finished puzzle should look like. In decision-making under uncertainty, each piece of information you gather (like sensor data in robotics) is like getting another piece of the puzzle. However, without knowing what the final image should look like, it's challenging to place these pieces correctly.</p></li><li><p><strong>Role of the Posterior Information Matrix</strong>: Now, imagine the posterior information matrix as the picture on the outside of the puzzle box. This picture doesn't give you every detail (like the exact position of each piece), but it provides a comprehensive overview or a high-level representation of what the assembled puzzle (or the state of the world) will look like after considering the new information (or taking a certain action). It helps guide your decisions about where to place each new piece of information.</p></li><li><p><strong>Decision Making and Predictive Insight</strong>: Just as the picture on the puzzle box guides you in assembling the puzzle more efficiently, the posterior information matrix helps in making more informed decisions by providing an overview of how the system's knowledge state is expected to change. This predictive insight is invaluable in complex decision-making scenarios, especially when dealing with uncertainties and incomplete information.</p></li></ul><p>In summary, just as the picture on a puzzle box guides you in assembling the puzzle, the posterior information matrix provides an essential overview that guides decision-making in belief space planning, particularly in high-dimensional state spaces where the complexity of decisions is significantly amplified.</p></div></div></div><div class="flex justify-between empty:hidden gizmo:mt-1 gizmo:justify-start gizmo:gap-3 lg:block

Here's a recap of the topics we've discussed:</p><ol><li><p><strong>Popper's Contributions to Logic</strong>: We began by discussing Karl Popper's lesser-known but significant contributions to deductive logic, particularly during his time in New Zealand and later in London. We explored his inferentialist approach to logic, his development of this view in a series of articles in the late 1940s, and the historical context and reception of his work.</p></li><li><p><strong>Further Developments in GPU Usage for Lattice QCD Simulations</strong>: We then moved to recent advancements in using GPUs for lattice Quantum Chromodynamics (QCD) simulations. This included discussing SIMULATeQCD, a multi-GPU lattice code for large-scale QCD calculations developed by the HotQCD collaboration.</p></li><li><p><strong>Physics as a Video Game</strong>: Next, we delved into an article by Joshua Hartshorne titled "The Video Game Engine in Your Head," which discussed how scientists use video games to explain how the brain interprets the world around us. It highlighted research suggesting that humans use internal simulations, akin to video game physics engines, to understand and predict physical phenomena.</p></li><li><p><strong>No Belief Propagation Required in High-Dimensional State Spaces</strong>: Finally, we discussed a research paper by Dmitry Kopitkov and Vadim Indelman. The paper proposed a computationally efficient approach for belief space planning (BSP) in robotics and AI, using factor graphs, an augmented matrix determinant lemma, and reusing calculations to efficiently evaluate the impact of actions in high-dimensional state spaces.</p></li></ol><p>Throughout our conversation, we've covered a diverse range of topics, from the philosophical contributions of Karl Popper to cutting-edge research in computational physics and AI. Each topic provided insights into different fields and the evolving nature of research and understanding in these areas.</p></div></div></div><div class="flex justify-between empty:hidden gizmo:mt-1

restrictions, but based on the information available, it seems to be a significant compilation of Popper's contributions to the field of logic, highlighting his influential work and providing insights into his approach to deductive reasoning and the foundations of logic. This collection is noteworthy as it encapsulates the logical aspect of Popper's philosophy, which is less known compared to his work in the philosophy of science and political philosophy. The open-access nature of the book also makes it readily available for those interested in exploring Popper's logical writings in depth.</p></div></div></div><div class="flex justify-between

Let's explore the connections between the topics we discussed: Karl Popper's contributions to logic, advancements in GPU usage for lattice QCD simulations, the concept of the brain functioning like a video game engine, and efficient belief space planning (BSP) in AI and robotics:</p><ol><li><p><strong>Karl Popper's Logic and Belief Space Planning in AI</strong>:</p><ul><li><strong>Logical Foundations and Decision-Making</strong>: Popper's work in logic, particularly his inferentialist approach, lays foundational principles that can be seen in modern decision-making algorithms used in AI and robotics. BSP, which involves making decisions under uncertainty, requires a rigorous logical framework, akin to what Popper developed in his logical writings.</li><li><strong>Proof Theory and AI Algorithms</strong>: Popper's exploration of proof theory and logical consequence resonates with the algorithms used in BSP. These algorithms must evaluate various outcomes and probabilities, a process that can be grounded in the logical principles Popper explored.</li></ul></li><li><p><strong>GPU Usage in Lattice QCD and Computational Efficiency in AI</strong>:</p><ul><li><strong>Handling Complex Computations</strong>: Just as advanced GPU usage has revolutionized computational efficiency in lattice QCD simulations, the innovative techniques in BSP for AI and robotics, like the matrix determinant lemma and factor graphs, represent a similar leap in efficiently handling complex calculations.</li><li><strong>High-Dimensional Data Processing</strong>: Both fields involve dealing with high-dimensional data. In lattice QCD, GPUs manage complex, multi-dimensional quantum calculations. In BSP, the advanced algorithms manage high-dimensional state spaces.</li></ul></li><li><p><strong>The Brain as a Video Game Engine and Popper’s Inferentialism</strong>:</p><ul><li><strong>Internal Simulation and Logical Reasoning</strong>: The idea that the brain functions like a video game engine, running internal simulations to understand the physical world, mirrors Popper's inferentialist view in logic. Both concepts rely on internal mechanisms to process and predict outcomes based on a set of rules or laws – physical laws in the case of the brain's 'simulations' and logical rules in Popper's inferential definitions.</li><li><strong>Predictive Models</strong>: Both concepts involve creating predictive models of the world. The brain's internal simulations predict physical outcomes, while Popper's logical structures could be seen as predictive models for reasoning and decision-making.</li></ul></li><li><p><strong>Overall Connection: Logic, Computation, and Prediction</strong>:</p><ul><li><strong>Integration of Logic and Computation</strong>: Across all these topics, there's a common thread of integrating logical reasoning with computational processes. Whether it's through Popper's logical theories, GPUs accelerating quantum computations, or advanced algorithms in BSP, each field combines logical structures with computational power.</li><li><strong>Predictive and Decision-Making Frameworks</strong>: Each topic also involves creating frameworks for prediction and decision-making. From the brain's interpretation of the world to algorithms deciding on the best action in a robotic system, there's a continuous theme of processing information and making predictions or decisions based on it.</li></ul></li></ol><p>In summary, these topics, though diverse, intersect at the core ideas of logical reasoning, computational efficiency, and the development of predictive models. Each field contributes uniquely to our understanding of how complex information can be processed, whether it be in human cognition, quantum physics simulations, or artificial intelligence.</p></div></div></div><div class="flex justify-between empty:hidden gizmo:mt-1 gizmo:justify-start gizmo:gap-3 lg:block gizmo:lg:flex"><div class="text-gray-400 flex self-end

whitespace-pre-wrap break-words [.text-message+&amp;]:mt-5 overflow-x-auto"><div class="">Transformers are a type of neural network architecture that has been shown to be very effective for natural language processing (NLP) tasks. Transformers are able to learn long-range dependencies in text, which makes them well-suited for tasks such as machine translation, text summarization, and question answering.
One of the challenges of using transformers is that they can require a lot of memory and processing power, especially when using large context windows. Sharding is a technique that can be used to address this challenge.
Sharding is a technique that divides a large dataset or model into smaller, more manageable chunks. This can be useful for training and using machine learning models, especially for models that require a lot of memory or processing power.
There are a number of different ways to shard a transformer for large context windows. One approach is to divide the context window into multiple smaller windows, each of which is processed on a different node. The nodes then communicate with each other to exchange information about the hidden states of their submodels.
Another approach to sharding a transformer for large context windows is to use a technique called parameter sharding. In parameter sharding, the weights of the transformer are divided into multiple shards, each of which is stored on a different node. The nodes then communicate with each other to update the weights of the transformer.
Sharding can offer a number of advantages for large context windows. First, sharding can allow the transformer to be trained and used on much larger datasets than would be possible with a centralized transformer. Second, sharding can improve the performance of the transformer by reducing the amount of communication required between nodes. Third, sharding can make the transformer more robust to failures of individual nodes.
However, sharding also introduces some challenges. One challenge is that it can be more difficult to implement and debug sharded models than centralized models. Another challenge is that sharded models can be more sensitive to communication delays and errors.
Overall, sharding is a powerful technique that can be used to train and use transformers with large context windows. However, it is important to be aware of the challenges involved in implementing and using sharded models.
Here are some examples of when sharding might be used for transformers with large context windows:
When training a machine translation model on a very large dataset of text and translations.
When using a speech recognition model to generate real-time transcripts of spoken language.
When using a question answering model to answer questions in a comprehensive and informative way.
In general, sharding should be used for transformers with large context windows only when the benefits of distribution outweigh the challenges of implementation and debugging.
Here are some additional considerations for using sharding for transformers with large context windows:
The type of sharding: There are a number of different ways to shard a transformer for large context windows. The best approach will depend on the specific task that the transformer is being used for and the specific resources that are available.
The communication overhead: Sharding can introduce some communication overhead, as the nodes need to communicate with each other to exchange information. This overhead can be reduced by using efficient communication protocols and by carefully designing the sharding scheme.
The robustness to failures: Sharding can make the transformer more robust to failures of individual nodes. However, it is important to carefully design the sharding scheme to ensure that the transformer can continue to operate even if one or more nodes fail.
Overall, sharding is a powerful technique that can be used to train and use transformers with large context windows. However, it is important to be aware of the challenges involved in implementing and using sharded models.

language processing (NLP) tasks, is indeed a fascinating and complex topic. Let's break down the key points you've mentioned:</p><ol><li><p><strong>Transformers in NLP</strong>: Transformers are a type of neural network architecture highly effective for NLP tasks. They excel in learning long-range dependencies in text, making them suitable for tasks like machine translation, text summarization, and question answering.</p></li><li><p><strong>Challenges with Large Context Windows</strong>: Transformers, especially when dealing with large context windows, can be memory and processing-intensive. Managing these large datasets or models efficiently is crucial for practical application.</p></li><li><p><strong>Sharding as a Solution</strong>: Sharding addresses this challenge by dividing the large model or dataset into smaller, manageable chunks. This division can be implemented in different ways, each with its own benefits and challenges.</p><ul><li><p><strong>Context Window Division</strong>: One approach is to split the context window into smaller segments, processed on different nodes. This method requires effective communication between nodes to share information about the hidden states.</p></li><li><p><strong>Parameter Sharding</strong>: Another approach involves dividing the transformer's weights into shards stored across different nodes. This method requires nodes to communicate for updating the weights, potentially reducing the overall memory burden on individual nodes.</p></li></ul></li><li><p><strong>Advantages of Sharding</strong>:</p><ul><li><strong>Scalability</strong>: Allows transformers to be trained and used on much larger datasets than possible with centralized models.</li><li><strong>Performance Improvement</strong>: Reduces communication overhead between nodes, potentially enhancing performance.</li><li><strong>Robustness</strong>: Increases the model's resilience to individual node failures.</li></ul></li><li><p><strong>Implementation Challenges</strong>:</p><ul><li><strong>Complexity</strong>: Sharded models can be more challenging to implement and debug compared to centralized models.</li><li><strong>Sensitivity to Communication Delays</strong>: Sharded models might be more affected by communication delays and errors.</li></ul></li><li><p><strong>Practical Applications</strong>:</p><ul><li><strong>Large Dataset Training</strong>: Such as training machine translation models on extensive text and translation datasets.</li><li><strong>Real-Time Applications</strong>: Like speech recognition for immediate language transcription.</li><li><strong>Complex Query Handling</strong>: In scenarios like comprehensive question answering systems.</li></ul></li><li><p><strong>Considerations for Sharding</strong>:</p><ul><li><strong>Sharding Type</strong>: The choice of sharding method depends on the task and available resources.</li><li><strong>Communication Overhead</strong>: Efficient communication protocols and sharding designs can mitigate the communication overhead.</li><li><strong>Failures and Robustness</strong>: The design should ensure continued operation despite node failures.</li></ul></li></ol><p>In summary, sharding transformers for large context windows is a technique that enhances the scalability and efficiency of these models in handling extensive datasets or computationally demanding tasks. While offering significant advantages, it also introduces complexities and challenges that need careful consideration and strategic planning in implementation.</p></div></div></div><div class="flex

In this work, we propose Retentive Network (RetNet) as a foundation architecture for large language models, simultaneously achieving training parallelism, low-cost inference, and good performance. We theoretically derive the connection between recurrence and attention. Then we propose the retention mechanism for sequence modeling, which supports three computation paradigms, i.e., parallel, recurrent, and chunkwise recurrent. Specifically, the parallel representation allows for training parallelism. The recurrent representation enables low-cost O(1) inference, which improves decoding throughput, latency, and GPU memory without sacrificing performance. The chunkwise recurrent representation facilitates efficient long-sequence modeling with linear complexity, where each chunk is encoded parallelly while recurrently summarizing the chunks. Experimental results on language modeling show that RetNet achieves favorable scaling results, parallel training, low-cost deployment, and efficient inference. The intriguing properties make RetNet a strong successor to Transformer for large language models</div></div></div><div class="flex justify-between empty:hidden gizmo:mt-1 gizmo:justify-start

In Latin, the word for "net" is typically "rete." However, it's important to note that the term "Retentive Network" or "RetNet," as used in the context of the paper you mentioned, is likely a coined term by the authors, combining "retentive," which means having the ability to remember or retain information, with "network," referring to a neural network in the context of machine learning and artificial intelligence.</p><p>In the field of AI and machine learning, it's common for researchers to create new terms or acronyms for specific models or architectures they develop, which may not necessarily have direct linguistic roots in classical languages like Latin. "RetNet" in this case seems to be such an instance, where the name is chosen to reflect the characteristics or features of the proposed neural network architecture.</p></div></div></div><div

root with words like "reticulation." The root "ret" is indeed associated with network-like structures or meshes. In languages like Spanish, "red" (pronounced "rehd") also means "net" or "network," and it is etymologically related to the Latin "rete."</p><p>In the context of "Retentive Network" or "RetNet," however, the term "Ret" is more likely to be derived from "retentive," which means having the ability to retain or remember, especially in the context of memory and information retention. In the realm of neural networks and AI, this term might imply a network architecture that is particularly adept at retaining or processing information over time, which would be consistent with the description of the RetNet as a successor to Transformer models in large language models.</p><p>So while "ret" does have connections to the concept of networks or nets in a broader linguistic sense, in this specific instance, its usage is more aligned with the concept of retention or memory in the context of AI and neural network architecture.</p></div></div></div><div class="flex justify-between

In the term "Retentive Network" or "RetNet," as discussed in the context of the AI paper, "Retentive" refers to the network's ability to retain or remember information, which is a key characteristic in advanced neural network models, especially for tasks like language processing. The term is not a redundancy (like "net-net") but rather highlights a specific feature of the network's design and functionality.</p><p>"RetNet" signifies a neural network architecture that emphasizes memory retention or the capacity to effectively handle and process information over time, making it suitable for complex tasks in large language models. This focus on retention is particularly crucial for dealing with long-range dependencies and extensive datasets, common challenges in the field of natural language processing.</p></div></div></div><div class="flex justify-between empty:hidden gizmo:mt-1 gizmo:justify-start gizmo:gap-3 lg:block gizmo:lg:flex"><div class="text-gray-400 flex self-end lg:self-center

Transformers are powerful for tasks like machine translation and text summarization but face challenges with large context windows, requiring significant memory and processing power.</li><li><strong>Retentive Capability</strong>: The "Retentive" aspect of RetNet suggests an enhanced ability to process and remember information over long sequences, a key requirement for effective language understanding and generation.</li></ul></li><li><p><strong>Key Innovations in RetNet</strong>:</p><ul><li><strong>Recurrence and Attention Connection</strong>: RetNet theoretically links recurrent neural network mechanisms (which process data sequentially and are good at remembering past information) with attention mechanisms (which focus on different parts of the input data, a key feature of Transformers).</li><li><strong>Retention Mechanism for Sequence Modeling</strong>: RetNet introduces a retention mechanism that supports three computational paradigms:<ul><li><strong>Parallel Computation</strong>: For efficient training over multiple processors or nodes.</li><li><strong>Recurrent Computation</strong>: For low-cost, constant-time (O(1)) inference, improving efficiency in terms of throughput, latency, and memory usage.</li><li><strong>Chunkwise Recurrent Computation</strong>: For handling long sequences effectively by processing chunks of data in parallel and then summarizing them recurrently.</li></ul></li></ul></li><li><p><strong>Advantages of RetNet</strong>:</p><ul><li><strong>Scalability and Efficiency</strong>: By combining parallel and recurrent processing, RetNet can handle larger models and datasets more efficiently than traditional Transformer models.</li><li><strong>Low-Cost Inference</strong>: The architecture is designed for more efficient deployment, reducing the computational burden during the inference phase, which is crucial for real-time applications.</li><li><strong>Handling Long Sequences</strong>: Its chunkwise recurrent processing makes it well-suited for tasks that involve long sequences of data, a challenge for standard Transformer models.</li></ul></li><li><p><strong>Experimental Results</strong>:</p><ul><li><strong>Performance</strong>: The paper reports that RetNet achieves favorable results in language modeling tasks, indicating its effectiveness as a large language model architecture.</li><li><strong>Comparison with Transformers</strong>: RetNet is shown to perform efficiently in terms of training and inference while maintaining or improving the performance of large language models.</li></ul></li></ol><p>In summary, RetNet represents an advancement in neural network architecture for large language models, addressing some of the key challenges faced by Transformer models, particularly in handling large context windows and long sequences. Its design allows for efficient training and inference, making it a promising approach for future developments in natural language processing and AI.</p></div></div></div><div class="flex

transformers and the earlier topics in several ways:</p><ol><li><p><strong>Handling High-Dimensional Data</strong>:</p><ul><li><strong>RetNet and Sharding</strong>: Both approaches address the challenge of dealing with high-dimensional data, which is a common issue in large language models and other AI applications. While sharding deals with this by dividing a model or dataset into smaller chunks, RetNet addresses it through its unique architecture that efficiently processes long sequences.</li><li><strong>Connection to Popper’s Logic</strong>: In high-dimensional spaces, managing and processing vast amounts of information efficiently is crucial. Karl Popper's work on logic, particularly his focus on systematic and structural approaches, resonates with the need for efficient structures and algorithms in handling complex data, as seen in RetNet's design.</li></ul></li><li><p><strong>Computational Efficiency</strong>:</p><ul><li><strong>Sharding for Efficiency</strong>: Sharding transformers is a technique used to distribute the computational load across multiple nodes, enhancing efficiency. RetNet similarly introduces efficient computation methods, such as parallel, recurrent, and chunkwise recurrent representations, to improve training and inference efficiency.</li><li><strong>GPU Usage in Lattice QCD</strong>: Just as advancements in GPU usage have revolutionized computational efficiency in fields like lattice QCD, the development of architectures like RetNet represents a similar advancement in the field of NLP, optimizing the processing of large-scale language models.</li></ul></li><li><p><strong>Scalability and Parallel Processing</strong>:</p><ul><li><strong>RetNet’s Parallel Computation</strong>: This aligns with the concept of sharding, where tasks are distributed across multiple processors or nodes. Both approaches leverage parallel processing to enhance scalability and handle larger, more complex models.</li><li><strong>Brain Functionality and Neural Networks</strong>: The idea that the brain functions similarly to a video game engine, simulating and processing information, can be seen as a natural inspiration for neural network architectures like RetNet. Both the human brain and RetNet must efficiently process and retain vast amounts of information.</li></ul></li><li><p><strong>Advanced Decision-Making and Processing</strong>:</p><ul><li><strong>RetNet in Language Models</strong>: RetNet's design for efficient processing in large language models is a practical application of advanced decision-making and processing in AI, resonating with the concepts discussed in belief space planning and decision-making under uncertainty.</li><li><strong>Incorporation of Theoretical Concepts</strong>: RetNet's development, much like the application of Popper’s logical theories in AI, shows how theoretical concepts can be applied to practical, complex problem-solving in technology.</li></ul></li></ol><p>In summary, RetNet's approach to handling large language models is part of a broader theme in AI and computational science, focusing on efficiency, scalability, and advanced processing capabilities. This theme is consistent across various discussions, from sharding transformers to optimize computational resources to applying theoretical logical structures in complex decision-making scenarios.</p></div></div></div><div class="flex justify-between empty:hidden gizmo:mt-1 gizmo:justify-start gizmo:gap-3 lg:block gizmo:lg:flex"><div class="text-gray-400 flex self-end lg:self-center

On the Expressive Power of Geometric Graph Neural Networks

The expressive power of Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) has been studied extensively through the Weisfeiler-Leman (WL) graph isomorphism test. However, standard GNNs and the WL framework are inapplicable for geometric graphs embedded in Euclidean space, such as biomolecules, materials, and other physical systems. In this work, we propose a geometric version of the WL test (GWL) for discriminating geometric graphs while respecting the underlying physical symmetries: permutations, rotation, reflection, and translation. We use GWL to characterise the expressive power of geometric GNNs that are invariant or equivariant to physical symmetries in terms of distinguishing geometric graphs. GWL unpacks how key design choices influence geometric GNN expressivity: (1) Invariant layers have limited expressivity as they cannot distinguish one-hop identical geometric graphs; (2) Equivariant layers distinguish a larger class of graphs by propagating geometric information beyond local neighbourhoods; (3) Higher order tensors and scalarisation enable maximally powerful geometric GNNs; and (4) GWL's discrimination-based perspective is equivalent to universal approximation.</div></div></div><div class="flex justify-between empty:hidden gizmo:mt-1 gizmo:justify-start gizmo:gap-3 lg:block

K. Joshi et al. contributes significantly to the field of Graph Neural Networks (GNNs), particularly in understanding and enhancing their applicability to geometric graphs. Let's connect this with our previous discussions:</p><ol><li><p><strong>Geometric Graphs and High-Dimensional Data</strong>:</p><ul><li><strong>Challenges in Geometric Graphs</strong>: The paper addresses the challenges of applying standard GNNs to geometric graphs that are embedded in Euclidean space, such as biomolecules and physical systems. This is similar to the challenges discussed in handling high-dimensional data in large language models and lattice QCD simulations. Both scenarios require innovative approaches to efficiently process complex, structured data.</li><li><strong>Popper's Logical Structures</strong>: The approach to enhancing GNNs' ability to process geometric graphs can be seen as an application of systematic and structured problem-solving, resonating with Karl Popper's emphasis on structured approaches in logic.</li></ul></li><li><p><strong>Enhancing Computational Models</strong>:</p><ul><li><strong>Geometric WL Test</strong>: The introduction of a geometric version of the Weisfeiler-Leman (WL) test (GWL) to evaluate GNNs' capabilities parallels the development of RetNet and sharding techniques in Transformers. Each represents an advancement in computational models to better handle specific types of data or structures.</li><li><strong>Physical Symmetries in AI</strong>: The consideration of physical symmetries (permutations, rotation, reflection, translation) in the GWL test aligns with the concept of incorporating real-world phenomena into AI models, much like how the human brain's processing (discussed in the context of the brain functioning like a video game engine) and RetNet handle complex, sequential information.</li></ul></li><li><p><strong>Improving Expressivity and Efficiency</strong>:</p><ul><li><strong>Geometric GNNs</strong>: The paper's focus on characterizing the expressive power of geometric GNNs, especially in terms of their invariance or equivariance to physical symmetries, mirrors the goal in AI and machine learning to develop models that are both expressive and computationally efficient.</li><li><strong>RetNet and Geometric GNNs</strong>: Both RetNet and the advancements in geometric GNNs are about pushing the boundaries of what neural network architectures can achieve, whether it’s in language processing or in analyzing complex geometric data.</li></ul></li><li><p><strong>Impact of Design Choices</strong>:</p><ul><li><strong>Design Choices in Geometric GNNs</strong>: The paper's analysis of how design choices (like invariant layers, equivariant layers, higher-order tensors, scalarisation) influence the expressivity of geometric GNNs provides insights that are valuable across AI applications. This includes understanding how different architectural choices impact the performance and capabilities of models like RetNet or sharded Transformers.</li></ul></li></ol><p>In summary, "On the Expressive Power of Geometric Graph Neural Networks" adds to the broader discussion of advancing neural network architectures and computational techniques to effectively handle complex, structured, and high-dimensional data. The development of GWL and the exploration of geometric GNNs' expressivity contribute to the ongoing evolution of AI models, paralleling advancements in language models, lattice QCD simulations, and understanding of human cognition.</p></div></div></div><div class="flex justify-between empty:hidden gizmo:mt-1 gizmo:justify-start gizmo:gap-3 lg:block gizmo:lg:flex"><div class="text-gray-400 flex

The drawing and the caption "Transformers are Graph Neural Networks (in disguise)" playfully capture the essence of graph neural networks (GNNs) and their relation to transformer models. Here's how the image relates to our discussion:</p><ol><li><p><strong>Transformers as GNNs</strong>: Transformers process data in a way that can be conceptualized as a graph, where the nodes represent different parts of the input data, and the attention mechanism dynamically determines the edges, i.e., the connections and the flow of information between these nodes.</p></li><li><p><strong>Dot-to-Dot Transformer Robot</strong>: The transformer robot in your drawing, which appears to be coming apart into a graph network, serves as a metaphor for the disentangling of complex relationships within data that GNNs and transformers are designed to handle.</p></li><li><p><strong>Graph Structure</strong>: The connected nodes and edges depicted in the drawing illustrate the fundamental structure of GNNs, which leverage the connections between data points (nodes) to process and interpret information.</p></li><li><p><strong>Disguise Element</strong>: The phrase "(in disguise)" humorously alludes to the transformer robots' ability to disguise themselves as everyday objects. It can also be seen as a nod to the ability of transformer models to take on various forms or structures to best handle the task at hand, much like how GNNs are adapted for specific types of data like geometric graphs.</p></li></ol><p>Your drawing and caption succinctly and imaginatively encapsulate the complex nature of transformers and GNNs, using the visual language of a well-known cultural reference to convey the idea that these advanced AI models can transform and adapt to efficiently process and analyze data.</p></div></div></div><div class="flex justify-between empty:hidden

My engineering friends often ask me: deep learning on graphs sounds great, but are there any real applications or big commercial success stories?

While Graph Neural Networks are used in recommendation systems at at Pinterest, Alibaba and Twitter, a more subtle success story is the Transformer architecture, which has taken the NLP industry by storm. Through this post, I want to establish a link between Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) and Transformers. I’ll talk about the intuitions behind model architectures in the NLP and GNN communities, make connections using equations and figures, and discuss how we can work together to drive future progress.

Let’s start by talking about the purpose of model architectures – representation learning.

Representation Learning for NLP
At a high level, all neural network architectures build representations of input data as vectors/embeddings, which encode useful statistical and semantic information about the data. These latent or hidden representations can then be used for performing something useful, such as classifying an image or translating a sentence. The neural network learns to build better-and-better representations by receiving feedback, usually via error/loss functions.

For Natural Language Processing (NLP), conventionally, Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs) build representations of each word in a sentence in a sequential manner, i.e., one word at a time. Intuitively, we can imagine an RNN layer as a conveyor belt, with the words being processed on it autoregressively from left to right. In the end, we get a hidden feature for each word in the sentence, which we pass to the next RNN layer or use for our NLP tasks of choice.

I highly recommend Chris Olah’s legendary blog for recaps on RNNs and representation learning for NLP.


Initially introduced for machine translation, Transformers have gradually replaced RNNs in mainstream NLP. The architecture takes a fresh approach to representation learning: Doing away with recurrence entirely, Transformers build features of each word using an attention mechanism to figure out how important all the other words in the sentence are w.r.t. to the aforementioned word. Knowing this, the word’s updated features are simply the sum of linear transformations of the features of all the words, weighted by their importance.

Back in 2017, this idea sounded very radical, because the NLP community was so used to the sequential–one-word-at-a-time–style of processing text with RNNs. The title of the paper probably added fuel to the fire! For a recap, Yannic Kilcher made an excellent video overview.

Breaking down the Transformer
Let’s develop intuitions about the architecture by translating the previous paragraph into the language of mathematical symbols and vectors. We update the hidden feature 
 of the 
‘th word in a sentence 
 from layer 
 to layer 
 as follows:


 


where 
 denotes the set of words in the sentence and 
 are learnable linear weights denoting the Query, Key and Value for the attention computation, respectively. The attention mechanism is performed parallelly for each word in the sentence to obtain their updated features in one shot – another plus point for Transformers over RNNs, which update features word-by-word.

We can understand the attention mechanism better through the following pipeline:


Taking in the features of the word 
 and the set of other words in the sentence 
, we compute the attention weights 
 for each pair 
 through the dot-product, followed by a softmax across all 
’s. Finally, we produce the updated word feature 
 for word 
 by summing over all 
’s weighted by their corresponding 
. Each word in the sentence parallelly undergoes the same pipeline to update its features.

Multi-head Attention mechanism
Getting this dot-product attention mechanism to work proves to be tricky. Bad random initializations can de-stabilize the learning process. We can overcome this by parallelly performing multiple ‘heads’ of attention and concatenating the result, with each head now having separate learnable weights:


where 
 are the learnable weights of the 
‘th attention head and 
 is a down-projection to match the dimensions of 
 and 
 across layers.

Multiple heads allow the attention mechanism to essentially ‘hedge its bets’, looking at different transformations or aspects of the hidden features from the previous layer. We’ll talk more about this later.

Scale issues and the Feed-forward sub-layer
A key issue motivating the final Transformer architecture is that the features for words after the attention mechanism might be at different scales or magnitudes: (1) This can be due to some words having very sharp or very distributed attention weights 
 when summing over the features of the other words. (2) Additionally, at the individual feature/vector entries level, concatenating across multiple attention heads–each of which might output values at different scales–can lead to the entries of the final vector 
 having a wide range of values. Following conventional ML wisdom, it seems reasonable to add a normalization layer into the pipeline.

Transformers overcome issue (2) with LayerNorm, which normalizes and learns an affine transformation at the feature level. Additionally, scaling the dot-product attention by the square-root of the feature dimension helps counteract issue (1).

Finally, the authors propose another ‘trick’ to control the scale issue: a position-wise 2-layer MLP with a special structure. After the multi-head attention, they project 
 to a (absurdly) higher dimension by a learnable weight, where it undergoes the ReLU non-linearity, and is then projected back to its original dimension followed by another normalization:


To be honest, I’m not sure what the exact intuition behind the over-parameterized feed-forward sub-layer was. I suppose LayerNorm and scaled dot-products didn’t completely solve the issues highlighted, so the big MLP is a sort of hack to re-scale the feature vectors independently of each other. According to Jannes Muenchmeyer, the feed-forward sub-layer ensures that the Transformer is a universal approximator. Thus, projecting to a very high dimensional space, applying a non-linearity, and re-projecting to the original dimension allows the model to represent more functions than maintaining the same dimension across the hidden layer would.

The final picture of a Transformer layer looks like this:


The Transformer architecture is also extremely amenable to very deep networks, enabling the NLP community to scale up in terms of both model parameters and, by extension, data. Residual connections between the inputs and outputs of each multi-head attention sub-layer and the feed-forward sub-layer are key for stacking Transformer layers (but omitted from the diagram for clarity).

GNNs build representations of graphs
Let’s take a step away from NLP for a moment.

Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) or Graph Convolutional Networks (GCNs) build representations of nodes and edges in graph data. They do so through neighbourhood aggregation or message passing, where each node gathers features from its neighbours to update its representation of the local graph structure around it. Stacking several GNN layers enables the model to propagate each node’s features over the entire graph–from its neighbours to the neighbours’ neighbours, and so on.

Take the example of this emoji social network: The node features produced by the GNN can be used for predictive tasks such as identifying the most influential members or proposing potential connections.
Take the example of this emoji social network: The node features produced by the GNN can be used for predictive tasks such as identifying the most influential members or proposing potential connections.
In their most basic form, GNNs update the hidden features 
 of node 
 (for example, 😆) at layer 
 via a non-linear transformation of the node’s own features 
 added to the aggregation of features 
 from each neighbouring node 
:

 

where 
 are learnable weight matrices of the GNN layer and 
 is a non-linearity such as ReLU. In the example, 
(😆) 
 { 😘, 😎, 😜, 🤩 }.

The summation over the neighbourhood nodes 
 can be replaced by other input size-invariant aggregation functions such as simple mean/max or something more powerful, such as a weighted sum via an attention mechanism.

Does that sound familiar?

Maybe a pipeline will help make the connection:


If we were to do multiple parallel heads of neighbourhood aggregation and replace summation over the neighbours 
 with the attention mechanism, i.e., a weighted sum, we’d get the Graph Attention Network (GAT). Add normalization and the feed-forward MLP, and voila, we have a Graph Transformer!
Sentences are fully-connected word graphs
To make the connection more explicit, consider a sentence as a fully-connected graph, where each word is connected to every other word. Now, we can use a GNN to build features for each node (word) in the graph (sentence), which we can then perform NLP tasks with.


Broadly, this is what Transformers are doing: they are GNNs with multi-head attention as the neighbourhood aggregation function. Whereas standard GNNs aggregate features from their local neighbourhood nodes 
, Transformers for NLP treat the entire sentence 
 as the local neighbourhood, aggregating features from each word 
 at each layer.

Importantly, various problem-specific tricks–such as position encodings, causal/masked aggregation, learning rate schedules and extensive pre-training–are essential for the success of Transformers but seldom seem in the GNN community. At the same time, looking at Transformers from a GNN perspective could inspire us to get rid of a lot of the bells and whistles in the architecture.

What can we learn from each other?
Now that we’ve established a connection between Transformers and GNNs, let me throw some ideas around…

Are sentences fully-connected graphs?
Before statistical NLP and ML, linguists like Noam Chomsky focused on developing fomal theories of linguistic structure, such as syntax trees/graphs. Tree LSTMs already tried this, but maybe Transformers/GNNs are better architectures for bringing the world of linguistic theory and statistical NLP closer? For example, a very recent work from MILA and Stanford explores augmenting pre-trained Transformers such as BERT with syntax trees [Sachan et al., 2020].</div></div></div><div class="flex

Abstract 
We introduce Episodic Memory QA, the 
task of answering personal user questions 
grounded on memory graph (MG), where 
episodic memories and related entity nodes 
are connected via relational edges. We cre- 
ate a new benchmark dataset i rst by gen- 
erating synthetic memory graphs with simu- 
lated attributes, and by composing 100K QA 
pairs for the generated MG with bootstrapped 
scripts.To address the unique challenges 
for the proposed task, we propose Memory 
Graph Networks (MGN), a novel extension of 
memory networks to enable dynamic expan- 
sion of memory slots through graph traver- 
sals, thus able to answer queries in which con- 
texts from multiple linked episodes and exter- 
nal knowledge are required. We then propose 
the Episodic Memory QA Net with multiple 
module networks to effectively handle various 
question types.Empirical results show im- 
provement over the QA baselines in top-k an- 
swer prediction accuracy in the proposed task. 
The proposed model also generates a graph 
walk path and attention vectors for each pre- 
dicted answer, providing a natural way to ex- 
plain its QA reasoning. 
1Introduction 
The task of question and answering (QA) has been 
extensively studied, where many of the existing 
applications and datasets have been focused on 
the fact retrieval task from a large-scale knowl- 
edge graph (KG) (Bordes et al., 2015), or machine 
reading comprehension (MRC) approaches given 
unstructured text (Rajpurkar et al., 2018). In this 
work, we introduce the new task and dataset for 
Episodic Memory QA, in which the model an- 
swers personal and retrospective questions based 
on memory graphs (MG), where each episodic 
memory and its related entities (e.g. knowledge 
graph (KG) entities, participants, ...) are repre- 
Figure 1: Illustration of Episodic Memory QA with 
user queries and memory graphs (MG) with knowledge 
graph (KG) entities. Relevant memory nodes are pro- 
vided as initial memory slots via graph search lookup. 
The Memory Graph Network walks from the initial 
nodes to attend to relevant contexts and expands the 
memory slots when necessary. The main QA model 
takes these graph traversal paths and expanded memory 
slots as input, and predicts correct answers via multiple 
module networks (e.g. COUNT, CHOOSE, etc.) 
sented as the nodes connected via corresponding 
edges (Figure 1). Examples of such queries in- 
clude “Where did we go after we had brunch with 
Jon?”, “How many times did I go to jazz concerts 
last year?”, etc. For Episodic Memory QA, a ma- 
chine has to understand the contexts of a question 
and navigate multiple MG episode nodes as well 
as KG nodes to gather comprehensive information 
to match the query requirement. 
While the ability of querying a personal 
database could lead to many potential applica- 
tions, previous work in this domain (Jiang et al., 
2018) is limited due to the lack of a large-scale 
729 
Figure 3: Memory Graph Network (MGN) Walker. Input query q and candidate memory nodes m = {m(k)} 
are encoded with the query encoder and the memory encoder, respectively (left). The decoder (right) predicts both 
the optimal paths and the i nal nodes p = {pt}T 
t=1based on their relevance scores as well as soft-attention based 
walk paths, which expands the initial memory slots. 
Memory Graph Networks (MGN) (Section 2.2): 
Many previous work in QA or MRC systems 
use memory networks to evaluate multiple an- 
swer candidates with transitive reasoning, and typ- 
ically store all potentially relevant raw sentences 
or bag-of-symbols as memory slots.However, 
naive increase of memory slot size or retention- 
based sequential update of memory slots often in- 
crease search space for answer candidates, lead- 
ing to poor precision especially for the Episodic 
Memory QA task. To overcome this issue, with 
MGN we store memory graph nodes as initial 
memory slots, where additional contexts and an- 
swer candidates can be succinctly expanded and 
reached via graph traversals. For each (q,m(k)) 
pair, MGN predicts optimal memory slot expan- 
sionsteps: p(k)= {[p(k) 
e,t;p 
(k) 
n,t]}Tt=1foredgepaths 
peand corresponding node paths pn(Figure 3). 
QA Modules (Section 2.3, 2.4): An estimated an- 
swer ˆ a = QA(m,q) is predicted given a query 
and MGN graph path output from initial memory 
slots. Specif i cally, the model outputs a module 
program {u(k)} for several module networks (e.g. 
CHOOSE, COUNT, ...) via module selector, each 
of which produces an answer vector . The aggre- 
gatedresultofmodulenetworkoutputsdetermines 
the top-k answers. 
2.1Input Encoding 
Query encoder: We represent each textual query 
with an attention-based Bi-LSTM language model 
(Conneau et al., 2017) with GloVe (Pennington 
et al., 2014) distributed word embeddings trained 
on the Wikipedia and the Gigaword corpus with a 
total of 6B tokens. 
Memory encoder: We represent each memory 
node based on both its structural features (graph 
embeddings) and contextual multi-modal features 
from its neighboring nodes (e.g. attribute values). 
Structural contexts of each memory node (ms) 
are encoded via graph embeddings projection ap- 
proaches (Bordes et al., 2013), in which nodes 
with similar relation connectivity are mapped 
closer in the embeddings space. The model for 
obtaining embeddings from a MG (composed of 
subject-relation-object (s,r,o) triples) can be for- 
mulated as follows: 
P(Ir(s,o)=1|θ) = score?e(s),er(r),e(o)?(1) 
where Iris an indicator function of a known re- 
lation r for two entities (s,o) (1: valid relation, 0: 
unknownrelation), eisafunctionthatextractsem- 
beddings for entities, erextracts embeddings for 
relations, and score(·) is a function (e.g. multi- 
layer perceptrons) that produces a likelihood of a 
valid triple. 
For contextual representation of memories 
(mc), we compute attention-weighted sum of tex- 
tual representation of neighboring nodes and at- 
tributes (connected via rj∈ R), using the same 
731 
language model as the query encoder: 
mc= X 
γjmc,j 
γ = σ(Wqγq) 
Note that the query attention vector γ attenuates 
or amplif i es each attribute of memory based on a 
query vector to better account for query-memory 
compatibility accordingly. We then concatenate 
the structural features with semantic contextual 
features to obtain the i nal memory representation 
(m = [ms;mc]). 
2.2Memory Graph Network 
Inspired by the recently introduced graph traversal 
networks (Moon et al., 2019) which output dis- 
crete graph operations given input contexts, we 
formulate our MGN as follows. Given a set of ini- 
tial memory slots (m) and a query (q), the MGN 
model outputs a sequence path of walk steps (p) 
within MG to attend to relevant nodes or expand 
initial memory slots (Figure 3): 
{p(k)} = MGN(q,{m(k)})(2) 
Specif i cally,we def i ne the attention-based 
graph decoder model which prunes unattended 
paths, which effectively reduce the search space 
for memory expansion. We formulate the decod- 
ing steps for MGN as follows (bias terms for gates 
are omitted for simplicity of notation): 
it= σ(Whiht−1+ Wcict−1) 
ct= (1 − it) ? ct−1 
+ it? tanh(Wzczt+ Whcht−1) 
ot= σ(Wzozt+ Whoht−1+ Wcoct) 
ht= WALK(x,zt) = ot? tanh(ct)(3) 
where ztis a context vector at decoding step t, 
produced from the attention over graph relations 
which is def i ned as follows: 
x = Wqmx[q;m(k)] 
αt= σ(Whαht−1+ Wxαx) 
zt= ht−1+ X 
rj∈R 
αt,jrj(4) 
where αt∈ R|R|is 
an attention vector over the re- 
lations space, rkis relation embeddings, and ztis 
a resulting node context vector after walking from 
its previous node on an attended path. 
The graph decoder is trained with the ground- 
truth walk paths by computing the combined loss 
of Lwalk(m,q,p) 
= P 
i,tLe + Lnbetween 
pre- 
dicted paths and each of {pe,pn}, respectively 
(Le: loss for edge paths, and Lnfor node paths): 
X 
˜pe6=p(i) 
e,t 
max[0, ˜ pe· pe,t(i)−αtr· (p(i) 
e,t− ˜ ye) &gt;] 
+ X 
˜pn6=p(i) 
n,t 
max[0, ˜pn· pn,t(i)−ht(i)· (p(i) 
n,t− ˜ 
pn)&gt;] 
At test time, we expand the memory slots by 
activating the nodes along the optimal paths based 
on the sum of their relevance scores (left) and soft- 
attention-based output path scores (right) at each 
decoding step: 
p(k) 
n,t = argmax 
p(k) 
n ∈VR,1(p(k) 
n,t−1) 
ht· p(i) 
n &gt; + X 
αt,jrj· p(k) 
e &gt; 
(5) 
2.3Module Networks 
MGN outputs are then passed to module networks 
for the i nal stage of answer prediction. We ex- 
tend the previous work in module networks (Kot- 
tur et al., 2018), often used in VQA tasks, to 
accommodate for graph nodes output via MGN. 
We i rst formulate the module selector which out- 
puts the module label probability {u(k)} given in- 
put contexts for each memory node, trained with 
cross-entropy loss Lmodule: 
{u(k)} = Softmax(MLP(q,{m(k)}))(6) 
We then def i ne the memory attention to attenu- 
ate or amplify all activated memory nodes based 
on their compatibility with query, formulated as 
follows: β = MLP(q,{m(k)},{p(k)})(7) 
α = Softmax(W&gt; 
ββ) ∈ R 
K (8) For this work, we propose the following four 
modules: CHOOSE, COUNT, CONFIRM, SET OR, 
and SET AND, hence u(k)∈ R5. 
Note that the 
formulation can be extended to the auto-regressive 
decoder in case sequential execution of modules is 
required. 
CHOOSE module outputs answer space vector 
by assigning weighted sum scores to nodes along 
the MGN soft-attention walk paths.End nodes 
with the most probable walk paths thus get the 
732 
highest scores, and their node attribute values are 
considered as answer candidates. COUNT mod- 
ule counts the query-compatible among the ac- 
tivated nodes, a = W&gt; 
K([α;max{α};min{α}]). 
CONFIRM uses a similar approach to COUNT, ex- 
cept it outputs a binary label indicating whether 
the memory nodes match the query condition: 
a = W&gt; 
b ([α;max{α};min{α}]). SET modules 
either combine or i nd intersection among answer 
candidates by updating the answer vectors with 
a = max{W&gt; 
s{a(k)}} or a = min{W&gt;s{a(k)}}. 
2.4Answer Decoding 
Answers from each module network (Section 2.3 
are then aggregated as weighted sum of answer 
vectors with module probability (Eq.6), guided by 
memory attention (Eq.7). Predicted answers are 
evaluated with cross-entropy loss Lans 
Weobservethatthemodelperformsbetterwhen 
the MGN component of the model is pre-trained 
with ground-truth paths. We thus i rst train the 
MGN network with the same training split (with- 
out answer labels), and then train the entire model 
with module networks, fully end-to-end super- 
vised with L = Lwalk+ Lmodule+ Lans.

Graph Networks for Explainable Memory-grounded Question Answering" by Seungwhan Moon et al. from Facebook Assistant. Both concepts involve using graph structures to improve the memory and explainability of neural network models. Let's explore the similarities and connections:</p><ol><li><p><strong>Memory Grounding in Graph Structures</strong>:</p><ul><li>Both "Retentive Graph Networks" and "Memory Graph Networks" imply that a graph structure is used to represent and retain information. This can be episodic memories in the case of the Facebook Assistant paper or long-range dependencies in text for language models.</li></ul></li><li><p><strong>Graph Traversals for Information Retrieval</strong>:</p><ul><li>Memory Graph Networks (MGN) use graph traversal to dynamically expand memory slots and access relevant information for answering questions. The idea of "Retentive Graph Networks" could similarly involve traversing through stored information in a structured manner to retain and utilize knowledge over time.</li></ul></li><li><p><strong>Explainability Through Graph Paths</strong>:</p><ul><li>MGNs provide a natural way to explain their reasoning by generating a graph walk path and attention vectors for each predicted answer. The notion of "Retentive Graph Networks" would also benefit from such explainability features, as understanding the network's decision-making process is crucial, especially in complex tasks like language understanding.</li></ul></li><li><p><strong>Handling Complex Data Structures</strong>:</p><ul><li>Just as Memory Graph Networks are designed to handle complex queries based on a user's memory graph, "Retentive Graph Networks" could be conceptualized to manage complex data structures, such as the interdependencies in large language models.</li></ul></li><li><p><strong>Dynamic Memory and Computation</strong>:</p><ul><li>MGNs propose a dynamic memory expansion mechanism through graph traversals. Similarly, "Retentive Graph Networks" could incorporate mechanisms for dynamic memory retention, possibly drawing on the strengths of both Transformers and GNNs.</li></ul></li></ol><p>In summary, "Retentive Graph Networks" as a concept encapsulates the ideas of using structured graph representations to encode, retrieve, and reason with large amounts of information dynamically. This concept aligns with the work presented in the Facebook Assistant paper, which uses Memory Graph Networks to answer personal user questions grounded in memory graphs, showcasing a method for neural networks to retain and process information efficiently and explainably.</p></div></div></div><div class="flex justify-between empty:hidden gizmo:mt-1 gizmo:justify-start gizmo:gap-3 lg:block

neural network architectures that combine the principles of graph neural networks (GNNs) with memory retention capabilities inspired by the fields of NLP and logical inference. Drawing from the breadth of our conversation, here's an overview of what RGNs might encompass:</p><ol><li><p><strong>Graph-Based Structure</strong>:</p><ul><li>Like GNNs, RGNs would leverage the power of graph-based data structures to represent complex relationships within data. Nodes in these graphs could represent entities or concepts, while edges would capture the interactions or dependencies between them.</li></ul></li><li><p><strong>Memory Retention</strong>:</p><ul><li>Inspired by memory networks and Retentive Networks, RGNs would integrate mechanisms to retain and recall information over time, akin to episodic memory in humans. This feature would be crucial for tasks that require an understanding of context or history, such as question answering based on past interactions.</li></ul></li><li><p><strong>Scalability and Efficiency</strong>:</p><ul><li>Drawing on ideas from sharding and advancements in transformers, RGNs would be designed for scalability, allowing them to handle large datasets and high-dimensional state spaces efficiently. This could involve techniques to parallelize computation and distribute the model's parameters across multiple processing units.</li></ul></li><li><p><strong>Explainability</strong>:</p><ul><li>Following the lead of Memory Graph Networks, RGNs would incorporate explainability into their core, providing insights into the reasoning behind their outputs. This could be achieved through mechanisms that track and visualize the graph traversal paths taken during the decision-making process.</li></ul></li><li><p><strong>Attention and Recurrence</strong>:</p><ul><li>RGNs would integrate attention mechanisms to selectively focus on relevant parts of the graph structure. They might also include recurrent aspects to process sequential data or to capture dynamic changes in the graph over time.</li></ul></li><li><p><strong>Physical and Logical Consistency</strong>:</p><ul><li>In line with the geometric version of the Weisfeiler-Leman test, RGNs would ensure consistency with underlying physical symmetries such as rotation and translation, making them applicable to domains like molecular biology where spatial relationships are key.</li><li>The models would also reflect logical structures, potentially drawing from Karl Popper's contributions to logic, to ensure that inference and reasoning tasks are grounded in robust logical foundations.</li></ul></li><li><p><strong>Complexity Management</strong>:</p><ul><li>To manage complexity, RGNs would likely adopt advanced techniques such as those found in RetNet, such as chunkwise processing for long sequences, ensuring efficient computation without compromising performance.</li></ul></li></ol><p>In essence, Retentive Graph Networks would be a synthesis of multiple AI disciplines, aiming to create a versatile and powerful tool for modeling complex systems that evolve over time and require a nuanced understanding of a vast web of relationships. This would make them suitable for a wide range of applications, from personal digital assistants to advanced scientific modeling tools.</p></div></div></div><div class="flex justify-between

Our conversation wove together discussions on artificial intelligence, cognitive processes, and cosmological theories:

1. We looked at AI learning and processing, comparing it to human methods like the Tree of Self-Reflection and Zettelkasten.

2. We considered cognitive phenomena such as the Stroop Test to understand perception and thought.

3. The discussion included ethical AI development, referencing Asimov's Laws and historical dialogues.

4. We delved into advanced cosmological theories, discussing the structure and dynamics of the universe, and the application of Poincaré recurrence to a zero-energy cosmological model.

5. We touched on the use of 5D Ising models and generative adversarial networks for simulating and understanding complex systems.

6. The conversation also involved archaeological insights from the Bruniquel Cave structures, pondering Neanderthal cognitive capacities.

7. This melded into a debate on the universe's expansion, considering alternate interpretations of cosmic microwave background and baryon acoustic oscillations.

Overall, the dialogue was a technical examination of information processing in both AI and human contexts, ethical considerations in technology, and a theoretical framework for understanding the universe's evolution.</div></div></div><div class="flex justify-between empty:hidden gizmo:mt-1 gizmo:justify-start gizmo:gap-3 lg:block gizmo:lg:flex"><div class="text-xs flex items-center

cosmology, ethics in technology, and historical insights, each contributing to a comprehensive understanding of complex systems—whether they are computational models, human cognition, or the universe itself. Here's how "Retentive Graph Networks" might tie into these varied domains:</p><ol><li><p><strong>AI Learning and Human Cognitive Methods</strong>:</p><ul><li>RGNs could model the associative and reflective processes seen in the Tree of Self-Reflection and Zettelkasten by using graph structures to represent and link concepts in a way that mirrors human thought patterns and memory retrieval.</li></ul></li><li><p><strong>Cognitive Phenomena and Perception</strong>:</p><ul><li>They could simulate cognitive tests like the Stroop Test, allowing for an analysis of how different stimuli can be processed and how conflicting information can be resolved within a network.</li></ul></li><li><p><strong>Ethical AI Development</strong>:</p><ul><li>RGNs would operate within ethical constraints, akin to Asimov's Laws, to ensure that their decision-making processes do not lead to harmful outcomes. Their explainability features could help in making ethical decision-making transparent.</li></ul></li><li><p><strong>Cosmological Theories</strong>:</p><ul><li>In the realm of cosmology, RGNs might be used to model complex theories of the universe's structure and dynamics, possibly incorporating ideas from zero-energy cosmological models and Poincaré recurrence.</li></ul></li><li><p><strong>5D Ising Models and GANs</strong>:</p><ul><li>They could be employed to simulate physical systems, akin to 5D Ising models, by representing physical entities as nodes and their interactions as edges. They might also work alongside generative adversarial networks to generate new, complex data patterns for study.</li></ul></li><li><p><strong>Archaeological Insights and Cognitive Capacities</strong>:</p><ul><li>RGNs could be utilized to model and understand cognitive capacities, such as those suggested by the Bruniquel Cave structures, by representing archaeological findings in a graph format and simulating potential cognitive processes.</li></ul></li><li><p><strong>Universe's Expansion and Cosmological Data</strong>:</p><ul><li>They could be applied to interpret cosmological data, such as cosmic microwave background radiation and baryon acoustic oscillations, by modeling the universe as a vast graph with nodes representing celestial bodies and edges representing gravitational and other cosmological interactions.</li></ul></li></ol><p>In your multidisciplinary research, Retentive Graph Networks could be a unifying tool, providing a versatile framework for modeling and understanding the complex interrelations and dynamics present in both artificial and natural systems. Their ability to dynamically expand and adapt makes them particularly well-suited to encapsulate processes that span the micro to the macro scale, from the cognitive processes of ancient humans to the vast structures of the cosmos.</p></div></div></div><div class="flex justify-between empty:hidden gizmo:mt-1 gizmo:justify-start gizmo:gap-3 lg:block gizmo:lg:flex"><div class="text-gray-400 flex

Let's call that section three. Before that we discussed:

Section one.

1. Karl Popper's Contributions to Logic
2. Video Game Engine in Your Head
3. Quantum Mechanics as a Video Game
4. Sharding in Transformers for Large Context Windows
5. Retentive Network (RetNet) for Large Language Models
6. Expressive Power of Geometric Graph Neural Networks (GNNs)
7. Your Green Marker Drawing: Transformers as Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) in Disguise

Section Two

1. **DALL·E Image Generation**
   - We explored the capabilities of DALL·E, an AI model that generates images from text descriptions.

2. **Creating a Transformer Robot Drawing**
   - We generated a drawing of a transformer robot based on your description.

3. **Choosing a Conversation Title**
   - We discussed and selected the title "Retentive Graph Networks" for this conversation.

4. **Memory Graph Networks for QA**
   - We reviewed a research paper titled "Memory Graph Networks for Explainable Memory-grounded Question Answering" by Seungwhan Moon, Pararth Shah, Anuj Kumar, and Rajen Subba. This paper introduced the concept of Episodic Memory QA and Memory Graph Networks (MGN) for addressing it.

5. **Overview of Retentive Graph Networks**
   - We provided an overview of what Retentive Graph Networks might encompass, drawing inspiration from various topics discussed in this conversation, including graph-based structures, memory retention, scalability, explainability, attention mechanisms, physical and logical consistency, and complexity management.</div></div></div><div class="flex justify-between empty:hidden gizmo:mt-1

section, we laid the foundational concepts that are relevant to Retentive Graph Networks.</li><li>Topics covered include Karl Popper's Contributions to Logic, the idea of a Video Game Engine in Your Head, the analogy of Quantum Mechanics as a Video Game, sharding in Transformers for Large Context Windows, Retentive Network (RetNet) for Large Language Models, the Expressive Power of Geometric Graph Neural Networks (GNNs), and Your Green Marker Drawing: Transformers as Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) in Disguise.</li></ul><p><strong>Section Two: Visualizing AI with DALL·E and Memory Graph Networks</strong></p><ul><li>In this section, we explored the visual aspect of AI and its relationship with memory.</li><li>Topics covered include DALL·E Image Generation, Creating a Transformer Robot Drawing with DALL·E, Choosing a Conversation Title ("Retentive Graph Networks"), and delving into the research paper "Memory Graph Networks for Explainable Memory-grounded Question Answering."</li></ul><p><strong>Section Three: The Essence of Retentive Graph Networks</strong></p><ul><li>This section serves as the heart of the conversation, where we discuss the core concepts and potential elements of Retentive Graph Networks.</li><li>Topics include Memory Retention, Scalability, Explainability, Attention Mechanisms, Physical and Logical Consistency, Complexity Management, and how these ideas come together in the concept of Retentive Graph Networks.</li></ul><p>If you have any specific questions or if there's anything else you'd like to explore within these sections, please

Here's a summary of the entire conversation on "Retentive Graph Networks":</p><hr><p><strong>Section One: "Foundations of Thought"</strong></p><p>In this section, we delved into various topics related to cognition and artificial intelligence:</p><ol><li>We explored Karl Popper's contributions to logic and the philosophy of science.</li><li>Analogy was used to explain the concept of a video game engine in the mind.</li><li>Quantum mechanics was likened to a video game with its own set of rules.</li><li>Transformers were introduced, and sharding was discussed in the context of handling large context windows.</li><li>We explored Retentive Networks (RetNet) and their application to large language models.</li><li>The expressive power of Geometric Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) was discussed.</li><li>We created a drawing of a transformer robot using AI.</li></ol><p><strong>Section Two: "AI and Imaging"</strong></p><p>This section focused on AI image generation and understanding:</p><ol><li>We experimented with DALL·E, an AI model for generating images from text descriptions.</li><li>A drawing of a transformer robot was created based on your description.</li><li>We selected the title "Retentive Graph Networks" for the conversation.</li><li>A research paper titled "Memory Graph Networks for Explainable Memory-grounded Question Answering" was summarized.</li><li>An overview of what Retentive Graph Networks might encompass was provided, incorporating ideas from various topics in the conversation.</li></ol><p><strong>Section Three: "Concluding Thoughts"</strong></p><p>In this final section, we wrapped up the conversation:</p><ol><li>We discussed the organization of the conversation into three sections.</li><li>You shared some insights into the limitations of your Nuspeak Translator and its handling of image generation.</li><li>We explored the reasons behind the AI's decisions during the conversation.</li><li>You requested a final summary of the entire conversation.</li></ol><p>Overall, the dialogue spanned topics from philosophy to AI, with a focus on memory networks, image generation, and the exploration of Retentive Graph Networks as a theoretical framework.</p><hr><p>If you have any more questions or if there's anything else you'd like to discuss or explore, please feel free to let me know!</p></div></div></div><div class="flex justify-between empty:hidden gizmo:mt-1 gizmo:justify-start gizmo:gap-3 lg:block gizmo:lg:flex"><div class="text-gray-400 flex self-end lg:self-center

concept that draws inspiration from various discussions in this conversation. At its core, RetNet is an advanced form of neural network designed to process and retain information in a graph-based structure. It takes cues from graph neural networks (GNNs) and memory-based models to create a sophisticated framework for information retention, processing, and reasoning.</p><p>RetNet's primary goal is to address the challenge of handling vast amounts of complex and interconnected data. It excels at maintaining contextual information and connections over time, making it well-suited for tasks that require long-term memory and reasoning. This network leverages attention mechanisms to focus on relevant information while ensuring both physical and logical consistency within the graph.</p><p>One of RetNet's key features is scalability. It can efficiently handle large-scale data, making it applicable in various domains, from natural language processing to cosmological simulations. Its explainability and interpretability aspects enable users to understand how the network arrives at its conclusions, enhancing transparency in AI systems.</p><p>Additionally, RetNet incorporates techniques to manage computational complexity, ensuring that it remains practical for real-world applications. Overall, Retentive Graph Networks represent a cutting-edge approach to AI and knowledge representation, bridging the gap between information retention, processing, and advanced reasoning capabilities.</p></div></div></div><div class="flex justify-between empty:hidden gizmo:mt-1 gizmo:justify-start gizmo:gap-3 lg:block gizmo:lg:flex"><div class="text-gray-400 flex self-end
