virtual storage Descriptive of the capabil-
ity to use online secondary storage devices
and specialized software to divide programs
into smaller segments for transmission to and
from internal storage in order to significantly
increase the effective size of the available
internal storage
visual display terminal A device capable
of displaying keyed input and CPU output on
a cathode ray tube
VLSI (Very Large Scale Integration) The
packing of hundreds of thousands of elec-
tronic components on a single semiconductor
chip
voice-grade channels Medium-speed data
transmission channels that use telephone
communications facilities.
volatile storage A storage medium that
loses its contents in the event of a power in-
terruption.
von Neumann bottleneck A reference to
the fact that processing speed in a von Neu-
mann machine is limited by the speed of (1)
the circuits in the single channel used to
carry instructions from primary storage to
the control section, and (2) the circuits in the
single data path between primary storage and
the arithmetic-logic section.
von Neumann machine A computer sys-
tem whose CPU has a single control, pri-
mary storage, and arithmetic-logic section.
Such a machine follows the design approach
developed by John von Neumann and others
in the mid-1940s.

Here are concise explanations for the terms you've provided, each relating to different aspects of computer science and technology:
Virtual Storage
: This refers to the ability of a computer system to use secondary storage devices (like hard drives) and specialized software to break programs into smaller segments. These segments are transferred to and from internal memory (RAM), effectively increasing the size of available memory for processing.
Visual Display Terminal
: A device that shows both user input and computer output on a cathode ray tube (CRT) screen. Commonly used in older computer systems, these terminals display text and graphics based on data received from a central processing unit (CPU).
VLSI (Very Large Scale Integration)
: A technology in semiconductor manufacturing where hundreds of thousands of electronic components, like transistors, are integrated onto a single chip. This advancement allows for more complex and powerful microprocessors and memory chips.
Voice-Grade Channels
: These are communication channels, typically used in telephone systems, designed for medium-speed data transmission. They are sufficient for transmitting voice and can be adapted for data transmission, although they are not as fast as modern broadband connections.
Volatile Storage
: A type of computer memory that requires power to maintain its information. When power is lost or turned off, the data stored in this type of memory is also lost. RAM is a common example of volatile storage.
Von Neumann Bottleneck
: This term refers to a limitation in computer architecture designs based on the Von Neumann model. The bottleneck is caused by the limited throughput between the CPU and its memory due to a single data path and control channel, which restricts the speed of processing.
Von Neumann Machine
: A computer system architecture developed in the mid-1940s by John von Neumann and others. It features a single control unit, arithmetic-logic unit, and a common memory for storing data and instructions. This architecture forms the basis of most modern computers.
