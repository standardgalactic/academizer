means of computer operations.)

procedures, and routines associated with the
operation of a computer system. Contrast
with hardware.
solid-state Descriptive of electronic com-
ponents whose operation depends on the
control of electric or magnetic phenomena in
solids, such as transistors and diodes.
sort To arrange data into a predetermined
sequence.
source language The language that is an
input for statement translation.
A computer program
source program
written in a source language such as BASIC,
FORTRAN, COBOL, etc.

Here are the shortened definitions for these terms:
Sequential Processing
: A method of data processing where tasks are completed one after another in a specific order. Also known as batch processing.
Serial Access
: A storage method where data access time depends on the physical location of the data, with each piece of data accessed sequentially.
Serial Interface
: A connection that transmits data one bit at a time over a single path, in contrast to parallel interfaces which transmit multiple bits simultaneously.
Simplex Transmission
: A communication method that allows data to be sent in only one direction.
Simulation
: The process of modeling a real or theoretical system to study its behavior and properties, often using a computer.
Software
: The collection of programs, procedures, and routines associated with the operation of a computer system, in contrast to the physical components, or hardware.
Solid-State
: Pertaining to electronic devices made from solid materials, such as transistors and diodes, without moving parts.
Sort
: The process of arranging data in a specific sequence or order.
Source Language
: The original language in which a program is written, before it is translated into machine language.
Source Program
: A program written in a high-level language such as BASIC, FORTRAN, or COBOL, before being compiled or interpreted for execution by a computer.

program
spreadsheet
spreadsheet program.
statement In programming, an expression
or generalized instruction in a source lan-
guage.
storage Descriptive of a device or medium
that can accept data, hold them, and deliver
them on demand at a later time. Synonymous
with memory
structured programming An approach or
discipline used in the design and coding of
computer programs. The approach generally
assumes the disciplined use of a few basic
coding structures and the use of top-down
concepts to decompose main functions into
lower-level components for modular coding
purposes.
supercomputer Computer systems charac-
terized by their very large size and very high processing speeds. Generally used for com-
plex seientific applications
supervisor See executive routine.
system (1) A grouping of integrated meth-
ods and procedures united to form an orga-
nized entity; (2) an organized grouping of
peopie, methods, machines, and materials
collected together to accomplish a set of spe-
cific objectives.
system analysis A detailed step-by-step
investigation of related procedures to see
what must be done and the best way of doing
IT.
system analyst One who studies the activi-
ties, methods, procedures, and techniques of
organizational systems in order to determine
what actions need to be taken and how these
actions can best be accomplished.
system commands The means by which
programmers communicate with the operat-
ing system of the computer

Here are the shortened definitions for these terms:
Spooler Program
: Software that manages the CPU's multitasking, allowing it to switch between user activities and other operations like printing.
Spreadsheet Program
: A type of software that allows users to organize, calculate, and analyze data in a tabular format.
Statement
: In programming, a single instruction or expression written in a source language.
Storage
: Devices or media that store data for retrieval at a later time; synonymous with memory.
Structured Programming
: A programming methodology that emphasizes clear, structured control flow, often using top-down design and modular coding.
Supercomputer
: A highly powerful computer system known for its large size and exceptional processing speed, typically used for complex scientific calculations.
Supervisor
: Another term for an executive routine in a computer system's operating system.
System
: 1) An organized set of methods and procedures forming a unified whole; 2) An arrangement of people, methods, machines, and materials working towards specific objectives.
System Analysis
: The detailed examination of processes and procedures to determine the best methods for accomplishing tasks.
System Analyst
: A professional who evaluates organizational systems to identify necessary actions and optimal methods for implementation.
System Commands
: Instructions used by programmers to interact with a computer's operating system.
