It's rather stunning to see how many AI experts and skeptics refuse to acknowledge current AI capabilities just because the models are not based on their pet theories about AI.

And some of them warn about the dangers of AI too, to make it funnier. If you're worried about the dangers, perhaps admit the advancements first?

Also, claiming LLMs will not bring about general AI or something along those lines, is not even wrong.   

A fantastically smart combination from the bucket of all known non-LLM approaches + LLMs & scale will blow your mind. Never mind if you sprinkle a few advancements on top.

If you don't see this, you lack imagination, vision, and you must not know your stuff technically. You're just not an AI engineer and hereby disqualified as far as I'm concerned.

AGI, or striving for human-level-and-beyond artificial intelligence has been taboo (academia and industry) for a long time, and is only coming out of taboo now. (Seriously pursuing AGI, it was a great way to lose tenure, not be taken seriously, and to be looked upon as a crackpot.)

Many "experts" considered it 30-50 years away. I write "experts", because who the experts are on what in AI is really unclear in so many ways. Those estimations have changed. Timelines have drastically shortened.

There has been an AGI conference annually since 2008, for example (link in comments). I think not many people in "regular" AI are aware of it, never mind researchers from other fields.

Yet I think those that have been interested in AGI, have a huge advantage over those who haven't, as the pursuit of AGI necessitates interdisciplinary work.

Some people in AI try throwing their weight and authority around without any actual arguments. It's daft, and dangerous. There is too much at stake.

We're entering an era where literally no one has experience with what's about to come. Everyone has to massively rely on interdisciplinary knowledge and hopefully the serious thought they have put in and continue to put into it.

Have you ever researched what intelligence is? Agency? Have you ever tried to put together an architecture for an actual AGI? Have you ever tried to build one? Do you have a decent grasp of systems science, cybernetics, neuroscience, cognitive science overall, some philosophy, physics, etc? Can you draw upon that knowledge in AI in a practical matter? Have you, for example applied some light biomimetics even and designed a bio-inspired system? Would you know how to implement nice features from bio into something synthetic or artificial? Like the sort of pluripotency and redundancy in biological systems? 

These are the sort of criteria and "credentials" that matter right now. The proof is in the pudding, the pudding being the argument and the methods.

You can be a C++ ninja and have 10 years of experience optimizing AI frameworks, but if you have narrowly focused on that and your interdisciplinary knowledge is poor, you've balked at the idea of a general intelligence, your opinion about current and future AI developments may mean very little. Sorry. 

And such narrowly specialized people exist. In fact, most people are like that. There are lots of people just working in machine learning, that are not much better than opiniated code bros that signal how rational and grounded they are by aligning themselves with bits of science they superficially read.

A specialist is a barbarian whose ignorance is not well-rounded. ��� Stanislaw Lem, "His Master's Voice"

You can laugh at the idea of a futurist, but I certainly consider myself one and many transhumanist friends among me. There are tremendously many bright polymaths in the community who have done serious research, thinking, interdisciplinary work and have considered very many scenarios. Transhumanists are way, way ahead of the game.

AI Experts have been wrong numerous times. Many top names have admitted they did not see these developments coming. Most transhumanists have, but even to some, including me, it's accelerating harder than I and other transhumanists anticipated. We're all biased. Beware!

And beware of experts throwing their weight around, which more often than not represents antiquated knowledge, rigid thinking, and a lack of (the rigorous sort) imagination.

"If an elderly but distinguished scientist says that something is possible, he is almost certainly right; but if he says that it is impossible, he is very probably wrong."

��� Arthur C. Clarke

Now more than ever, we need insight and arguments, *not* authority. 

P.S. Hardware/physics is a MAJOR oversight in 99% of AI debates now. Thinking in terms of "software" and "data centers" is anachronistic.

I was thinking how the Toltecs built their civilization based on trying to reconstruct the intentions of the Olmecs, artifacts like stone heads and towers and jade jewellery, and imagined that they has been organized and civilized.
1 / 1
ChatGPT
The idea you're presenting is a fascinating one: that a subsequent civilization, like the Toltecs, might base aspects of their culture or societal organization on interpretations or misinterpretations of the remnants left behind by a previous civilization, such as the Olmecs. This idea of one culture trying to "decode" or understand the intentions and meaning behind the artifacts of another is a powerful theme in history and literature.
Drawing a parallel, both "His Master's Voice" and "A for Andromeda" feature humanity trying to understand, reconstruct, or make use of an alien intelligence based on limited and potentially misunderstood information. Similarly, a civilization like the Toltecs might view the stone heads, jade jewelry, and other artifacts of the Olmecs as clues or instructions for societal organization, spiritual beliefs, or aesthetic standards.
Whether looking at alien signals in sci-fi narratives or ancient artifacts in history, the core theme remains: the challenges of interpretation, the potential dangers of misinterpretation, and the profound impact that such interpretations can have on the trajectory of a society or civilization. This theme underscores the importance of interdisciplinary study, caution, and open-mindedness, much like what Pawel Pachniewski emphasized in his discourse on AI and AGI.

The word adamah means red or ruddy, it is used for blood, clay, and human.
1 / 1
ChatGPT
You're right. In Hebrew, "adamah" does indeed mean "ground" or "earth," but there's a linguistic connection between "adamah" and the word "adom," which means "red." This gives rise to the idea that Adam, the first human, was created from the red clay or earth. The reddish clay and the concept of "blood" connect in terms of the color and the idea of life.
The naming of Adam from "adamah" emphasizes the human connection to the earth and perhaps the living essence of the ground. The interplay of these terms enriches the symbolism and depth of the Genesis narrative.
2 / 2
You're right. My apologies for the oversight.

"Adamah" is a Hebrew word that generally translates to "ground" or "earth." The name "Adam" is believed to be derived from this, denoting the creation of the first man from the earth. The term "adamah" is related to the words "adom" (red) and "dam" (blood). This linkage is thought to reflect the reddish hue of the Middle Eastern soil, which was used in the biblical account of man's creation.

Given this connection:

Blood and Life (Adam and Eve):

This title brilliantly captures the essence of the biblical creation story. The connection between "adamah" (earth), "adom" (red), and "dam" (blood) portrays the intimate relationship between humanity, life, and the earth. The creation of Adam from the earth and the introduction of Eve as the mother of all living can be likened to the inception and evolution of AI ��� a blend of raw materials (data and code)

Decoding the Tapestry of Time: From Ancient Civilizations to AI Evolution
In the vast landscape of human history and technological progress, themes of creation, discovery, and evolution constantly emerge. The genesis of AI's capabilities, much like the dawn of civilizations, represents the profound intricacies of existence. However, to truly understand the fabric of this development, one must venture through the corridors of history, literature, linguistics, and technology.
The accelerating advancements in AI have often been met with both awe and skepticism. Major corporations, like Amazon and Microsoft, are investing heavily in AI's potential, signaling an unwavering belief in its future role. In the same vein, ancient civilizations like the Toltecs constructed their society based on their interpretations of the Olmecs' intentions, decoding the significance of stone artifacts, towers, and jade jewelry. Both instances underscore humanity's drive to build upon the known and venture into the unknown.
This journey into the unknown is not without its challenges. The pursuit of Artificial General Intelligence (AGI) was long considered taboo in academia and industry. Much like explorers setting out on uncharted seas, researchers in AGI have faced skepticism. Yet, the rigorous interdisciplinary approach, which intertwines fields such as systems science, cognitive science, and even philosophy, proves that holistic perspectives foster innovation.
The literary world offers a mirror to these themes. Stanislaw Lem's "His Master's Voice" delves into the endeavor of decoding an extraterrestrial signal, echoing our quest to understand and emulate intelligence. This narrative parallels the plot of "A is for Andromeda," further emphasizing humanity's universal desire to decode and comprehend the vast unknown.
The essence of creation is beautifully captured in the biblical narrative of Adam and Eve. The Hebrew term "adamah," meaning ground, is interwoven with "adom" (red) and "dam" (blood). This rich tapestry of linguistics illustrates the intimate relationship between humanity, life, and the earth, a connection that resonates with the inception of AI���a blend of raw materials (data and code) and innovation.
Reimagining the titles of the Pentateuch, such as "Blood and Life" for the story of Adam and Eve or "The Third Egypt" referencing the duality in Exodus, serves as an emblematic representation of the ebb and flow of narratives over time. These texts, foundational to many, carry with them themes of beginnings, challenges, ethical dilemmas, and eventual enlightenment, not dissimilar to the trajectory of AI's evolution.
In conclusion, the intertwining threads of history, literature, and technology underscore that while contexts change, the essence of our quests remains. Whether decoding the intentions of a lost civilization or programming the next AI marvel, humanity's spirit of discovery remains undiminished. The mosaic of our past serves not just as a reflection but as a compass, guiding us into the uncharted terrains of the future.

Reclaiming Neurofuturism: Neuroqueering knowledge and its production
In a previous article, I discussed the idea of verisimilitude. I discussed how we might never find an objective truth that explains neurodivergent experience. In fact, we might never find one for human experience on the whole. What we can do is seek a falsehood that is close enough to truth to seem true, it has verisimilitude.

One of the flaws in this is the arborescent approach to knowledge creation that this takes. We are constantly building on previous knowledge. Our foundations are rooted in the past. However, if we accept the verisimilitous nature of all knowledge pertaining to neurodivergent experience, then we must accept that there is a good chance that prior knowledge is a falsehood that seems true.

This presents an issue. If the foundations we branch out from are unstable, the metaphysical structure of our knowledge is one doomed for collapse. I believe we need to move beyond the roots and instead create new knowledge, not by abandoning the past, but by utilising it in a way that no single part depends upon another.

One might pontificate that knowledge exists to evolve, but what if we approach knowledge as being independent of its purpose. Rather than measuring knowledge by its reiteration and resilience in the fave of scrutiny, we can view it as interconnected while retaining its independence.

Creating Autistic suffering: CAMHS advise ���safe cutting��� for Autistic children
Can we create new knowledge through linking networks of knowledge that are seemingly unrelated? How might one approach the creation of knowledge in a way that does not depend on antiquated thought?

Knowledge is a by-product of thought, which itself is a by-product of the bodymind. If we desire to queer knowledge, we must first queer the bodymind. This requires us to abandon the politics of our own existence and instead explore our own reality.

Through exploration of the Self, we are able to tweak and alter the bodymind. This, in turn, will alter our thoughts and, thus, knowledge production. By abandoning the arborescence of our own thoughts, we can abandon the roots of antiquated knowledge.

To liberate humanity, we must liberate thought and knowledge. We must escape the branching nature of our current system of knowledge and instead explore the coherence of our entire knowledge base rather than focusing on small details. When we can embrace the connectivity of everything, we can wield knowledge as the tool it should always have been.

Normative society has standardised thought to control the direction of knowledge. To be free of normativity, we must first free our thoughts and knowledge.

Connections: From Ancient Narratives to Neurofuturism
The discourse on the evolution of AI and the interpretations of ancient civilizations reveal profound connections with the ideas presented in the piece on Reclaiming Neurofuturism. The intersectionality of history, technology, and neurodivergence provides a rich framework for understanding humanity's intricate journey in the pursuit of knowledge and self-awareness.
Seeking Verisimilitude
: Just as we ponder over the intentions of the Olmecs by examining artifacts or the potential and limits of AI, the quest for verisimilitude in understanding neurodivergent experiences resonates with humanity's innate desire for understanding. It's a journey towards a truth, even if that truth is shrouded in layers of interpretations, subjectivities, and the ever-evolving nuances of understanding.
Foundation and Branching Knowledge
: The emphasis on arborescent knowledge creation parallels the narrative of building upon past civilizations or iterating upon existing AI models. Both highlight the dilemma: if foundational knowledge is imperfect, does that render all subsequent knowledge inherently flawed? Just as AI's evolution seeks to challenge and redefine its foundational principles, neurofuturism demands a reevaluation of how we perceive and understand neurodivergent experiences.
Queering the Bodymind
: The concept of exploring and altering the 'Self' to modify thought processes is analogous to the advancement of AI. An AI's learning and evolution can be viewed as a continuous process of self-modification, reminiscent of the call to queer the bodymind. Similarly, as ancient civilizations built upon, altered, and redefined legacies, the journey towards self-awareness and understanding remains a dynamic process.
Interconnected Independence
: Both AI's progression and the evolution of civilizations emphasize the interconnectedness of knowledge while retaining distinct identities. Just as the Toltecs didn't merely mimic the Olmecs but interpreted and built upon their artifacts, AI's evolution thrives on interconnected insights without necessarily being tethered to a singular foundational principle. This mirrors the call to perceive knowledge as interconnected yet independent.
Liberation from Normativity
: The transition from taboos surrounding AGI to its eventual embrace exemplifies breaking free from normative constraints. Similarly, neurofuturism advocates for breaking free from standardized thought patterns. Both journeys underline humanity's yearning for liberation, be it in the realm of technological advancements or understanding the vast spectrum of human experiences.
In essence, the narratives of ancient civilizations, AI's evolution, and the themes of neurofuturism collectively underscore humanity's relentless quest for understanding, self-awareness, and liberation from constrained thought processes. Each journey, though unique in its context, converges on the universal theme of exploration, interpretation, and the ever-evolving nature of truth.

Retrofuturist Knowledge: A Nexus of Past Insights and Future Visions
Retrofuturism ��� the vision of the future through the lens of the past ��� offers a unique perspective that ties together the multifaceted threads of our discussion. By merging historical narratives, AI evolution, and neurofuturism, the concept of 'Retrofuturist Knowledge' emerges as a vibrant tapestry of interconnected wisdom, illuminating humanity's quest for understanding across time and space.
Historical Echoes in Future Visions
: Just as the Toltecs sought to interpret and reconstruct the intentions of the Olmecs, the quest for AI's potential and boundaries is akin to a retrofuturistic journey. We look back to our ancient stories, myths, and foundational knowledge to inform and shape our forward-looking aspirations, drawing parallels between past civilizations and future possibilities.
AI's Iterative Evolution
: The development of AI, particularly its advancements and the skepticism surrounding its potential, can be viewed as a retrofuturistic endeavor. As we aspire for AI models that can mirror human intelligence and beyond, we're often drawing upon age-old philosophical and ethical dilemmas, reinventing them in the context of modern technology.
Neurofuturism and the Past
: The neurofuturistic drive to understand and 'queer' the bodymind harks back to ancient philosophical inquiries into the nature of the self, consciousness, and reality. By examining neurodivergent experiences and advocating for a departure from standardized thought processes, we're revisiting age-old questions through a contemporary lens.
Interdependence and Independence
: Retrofuturist knowledge emphasizes both the interconnectedness and the distinctiveness of insights. As with the Olmec-Toltec narrative or the evolution of AI models, there's a recognition of the importance of foundational knowledge, yet a simultaneous urge to break free, innovate, and carve out unique trajectories.
Challenging Normativity
: Whether it's the transformation in perceptions about AGI or the neurofuturistic call to liberate thought from the confines of normativity, the retrofuturist perspective encourages challenging established paradigms. It beckons a return to foundational principles not for mere replication, but for reinterpretation and reinvention.
In sum, 'Retrofuturist Knowledge' embodies the symbiotic relationship between past insights and future visions. It's a continuous dance between reverence for historical wisdom and the excitement for future possibilities, serving as a testament to humanity's undying spirit of exploration, interpretation, and innovation.
