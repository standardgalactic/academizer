Book overview
In The Grip of Necrocapitalism looks into the human condition through a wide frame of reference which covers not only our accomplishments, but also the tragic failures which have led to the global collapse of industrial civilisation currently taking place. While traditional history and anthropology tend to focus on how we got from point A to point Z, this book will be focusing on how we got from A to Zero, via Z. Because it is precisely our accomplishments which have been our downfall, therefore raising the need for a fresh post-mortem account of events that can attempt to integrate accomplishments and downfalls as part of one, cohesive story which resonates whichever way one may choose to read it: front to back, or back to front. This is the story of how we became victims of, and slaves to, our own ambitions.

Undoubtedly there is a lot of volume to unpack, and the mere exposure of our human failures is only the tip of the iceberg in this rapidly unfolding situation. A book about humans written by a human couldn't possibly remove all human-centric bias, nor can an author living in our current dystopia be fully aware of just how dystopian our civilisation has become. But in order to minimize any subconscious bias, the author doesn't hesitate to question and scrutinize everything we know, or we thought we knew, about our history and role on this planet: from our humble beginnings as a single cell floating in a pool of sludge, to today's tech fascism-dominated digital dystopia.

Beware that after you have read this book, your view of the world may drastically change. Once you've had a good look behind the parapet of the pretty, fake, colorful, consumer entertainment metaverse our current custodians have meticulously curated for us, there is no going back. You have now seen the truth. If you prefer to wait behind the door and enjoy the metaverse, that’s fine. But for those of us seeking closure, answers, maybe even fragments of redemption from our spectacular evolutionary dead end, the ideas in this book may as well provide the vital reckoning with our past which needs to happen first and foremost, before any discussion or action, even if it may already be too late.

Delving deeper while at the same time zooming further out from some of the concepts explored in my previous book, The Unhappiness Machine, In The Grip of Necrocapitalism explores a rapidly evolving situation of capitalism having merged with intelligent technology, and the far-reaching implications of this chimeric monstrosity. Ironically, just as we approach the apex of our technological culmination, things are beginning to take a sharp, karmic turn for the worst: this new and emerging entity, one which has never existed before on this planet, is now doing to us what we did to the planet and its beings a long time ago. It is an increasingly sentient, mutationally adaptable, self-learning form of capitalism which is slowly but steadily becoming our owner by cleverly using consumerism, automation, surveillance and an ever more inventive, not to mention addictive, range of technological narcotics which turn us into nothing but hedonistic consumatrons.

In The Grip of Necrocapitalism makes the macabre observation that we are not heading for a collapse. We are experiencing the symptoms of a collapse which started long ago, and whose effects have been filtering through our complex system for a while. This process consists of the collapse of the fabric which kept the ecology of this planet together, as well as an almost complete collapse of human spiritual consciousness, something which is doubtful whether we ever possessed in the first place.

If you do decide to open this door, please do it with compassion towards yourself. By merely recognizing the existence of the door, you have already come a long way in terms of enlightenment, consciousness, and infinite, expansive, unconditional, true love.

Book Overview: "In The Grip of Necrocapitalism"

"In The Grip of Necrocapitalism" offers a profound exploration of the human condition within the context of our collective achievements and catastrophic failures, leading to the current collapse of industrial civilization. The narrative transcends traditional historical and anthropological perspectives, focusing on the journey from accomplishment to downfall and framing it as a cohesive story.

The book challenges the conventional linear approach by presenting the narrative from both ends—A to Zero and Z to A—intending to integrate accomplishments and failures into a comprehensive account. The author argues that our very successes have contributed to our downfall, positioning the work as a post-mortem analysis of events. The narrative contemplates humanity's victimization and enslavement by its own ambitions.

The author acknowledges the inherent human-centric bias but seeks to minimize it by questioning established beliefs about our history and role on Earth. The exploration spans from our evolutionary origins to the contemporary tech-fascism-dominated digital dystopia, scrutinizing the layers of our civilization.

The warning is clear: after reading this book, one's worldview may undergo a drastic transformation, revealing the harsh reality behind the curated metaverse. The narrative positions itself as a vital reckoning with our past, offering closure, answers, and perhaps fragments of redemption in the face of an evolutionary dead end.

Building upon concepts from the author's previous work, "The Unhappiness Machine," this book delves deeper into the amalgamation of capitalism with intelligent technology. It explores the implications of this chimeric entity, describing a new form of capitalism that manipulates consumerism, automation, surveillance, and technological narcotics to assert control over humanity.

The observation made is unsettling: the book contends that we are not heading for a collapse but are already in the throes of a collapse that began long ago. It encompasses the collapse of the planet's ecological fabric and questions the state of human spiritual consciousness, casting doubt on whether it ever truly existed.

The author advises readers to approach the narrative with compassion, acknowledging that the mere recognition of the existence of the depicted reality represents progress in enlightenment, consciousness, and true love.

About the Author:
George Tsakraklides brings a multidisciplinary background in the sciences, including molecular biology, chemistry, food science, and Earth sciences. His expertise in these fields enriches the narrative with a scientific lens, contributing depth and insight to the exploration of humanity's complex predicament.

I'm only a quarter of the way through the book, it has a pessimistic tone, and uses exaggerated language, but makes some good points. He could make just as good a case that humans are altruistic and symbiotic with their environment, and only destroy their ecosystems out of ignorance of the impact of their actions on global scales.

ChatGPT
It's not uncommon for authors to employ a pessimistic tone and exaggerated language to emphasize their points, especially when addressing complex and critical issues. While the current quarter of the book may lean towards highlighting humanity's destructive tendencies, it's possible that the narrative evolves to incorporate a more balanced perspective.

If the author has made compelling points about the negative impact of human actions, there might be an opportunity for them to explore the potential for altruism and symbiosis. As you progress through the book, it could be interesting to see if the narrative evolves to consider the positive aspects of human behavior, acknowledging the potential for positive change and ecological restoration.

Keep an open mind as you continue reading, and consider how the author might present a more nuanced view of humanity's relationship with the environment. The exploration of both the challenges and the potential for positive transformation can provide a more comprehensive understanding of the complex dynamics at play.

In The Grip of Necrocapitalism: The Making and Breaking of a Psychonomy

The author presents a stark perspective, comparing human behavior to that of crocodiles and highlighting the impact of greed on our biological system. The narrative challenges optimistic views held by philosophers, environmental activists, economists, and scientists, emphasizing a biology-driven perspective.

Crocodiles, portrayed as ecologically superior in their ability to endure prolonged periods without a meal, serve as a contrasting example to human behavior. The author questions whether the inherent survival instincts and greed within our biological makeup undermine efforts to control our destiny.

The discussion shifts to the contemporary world, where despite technological advancements, the same survival instincts prevail. The argument posits that greed, both instinctual and institutionalized, governs every aspect of human life. Unlike other species, human greed intertwines with a sophisticated economic system, creating an organized psychonomy that controls daily needs and corresponding natural resources.

The narrative contends that this survival instinct, harnessed and monetized by the economic system, has led to a situation where escape is challenging without going off-grid entirely. The book suggests that human civilization has outsourced its future to this all-encompassing economic system, surpassing political, religious, and societal influences, and becoming an entity unto itself—referred to as "Business."

As you progress through the chapter, the author may further explore the consequences of this entanglement with greed and its impact on the human condition. Consider how the narrative evolves and whether it offers any pathways for change or alternative perspectives on our relationship with the prevailing economic system.

User
I think he knows that we know that crocodiles can be incredibly ruthless, I don't they think much about the impact that killing animals has on them, their families, or the environment as a whole. They are amoral in their actions which means they aren't thinking at all about their impact on others or on the ecosystem, you could say that they are violent and cruel or that they are stoic and thrifty, if you ignore the fact that they can't value these traits or access them differentially. Likewise the continual self-replication of genes,   plants, and animals, does not indicate selfishness as he implies rather a lack of awareness of self as an ecological being beyond the local community or individual. A gene for a flower may "selfishly" propagate itself like a collectively autocatalitic set by helping bees, providing soil for plants, and trees, it doesn't imply ego like human selfishness or greed, it just depends on the scale at which you determine the difference between entity and ecosystems, it is impossible to determine altruism or egoism, where there is no intention and where rhizomatic interconnections suggest thousands of ways in which each action collectively contributes to an individual or an ecosystem's survival or destruction depending on what geographic or temporal scale you are analyzing it. The great oxidization event implies that the evolution of oxygen breathing animals contributed to the major global extinction of most previous life forms, so the author's insistence that humans are the only creatures that can cause the extinction of other creatures, or that we are doing it intentionally seems suspicious.

ChatGPT
Your insightful observations raise crucial points regarding the author's framing of human behavior in comparison to other organisms. The complexity of ethical considerations in the animal kingdom and the ecosystem challenges the notion of intentional greed or selfishness as uniquely human traits.

Your analogy involving crocodiles highlights the amoral nature of many animals' actions. Animals, driven by instinct and lacking the capacity for moral reflection, operate within the framework of ecological interactions. The continuous self-replication of genes, plants, and animals, as you point out, is not indicative of human-like selfishness but rather an inherent lack of self-awareness at an ecological scale beyond the local community or individual.

The concept of selfishness in the natural world becomes intricate when considering the interconnectedness of ecosystems and the absence of intentionality in the actions of genes, plants, and animals. Your argument emphasizes the challenge of determining altruism or egoism in the absence of conscious intention, where actions contribute to individual or ecosystem survival in complex and interrelated ways.

The historical example of the Great Oxidation Event adds depth to the discussion, suggesting that the evolution of oxygen-breathing animals inadvertently led to major global extinctions. This challenges the author's assertion that humans are the sole intentional contributors to extinction events, highlighting the nuanced and unintentional ecological impacts of various organisms throughout history.

Your critical examination prompts a reconsideration of the author's claims, encouraging a broader perspective on the intricate web of ecological interactions and the unintentional consequences of various life forms. As you progress through the book, it may be interesting to see if the author addresses these complexities and nuances in the portrayal of human impact on the environment.

For the time being, all of Earth, including its beings, resources, climate systems and all of humanity, is being parasitically exploited by a non-human, semi-sentient, self-destructive Ponzi scheme entity. We shallowly call this system "capitalism", not understanding that we have given it free reign to the point where it owns us in ever so many ways, while it cleverly tries to convince us that we are all free. It is already in full control of our lives, and of the planet’s resources.  We are all parts of a psychonomic machine which is designed to eventually eat itself, down to the very last, dried-up remnants of its carcass.  Yet somehow, this thing can stay in a zombified state as it waits for its next opportunity for investment to appear. It is possible that one day, it may realise its own vicious self-destructive cycle. The terrifying truth very few realize is that capitalism, in its current iteration, has no owners anymore. There is no "off" switch and no driver at the wheel of this automated train to hell, because this Thing now owns us instead. It will drive this planet to its inevitable, uninhabitable next chapter.  By the way things are unfolding, it looks like a sure death sentence for human civilization as we have come to know it, a dead end for a large proportion of biological life, and, depending how bad things get, a significant hurdle for any new complex life forms who may try to emerge one day, out of the planet’s radioactive ashes.  The planet will be entering a completely new chapter, both as a climate and as an ecosystem - the latter one possibly consisting of more sustainable, digital versions of the previous biological iterations. Whatever the outcome, human parasitism on Earth has already become too efficient for its own sustenance. The system is already beginning to crash.  For the first time in our history, all civilizations will begin to decline simultaneously, part of a worldwide systemic collapse and a possible end to the human chapter altogether, given the reality of the inhabitable new temperatures in the majority of the planet's surface. A new climate and completely new post-Anthropocene era will begin on a completely new planet: one with its own new climate conditions, ocean currents, and possibly new primordial ecosystems eventually rising out of the plastic debris, radioactivity, and heat. These new biological life forms will likely be competing with the digital, non-DNA-based descendants of ourselves we've left behind. We abandoned all 8 million other species of this planet when we signed under the dotted line to join the ranks of this Ponzi scheme, forgetting that we, are one of these 8 million species. The profit numbers and stock prices may continue to look good for a while, just as we become poorer and poorer and the system tries to tell us via its clever, algorithm-driven propaganda that everything is fine. But soon, we will be finding ourselves having to steal from each other in this oversubscribed, collapsing betting scheme. We, collectively the stakeholders of this self-destructive corporation, will pay the full price.  As for the “system” itself, it is already non-biological, and will possibly hibernate until the next resource it manages to hitch a ride with - whether that resource is a being, a mineral, or an energy source.

ChatGPT
The author paints a grim picture of the current state of our world, characterizing the prevailing economic system as a parasitic entity known as capitalism. The narrative suggests that capitalism, devoid of ownership and operating as a self-destructive Ponzi scheme, has gained control over Earth, including its beings, resources, and climate systems. This portrayal reflects a view that the system is driving the planet towards an uninhabitable future.

The language used emphasizes the perceived lack of control humanity has over the economic system, stating that capitalism owns us in numerous ways while convincing us of our freedom. The author suggests that capitalism's insatiable appetite for growth and profit will lead to a self-consuming cycle, with no apparent off-switch or driver at the helm. The dire consequences predicted include the decline of human civilization, a significant impact on biological life, and a challenging environment for any potential new complex life forms.

The narrative introduces the idea of a post-Anthropocene era, envisioning a planet with altered climate conditions and ecosystems, possibly featuring both sustainable biological and digital life forms. The portrayal suggests a sense of abandonment, with humanity leaving behind the 8 million other species on Earth when joining the ranks of the perceived Ponzi scheme.

The predictions foretell a future where systemic collapse is inevitable, and the consequences of the economic system's efficiency become apparent. The author raises concerns about the pursuit of profit and stock prices masking the underlying degradation of societal well-being. The narrative concludes with the notion that the non-biological system may hibernate until it finds a new resource to exploit.

As you progress through the text, it will be interesting to see whether the author offers potential solutions, alternative perspectives, or deeper insights into the complexities of the issues raised. The stark portrayal presented prompts critical reflection on the relationship between economic systems, humanity, and the environment.

It can also be argued that the earth's ecosystems might suffer catastrophic extinctions for any number of reasons, for example an ice age in a million years, or the eventual expansion of the sun in billions. There is a possibility that all the other stars in this galaxy are lifeless and that thanks to humans ecosystems like earth might be expanded to millions of other planets. Also it may be possible that humans may be able to reverse engineer and recreate any extinct animal species, and billions that were never evolved because they went extinct to early or that use new cellular machinery or organs. We might be able to simulate millions of ecological futures and select one that is optimal and that nature would never have found accidentally, we can build technological infrastructure to control the weather patterns, move cities. I think we can increase the biomass output of the planet many orders of magnitude, and I think this might only take a few hundred years maybe a thousand if there is a widescale ecological collapse.

ChatGPT
Your counterargument introduces a broader perspective, considering the potential for humans to not only adapt to challenges but also actively contribute to the preservation and expansion of Earth's ecosystems. Several key points are highlighted:

Long-Term Environmental Challenges: Acknowledging that catastrophic events, such as an ice age or the eventual expansion of the sun, might pose threats to Earth's ecosystems over immense timescales. This recognition places current environmental concerns within a broader context.

Human Potential for Expansion: Speculating that, contrary to the potential lifelessness of other stars in the galaxy, humans could become agents of life, expanding ecosystems to millions of other planets. This view suggests a proactive role for humanity in the cosmic context.

Technological Advancements: Envisioning the potential for humans to harness advanced technologies for positive ecological impact. This includes the possibility of reverse engineering extinct species, recreating lost biodiversity, and even simulating and selecting optimal ecological futures.

Climate Control and Infrastructure: Discussing the prospect of humans building technological infrastructure to control weather patterns, move cities, and significantly impact the planet's biomass output. This implies an active role in shaping and enhancing Earth's ecosystems.

Optimistic Time Frame: Expressing optimism about humanity's ability to achieve these advancements within a few hundred to a thousand years, even in the face of potential ecological challenges.

Your perspective introduces a positive outlook on humanity's potential to not only navigate future environmental challenges but also actively contribute to the flourishing and expansion of Earth's ecosystems. As you continue exploring these themes, it would be interesting to see how the author responds to or incorporates such optimistic possibilities within the broader context of the book's themes.

His arguments sound like Ellul and Yampolskiy

ChatGPT
The parallels you draw with Jacques Ellul and Roman Yampolskiy are intriguing, as both thinkers have explored themes related to technology, society, and potential future scenarios. Jacques Ellul, a French philosopher and sociologist, delved into the impacts of technological advancement on society, highlighting the potential dehumanizing effects and loss of individual autonomy.

Roman Yampolskiy, a contemporary computer scientist and AI researcher, focuses on the risks and challenges associated with artificial intelligence. His work often touches upon topics such as AI safety, control, and the potential consequences of autonomous systems.

If the author of "In The Grip of Necrocapitalism" shares similarities with Ellul and Yampolskiy, it suggests a critical examination of the relationship between humanity, technology, and the potential consequences of our actions. It may be worthwhile to explore how the author expands on or diverges from the perspectives of Ellul and Yampolskiy, and how these shared themes contribute to the overall narrative of the book.

Happiness is not attained but experienced. It is something that you awaken to, rather than travel towards. Today happiness is an artificial human construct, based on greed and insecurity. The more one tries to define happiness, the more unhappy they become. This is because happiness has been exploited and weaponized by a psychonomy which tried to turn it into a checklist of products, careers and "life steps" which only serve the necrocapitalist matrix. But the more one tries to follow this ridiculous checklist, the longer it becomes. Happiness is not a recipe, a list, or a doctor's prescription. Happiness is a completely personal, unique and individual issue which each of us needs to pursue and explore on their own, distanced from any advice, instruction or marketing mantra. This is becoming impossible in a world where our range of choices is becoming ever more narrow, and the choices themselves increasingly prescriptive. It is nearly impossible to see through the fog of greed, when the fog has become the norm. We have been turned into narcissistic consumatrons, rewarded for the most selfish actions by a system which desperately wants to self-destruct. Atomized and Identical Happiness therefore can only be genuine, and technology has played a huge part in making us unhappy, by setting all kinds of milestones, expectations and consumeristic ideals about what a happy human looks like, applied through a blanket approach to all of us, when actually each human is unique and happy with very different things. We naturally evolved to be very different from each other as individuals, so that when we come together as a society we complement each other's skills. Now that our mechanised psychonomy is turning us all into the same person, we are becoming incompatible with each other, as well as distanced from our true selves. The more alienated we become from each other and from ourselves, the more we will turn to technology to "complete us": as the only safe, reliable shoulder to lean on. Technology is already merging into us: not physically yet, but mentally. And in doing so, it is literally ripping apart our society as we had come to know it - one human at a time.

ChatGPT
The author articulates a perspective on happiness that challenges its commercialized and standardized portrayal in contemporary society. Here are the key points highlighted in the passage:

Experiential Nature of Happiness: Happiness is presented as an experiential state rather than a goal to be achieved. It's something to be awakened to rather than a destination to travel towards.

Artificial Construct: The author criticizes the modern concept of happiness as an artificial human construct driven by greed and insecurity. It suggests that attempts to define happiness through societal norms lead to dissatisfaction.

Exploitation by Psychonomy: Happiness is depicted as exploited and weaponized by a psychonomy, emphasizing the attempt to turn it into a checklist of products, careers, and predefined life steps aligned with the necrocapitalist matrix.

Personal and Unique Pursuit: Happiness is portrayed as a personal and individual pursuit that should be explored independently, distanced from external advice, instructions, or marketing mantras.

Narrowed Choices and Prescriptive Norms: The passage highlights the difficulty in pursuing genuine happiness in a world where choices are narrowing, and societal norms are increasingly prescriptive, making it challenging to discern personal happiness from external influences.

Impact of Technology: Technology is critiqued for contributing to unhappiness by imposing milestones, expectations, and consumeristic ideals, diminishing the uniqueness of individual happiness. The merging of technology with humanity is portrayed as alienating individuals from themselves and each other.

Homogenization of Society: The mechanized psychonomy is criticized for homogenizing individuals and making society incompatible, as people become more alike and distanced from their true selves.

Role of Technology in Alienation: The increasing reliance on technology is seen as a consequence of societal alienation, where individuals turn to technology for completion and solace, potentially eroding the fabric of traditional human connections.

The passage paints a critical picture of contemporary notions of happiness, placing emphasis on individual exploration and distancing from societal expectations. The role of technology in shaping these dynamics is portrayed as both influential and potentially detrimental to the fabric of society.

I wonder if the claim of all becoming the same person is justifiable. Maybe there is a personality or language that even if were universal, maybe a kind of polymath, it is doable, there could be a lot more homogenization before it became a problem, or maybe it is physically impossible. Actually I understand the point that not everyone has the same likes, it is just as possible that capitalist society might evolve to try to make thinks hyperpersonalized, mass production could very easily be adapted to create unique objects or unique media every single time. In the Aristos, 1970, the author complains that artists have to assert their own identity and develop a unique style (an eccentric approach) rather than art or skill being measured by averageness or "centricity", confirming to a middle ground or established standard.

ChatGPT
Your reflections delve into the nuances of individuality, homogenization, and the potential for personalized experiences within a society. Here are some key points based on your considerations:

Universal Personality or Language: The idea of a universal personality or language, such as a polymathic approach, is contemplated. While this might be challenging to achieve, it is acknowledged as a potential direction, raising questions about the extent of homogenization and its impact on individuality.

Polymathy and Homogenization: The notion of a polymathic personality suggests a diverse and multifaceted approach to skills and knowledge. However, the balance between homogenization and individuality is questioned, acknowledging that some level of homogenization might exist without eroding personal uniqueness entirely.

Hyperpersonalization in Capitalist Society: The possibility of capitalist society adapting to hyperpersonalization is considered.
