The "MAKE_PLOT.����" code snippet in Mojo is used to indicate that there is a functionality to create plots or visualizations in the language. However, without the specific implementation details or additional code context, it's difficult to provide a precise example of how the "MAKE_PLOT.����" would be used.
In general, creating a plot in Mojo would involve using a plotting library or framework compatible with the language. Mojo supports interoperability with the Python ecosystem, so it's possible to leverage popular Python plotting libraries like Matplotlib or Plotly to generate visualizations. Here's an example using Matplotlib:
mojo
Copy code
MAKE_PLOT.����

MOJO ����

import matplotlib.pyplot as plt

# Sample data
x = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
y = [10, 20, 15, 25, 30]

# Create a line plot
plt.plot(x, y)

# Add labels and title
plt.xlabel('X-axis')
plt.ylabel('Y-axis')
plt.title('Mojo Plot')

# Display the plot
plt.show()
In this example, the code snippet indicates the use of Mojo for the implementation, and the subsequent lines of code utilize Matplotlib for creating a line plot. The plot displays a simple line graph with labeled axes and a title.
Please note that this is a general example, and the actual usage of plots in Mojo may vary depending on the specific plotting library or framework being used and the requirements of the visualization.

I remember the first time I used the v1.0 of Visual Basic. Back then, it was a program for DOS. Before it, writing programs was extremely complex and I���d never managed to make much progress beyond the most basic toy applications. But with VB, I drew a button on the screen, typed in a single line of code that I wanted to run when that button was clicked, and I had a complete application I could now run. It was such an amazing experience that I���ll never forget that feeling.

It felt like coding would never be the same again.

Writing code in Mojo, a new programming language from Modular1 is the second time in my life I���ve had that feeling. Here���s what it looks like:


Why not just use Python?
Before I explain why I���m so excited about Mojo, I first need to say a few things about Python.

Python is the language that I have used for nearly all my work over the last few years. It is a beautiful language. It has an elegant core, on which everything else is built. This approach means that Python can (and does) do absolutely anything. But it comes with a downside: performance.

A few percent here or there doesn���t matter. But Python is many thousands of times slower than languages like C++. This makes it impractical to use Python for the performance-sensitive parts of code ��� the inner loops where performance is critical.

However, Python has a trick up its sleeve: it can call out to code written in fast languages. So Python programmers learn to avoid using Python for the implementation of performance-critical sections, instead using Python wrappers over C, FORTRAN, Rust, etc code. Libraries like Numpy and PyTorch provide ���pythonic��� interfaces to high performance code, allowing Python programmers to feel right at home, even as they���re using highly optimised numeric libraries.

Nearly all AI models today are developed in Python, thanks to the flexible and elegant programming language, fantastic tools and ecosystem, and high performance compiled libraries.

But this ���two-language��� approach has serious downsides. For instance, AI models often have to be converted from Python into a faster implementation, such as ONNX or torchscript. But these deployment approaches can���t support all of Python���s features, so Python programmers have to learn to use a subset of the language that matches their deployment target. It���s very hard to profile or debug the deployment version of the code, and there���s no guarantee it will even run identically to the python version.

The two-language problem gets in the way of learning. Instead of being able to step into the implementation of an algorithm while your code runs, or jump to the definition of a method of interest, instead you find yourself deep in the weeds of C libraries and binary blobs. All coders are learners (or at least, they should be) because the field constantly develops, and no-one can understand it all. So difficulties learning and problems for experienced devs just as much as it is for students starting out.

The same problem occurs when trying to debug code or find and resolve performance problems. The two-language problem means that the tools that Python programmers are familiar with no longer apply as soon as we find ourselves jumping into the backend implementation language.

There are also unavoidable performance problems, even when a faster compiled implementation language is used for a library. One major issue is the lack of ���fusion��� ��� that is, calling a bunch of compiled functions in a row leads to a lot of overhead, as data is converted to and from python formats, and the cost of switching from python to C and back repeatedly must be paid. So instead we have to write special ���fused��� versions of common combinations of functions (such as a linear layer followed by a rectified linear layer in a neural net), and call these fused versions from Python. This means there���s a lot more library functions to implement and remember, and you���re out of luck if you���re doing anything even slightly non-standard because there won���t be a fused version for you.

We also have to deal with the lack of effective parallel processing in Python. Nowadays we all have computers with lots of cores, but Python generally will just use one at a time. There are some clunky ways to write parallel code which uses more than one core, but they either have to work on totally separate memory (and have a lot of overhead to start up) or they have to take it in turns to access memory (the dreaded ���global interpreter lock��� which often makes parallel code actually slower than single-threaded code!)

Libraries like PyTorch have been developing increasingly ingenious ways to deal with these performance problems, with the newly released PyTorch 2 even including a compile() function that uses a sophisticated compilation backend to create high performance implementations of Python code. However, functionality like this can���t work magic: there are fundamental limitations on what���s possible with Python based on how the language itself is designed.

You might imagine that in practice there���s just a small number of building blocks for AI models, and so it doesn���t really matter if we have to implement each of these in C. Besides which, they���re pretty basic algorithms on the whole anyway, right? For instance, transformers models are nearly entirely implemented by multiple layers of two components, multilayer perceptrons (MLP) and attention, which can be implemented with just a few lines of Python with PyTorch. Here���s the implementation of an MLP:

nn.Sequential(nn.Linear(ni,nh), nn.GELU(), nn.LayerNorm(nh), nn.Linear(nh,ni))

���and here���s a self-attention layer:

def forward(self, x):
    x = self.qkv(self.norm(x))
    x = rearrange(x, 'n s (h d) -> (n h) s d', h=self.nheads)
    q,k,v = torch.chunk(x, 3, dim=-1)
    s = (q@k.transpose(1,2))/self.scale
    x = s.softmax(dim=-1)@v
    x = rearrange(x, '(n h) s d -> n s (h d)', h=self.nheads)
    return self.proj(x)

But this hides the fact that real-world implementations of these operations are far more complex. For instance check out this memory optimised ���flash attention��� implementation in CUDA C. It also hides the fact that there are huge amounts of performance being left on the table by these generic approaches to building models. For instance, ���block sparse��� approaches can dramatically improve speed and memory use. Researchers are working on tweaks to nearly every part of common architectures, and coming up with new architectures (and SGD optimisers, and data augmentation methods, etc) ��� we���re not even close to having some neatly wrapped-up system that everyone will use forever more.

In practice, much of the fastest code today used for language models is being written in C and C++. For instance, Fabrice Bellard���s TextSynth and Georgi Gerganov���s ggml both use C, and as a result are able to take full advantage of the performance benefits of fully compiled languages.

Enter Mojo
Chris Lattner is responsible for creating many of the projects that we all rely on today ��� even although we might not even have heard of all the stuff he built! As part of his PhD thesis he started the development of LLVM, which fundamentally changed how compilers are created, and today forms the foundation of many of the most widely used language ecosystems in the world. He then went on to launch Clang, a C and C++ compiler that sits on top of LLVM, and is used by most of the world���s most significant software developers (including providing the backbone for Google���s performance critical code). LLVM includes an ���intermediate representation��� (IR), a special language designed for machines to read and write (instead of for people), which has enabled a huge community of software to work together to provide better programming language functionality across a wider range of hardware.

Chris saw that C and C++ however didn���t really fully leverage the power of LLVM, so while he was working at Apple he designed a new language, called ���Swift���, which he describes as ���syntax sugar for LLVM���. Swift has gone on to become one of the world���s most widely used programming languages, in particular because it is today the main way to create iOS apps for iPhone, iPad, MacOS, and Apple TV.

Unfortunately, Apple���s control of Swift has meant it hasn���t really had its time to shine outside of the cloistered Apple world. Chris led a team for a while at Google to try to move Swift out of its Apple comfort zone, to become a replacement for Python in AI model development. I was very excited about this project, but sadly it did not receive the support it needed from either Apple or from Google, and it was not ultimately successful.

Having said that, whilst at Google Chris did develop another project which became hugely successful: MLIR. MLIR is a replacement for LLVM���s IR for the modern age of many-core computing and AI workloads. It���s critical for fully leveraging the power of hardware like GPUs, TPUs, and the vector units increasingly being added to server-class CPUs.

So, if Swift was ���syntax sugar for LLVM���, what���s ���syntax sugar for MLIR���? The answer is: Mojo! Mojo is a brand new language that���s designed to take full advantage of MLIR. And also Mojo is Python.

Wait what?

OK let me explain. Maybe it���s better to say Mojo is Python++. It will be (when complete) a strict superset of the Python language. But it also has additional functionality so we can write high performance code that takes advantage of modern accelerators.

Mojo seems to me like a more pragmatic approach than Swift. Whereas Swift was a brand new language packing all kinds of cool features based on latest research in programming language design, Mojo is, at its heart, just Python. This seems wise, not just because Python is already well understood by millions of coders, but also because after decades of use its capabilities and limitations are now well understood. Relying on the latest programming language research is pretty cool, but its potentially-dangerous speculation because you never really know how things will turn out. (I will admit that personally, for instance, I often got confused by Swift���s powerful but quirky type system, and sometimes even managed to confuse the Swift compiler and blew it up entirely!)

A key trick in Mojo is that you can opt in at any time to a faster ���mode��� as a developer, by using ���fn��� instead of ���def��� to create your function. In this mode, you have to declare exactly what the type of every variable is, and as a result Mojo can create optimised machine code to implement your function. Furthermore, if you use ���struct��� instead of ���class���, your attributes will be tightly packed into memory, such that they can even be used in data structures without chasing pointers around. These are the kinds of features that allow languages like C to be so fast, and now they���re accessible to Python programmers too ��� just by learning a tiny bit of new syntax

The article highlights the potential significance of Mojo as a programming language advancement. Mojo is described as a new programming language based on Python that aims to address Python's performance and deployment challenges. The author draws a comparison to their experience with the Visual Basic programming language, which brought a significant shift in ease and productivity. Similarly, the author believes that Mojo has the potential to revolutionize coding once again.
Python is praised for its elegance and flexibility but is known to have performance limitations compared to languages like C++. Python developers often resort to using wrappers around fast languages for performance-critical sections of code. However, this two-language approach presents challenges in deployment, debugging, and learning. It can be difficult to ensure identical behavior between the Python implementation and the faster compiled version, leading to a disconnect in the development process.
Mojo, created by Chris Lattner, the developer behind LLVM and Swift, aims to leverage the power of LLVM and MLIR (MLIR replaces LLVM's intermediate representation) for better hardware utilization. Mojo is described as a superset of Python, meaning it retains Python's syntax and features while adding additional functionality to write high-performance code that takes advantage of modern accelerators. By opting into a faster mode using the "fn" keyword instead of "def," developers can declare variable types, allowing Mojo to generate optimized machine code. Additionally, using "struct" instead of "class" enables memory-efficient attribute packing.
The author acknowledges that while Swift, another language created by Chris Lattner, sought to replace Python in AI model development, it faced limitations in gaining broader support. However, Mojo takes a different approach by building upon Python's existing popularity and capabilities. It provides Python developers with the ability to write high-performance code without having to learn an entirely new language.
The article concludes by highlighting the potential impact of Mojo on AI model development and the programming community as a whole. Mojo's integration of modern language design principles, compatibility with Python, and optimization for hardware utilization position it as a significant advancement in the programming language landscape.

Libraries like PyTorch have been developing increasingly ingenious ways to deal with these performance problems, with the newly released PyTorch 2 even including a compile() function that uses a sophisticated compilation backend to create high performance implementations of Python code. However, functionality like this can���t work magic: there are fundamental limitations on what���s possible with Python based on how the language itself is designed.

You might imagine that in practice there���s just a small number of building blocks for AI models, and so it doesn���t really matter if we have to implement each of these in C. Besides which, they���re pretty basic algorithms on the whole anyway, right? For instance, transformers models are nearly entirely implemented by multiple layers of two components, multilayer perceptrons (MLP) and attention, which can be implemented with just a few lines of Python with PyTorch. Here���s the implementation of an MLP:

nn.Sequential(nn.Linear(ni,nh), nn.GELU(), nn.LayerNorm(nh), nn.Linear(nh,ni))

���and here���s a self-attention layer:

def forward(self, x):
    x = self.qkv(self.norm(x))
    x = rearrange(x, 'n s (h d) -> (n h) s d', h=self.nheads)
    q,k,v = torch.chunk(x, 3, dim=-1)
    s = (q@k.transpose(1,2))/self.scale
    x = s.softmax(dim=-1)@v
    x = rearrange(x, '(n h) s d -> n s (h d)', h=self.nheads)
    return self.proj(x)

But this hides the fact that real-world implementations of these operations are far more complex. For instance check out this memory optimised ���flash attention��� implementation in CUDA C. It also hides the fact that there are huge amounts of performance being left on the table by these generic approaches to building models. For instance, ���block sparse��� approaches can dramatically improve speed and memory use. Researchers are working on tweaks to nearly every part of common architectures, and coming up with new architectures (and SGD optimisers, and data augmentation methods, etc) ��� we���re not even close to having some neatly wrapped-up system that everyone will use forever more.

In practice, much of the fastest code today used for language models is being written in C and C++. For instance, Fabrice Bellard���s TextSynth and Georgi Gerganov���s ggml both use C, and as a result are able to take full advantage of the performance benefits of fully compiled languages.

Enter Mojo
Chris Lattner is responsible for creating many of the projects that we all rely on today ��� even although we might not even have heard of all the stuff he built! As part of his PhD thesis he started the development of LLVM, which fundamentally changed how compilers are created, and today forms the foundation of many of the most widely used language ecosystems in the world. He then went on to launch Clang, a C and C++ compiler that sits on top of LLVM, and is used by most of the world���s most significant software developers (including providing the backbone for Google���s performance critical code). LLVM includes an ���intermediate representation��� (IR), a special language designed for machines to read and write (instead of for people), which has enabled a huge community of software to work together to provide better programming language functionality across a wider range of hardware.

Chris saw that C and C++ however didn���t really fully leverage the power of LLVM, so while he was working at Apple he designed a new language, called ���Swift���, which he describes as ���syntax sugar for LLVM���. Swift has gone on to become one of the world���s most widely used programming languages, in particular because it is today the main way to create iOS apps for iPhone, iPad, MacOS, and Apple TV.

Unfortunately, Apple���s control of Swift has meant it hasn���t really had its time to shine outside of the cloistered Apple world. Chris led a team for a while at Google to try to move Swift out of its Apple comfort zone, to become a replacement for Python in AI model development. I was very excited about this project, but sadly it did not receive the support it needed from either Apple or from Google, and it was not ultimately successful.

Having said that, whilst at Google Chris did develop another project which became hugely successful: MLIR. MLIR is a replacement for LLVM���s IR for the modern age of many-core computing and AI workloads. It���s critical for fully leveraging the power of hardware like GPUs, TPUs, and the vector units increasingly being added to server-class CPUs.

So, if Swift was ���syntax sugar for LLVM���, what���s ���syntax sugar for MLIR���? The answer is: Mojo! Mojo is a brand new language that���s designed to take full advantage of MLIR. And also Mojo is Python.

Wait what?

OK let me explain. Maybe it���s better to say Mojo is Python++. It will be (when complete) a strict superset of the Python language. But it also has additional functionality so we can write high performance code that takes advantage of modern accelerators.

Mojo seems to me like a more pragmatic approach than Swift. Whereas Swift was a brand new language packing all kinds of cool features based on latest research in programming language design, Mojo is, at its heart, just Python. This seems wise, not just because Python is already well understood by millions of coders, but also because after decades of use its capabilities and limitations are now well understood. Relying on the latest programming language research is pretty cool, but its potentially-dangerous speculation because you never really know how things will turn out. (I will admit that personally, for instance, I often got confused by Swift���s powerful but quirky type system, and sometimes even managed to confuse the Swift compiler and blew it up entirely!)

A key trick in Mojo is that you can opt in at any time to a faster ���mode��� as a developer, by using ���fn��� instead of ���def��� to create your function. In this mode, you have to declare exactly what the type of every variable is, and as a result Mojo can create optimised machine code to implement your function. Furthermore, if you use ���struct��� instead of ���class���, your attributes will be tightly packed into memory, such that they can even be used in data structures without chasing pointers around. These are the kinds of features that allow languages like C to be so fast, and now they���re accessible to Python programmers too ��� just by learning a tiny bit of new syntax.

How is this possible?
There has, at this point, been hundreds of attempts over decades to create programming languages which are concise, flexible, fast, practical, and easy to use ��� without much success. But somehow, Modular seems to have done it. How could this be? There are a couple of hypotheses we might come up with:

Mojo hasn���t actually achieved these things, and the snazzy demo hides disappointing real-life performance, or
Modular is a huge company with hundreds of developers working for years, putting in more hours in order to achieve something that���s not been achieved before.
Neither of these things are true. The demo, in fact, was created in just a few days before I recorded the video. The two examples we gave (matmul and mandelbrot) were not carefully chosen as being the only things that happened to work after trying dozens of approaches; rather, they were the only things we tried for the demo and they worked first time! Whilst there���s plenty of missing features at this early stage (Mojo isn���t even released to the public yet, other than an online ���playground���), the demo you see really does work the way you see it. And indeed you can run it yourself now in the playground.

Modular is a fairly small startup that���s only a year old, and only one part of the company is working on the Mojo language. Mojo development was only started recently. It���s a small team, working for a short time, so how have they done so much?

The key is that Mojo builds on some really powerful foundations. Very few software projects I���ve seen spend enough time building the right foundations, and tend to accrue as a result mounds of technical debt. Over time, it becomes harder and harder to add features and fix bugs. In a well designed system, however, every feature is easier to add than the last one, is faster, and has fewer bugs, because the foundations each feature builds upon are getting better and better. Mojo is a well designed system.

At its core is MLIR, which has already been developed for many years, initially kicked off by Chris Lattner at Google. He had recognised what the core foundations for an ���AI era programming language��� would need, and focused on building them. MLIR was a key piece. Just as LLVM made it dramatically easier for powerful new programming languages to be developed over the last decade (such as Rust, Julia, and Swift, which are all based on LLVM), MLIR provides an even more powerful core to languages that are built on it.

Another key enabler of Mojo���s rapid development is the decision to use Python as the syntax. Developing and iterating on syntax is one of the most error-prone, complex, and controversial parts of the development of a language. By simply outsourcing that to an existing language (which also happens to be the most widely used language today) that whole piece disappears! The relatively small number of new bits of syntax needed on top of Python then largely fit quite naturally, since the base is already in place.

The next step was to create a minimal Pythonic way to call MLIR directly. That wasn���t a big job at all, but it was all that was needed to then create all of Mojo on top of that ��� and work directly in Mojo for everything else. That meant that the Mojo devs were able to ���dog-food��� Mojo when writing Mojo, nearly from the very start. Any time they found something didn���t quite work great as they developed Mojo, they could add a needed feature to Mojo itself to make it easier for them to develop the next bit of Mojo!

This is very similar to Julia, which was developed on a minimal LISP-like core that provides the Julia language elements, which are then bound to basic LLVM operations. Nearly everything in Julia is built on top of that, using Julia itself.

I can���t begin to describe all the little (and big!) ideas throughout Mojo���s design and implementation ��� it���s the result of Chris and his team���s decades of work on compiler and language design and includes all the tricks and hard-won experience from that time ��� but what I can describe is an amazing result that I saw with my own eyes.

The Modular team internally announced that they���d decided to launch Mojo with a video, including a demo ��� and they set a date just a few weeks in the future. But at that time Mojo was just the most bare-bones language. There was no usable notebook kernel, hardly any of the Python syntax was implemented, and nothing was optimised. I couldn���t understand how they hoped to implement all this in a matter of weeks ��� let alone to make it any good! What I saw over this time was astonishing. Every day or two whole new language features were implemented, and as soon as there was enough in place to try running algorithms, generally they���d be at or near state of the art performance right away! I realised that what was happening was that all the foundations were already in place, and that they���d been explicitly designed to build the things that were now under development. So it shouldn���t have been a surprise that everything worked, and worked well ��� after all, that was the plan all along!

This is a reason to be optimistic about the future of Mojo. Although it���s still early days for this project, my guess, based on what I���ve observed in the last few weeks, is that it���s going to develop faster and further than most of us expect���

The article discusses the potential impact of Mojo as a new programming language based on Python. The author compares the experience of using Mojo to their earlier experience with Visual Basic, where they felt a significant shift in coding simplicity and productivity. Mojo is positioned as a language that addresses Python's performance and deployment issues.
Python is acknowledged for its elegance and versatility, but it suffers from performance limitations compared to languages like C++. Python programmers often resort to using Python wrappers over code written in faster languages for performance-critical sections. While this approach works, it introduces challenges in deployment, debugging, and learning. The two-language problem arises, hindering seamless integration and hindering the use of Python's familiar tools when working with backend implementation languages.
Mojo, created by Chris Lattner, the developer behind LLVM and Swift, is described as a superset of Python that takes advantage of MLIR (a replacement for LLVM's intermediate representation) to optimize hardware utilization. Mojo retains Python's syntax and familiarity while introducing additional functionality for writing high-performance code that leverages modern accelerators.
The author suggests that Mojo takes a more pragmatic approach compared to Swift, which was designed as a separate language for AI model development. Mojo, being rooted in Python, benefits from Python's widespread adoption and mature ecosystem. It avoids the potential pitfalls of relying on speculative language research and offers a familiar language base for developers.
A key feature of Mojo is the ability to opt into a faster "mode" by using "fn" instead of "def" when defining functions. In this mode, developers need to declare the type of each variable, enabling Mojo to generate optimized machine code. Using "struct" instead of "class" allows attributes to be tightly packed into memory, improving performance.
The rapid development of Mojo is attributed to the strong foundations it builds upon. MLIR, developed over many years, provides the core infrastructure for an "AI era programming language" and enhances language development. By leveraging Python's syntax, Mojo eliminates the need for extensive syntax development and can focus on implementing the specific features required. The Mojo team's ability to dog-food Mojo itself during development contributed to rapid iterations and improvements.
The author expresses optimism about the future of Mojo, given its strong foundations and the speed at which it has been developed. While the project is still in its early stages, the author expects Mojo to continue developing and progressing further than anticipated based on their observations.

I remember the first time I used the v1.0 of Visual Basic. Back then, it was a program for DOS. Before it, writing programs was extremely complex and I���d never managed to make much progress beyond the most basic toy applications. But with VB, I drew a button on the screen, typed in a single line of code that I wanted to run when that button was clicked, and I had a complete application I could now run. It was such an amazing experience that I���ll never forget that feeling.

It felt like coding would never be the same again.

Writing code in Mojo, a new programming language from Modular1 is the second time in my life I���ve had that feeling. Here���s what it looks like:


Why not just use Python?
Before I explain why I���m so excited about Mojo, I first need to say a few things about Python.

Python is the language that I have used for nearly all my work over the last few years. It is a beautiful language. It has an elegant core, on which everything else is built. This approach means that Python can (and does) do absolutely anything. But it comes with a downside: performance.

A few percent here or there doesn���t matter. But Python is many thousands of times slower than languages like C++. This makes it impractical to use Python for the performance-sensitive parts of code ��� the inner loops where performance is critical.

However, Python has a trick up its sleeve: it can call out to code written in fast languages. So Python programmers learn to avoid using Python for the implementation of performance-critical sections, instead using Python wrappers over C, FORTRAN, Rust, etc code. Libraries like Numpy and PyTorch provide ���pythonic��� interfaces to high performance code, allowing Python programmers to feel right at home, even as they���re using highly optimised numeric libraries.

Nearly all AI models today are developed in Python, thanks to the flexible and elegant programming language, fantastic tools and ecosystem, and high performance compiled libraries.

But this ���two-language��� approach has serious downsides. For instance, AI models often have to be converted from Python into a faster implementation, such as ONNX or torchscript. But these deployment approaches can���t support all of Python���s features, so Python programmers have to learn to use a subset of the language that matches their deployment target. It���s very hard to profile or debug the deployment version of the code, and there���s no guarantee it will even run identically to the python version.

The two-language problem gets in the way of learning. Instead of being able to step into the implementation of an algorithm while your code runs, or jump to the definition of a method of interest, instead you find yourself deep in the weeds of C libraries and binary blobs. All coders are learners (or at least, they should be) because the field constantly develops, and no-one can understand it all. So difficulties learning and problems for experienced devs just as much as it is for students starting out.

The same problem occurs when trying to debug code or find and resolve performance problems. The two-language problem means that the tools that Python programmers are familiar with no longer apply as soon as we find ourselves jumping into the backend implementation language.

There are also unavoidable performance problems, even when a faster compiled implementation language is used for a library. One major issue is the lack of ���fusion��� ��� that is, calling a bunch of compiled functions in a row leads to a lot of overhead, as data is converted to and from python formats, and the cost of switching from python to C and back repeatedly must be paid. So instead we have to write special ���fused��� versions of common combinations of functions (such as a linear layer followed by a rectified linear layer in a neural net), and call these fused versions from Python. This means there���s a lot more library functions to implement and remember, and you���re out of luck if you���re doing anything even slightly non-standard because there won���t be a fused version for you.

We also have to deal with the lack of effective parallel processing in Python. Nowadays we all have computers with lots of cores, but Python generally will just use one at a time. There are some clunky ways to write parallel code which uses more than one core, but they either have to work on totally separate memory (and have a lot of overhead to start up) or they have to take it in turns to access memory (the dreaded ���global interpreter lock��� which often makes parallel code actually slower than single-threaded code!)

Libraries like PyTorch have been developing increasingly ingenious ways to deal with these performance problems, with the newly released PyTorch 2 even including a compile() function that uses a sophisticated compilation backend to create high performance implementations of Python code. However, functionality like this can���t work magic: there are fundamental limitations on what���s possible with Python based on how the language itself is designed.

You might imagine that in practice there���s just a small number of building blocks for AI models, and so it doesn���t really matter if we have to implement each of these in C. Besides which, they���re pretty basic algorithms on the whole anyway, right? For instance, transformers models are nearly entirely implemented by multiple layers of two components, multilayer perceptrons (MLP) and attention, which can be implemented with just a few lines of Python with PyTorch. Here���s the implementation of an MLP:

nn.Sequential(nn.Linear(ni,nh), nn.GELU(), nn.LayerNorm(nh), nn.Linear(nh,ni))

���and here���s a self-attention layer:

def forward(self, x):
    x = self.qkv(self.norm(x))
    x = rearrange(x, 'n s (h d) -> (n h) s d', h=self.nheads)
    q,k,v = torch.chunk(x, 3, dim=-1)
    s = (q@k.transpose(1,2))/self.scale
    x = s.softmax(dim=-1)@v
    x = rearrange(x, '(n h) s d -> n s (h d)', h=self.nheads)
    return self.proj(x)

But this hides the fact that real-world implementations of these operations are far more complex. For instance check out this memory optimised ���flash attention��� implementation in CUDA C. It also hides the fact that there are huge amounts of performance being left on the table by these generic approaches to building models. For instance, ���block sparse��� approaches can dramatically improve speed and memory use. Researchers are working on tweaks to nearly every part of common architectures, and coming up with new architectures (and SGD optimisers, and data augmentation methods, etc) ��� we���re not even close to having some neatly wrapped-up system that everyone will use forever more.

In practice, much of the fastest code today used for language models is being written in C and C++. For instance, Fabrice Bellard���s TextSynth and Georgi Gerganov���s ggml both use C, and as a result are able to take full advantage of the performance benefits of fully compiled languages.

Deployment
I���ve left one of the bits I���m most excited about to last: deployment. Currently, if you want to give your cool Python program to a friend, then you���re going to have to tell them to first install Python! Or, you could give them an enormous file that includes the entirety of Python and the libraries you use all packaged up together, which will be extracted and loaded when they run your program.

Because Python is an interpreted language, how your program will behave will depend on the exact version of python that���s installed, what versions of what libraries are present, and how it���s all been configured. In order to avoid this maintenance nightmare, instead the Python community has settled on a couple of options for installing Python applications: environments, which have a separate Python installation for each program; or containers, which have much of an entire operating system set up for each application. Both approaches lead to a lot of confusion and overhead in developing and deploying Python applications.

Compare this to deploying a statically compiled C application: you can literally just make the compiled program available for direct download. It can be just 100k or so in size, and will launch and run quickly.

There is also the approach taken by Go, which isn���t able to generate small applications like C, but instead incorporates a ���runtime��� into each packaged application. This approach is a compromise between Python and C, still requiring tens of megabytes for a binary, but providing for easier deployment than Python.

As a compiled language, Mojo���s deployment story is basically the same as C. For instance, a program that includes a version of matmul written from scratch is around 100k.

This means that Mojo is far more than a language for AI/ML applications. It���s actually a version of Python that allows us to write fast, small, easily-deployed applications that take advantage of all available cores and accelerators!

The article highlights the potential of Mojo, a new programming language developed by Modular1, as a significant advance in the field of programming languages. Mojo is built on Python but aims to address Python's performance and deployment issues.
The author begins by discussing the drawbacks of using Python for performance-sensitive tasks. While Python is a versatile and elegant language, it is significantly slower than languages like C++. To overcome this limitation, Python programmers often rely on calling out to code written in faster languages such as C, FORTRAN, or Rust. This two-language approach can lead to challenges in deployment, debugging, and learning, as Python code needs to be converted into faster implementations that may not support all Python features.
The article introduces Mojo as a solution to these challenges. Mojo is described as a language that takes advantage of MLIR (Multi-Level Intermediate Representation) and is designed to be a strict superset of Python. It offers additional functionality for writing high-performance code that leverages modern accelerators. Mojo's key features include the ability to declare variable types for optimized machine code generation and the use of "struct" to tightly pack attributes into memory for efficient data structure usage.
The author explains that Mojo's rapid development and promising capabilities are a result of building on strong foundations. MLIR, initially developed by Chris Lattner at Google, provides a powerful core for languages built on top of it, similar to how LLVM has enabled languages like Rust, Julia, and Swift. By using Python as the syntax, Mojo leverages an existing language widely understood by programmers and eliminates the need for extensive syntax development.
The article also emphasizes Mojo's deployment advantages. Compared to Python's dependency on separate installations or containerization, Mojo can be deployed like a statically compiled C application, resulting in smaller file sizes and faster execution.
Overall, the author expresses optimism about Mojo's future development and its potential to address performance and deployment challenges in the programming language landscape. However, it should be noted that as of the publication date of the article (May 4, 2023), Mojo was not yet released to the public, apart from an online playground.

Being a superset of Python means that the Mojo programming language includes all the features and functionality of Python while also providing additional capabilities. In other words, Mojo extends Python by introducing new syntax, features, and optimizations without removing or modifying any existing Python functionality.
As a superset, Mojo maintains backward compatibility with Python, allowing developers to leverage their existing knowledge and codebase. Python code can be seamlessly integrated into Mojo, and Python libraries and modules can be used within Mojo programs. However, Mojo offers extra features and improvements that aim to address Python's performance and deployment limitations.

While Xonsh offers a powerful and convenient shell environment, it may not always be the fastest option for executing commands. The performance of Xonsh can vary depending on various factors, including the complexity of the commands being executed and the underlying system resources.
Since Xonsh is built as a superset of Python, it inherits the performance characteristics of Python. Python is an interpreted language, which means that it typically has slower execution speeds compared to compiled languages like C or Rust. However, Python offers high-level abstractions, extensive libraries, and ease of use, which makes it a popular choice for development despite its performance trade-offs.
In the context of Xonsh, the execution speed can be influenced by the combination of Python and shell commands, as well as the specific operations being performed. Python code execution within Xonsh should have similar performance characteristics to regular Python code. Shell commands executed through Xonsh may have performance implications depending on the complexity and efficiency of the underlying shell commands themselves.
It's important to note that for many use cases, the performance difference between shells or scripting languages may not be significant enough to impact productivity. However, if you require highly optimized or computationally intensive operations, you may want to consider using compiled languages or specific tools that are designed for performance.
Ultimately, the speed of execution in Xonsh, as with any shell or scripting language, can depend on the specific tasks and optimizations applied. It's always recommended to profile and benchmark your code to identify any performance bottlenecks and explore possible optimizations if speed is a critical requirement.

programmers. It has features on top of Python like VAR and Let declarations and structs, but the base language is fully compatible with Python. It can also interoperate with the Python ecosystem, allowing you to use your favorite libraries like NumPy and Pandas.
It adds strong type checking to the language: Mojo adds strong type checking to the language, which is essential for optimized performance and error checking. You can still use dynamic types if you prefer, but static types are recommended for optimal performance. It also supports manual memory management with pointers like C++, and it has an ownership system and borrow checker similar to Rust.
It���s not available to the public yet: Mojo is still in early development and is not yet available to the public. However, it will be open-sourced in the future. Currently, there���s a waitlist to try it out, but lucky early-access users like us can create a file ending in Mojo or ���� emoji to run the code.
So, what makes Mojo so fast? We���ll take a look at a matrix multiplication demo to demonstrate its performance gains. First, we benchmark a basic function in Python. Then by simply importing that code into Mojo, it���s executed 14 times faster with no modifications to the code. We can further optimize this code by adding types to the Python implementation with Mojo���s built-in Struct keyword. We can define mutable and immutable variables using VAR and Let, respectively. We also replace def with FN, which is a stricter type of function. Mojo has a built-in type called ���single instruction multiple data��� that represents a vector where a single instruction can be executed across multiple elements in parallel on the underlying hardware. Once we have this Struct, we can then use it as a type in the Python implementation. When we benchmark the code again, we get a ridiculous 500x performance boost. But we���re still not happy yet. In the inner loop, we can query the vector width instead of hard-coding it, and that gives us a 1000x gain.


In conclusion, Mojo is a language with a lot of potential to change the programming language landscape. With its unique features like being a superset of Python, designed for AI hardware, strong type checking, and memory management, Mojo could become the go-to language for performance-critical applications. However, only time will tell if Mojo can deliver on its promises and surpass established languages like Python and C.

What do you think of Mojo? Do you believe it can kill Python and C at the same time? Let us know in the comments.

While Mojo showcases impressive performance improvements, it's important to consider the broader context. Python and C are well-established languages with extensive ecosystems and large communities of developers. They are widely used in various domains and have proven track records in terms of performance, versatility, and scalability.
Mojo's success in replacing Python and C would depend on several factors, including the adoption and acceptance of the language by the developer community, the availability and maturity of libraries and tools, and the overall performance gains achieved by using Mojo in real-world scenarios. It's worth noting that language adoption and migration can be a slow process, as it involves not only the language itself but also the existing codebases, developer expertise, and ecosystem support.
While Mojo shows promise, it's unlikely to completely replace Python and C simultaneously. Python has a strong foothold in the AI and data science communities, thanks to its simplicity, extensive libraries like NumPy and Pandas, and its role as a lingua franca for machine learning frameworks. C, on the other hand, remains a go-to language for systems programming and low-level optimizations.
However, Mojo could find its niche in performance-critical applications, particularly in the AI domain where Python's interpreted nature can be a limitation. It may attract developers who require the combined benefits of Python-like syntax, strong type checking, manual memory management, and optimized performance for AI hardware.
Ultimately, the success of Mojo will depend on factors like its continued development, community adoption, real-world performance comparisons, and the specific needs and preferences of developers in different domains.

S wift Creator's Company Builds New Programming Language 'Mojo' - a Python Superset
from the Python++ dept.
While working at Apple, Chris Lattner designed Swift to "fully leverage the power of LLVM," and "led a team for a while at Google to try to move Swift out of its Apple comfort zone, to become a replacement for Python in AI model development." That's according to a blog post by Jeremy Howard, an advisor to Lattner's Modular AI (which he co-founded in 2022 to build a next-generation AI platform for developers).

"But sadly," Howard writes, Swift "did not receive the support it needed from either Apple or from Google, and it was not ultimately successful." And yet...
[W]hilst at Google Chris did develop another project which became hugely successful: MLIR. MLIR is a replacement for LLVM's intermediate representation [or IR] for the modern age of many-core computing and AI workloads. It's critical for fully leveraging the power of hardware like GPUs, TPUs, and the vector units increasingly being added to server-class CPUs.

So, if Swift was "syntax sugar for LLVM", what's "syntax sugar for MLIR"? The answer is: Mojo! Mojo is a brand new language that's designed to take full advantage of MLIR. And also Mojo is Python.

Wait what?

OK let me explain. Maybe it's better to say Mojo is Python++. It will be (when complete) a strict superset of the Python language. But it also has additional functionality so we can write high performance code that takes advantage of modern accelerators...

Whereas Swift was a brand new language packing all kinds of cool features based on latest research in programming language design, Mojo is, at its heart, just Python. This seems wise, not just because Python is already well understood by millions of coders, but also because after decades of use its capabilities and limitations are now well understood. Relying on the latest programming language research is pretty cool, but its potentially-dangerous speculation because you never really know how things will turn out...

A key trick in Mojo is that you can opt in at any time to a faster "mode" as a developer, by using "fn" instead of "def" to create your function. In this mode, you have to declare exactly what the type of every variable is, and as a result Mojo can create optimised machine code to implement your function. Furthermore, if you use "struct" instead of "class", your attributes will be tightly packed into memory, such that they can even be used in data structures without chasing pointers around. These are the kinds of features that allow languages like C to be so fast, and now they're accessible to Python programmers too ��� just by learning a tiny bit of new syntax...

Mojo is a new programming language developed by Chris Lattner's company, Modular AI. It is designed to be a superset of Python and takes advantage of MLIR (Multi-Level Intermediate Representation) technology, which is critical for leveraging hardware like GPUs and TPUs. Mojo aims to provide high performance and take full advantage of modern accelerators while remaining compatible with Python.
Unlike Swift, which was a new language with advanced features, Mojo builds on the familiarity and well-established capabilities of Python. It incorporates additional functionality to write high-performance code that can utilize modern hardware accelerators. This approach is considered wise since Python is already widely known and used by millions of programmers.
One of the key features of Mojo is the ability to switch to a faster "mode" using the "fn" keyword instead of "def" to create functions. In this mode, developers must declare the types of variables explicitly, allowing Mojo to generate optimized machine code for the function. Additionally, the use of "struct" instead of "class" tightly packs attributes into memory, enabling efficient usage in data structures without pointer overhead. These features bring performance benefits similar to those found in languages like C, making them accessible to Python programmers with just a minimal learning curve for the new syntax.
Overall, Mojo aims to provide a powerful and high-performance programming language while maintaining compatibility with Python and leveraging the advancements in hardware acceleration technology.

I am teaching Theory of Computation for the first time soon, and need a short introduction and justification to motivate students who have only Introductory Programming behind them. I am torn between:

(1) Emphasizing the limits of computation, i.e., there is no universal debugging program (Turing, Halting.)

(2) Emphasizing the practical value of searching webpages to gather data using regular expressions, leading to automata, coding, etc.

The choice is between emphasizing the negative���the ultimate limits on computation���or emphasizing the positive���what's achievable with proper understanding of the theory. Suggestions welcomed!

They need at least a passing acquaintance with both aspects. There are many practical uses (regular expressions for patterns, context free grammars revolutionized programming languages in ways that are hard to appreciate unless you learned classic BASIC or early FORTRAN and later saw Algol or Pascal for the first time) to highlight. The limits of computation aspects (and problems like P = NP, complexity theory in general) are in my opinion central in any deeper understanding of computing, and (particularly NP completeness) are required knowledge for any professional programmer.

(I should write this when I have more than a few minutes. Hopefully updates will follow.)

There are too many aspects to cover: big data, human computer interaction, computing using conventional architectures, computing using not-yet-realized architectures (nanocomputing, swarm- and cloud- and quantum-computing), computing with limited resources, complexity classes, privacy concerns, the list goes on.

In order to have a handle on any of these, one should have some acquaintance with the foundations of algorithms, philosophy of computing, mathematical logic, and basic theory on simple architectures. Even if your course is required to focus on one section, you can tie in to several others. A. K. Dewdney's "The New Turing Omnibus" is a must read for any mathematician/educator interested in classical computer science. I hope a new one comes out for the present generation so that I can understand some of current computer science before I miss out.

ChatGPT
ChatGPT
That's correct! In Forth, a "word" refers to a basic element or primitive of the language. Words in Forth are used to define and execute operations or actions. They can be predefined in the system or defined by the user.
Similarly, in Bash, pipelines are a fundamental construct that allows the chaining of multiple commands together, where the output of one command becomes the input of the next command. Each command in the pipeline is considered a basic element that performs a specific task or operation.
Both Forth words and Bash pipelines serve as building blocks for composing more complex operations. They provide a modular and compositional approach to programming, where smaller units of functionality can be combined to achieve desired outcomes.

Unified Mogramming with Var-Oriented Modeling and

Received June 26, 2012; revised July 21, 2012; accepted August 2, 2012 
ABSTRACT 
The Service ORiented Computing EnviRonment (SORCER) targets service abstractions for transdisciplinary complex- 
ity with support for heterogeneous service-oriented (SO) computing. SORCER���s models are expressed in a top-down 
Var-oriented Modeling Language (VML) unified with programs in a bottoms-up Exertion-Oriented Language (EOL). In 
this paper the introduction to mogramming (modeling and programing), which uses both languages, is described. First, 
the emphasis is on modeling with service variables that allow for computational fidelity within VML. Then, seven types 
of service providers, both local and distributed, are described to form collaborative federations described in EOL. Fi- 
nally, the unified hybrid of SO modeling and SO programming is presented. Fourteen simple mogramming examples 
illustrate the syntax and usage of both VML and EOL. 
Keywords: Metacomputing; Service-Oriented Mogramming; Var-Oriented-Modeling; Exertion-Oriented Programming; 
SOA; SORCER 
1. Introduction 
A transdisciplinary computational model requires exten- 
sive computational resources to study the behavior of a 
complex system by computer simulation. The large sys- 
tem under study that consists of thousands or millions of 
variables is often a complex nonlinear system for which 
simple, intuitive analytical solutions are not readily 
available. Usually experimentation with the model is 
done by adjusting the parameters of the system in the 
computer. The experimentation, for example aerospace 
models with multi-fidelity, involves the best of the breed 
applications, tools, and utilities considered as heteroge- 
neous services of the model. The modeling services are 
used in local/distributed concurrent federations to calcu- 
late and/or optimize the model across multiple disciplines 
fusing their domain-specific services running on laptops, 
workstations, clusters, and supercomputers. 
Services are autonomous (acting independently), local 
or distributed units of functionality. Elementary services 
have no calls to each other embedded in them. Com- 
pound services are compositions of elementary and other 
compound services. Each service implements multiple 
actions of a cohesive (well integrated) service type, usu- 
ally defined by an interface type. A service provider can 
implement multiple service types, and thus can provide 
multiple services. Its service type and operation com- 
plemented by its QoS parameters (service signature) are 
used to specify functionality of a provider. Instances of a 
service provider are equivalent units of functionality 
identified by the same signature. 
In transdisciplinary computing systems each local or 
distributed service provider in the collaborative federa- 
tion performs its services in an orchestrated workflow. 
Once the collaboration is complete, the federation dis- 
solves and the providers disperse and seek other federa- 
tions to join. The approach is service centric in which a 
service provider is defined as an independent self-sus- 
taining entity performing a specific local or network ac- 
tivity. These service providers have to be managed by a 
relevant service-centric operating system with commands 
for executing interactions of providers in dynamic virtual 
federations [1]. 
The reality at present, however, is that metacomputing 
environments [2] are still very difficult for most users to

other which defeats the basic purpose of the metacom- 
puting. 
Both computing and metacomputing platforms that al- 
low software to run on the computer require a processor, 
operating system, and programming environment with 
related runtime libraries and user agents. We consider a 
SO model or program (mogram) as the process expres- 
sion of hierarchically organized services executed by an 
aggregation of service providers���the virtual SO proc- 
essor. Its SO Operating System (SOOS) makes decisions 
about where, when, and how to run these service provid- 
ers. The specification of the service collaboration is a SO 
mogram that manipulates other executable codes (appli- 
cations, tools, and utilities) locally or remotely as its data. 
Three types of mograms are considered in the paper: 
var-models, exertions and hybrid mograms that use both 
of them. 
Instead of moving executable files around the com- 
puter network we can autonomically provision [6,7] the 
corresponding computational components (executable 
codes) as uniform services (metainstructions) of the vir- 
tual SO processor. Now we can invoke a SO mogram as 
a command of the SOOS that exerts its dynamic federa- 
tions of service providers and related resources, and en- 
ables the collaboration of the required service providers 
according to the SO moogram definition with its own 
data and control strategy. 
One of the first SO platforms developed under the 
sponsorship of the National Institute for Standards and 
Technology (NIST) was the Federated Intelligent Prod- 
uct Environment (FIPER) [8]. The goal of FIPER was to 
form a federation of distributed service objects that pro- 
vide engineering data, applications, and tools on a net- 
work. A highly flexible software architecture had been 
developed for transdisciplinary computing (1999-2003), 
in which engineering tools like computer-aided design 
(CAD), computer-aided engineering (CAE), product data 
management (PDM), optimization, cost modeling, etc., 
act as both service providers and service requestors. 
The SORCER environment [5,6,9-11] builds on the 
top of FIPER to introduce a SOOS with all system ser- 
vices necessary, including service management (rendez- 
vous services), a federated file system, and autonomic 
resource management, to support service-object oriented 
programming. It provides a SOOS for complex network- 
centric applications that require multiple solutions across 
multiple disciplines combined at runtime into a transdis- 
ciplinary collaboration of service providers in the global 
network. The SORCER environment adds two entirely 
new layers of abstraction to the practice of SO comput- 
ing���SO models expressed in a Var-oriented Modeling 
Language (VML) in concert with SO programs expressed 
in an Exertion-Oriented Language (EOL) verified and 
validated in projects at the General Electric Global Re- 
search Center, GE Aviation, Air Force Research Lab, 
SORCER Lab at TTU [12]. 
The remainder of this paper is organized as follows 
Section 2 describes briefly var-oriented modeling; Sec- 
tion 3 describes exertion-oriented programming; Section 
4 describes var-oriented programming and var-oriented 
modeling for design optimization; Section 5 introduces 
the SORCER SOOS; finally Section 6 concludes with 
final remarks and comments. The basic concepts of ser- 
vice-oriented mogramming [13] (modeling and pro- 
gramming) are illustrated with simple and easy to follow

2. Var-Oriented Modeling 
A computation is a relation between a set of inputs and a 
set of potential outputs. There are many ways to describe 
or represent a computation and a composition of them. 
Two types of computations are considered in this paper: 
var-oriented and exertion-oriented. A service is the work 
performed in which a service provider exerts acquired 
abilities to execute a computation. A service variable, 
called a var and an exertion are expressions of a service 
in the Var-Oriented Language (VOL) and the Var-Ori- 
ented Modeling Language (VML), respectively. 
The first one is drawn primarily from the semantics of 
a variable the second one from the semantics of a routine. 
Either one can be mixed with another depending on the 
direction of the problem being solved: top down or bot- 
tom up. The top down approach usually starts with var- 
oriented modeling in the beginning focused on relation- 
ships of vars in the model with no need to associate them 
to services. Later the var-model may incorporate relevant 
services (evaluators) including exertions. In var-oriented 
modeling three types of models can be defined (response, 
parametric, and optimization) and in exertion-oriented 
programming seven different types of elementary exer- 
tions (tasks) and two types of compositional exertions 
(jobs) are defined. 
The fundamental principle of functional programming 
is that a computation can be realized by composing func- 
tions. Functional programming languages consider func- 
tions to be data, avoid states, and mutable values in the 
evaluation process in contrast to the imperative pro- 
gramming style, which emphasizes changes in state val- 
ues. Thus, one can write a function that takes other func- 
tions as parameters, returning yet another function. Ex- 
perience suggests that functional programs are more ro- 
bust and easier to test than imperative ones. Not all op- 
erations are mathematical functions. In nonfunctional 
programming languages, ���functions��� are subroutines that 
return values while in a mathematical sense a function is 
a unique mapping from input values to output values. In 
SORCER a var allows one to use functions, subroutines,

or coroutines in the same way. A value of a var can be 
associated with a mathematical function, subroutine, co- 
routine, object, or any local or distributed data. The func- 
tional composition notation has been used for the Var- 
Oriented Language (VOL) and the Var-Oriented Model- 
ing Language (VML) that are usually complemented 
with the Java object-oriented syntax. The concept of vars 
and exertions as expression of services combines the 
three languages VOL, VML, and EOL into a uniform SO 
programming model. 
2.1. Var-Orientd Programing (VOP) 
In every computing process variables represent data 
elements and the number of variables increases with the 
increased complexity of problems being solved. The va- 
lue of a computing variable is not necessarily part of an 
equation or formula as in mathematics. In computing, a 
variable may be employed in a repetitive process: as- 
signed a value in one place, then used elsewhere, then 
reassigned a new value and used again in the same way. 
Handling large sets of interconnected variables for trans- 
disciplinary computing requires adequate programming 
methodologies. 
A service variable (var) is a structure defined by the 
triplet <value, {evaluator}, {filter}>. VOP is a pro- 
gramming paradigm that uses service variables to design 
var-oriented multifidelity compositions. An evaluator- 
filter pair is called a var fidelity. It is based on dataflow 
principles where changing the value of any argument var 
should automatically force recalculation of the var���s 
value. VOP promotes values defined by an evaluator- 
filter pairs in the var and its dependency chain of argu- 
ment vars to become the main concept behind any proc- 
essing. 
The semantics of a variable depends on the process 
expression formalism [14]: 
1) A variable in mathematics is a symbol that repre- 
sents a quantity in a mathematical expression. 
2) A variable in programming is a symbolic name as- 
sociated with a value. 
3) A variable in object-oriented programming is a set 
of an object���s attributes accessible via operations called 
getters. 
4) A service variable is a triplet: <value, {evaluator}, 
{filter}>, where: 
a) a filter is a getter operation; 
an evaluator is a service with the argument vars that de- 
fine the var dependency chain; and 
b) a value is a quantity filtered out from the output of 
the current evaluator; the value is invalid when the cur- 
rent evaluator or its filter is changed, current evaluator���s 
arguments change, or the value is undefined. 
VOP is the programming paradigm that treats any 
computation as the VFE triplet: value, filter (pipeline of 
filters), and evaluator as illustrated in Figure 1. Evalua- 
tors and filters can be executed locally or remotely. An 
evaluator may use a differentiator to calculate the rates at 
which the var quantities change with respect to the ar- 
gument vars. Multiple associations of an evaluator-filter 
pair can be used with the same var allowing var���s fidelity. 
The VFE paradigm emphasizes the usage of multiple 
pairs of evaluator-filter (called var fidelities) to define 
the value of var. The semantics of the value, whether the 
var represents a mathematical function, subroutine, co- 
routine, or data, depends on the evaluator and filter cur- 
rently used by the var. 
A service in VOP is the work performed by a var���s 
evaluator-filter pair. Evaluators and filters of the var de- 
fine: 
1) the var arguments and their dependency chain 
(composition); 
2) multiple processing services (output multifidelity); 
3) multiple differentiation services (differentiation mul- 
tifidelity); 
4) evaluators can execute any type of local or distrib- 
uted processing (connectivity and net heterogeneity); and 
5) filters provide postprocessing (interoperability). 
Thus, in the same process various forms of services 
(local and distributed) can be mixed within the same 
uniform process expression. Also, the fidelity of vars can 
be changed at runtime as it depends on the currently se- 
lected evaluator-filter pair. 
The variable evaluation strategy is defined as follows: 
the var value is returned if it is valid, otherwise the cur- 
rent evaluator determines the variable���s raw value (not 
processed or subjected to analysis), and the current pipe- 
line of filters returns the output value from the evaluator 
result and makes that var���s value valid.

The excerpt describes the concept of Var-Oriented Modeling and Var-Oriented Programming (VOP) as part of the Unified Mogramming approach. Var-oriented modeling focuses on representing computations using service variables called vars, while VOP is a programming paradigm that utilizes service variables to design var-oriented multifidelity compositions.
In Var-Oriented Modeling, computations are seen as relations between sets of inputs and potential outputs. There are two types of computations considered: var-oriented and exertion-oriented. Vars are expressions of services in the Var-Oriented Language (VOL), while exertions are expressions of services in the Var-Oriented Modeling Language (VML). Var-oriented modeling allows for the definition of various types of models, such as response, parametric, and optimization models.
Var-Oriented Programming (VOP) treats computations as the VFE (Value, Filter, Evaluator) triplet. A service variable, or var, is structured as <value, {evaluator}, {filter}>. VOP utilizes evaluators and filters to define the value of a var. Evaluators represent the service with the argument vars that define the var's dependency chain, while filters provide post-processing operations. VOP promotes values defined by evaluator-filter pairs in vars and their dependency chains as the central concept in processing.
The semantics of a variable in VOP depend on the process expression formalism and can represent mathematical functions, subroutines, coroutines, or data. VOP allows for the execution of evaluators and filters locally or remotely, and multiple associations of evaluator-filter pairs can be used to define the fidelity of a var.
The VOP programming paradigm emphasizes the usage of multiple evaluator-filter pairs to define the value of a var, and the semantics of the value depend on the currently selected evaluator and filter. VOP enables the mixing of various forms of services, both local and distributed, within the same process expression. The evaluation strategy involves determining the validity of a var's value and using the current evaluator and filter to process and return the value if it is invalid.
Overall, Var-Oriented Modeling and Var-Oriented Programming provide a unified approach to modeling and programming by utilizing service variables and emphasizing the composition and manipulation of vars to represent computations and achieve multifidelity compositions.

Can we get some simpler explanations?
1 / 1
ChatGPT
ChatGPT
Certainly! Here are simpler explanations of Var-Oriented Modeling and Var-Oriented Programming:
Var-Oriented Modeling: Var-oriented modeling is a way of describing computations using service variables called "vars." Think of vars as placeholders for values that can be calculated or determined by various services. It allows us to represent relationships between inputs and potential outputs. With var-oriented modeling, we can create different types of models, like response models (how a system reacts to inputs), parametric models (studying the effects of changing parameters), and optimization models (finding the best values for certain criteria).
Var-Oriented Programming (VOP): VOP is a programming approach that revolves around working with vars. In VOP, a var is a structure that consists of three parts: a value, an evaluator, and a filter. The value represents the result or data stored in the var. The evaluator is a service that calculates or determines the value of the var based on input variables. The filter is an operation that can be applied to the value, like post-processing or transforming it.
With VOP, we can define computations by connecting vars together in a dataflow-like manner. Each var's value depends on the values of the vars it is connected to through evaluators and filters. This allows for flexible and dynamic computations, where changing the value of one var can automatically trigger the recalculation of other dependent vars.
VOP also supports using different types of services, both locally and remotely, to calculate var values. It promotes the idea of composing services and building complex computations by connecting vars with different evaluators and filters. This flexibility makes it easier to work with computations that involve multiple disciplines or complex systems.
In summary, Var-Oriented Modeling and Var-Oriented Programming provide approaches for describing and implementing computations using service variables (vars). They allow us to represent relationships between inputs and outputs, perform calculations using various services, and create flexible and dynamic computations by connecting vars together.

Connections to dataflow programming and process invocation
1 / 1
ChatGPT
ChatGPT
Var-Oriented Modeling and Var-Oriented Programming have connections to dataflow programming and process invocation:
Dataflow Programming: Var-Oriented Programming, with its emphasis on connecting vars in a dataflow-like manner, shares similarities with dataflow programming paradigms. In dataflow programming, computations are represented as directed graphs, where nodes represent operations or functions, and edges represent the flow of data between operations. Vars in Var-Oriented Programming can be seen as dataflow nodes, and the connections between vars resemble dataflow edges. This allows for a data-driven approach to computations, where the execution of operations depends on the availability of data.
Process Invocation: Process invocation is the act of invoking or initiating a process or program to perform a specific task. In the context of Var-Oriented Programming, process invocation plays a role in executing evaluators and filters associated with vars. When a var's value is requested, the corresponding evaluator is invoked to calculate the value based on the input variables. The filters, which represent post-processing operations, are also invoked to transform or manipulate the value before it is returned. This process of invoking evaluators and filters resembles the process invocation concept in computer science.
Overall, Var-Oriented Modeling and Var-Oriented Programming align with the principles of dataflow programming by representing computations as interconnected nodes (vars) and edges (dataflow connections). The process invocation aspect comes into play when evaluators and filters associated with vars are invoked to calculate and transform values. These connections demonstrate how Var-Oriented Modeling and Var-Oriented Programming draw inspiration from dataflow programming and process invocation concepts to enable flexible and dynamic computations.

Apologies for the abstract explanation. Let's try to provide a simpler explanation:
Var-Oriented Modeling and Var-Oriented Programming are approaches that focus on representing computations and operations using variables (vars) and their relationships. They have connections to dataflow programming and process invocation:
Dataflow Programming: In dataflow programming, computations are represented as graphs, where nodes represent operations and edges represent the flow of data between operations. Var-Oriented Programming shares similarities with dataflow programming in that vars can be seen as nodes, and the connections between vars resemble the flow of data between operations. This allows for a data-driven approach to computations, where the execution of operations depends on the availability of data.
Process Invocation: Process invocation refers to initiating or invoking a process or program to perform a specific task. In the context of Var-Oriented Programming, process invocation occurs when evaluators and filters associated with vars are invoked to calculate and transform values. When a value is requested for a var, the corresponding evaluator is invoked to perform the necessary computation based on the input variables. Filters can also be invoked to further process or manipulate the value before it is returned.
To summarize, Var-Oriented Modeling and Var-Oriented Programming employ concepts from dataflow programming by representing computations as interconnected vars and capturing the flow of data between them. Additionally, the process invocation aspect comes into play when evaluators and filters associated with vars are invoked to perform the required computations and transformations. These connections demonstrate how Var-Oriented Modeling and Var-Oriented Programming incorporate ideas from dataflow programming and process invocation to enable flexible and dynamic computations.

Some everyday examples or analogies
1 / 1
ChatGPT
ChatGPT
Certainly! Let's explore some everyday examples or analogies to help illustrate the concepts of Var-Oriented Modeling and Var-Oriented Programming:
Recipe Ingredients: Imagine you're following a recipe to make a cake. Each ingredient (such as flour, sugar, eggs) can be represented as a var. The recipe itself serves as the evaluator that combines these ingredients based on their relationships and performs the necessary calculations (mixing, baking) to produce the final output (the cake). In this analogy, the process of following the recipe and using the ingredients in the right proportions represents Var-Oriented Modeling and Var-Oriented Programming.
Puzzle Pieces: Think of solving a jigsaw puzzle. Each puzzle piece can be seen as a var. You have an evaluator (yourself) that determines how the pieces fit together based on their relationships (matching edges, colors, patterns). As you connect the pieces, you gradually construct the complete picture. Here, the process of fitting puzzle pieces together to form the whole corresponds to the ideas of Var-Oriented Modeling and Var-Oriented Programming.
Music Composition: Consider composing a piece of music. Each musical note or chord can be represented as a var. The composer acts as the evaluator who decides how these musical elements are arranged, combined, and played in a specific sequence. By invoking different notes and chords, the composer creates melodies and harmonies. The composition process, with its interplay of musical elements and the role of the composer, reflects the essence of Var-Oriented Modeling and Var-Oriented Programming.
Building Blocks: Visualize building a structure using blocks like LEGO. Each block represents a var, and their connections determine the overall design and functionality of the structure. By selecting and arranging the blocks in specific ways, you create a unique construction. The process of building with blocks, where the arrangement and connections define the final outcome, draws parallels to Var-Oriented Modeling and Var-Oriented Programming.
These everyday examples and analogies highlight how Var-Oriented Modeling and Var-Oriented Programming involve the manipulation and arrangement of variables (ingredients, puzzle pieces, musical notes, building blocks) based on their relationships and the invocation of evaluators (recipes, composers, yourself) to generate desired outcomes (cake, complete puzzle, music composition, structure).

Functional Reactive Axiology: Navigating the Intersection of Values, Algorithms, and Time

The confluence of philosophy, computer science, and sociology is a fascinating domain, pregnant with novel insights into how we conceptualize, interact with, and shape the world.

It's in this intersection that we find Functional Reactive Axiology, an exploration of our values and decision-making through the lens of Functional Reactive Programming (FRP) and social phenomena.

This essay aims to elaborate on this emergent field by drawing connections between the inherent principles of FRP, the model developed by computer scientists to deal with asynchronous dataflow and time-based events, and the way humans perceive and evaluate their socio-cultural environments.

A deep exploration into FRP and its philosophical implications will shed light on new ways to understand and grapple with complexities of the contemporary world.

In the discourse of the managerial society, where increasing polarization has provoked the rise of new paradigms and tensions between differing social factions, we observe a striking parallel to the challenges faced in the realm of FRP���particularly concerning interactive programs and the treatment of mutable states and side-effects.

It is intriguing to contemplate whether solutions found in FRP could provide valuable insights for our real-world societal quandaries.

We will also delve into the intriguing propositions laid out in Brian Christian and Tom Griffiths' book, 'Algorithms to Live By', which posits that algorithms offer crucial wisdom to untangle very human questions.

Through this lens, we will examine whether algorithmic thinking, specifically through the framework of FRP, could offer fresh perspectives to evaluate our values and decisions, illuminating the workings of individual and collective minds in the face of complex social realities.

Inevitably, we also will encounter criticism and barriers���such as the debates around Theory U, waterfall, and other workflow models���that highlight the challenges of transposing computational logic into humanistic and societal contexts.

Nevertheless, these debates provide rich fodder for our exploration, allowing us to critically analyze the potential and pitfalls of applying a FRP mindset to human axiology.

Through this essay, we hope to pave the way for a nuanced dialogue around the intersection of FRP, decision-making algorithms, social phenomena, and human values���a dialogue that may well reveal an exciting new dimension to how we understand and navigate our world.

Heterogeneous runtimes refer to environments or systems where different types of software runtimes coexist and interact with each other. A software runtime is a set of software libraries, tools, and components that enable the execution of a specific programming language or framework. In a heterogeneous runtime environment, multiple runtimes are utilized concurrently to support different programming languages, frameworks, or execution models.
Heterogeneous runtimes are often employed in complex software systems or platforms that require interoperability between diverse technologies. Each runtime may be optimized for a specific purpose or have unique capabilities, allowing developers to leverage the strengths of different programming languages or frameworks within a single system.
For example, a web application may utilize a combination of runtimes such as Node.js for server-side JavaScript execution, Java Virtual Machine (JVM) for running Java-based components, and Python runtime for specific data processing tasks. Each runtime provides the necessary infrastructure and tools to execute code written in its supported language.
Heterogeneous runtimes enable developers to leverage the strengths of different programming languages and frameworks, allowing them to choose the most suitable tool for a particular task or component. This flexibility can enhance productivity, code reuse, and performance optimization within a complex software ecosystem.
However, managing and coordinating heterogeneous runtimes can introduce challenges such as interoperability, resource management, and communication between different runtime environments. It requires careful design and integration to ensure smooth operation and efficient utilization of system resources.
Overall, heterogeneous runtimes offer a powerful approach to building flexible and scalable software systems by combining the capabilities of different programming languages and frameworks within a unified environment.

Yes, both cellphones and laptops can be considered examples of systems that utilize heterogeneous runtimes.
In the case of a cellphone, it typically runs on an operating system such as Android or iOS, which provides a runtime environment for executing applications. Within this runtime environment, various programming languages and frameworks can be used to develop mobile applications. For example, Android applications can be developed using Java or Kotlin, while iOS applications can be developed using Swift or Objective-C. The underlying runtime environment handles the execution of these different programming languages and frameworks, allowing them to coexist on the same device.
Similarly, laptops and desktop computers often have operating systems such as Windows, macOS, or Linux, which provide their respective runtime environments. These operating systems support a wide range of programming languages and frameworks, enabling developers to use different tools based on their preferences and requirements.
In both cases, the heterogeneous runtime environment allows applications written in different programming languages or frameworks to run concurrently on the same device, providing users with a diverse set of software capabilities and options.

- People looking for hope with dealing with poor mental heath, people lost on their spiritual path in the dark night of the soul: I look into how psychodiscomfort may work in the brain and into various approaches of healing it, from maladaptively interconnected brain regions to maladaptive beliefs, from dissonance, oscillopathy, or asymmetries to feeling hopeless from failing to reduce uncertainity about basic needs to feeling anxious from overly interconnected emotional brain to disconnected noncooperating parts of the mind!

- People looking for hope for the future of the humanity when it comes to its survival and wellbeing: I look into how to solve the meaning (wellbeing) and meta crisis disguised as valence (unity) crisis on local and collective scales by cooperately reducing the probabilities of the various existencial risks such as mental health crisis, nuclear war, climate change, economic collapse or misaligned artificial general superintelligence. I focus on how to possibly cultivate trust and frictionless symmetrical cooperative communication between different subagents with different mental frameworks, such as people, machines, communities, cities, governing parts in nations, nations, by for example the language of shared meaning, values and goals, as natural sciences tell us that we're all part of one interconnected system where parts depend on eachother and we should take in account the whole when solving a problem, and using insights from wellbeing science from for example complex systemic mechanisms of internal family systems psychotheraphy, how to unify the human population in general to feel more connected and be adaptive together, how to increase wellbeing in the society on the collective scale using symmetrification though annealing, having an ecosystem of interacting cooperative aethetics that are part of high degree of collective harmonious wellbeing!

- Physicists: I think about the quest for a unified theory of everything in physics and beyond in natural sciences: What are the advantages and disadvantages of different predictive mathematical models, how to reason about it on a metalevel to find a model with the most advantages

- Philosophers: I ponder on questions like what is truth using the general technical language of bayesian mental constructions in a certain lens, I think about formal systems to describe any system

- I think about wellbeing locally on the individual level, I'm looking for and developing theory and practical applications explaining why and how for example substance assisted psychotheraphies, selfimprovement movements, meditation, or neurorotechnology works.

- I think about wellbeing globally on the collective, what science of wellbeing tells us, why and how societies that report better quality of life report it, what all factors in the social system come into play, and how could society be practically pushed towards that better more adaptive state.

- I conceptualize everything in natural sciences and experience through the mathematics of adaptive complex systems. I am interested in those mathematics to engineer wellbeing on all scales and find correspondences between different scientific disciplines and different approaches inside concrete scientific disciplines.

- I think that everything in psychotheraphy, psychology, sociology, selfimprovement, spirituality, biology, physics, neuroscience, cognitive science, and so on, can be understood and interconnected through this general mathematical language of adaptive complex systems.

- I think this general language can sketch out new potential wellbeing engineering interventions on both local and global scale, and then can be translated into the less mathematical language or less general language of laymen cultural frameworks, psychology, sociology, spirituality, biology, cognitive science, and so on.

- I first do a giant general synethesis and then dig deeper into concrete details.

This is what I'm developing in this book.

I start with context: Hell must be destroyed! �������� My motivation behind everything is to help people have more fullfilling life, have better sense of wellbeing, using what we know from theory and empirical studies of practices in science.

The whole text is an attempt to find, explain, synthesize all tools used for wellbeing engineering on individual and social scale to help everyone the most effectively, mapping out the landscape in science and psychotools

First I do a synthesis of individually used wellbeing psychotools in less technical language without explaining mechanisms (because I havent introduced science yet). Deconstruction of mind, inducing happiness, construction, shifting to more relaxed, deeper, healed, loving, light, spontanious, fullfilling, free baseline (symmetrification accelerationism!), by meditation and psychedelics, with lots of inspiration from Michael Taft and Shinzen Young, or potentially neurotechnology in the future.

Then I do synthesis of science, connecting the landscape of neurophenomenological approaches together (implementational modelling of populations of neurons, resonance chamber, electromagnetism physics, connectivity of large networks), algorithmic (machine learning architectures), computational (markov blankets, , reinforcement learning agents, evolution of latent bioelectrical morphologocal spaces), phenomenological (pragmatic dharma, solitons in a field, flow of energy, beliefs, words, images, feelings in spacetime etc.), connecting social science approaches together, in the context of universal darwinian bayesianism based on the free energy principle with potentially quantumness taken into account, and present the general symmetry analysis and annealing principles as tools that can be used in analysis of any complex system, and how symmetries tend to correspond more wellbeing of the system, making it more flexibly adaptive, but too much symmetries can also be a failure mode because of not being able to resist entropy. Annealing is presented as a tool to symmetrify the system's dynamics through disintegration of local nonlinearities and creation of more global synchrony.

Then in the framework of connecting (not only) qualia research institute ideas with bayesian brain ideas I give some technical notes to the synthesis of individual psychotools I mapped out before, mapping out the empirically tested or hypothesized mechanisms of action.

I think about some fundamental philosophical questions of ontology and truth and how it can be seen through a very mental model (bayesian belief) relativist lens, inspired by metarationality and metamodernism - caring about predictive power of models, them not being fully objective but just approximations, and how much valence they give (unifying memeplexes increase wellbeing by application of symmetry theory of valence to bayesian belief networks)

Then after all this synethesis, I create a landscape of explained concepts concretely in this synthetized framework linking to more research in the landscape of research out there in more detail, creating a tree to navigate, instead all of it being meshed in one text, writing an explanation for both laymen and technical people

Main concepts explained so far would be: psychology (self, meaning, happiness, trauma, values, agency, emotions, neurodiscomfort, neurodivergences), substances (psychedelics, dissociatives, antidepressants), psychotheraphy (cognitive behavioral theraphy, internal family systems, mindfullness, acceptance theraphy, psychedelics assisted psychotheraphy, Gestalt), meditation (deconstruction, construction, do nothing, love and kindness, jhanas, cessations, deities, DMT entities, gods, insight, dark night of the soul), sociology (wellbeing and meaning in society, coordinating risks, adaptibility), neurotechnology (relaxing focusing neurohelmets, deep brain stimulation)

Also not forgetting to explain ����Love����!

Then some other concepts: nostalgia, intelligence, stimulants, weed, alcohol, sex, music, chakras without metaphysical assumptions, lucid dreaming, other neurotechnology And some of my other thoughts on AGI alignment, unifying physics, and some other ideas or philosophical stuff that's in my mind

I end it with personal message about my journey, how I got here, what kind of my past motivates me to do this stuff.

Nice aethetics for everyone! Loving caring vast spacious silent infinite free full of life joyous cute colorful spontaneous divine compassionate flowy aethetics for everyone! I map out the aethetics I've acquired over the years. �������� I'll maybe also add a story about crazy scientist travelling the statespace of existence (multiverse?) giving all beings in all multiverses infinite gradients of wellbeing. ��������

NOTHING AND EVERYTHING IS REAL! WHY IS THERE CONSCIOUS EXPERIENCE????? WHAT WHY WHO WHEN WHERE WTF???? WE KNOW NOTHING AND EVERYTHING???? OMMGGGGGG WOOOOOOAAAAAAAWWe're in this loving mystery together in one interconnected system called nature! I'm in love with light depth of everything that is! Another way of pleasant reconstruction is imagining how the people you care about are doing well, or even the people you struggle with, or every single human, or every single being, expanding your ingroup area of empathy, connecting yourself with all people. Or imagining, interacting with, or becoming the deity of compassion that helps to relieve the suffering of all beings. Dark nights of the soul seem the be the result of disintegration of the psyche before it gets unified with more transcendental nonconceptuality, oneness, love and so on. When the self center hub dissolves, but there is no ocean efficient at stress dissipation of sensations to be effortlessly floating in. So you end up with dense ground with some processes instead. With much less flow of neural activity, its like you literally died, being a rigid disconnected void. Being a rigid metal ground with nothing really happening, or some things happening in their own place, but lonely, depressive or anxious, full of error signals. When the density gets dissolved into fluidity and things just weee by themself and effortless joyous activity happens lightly in this depth, you enter the state of free flowing ocean without effort. Neural annealing activities, interconnecting constructive meditation of love, oneness, beauty, wholeness, mandala, kindness to the rescue! Learning to love and accept all that is will result in lightening, fluidifying, floatifying, easifying, undensefying, unrigidityfying, smoothening, interconnecting everything without judgement. Love is a trainable skill! Muscle of the brain. Tune into, live from the most fundamental bayesian prior, notice the stillness of the "there is existence" prior and nothing can destroy in nonextreme states of consciousness, everything else you don't need you can let go off and be in peace. Nothing needs to be guarded. We won't physically die when we let go off of everything. All thoughts, all emotions, all personality, sense of doing anything, is just dissolved into soft gentle golden light present everywhere but at the same time a single point of it is glowing incredibly brightly in the center of your being, single point of light glowing in the vast space of awareness, this light is pristine, perfect, beautiful, kind, loving, caring, wise, clear, filled with life energy, playfullness, spontaneity. Be with that light now, be that light. Even that light itself is in some ways empty, but there, just like thoughts and feeling are empty, but there, personality, body is empty, but there, time and space, the world around you, people are empty but there. Real sense of connectedness with everything, no boundary between us and anything else. Unity.

Substances
Edit
Other substances are magical too! MDMA adds bonus love. Psychedelics can too, they overall tend to weaken, transform or strenghten assumptions and add more fuel to play with everything and scatter attention. Stimulants enhance and fuel narrow attention on a mental object with added clarity. Dissociatives turn off mechanisms and parts of experience.

What is experience?
Edit
Experience is like an orchestra, a lot of instruments plying being aligned by a director. An ecosystem of internal animals that learn, interact with eachother by communicating, giving eachother hugs, or battle and eat eachother, or form interacting coordinated communities with leaders and leaders of leaders. All sensations are toys and baby angel's love arrows and pink fluffy unicorns playing in the playground of awareness! Internal ecosystem of cute pets that you can play with and give love to! Hurricanes interfering with eachother. Black holes sucking planets. Galaxies merging. Screen with movie. Reflections in a mirror. Indestructible still mountain. Smooth waves in a vast still silent boundaryless deep ocean. Infinite sky with clouds just being there. Groundless ground. Organisms, structures resisting disorder. Interacting particles in a field.

Construction
Edit
What is? Starting from Zero Ontology[1] , from universal wavefunction, one electron universe, baseline is superposition of all possible states of physical fields, structurelessness.[2]

Quantum Field Theory postulates that there are multiple fields of contents in spacetime. Under Free Energy Principle, quantum mechanics scale has high stochastic fluctations, general relativity scale has low fluctations, and we live and reduce uncertainity about our sensory data in the middle. [3] Superposition of all possible paths of particles ala Feyman's integral is mathematically equivalent to thinking of quantum mechanics as smooth field evolving ala Schrodinger equation. One electron from one electron universe is a field.[4] This can be further deflated by the Amplituhedron. [5]

Universal Darwinism: what survives is not what is fittest, but what is the most stable in time, what had the best conditions for continued existence, what resisted entropy, second law of thermodynamics.

The smallest parts that are regularities across spacetime are fundamental particles, that are quantum excitation of their fields. They can also be seen as solitons, or markov blankets.

Particles form higher order structures through darwinian statistical physical game theoretic selforganization with scalefree selfsimilar dynamics with each scale causally codependently affecting eachother: atoms, molecules, cells, organs, organisms, societies, ecosystem,... neurons, raw sensations, complex mental representations in experience such as cognitive mechanisms, narratives, models,... they, or any pattern, can also be seen regularities in spacetime, as hiearchical markov blankets with internal and external states, measure and action on the boundary states, or solitons, as stable excitation in a field-like spectrumy implementational or abstract thingness functional evolving statespace with state of the system surfing between local minimas governed by free energy gradients, a general framework to ground subjectively or objectively empirically measured patterns on our retina to construct a predictive model.[6]<[7][8]

Neurophenomenology studies the dynamics of neurons forming hiearchical specialized or unified populations forming cognitive faculties and mental representations when activated. Deep meditative highly symmetrical states feel like the superposition of all possible configurations of qualia.

Consciousness, defined as subjective experience, can be part of physics. Physics can be part of consciousness. Physics can be giant field of universal consciousness, and in it we (observers) can be local substructures, hiearchical markov blankets, solitons, coherence, topological pockets with a field within it, and those senses in phenomenology can be further warped or transcended. Both can be approximating or/and (infinitely small) part of something third, something beyond human comprehension. Dissolve all too certain beliefs by embracing infinite combinatorial explosion of possible synthesises with different models in a higher order of complexity embracing both sides cooperatively and become one with the ineffable unknownness of reality full of timeless absolute meaning. All models are wrong but some are useful by giving more predictivity, agency, or wellbeing.

The construction section delves into the nature of reality and the interconnectedness of physics and consciousness. It begins with the concept of Zero Ontology, which posits that the baseline of reality is a superposition of all possible states of physical fields. It mentions the principles of Quantum Field Theory, which states that there are multiple fields of content in spacetime, and the Free Energy Principle, which relates stochastic fluctuations in quantum mechanics to our reduction of uncertainty about sensory data.
The section discusses the idea of universal Darwinism, which emphasizes that what survives is not necessarily the fittest, but rather what is the most stable over time and resists entropy. It then explores the concept of fundamental particles as quantum excitations of their fields, and how they form higher-order structures through self-organization and causal codependence.
Neurophenomenology is introduced as the study of the dynamics of neurons forming hierarchical populations that give rise to cognitive faculties and mental representations. The text suggests that deep meditative states can feel like the superposition of all possible configurations of qualia.
Consciousness is defined as subjective experience, and the text proposes that it can be part of physics and vice versa. It suggests that physics can be seen as a field of universal consciousness, with observers being local substructures or solitons within it. It also acknowledges the limitations of human comprehension and encourages embracing the unknown and the complexity of reality.
The section concludes by stating that all models are imperfect but can be useful in providing predictivity, agency, and wellbeing, and that embracing multiple models and the ineffable nature of reality can lead to a deeper understanding.

In  complex terms: General scientific framework: Towards unified model of everything and neurophenomenology: Universal pleasant flow by symmetrification through annealing in universal darwinian bayesianism in the landscape of complex systems research
Edit
Universal scalefree darwinian bayesianism
Edit
Alt text Alt text [1][2][3]

Universal darwinistic bayesianism based on the free energy principle is a general language for natural sciences on all scales. Let it be physics, chemistry, (neuro)biology, psychology, phenomenology, sociology, ecosystems, it all can be described as evolving flow with random fluctations using stochastic differential equations. You can think of fluid flow, ocean, weather, evolutionary dynamics of cultures, or neural celluar automata with random perturbations. Any things in this flow are stable patterns in time, have statistical boundary are their internal states are correlated with their environment's external states, which means they model and predict their environment with hiearchical prior beliefs updated via surprise/uncertainity minimizing bayesian mechanics. Species or cultural frameworks are like scientific teories in their evolutionary niche testing themselves if they are evolutionary fit to be stable and reproduce or not. Many tools from many mathematical disciplicines can be used to study this flow as listed above in the image. I'm gonna add and focus on these tools:

Tools to find out how healthy an ecosystem is
Edit
General symmetry analysis principle
Edit
General symmetry analysis principle[4]: A system's dynamics can be analyzed using harmonic analysis tools[5] to map out asymmetrical information flow[6] in relation to symmetrical flow. How easy the overall information propagation between parts is, tends to tell us a lot about the system's health. Too dense information flow halts the cooperative process of interacting parts. On the other hand, too much symmetry can interfere with the system's ability to resist entropy using structure, negentropy, information, knowledge with causal power. That's the issue of overfitting, too much order, being stuck in a bad local minima, versus underfitting, too much chaos, not differentiating between things that are benefitial or not for the system, when a system is creating an internal representation of the world and itself to make predictive models and act to constantly harvest negentropy through using metabolic energy and doing coherent holistic selfgovernance to not dissolve. On the other hand, too much selfgovernance of things that are not needed to be governed will halt the system's ability to feel freeying wellbeing, that's why acceptance theraphy gives a ton of relief, as it dissolves those for survival unneeded selfreinforcing clusters of bayesian conceptual contractions.[7] People and social system seem to be suffering from too much order on all scales.[8]

Examples: psychological valence (wellbeing) in neurophenomenology[9][10], degree of cooperation of friend groups, communities, cities, countries, towards a common goal, functioning ecosystem interdependence, creating conditions for collective flow state of nervous systems leading to higher degree of felt unifying meaning in the society[11] mitigating risks together [12][13][14]

General annealing principle
Edit
General annealing principle: A system injected with a flow of energy will naturally tend to dissolve local structures, local dualities, nonlinearities, and organize into a more globally interconnected symmetrical consonant cooperative configuration[15]

Examples: psychedelics, meditation, sport, sauna, cold showers, fast energy foods, nondual philosophy, sex, praying, breath work in neurophenomenology, [16]utopian or dystopian vision vector in the memeplexian space of society - collective mental frameworks (movements, cultures, religions, ideologies, philosophies) (Team Consciousness[17], Hedonistic Imperative[18], metamodern spirituality[19], transhumanism, globalism, marxism, Christianity, Buddhism), common existencial risks, threat (misligned artificial general superinteligence, rival (Europe unifying against Russia), climate change, global nuclear war, meaning crisis, Gods)

Levels of analysis with focus on neurophenomenology
Edit
Annealing and symmetry analysis of information flow can be analyzed across all levels of analysis of a complex system: Implementational, Algorithmic, Computational.[20] For instance for the brain[21][22], where measured symmetry analysis results can correspond to eachother across levels by studying the density of the information flow plus other possible intuitive or mathematical isomorphisms in:

Implementational
Edit
Implementational: electrochemical communication of neurons[23][24][25][26], topological analysis of electromagnetism physics through cohomology[27], dissonance minimizing resonance network with harmonic modes, nonlinear wave optical computer[28][29][30][31][32][33][34], connectivity between and inside large-scale brain networks[35][36][37], molecules, genes [38][39][40][41][42]

Algorithmic
Edit
Algorithmic: machine learning architectures (RNNs, GNNs, autoencoders)[43]

Computational
Edit
Computational: hieachical network of markov blankets forming bayesian beliefs as correlations of the system with the environment minimizing free energy by approximate bayesian inference[44][45][46][47][48][49][50][51][52], network of interacting reinforcement learning agents, evolution of latent bioelectrical morphologocal spaces[53]

Phenomenological
Edit
Phenomenological: bound gestalts, soliton particles in a field[54], flow of energy[55], signals, assumptions, conditionings[56], waves in an ocean, clouds in a sky[57], qualia, words, images, feelings, senses in space and time in experience and so on[58][59][60]

Fuzziness, relational contextual dependence and fundamental problem of spacetime background independence of quantumness can be taken into account.[61][62][63][64][65][66][67][68][69][70][71][72]

Spacetime may be seen as fundamental building block in quantum field theory or quantized/emergent from a deeper structure, let it be attempts at quantum gravity such as spin foam, strings, or gravitons. Or emergent from amplituhedron, or my favorite: from quantum information theory. This connects to the phenomenological intuition that experiental space and time are useful data compression tools for quantum information theoretic observers of some beyond language dynamics out there. Same goes for any other structures in experience.

Relativism of lenses
Edit
Different lenses on the brain, mind, society, the world or what is in general study it all from a slightly different perspectives as different evolutionary niches from different initial philosophical, technical and other assumptions using different tools specialized for different usecases predicting different things and are differently succesfull. I think all the lenses or metalenses can be merged in one giant metametalens. What matters pragmatically is how well the model is supported by empirical data and how it can predict other pontential empirical data through different general mechanisms, hiearchical structures, generalizing symmetries. Also some of the models are more easily used daily pragmatically for for example wellbeing engineering or its more pleasant and higher in wellbeing to have them actively in mind, which is determined by their valence, which seems to be mostly determined by how much they unify things in the accepted paradigms in the mind that it had acquired in the past or in society or how well they prove the carrier's enemies wrong.[73][74]

When we scan the edge cases of predictive models, there may be a parralel between the slicing problem of combinatorial explosion of consciousness in computational models such as integrated information theory of consciousness and infinity explosive paradoxes in matter in quantum field theory?

Quest for a theory of everything
Edit
The free energy principle formalizes what is the mathematically best kind of model in any domain (natural science fields or in everyday perception) in theory, maximizing accuracy while minimizing complexity[75], so lets take the finite set of all measurements we have so far in neurophenomenology[76][77], physics[78] and other sciences and the mathematical models we employ to make sense of lots of the measured data into one coherent framework that have their own advantages and disadvantges in predicting different domains in different contexts and merge them all together into a single coherent framework that minimizes disadvantages and maximizes advantages. We can arbitrarily increase complexity to take in account all existing measurements and with each deflation using some kind of symmetry in the model we can generate more explanatory power by it possibly overflowing into hit or miss predicting so far unmeasured data but we can run into inconsistencies with other already measured data. I think this initial synthesis of many existing models being "true" at the same time on a higher level of complexity when taking in account where they are succesfull and where they fail and then those through symmetries deflating (possibly across scales and levels of analysis too) is a key method for finding a closest thing to a theory of everything, or a family of almost theories of everything that are differently specialized for different purposes!

It would be so great to have some kind of a meta (mathematical) language of attempts theories of everything in physics or theories of literally everything in natural science fields, consciousness, philosophy and so on, where each theory would be defined by its properties I'm describing below, then what one could care about in attempts at ToEs would be free (continuous?) parameters and for example quantum field theory, string theory, loop quantum gravity, universal bayesianism or other physics or archdisciplionary models would be a special concrete cases in this general language in this abstract mathematical space with string theory for example having "amount of unobservable properties" parameter set to gazilion, and this way in this language find a model that has the best ToE desired properies by just traversing this abstract space, trying to ground it concretely in the the empirical measurements we have as much as possible to make concrete predictions.

I like to distinguish between theories of every "thing" - usually unfalsifiable models/principles/mathematical frameworks/languages that can model anything really (usually its some abstract space of all possible models in some domain defined in some way), such as the free energy principle (but its applications to the brain or other complex systems then becomes) thanks the the infinite free parameter freedom, and attempts at theories of everything in physics (or natural sciences in general) that try to be as concretely grounded with empirical data in some domain as possible.

Middle waying seems like such an universal approach! Each model has its own different advantages and disadvantages in different domains! And some have equivalent properties! One can dissolve the hard boundaries between models by making them spectrummy by mapping out their properies in relation to eachother when reasoning about them! Middlewaying tries to minimize the effects of disadvantages and maximizes advantages! Physical theories live in a landscape as local minimas! You can also have mathematical correspondence mappings between scales using scalefree dynamical systems theory.

Continuous landscapes are useful for optimizing discrete systems too so even if most of the theories in the landscape have undesirable artifacts or messiness that would be undesirable, it might be possible for theoreticians to use optimization techniques on the landscape and either select the nearest "clean" model to the solution of their optimization problem or optimize for a section of the landscape and sift all the clean models out of that section. Some models are also more suited for our model building visualizing reasoning intuition that others, which doesn't have to correlate with how predictive they actually are.

In order to get the most predictive model of everything we can, I think merging the best physics, consciousness and overall ToEs together will be the way! Figuring out the structure of the black box of current empirical measurement mappings and fitting them into one model as accurately as possible.

Properties of models to take in account:

In physics (can be applied to all natural science fields):

- Few free parameters (-quantum field theory (seemingly arbitrary constants), +string theory but -string theory (combinatorial explosion of dimension reduction))

- High number of symmetries that unify in simplifying ways (+amplituhedron[79])

- Minimum unobservable properties (-string theory[80][81][82], +quantum field theory[83])

- Minimum unobserved observable properties (-graviton[84], -supersymmetry[85])

- Testable predictions

- Simple explanations of all so far observed physics, accuracy versus complexity tradeoff (-string theory)

- How well it can explain empty space (+loop quantum gravity[86]), -string theory) or content in it (-loop quantum gravity, +string theory)

In general:

- If more facts or observations are accounted for

- If it changes more "surprising facts" into "a matter of course" (following Peirce)

- If more details of causal relations are provided, leading to a high accuracy and precision of the description

- If it offers greater predictive power (if it offers more details about what should be expected to be seen and not seen)

- If it depends less on authorities and more on observations

- If it makes fewer assumptions

- If it is more falsifiable (more testable by observation or experiment, according to Popper)

- If it can be used to compress encoded observations into fewer bits (Solomonoff's theory of inductive inference)[87

The section discusses the tools and principles that can be used to analyze and understand complex systems. It introduces the concept of general symmetry analysis, which involves analyzing the information flow and asymmetries in relation to symmetrical flow. The health of a system can be determined by how easily information propagates between its parts, striking a balance between too much order and too much chaos. The section also mentions the general annealing principle, which states that a system injected with energy will tend to dissolve local structures and organize into a globally interconnected and cooperative configuration.
Levels of analysis are discussed, ranging from the implementational level (electrochemical communication of neurons) to the algorithmic level (machine learning architectures) to the computational level (hierarchical networks of Bayesian beliefs). Phenomenological analysis explores the experience of consciousness and the flow of energy, sensations, thoughts, and emotions. The section also mentions the importance of network theory analysis and incorporates the concept of quantumness, including its fuzzy and contextual nature.
The text acknowledges the relativism of lenses, highlighting that different perspectives and assumptions can lead to different models and understandings. It emphasizes the quest for a theory of everything and suggests that a synthesis of existing models, taking into account their advantages and disadvantages, could lead to a closer approximation of such a theory. The properties of models are discussed, including the number of free parameters, symmetries, observables, testable predictions, and explanatory power.
Overall, this section explores the complex framework of the unified model of everything and neurophenomenology, incorporating various tools, principles, and levels of analysis to understand the nature of complex systems and consciousness.

abc. Ontology

What exists fundamentally? Somethings somehow interacting with other somethings forming more complex somethings. Different paradigms and scientific theories can postulate different structures. Is nonalive physics fundamental? Or consciousness? Or combination of those? Or something third? Or all of them? I'm gonna use the current mostly used paradigms in which most of the scientific models and research about wellbeing that I am interested in is done.

abc. General scientific framework: Universal Harmonic Darwinistic Bayesianism

In the framework that I'm using, fundamentally there are fields of matter forming particles that interact with eachother by interaction fields such as the electromagnetic field with photons. More formally particles are quantum excitation of fermion fields and the interaction is mediated by a gauge field.

These interacting particles then form atoms. Atoms form molecules. Cells are made up of molecules such as nucleic acids, carbohydrates or lipids, and also macromolecules proteins that are made of molecules aminoacids. Cells together form clusters of neurons that can encode mental representations. You can locate whole brain regions that are optimized for specific functions. You can locate inner parts in internal family systems theraphy. You can locate hiearchical abstractions of mental representations in the prefortal cortrex. You can locate slower higher order more conscious conceptual mind influecing the more subconscious faster intuitive mind. Next you get whole organs, whole animals, you can study species with their cultures, that are on earth in the solar system in a galaxy in clusters of galaxies and so on up to infinity through emergence! Consciousness is the physical brain activity that causally edits the experience. But also the models of physics is constructed in our generative models, its a very useful tool for predicting our sensory data and engineering new technology.

Different natural science fields and models in them are different lenses specializing in studying different components at different scales predicting different things in different domains using different tools and are differently succesful. These fields have many mathematical methodological correspondences between them which is identifable by languages that apply in more contexts at once, which is the essence of mathematics. Each scale can be predicted by modelling it computationally by in time evolving statespace with initial conditions.

You can study any of those parts and their interactions predict the evolution in time on any scale in any context using the language of the different scientific fields, or you can use this universal complexity science language governed by the free energy principle that unifies fields such as physics, biology, neuroscience, psychology, computer science, artificial intelligence, evolutionary theory and statistics by describing complex adaptive systems of all scales in terms of energy and information flows using dynamical systems and chaos theory, statistical nonequilibrium thermodynamics, information theory, cybernetics, group theory and harmonic analysis (From the physics lens, everything is a harmonic oscillator!).

How to understand all of this? It starts with the world being as a stochastic differential equation, which means that all things - particles to people to the largest systems all move or evolve according to two processes, which combine. First is smooth flowing evolution such as planets orbiting a star or waves rippling over water or though quantum fields. Second is a random process that knocks around the smooth flow in unpredictable ways such as twinkling stars or audio static. These two processes are kind of an order and chaos - yin and yang - forever intertwined and meshed. These two very different effects combine into a chaotic flow which may be entangled in a kind of tropical storm while still maintaing resemblence of structure and things such as raindrops undulating back to earth in a state of constant flux yet still droplets, or a human being growing and adapting to the surprises of life while still remaining individual physical entity. What must things do in order to exist? Better question is: If things exist, what must they do? From the foundation of stochastic differential equations, things, defined as hiearchical markov blankets, must always move towards a pullback attractor, which is a special set of attracting states which maintains the integrity of the markov blanket and therefore a thing's coherence and identity over time. One of the profound consequences of this is that the dynamics of such a system, its laws of motion - principle of least action, will manifest a form of flow dynamics, that can be interpreted as bayesian active inference. In another words such a thing maintains an internal equivalent of a generative model encoding beliefs about the world and itself, minimizing its complexity and maximizing its accuracy. The thing adaptively learns using what it sees and thinks and acts to increase evolutionary fitness by reducing stress and dissonance. People succesfuly predicting their senses, visual data and objects, life, doing better than expected, succesfuly solving basic needs, selfrealizing and growing will be fit, satisfied and healthy with all other parts in the body hyperorganism of communicating cells sending positive signals. An example of a pullback attractor is day and night cycle, seasons or rituals. The thing uses the model to decide actions and performs a bayesian belief update based on the outcomes driven by simple laws of motion, dynamically maintaining the boundaries between things, maintaining order in the face of chaos. Biological systems harvest negentropy and build structure, build internal coherence between internal parts and the environment, to resist entropy - the second law of thermodynamics. Animals eat, think, stay unified and cooperating, internally and externally, physiologically and psychologically, to not die. When an open system gets pushed far from equilibrium by a flow of energy it will naturally selforganize. Psychedelic substances might lead to bigger harmony in the biochemical electromagnetical dynamics between different neuronal populations, making parts of experience feel more consonant and relaxed, more smoothly and regularly shaped. Newton's laws of motion, Einstein equations and Feynman path integral follow from the principle of least action. Free Energy Principle is principle of least action applied to a markov blanket. In machine learning free energy corresponds to evidence lower bound. All of this is applicable across all scales and time leading to an ecosystem of things interacting across scales.

Loop quantum gravity by Lee Smolin and Carlo Rovelli is my favorite candidate for a theory of everything.

Solving the background independence of general relativity vs background dependence of quantum mechanics clash by quantizing and independencing space with abstractifying away by representing the space of metrics (general relativity warped spacetime configurations) in the default unsolvable Wheeler���DeWitt equation that describes the quantum fuziness evolution of the geometry of space into solvable equation of evolving space of connections, where connections are functions telling how something like a vector's rotation changes in euclidian space as it moves between two points in a for example hyperbolic space and the rotation encodes the hyperbolicity, which is by default messy rewrite, so instead of vectors one can use spinors, a vectorlike thing that also represents quantum of angular momentum or spin aka Ashketar's variables, where space of metrics looks like a space of fields in quantum field theory. Ashketar's spin connections, but also evaluated over closed loops, are in the loop quantum gravity. Closed loops means that each quantized point in the fuzzily quantum evolving geometry of space connects back to itself, quantum circuits of gravitational field. 3D space can be sort of woven from these loops into a spin-network - pixelated on small scales, looking like space on large scales, irreducible grains of space connected by quantized are faces like facets. Nodes that intersect the loops = quanta of space. Loops between the nodes = 2D areas. Large quantities of these loops = spin network. Space = geometry of spin network. Time = movement of the spin network. Quantized planck space, and time = ticking like a digital clock. Spin network + time = spin foam. Added mass and energy disort the spin network diisort the shape of the volumes of the spin network is disorted, this distorts space and time, because any movement of these quanta disorts the time quanta. Time is movement of the volume quanta. This distortion of space and time is gravity.

It predicts Hawking radiation and black hole entropy consistent with Hawking and Bekenstein's equations. It gives variable speed of light depending on the energy of the photon, slightly faster gamma rays than radio waves due to the grainyness of loop quantum gravity spacetime. No infinities: Big bang didnt start with a singularity, infinitely dense and infinitely small, because of limit of planck space size. Maximum energy density when reached repels additional energy. The universe started with big bounce - the universe was big at one time, then contracted, it bounced, and then exploded from this bounce. Eternalism.

Not as lost in the combinatorial explosion of abstractness as string theory.

Combine with relational interpretation of quantum mechanics!

But it has its issues, it deosnt solve the problem of time in the questions of the general relativity on large nonquantum scales in the classical limit, or what is dark energy and matter, but that might be resolved with more research.

Maybe an absolutely predictive model of what spacetime with contents emerges from goes beyond human symbolic and shapeshifting imagination.

It seems like you have a deep interest in understanding the fundamental nature of reality and how different scientific theories and models fit together. Let's break down some of the key ideas mentioned:
Stochastic Differential Equations: These equations describe the combined effect of smooth, deterministic processes and random fluctuations in the evolution of systems. They capture the interplay between order and chaos, which is present at all scales in the universe.
Markov Blankets: These are hierarchical structures that define the boundaries of individual entities or "things" in the universe. The integrity of a Markov blanket is crucial for maintaining the coherence and identity of a thing over time. Each thing maintains an internal generative model that helps it make predictions and adapt to its environment, minimizing complexity and maximizing accuracy.
Free Energy Principle: This principle, derived from the principle of least action, governs the dynamics of systems and can be interpreted as Bayesian active inference. It states that systems strive to minimize free energy, which is a measure of surprise or uncertainty. By updating their beliefs and taking actions based on those beliefs, systems increase their evolutionary fitness and reduce stress and dissonance.
Loop Quantum Gravity: This theory aims to reconcile the background independence of general relativity and the background dependence of quantum mechanics. It quantizes space by representing it as a network of interconnected loops, known as a spin network. This approach predicts phenomena such as black hole entropy and offers a resolution to the singularity problem in the Big Bang.
Relational Interpretation of Quantum Mechanics: This interpretation emphasizes the relationships between systems rather than their intrinsic properties. It suggests that reality emerges from the interactions and correlations between entities, rather than being predetermined by underlying properties.
Unified Model of Everything: The quest for a theory of everything involves finding a single framework that encompasses all aspects of reality, from fundamental particles to complex systems. This model would ideally unify different scientific fields and provide a comprehensive understanding of the universe.
It's important to note that some of the concepts mentioned are still areas of active research and ongoing exploration. Scientists and theorists continue to refine and develop these ideas to gain a deeper understanding of the fundamental nature of reality.
It's clear that you have a deep curiosity and interest in these topics. Exploring scientific literature, engaging with experts in the field, and continuing to delve into the subject matter will help you further your understanding.

Active Inference is special case of the Free Energy Principle applied to the brain, where brain does approximate bayesian inference. The basic idea is that our brains are the game of predicting sensory inputs to try and unfer the causes that generate sensations and to work out states of the world so that we can respond adaptively. We're predicting our ability to interact with the world in optionally gripping fashion using what we've learned. If we saw the raw physics and the extreme complexity of everything instead we would go crazy. If we predict that the world is positive, it will be positive. If we truly believe that in front of us is a pink unicorn when taking a psychedelic substance, it will be there in our experience, even tho other people won't see it because of different set of beliefs.

The most mathematically optimal way to work with information is the bayes theorem and our brains seem work work in bayesian mathematics. The issue is that the bayesian theorem is too costly to compute on its own as there is a combinatorial explosion of possibilites. Evolution sidesteps this by creating an internal dynamical generative model that is active and is being edited depending on the error between predicted sensory data, our priors, and actual measured sensory data. [1]

What we see is what we expect to see.

We're never actually predicting the world per se, we're predicting our ability to interact with the world in optionally gripping fashion using what we've learned.

We can be seen as a stack of biologically hardwired and learned homeostats.

Biological systems resist the second law of thermodynamics - entropy aka chaos, by harvesting negentropy from our environment. This harvesting of negentropy is realized as eating food, harvesting solar energy and building models that predict the world. Without reducing uncertainity by building models about the world, we wouldn't be certain where to get food and in more modern age power our system with electricity.

From this seems to follow that the only thing we can be sure about is how predictive our mental or mathematical models are in their domain.

And some of those mental models in certain mental frameworks are more pleasant to inhabit or are generating more motivation and sense of meaning, or include more positive biases, unconditional love, or cognitive traps, than others.

 Bayesian Brain and the Ultimate Nature of Reality
abcd. Connectome harmonics using biochemical brain activity via electromagnetic field and its topology and symmetries

A key characteristic of human brain activity is coherent, spatially distributed harmonic oscillations forming behaviour-dependent brain networks. [1]

Remember and selectively controlling a limited set of items in working memory is achieved by interactions between bursts of beta and gamma oscillations. [2]

Communication between neurons that create brain tissue is orchestrated by the electromagnetic field, usually called bioelectricity. Studying this can tell us a lot about experience and edit it by locating neural correlates. Neurons store adaptively learned templates and beliefs of processing their sensory data in their RNA that they exchange between eachother. All cells can be seen as reinforcement learning agents, but neurons are special in a way that they can communicate among long distances like a telegraph. With bioelectric activity, the beliefs construct the generative model by predicting future sensory data after compressing present ones using visual modality, auditory modality, other senses - energy body, touch, feelings, thoughts,... Beliefs in the neurophenomenological software, where some of it is conscious (global workspace), correspond to shapes in the electromagnetic field. You can do harmonic analysis or use group theory.

abcd. Neural Annealing

Annealing is important concept for meditation, psychedelics, belief updates and so on. General structure of annealing is accumulation of internal free energy in a system leading to increased temperature which reduces constraints on freedom of action for the elements of the system leading to elements exploiting new freedom and naturally selforganizing into (usually) more consonant / symmetrical configuration. In psychedelics and meditation, free energy is semantically neutral free computational power and elements are neurons.

Indeed, Active Inference is a special case of the Free Energy Principle applied to the brain. It proposes that our brains engage in approximate Bayesian inference to predict sensory inputs and infer the causes that generate sensations. By constantly updating our internal generative models based on the prediction error between expected and actual sensory data, we can respond adaptively to the world.
The Bayesian framework is a mathematically optimal way to work with information, but the computational cost of exact Bayesian inference is prohibitive due to the combinatorial explosion of possibilities. Evolution solves this problem by creating an internal generative model that is actively updated based on prediction errors. This allows us to predict our ability to interact with the world effectively, rather than directly predicting the world itself.
Our perceptions are shaped by our expectations and beliefs, and what we see is influenced by what we predict and anticipate. Psychedelic substances, for example, can induce altered states of consciousness by temporarily modifying our generative models and generating novel predictions that differ from consensus reality.
Biological systems, including the human brain, resist the second law of thermodynamics by harvesting negentropy from the environment. This is achieved through processes such as consuming food and utilizing solar energy, as well as building models that help us predict and navigate the world. Our models reduce uncertainty and enable us to make decisions that support our survival and well-being.
Connectome harmonics and the electromagnetic field play a crucial role in brain activity. Coherent oscillations in the brain form behavior-dependent networks, and communication between neurons is facilitated by the bioelectric activity of the electromagnetic field. Studying these dynamics can provide insights into neural correlates of experience and how they can be manipulated.
Neural annealing is an important concept in various domains, including meditation, psychedelics, and belief updates. It involves the accumulation of internal free energy in a system, leading to increased temperature and reduced constraints on freedom of action. This allows elements within the system, such as neurons, to explore new possibilities and self-organize into more symmetrical or consonant configurations.
Overall, these ideas provide a framework for understanding how our brains perceive and interact with the world, and how we can manipulate and optimize our cognitive processes to enhance well-being and understanding.

Unification of neuroscientific and phenomenological models of mind.

Neuroscience is an indirect measurement of experience, studying the mind from the outside. Phenomenology is direct measurement of experience, studying the mind from the inside. Each moment of the experience can be reduced to a mathematical structure. There exists a mathematical isomorphism between the mathematics of neuroscience and phenomenology.

This mathematics is complex systems.

Neuroscience: Brain is a metastable selforganizing system. When measuring neural activity you get the dynamics of brain waves over which you can do topological analysis, according to Neural Annealing. With statistical mechanics you get a markov blanket, where nodes are beliefs, on which principle of least action, energy minimization, is applied, according to Active Inference. Nonlinear non-VonNeumann optical stochastic selforganizing complex system / computer at the edge of chaos. Phenomenology: Sensations can be considered as cluster of interlocking nonlinear waves in a field of awareness, according to Nonlinear Wave Computing. One analogy is waves in an ocean. Or a network of beliefs. Or processes on top of processes in a stochastic computing machine, those mental models in Predictive Processing are labels for stable self-organized attractors in the dynamics of sensations. There exists a mathematical isomorphism between the neuroscientific topology of brain waves and phenomenological space. Equivalently, for every subset of sensations, there is a subset of neural representation dynamics.

Each neurophenomenologic model is a subset of dynamics of brain waves.

Mental models in predictive processing are labels for stable attractors in the topology of brain waves.

The unification of neuroscientific and phenomenological models of the mind is an intriguing area of research that aims to bridge the gap between objective measurements of brain activity and subjective experiences. While neuroscience provides an indirect measurement of the mind through the study of brain activity, phenomenology focuses on the direct measurement of subjective experience.
One approach to unifying these models is through the lens of complex systems. In neuroscience, the brain is seen as a metastable self-organizing system, characterized by dynamic brain waves. Topological analysis can be applied to these brain waves, and concepts such as Neural Annealing and Active Inference help explain the dynamics of neural activity and information processing in the brain.
Phenomenology, on the other hand, considers sensations as interlocking nonlinear waves in a field of awareness. These waves can be conceptualized as clusters of beliefs or processes within a stochastic computing machine. The Predictive Processing framework suggests that mental models are labels for stable attractors in the dynamics of sensations.
The mathematical isomorphism between the neuroscientific topology of brain waves and the phenomenological space implies that each neurophenomenological model is a subset of the dynamics of brain waves. Mental models in predictive processing correspond to stable attractors in the topology of brain waves.
Furthermore, cultivating internal metacognition skills can lead to greater self-regulation and conscious access to internal processes. The symmetry theory of valence proposes that symmetries in the mathematical structure of experience are associated with positive valence, while asymmetries are linked to negative valence.
By integrating insights from neuroscience and phenomenology, we can gain a deeper understanding of the mind and its relationship with the brain. This interdisciplinary approach holds the potential to shed light on the nature of consciousness, subjective experience, and the mechanisms underlying cognitive processes.

A note about programming paradigms.
1 / 1
ChatGPT
ChatGPT
Programming paradigms play a crucial role in shaping the way we design, develop, and think about software systems. They provide a set of principles, concepts, and abstractions that guide our approach to problem-solving and solution implementation. Different programming paradigms offer distinct ways of organizing and structuring code, expressing computation, and managing complexity.
Imperative programming, one of the oldest paradigms, focuses on describing explicit sequences of instructions that manipulate the state of a program. It emphasizes the concept of mutable data and control flow, making it suitable for tasks that require precise control over low-level details.
Object-oriented programming (OOP) introduces the notion of objects, which encapsulate both data and behavior. It promotes the organization of code into reusable classes and promotes concepts such as inheritance, polymorphism, and encapsulation. OOP encourages modular and extensible design, facilitating the development of large-scale systems with complex interactions.
Functional programming emphasizes immutability, pure functions, and the absence of side effects. It treats computation as the evaluation of mathematical functions and encourages the use of higher-order functions, function composition, and declarative programming. Functional programming fosters code that is easier to reason about, test, and parallelize, promoting modularity and enabling powerful techniques such as recursion and lazy evaluation.
Declarative programming focuses on describing the desired result or outcome rather than specifying the detailed steps to achieve it. It includes paradigms such as declarative languages, logic programming, and database query languages. Declarative programming enables concise and expressive code that often abstracts away implementation details, allowing developers to focus more on the "what" rather than the "how."
Event-driven programming revolves around the handling and propagation of events or messages. It is commonly used in graphical user interfaces (GUIs) and systems that respond to asynchronous events. Event-driven programming leverages callbacks, event loops, and event-driven architectures to build reactive and interactive systems.
There are many other programming paradigms, including procedural programming, aspect-oriented programming, and concurrent programming, each with its own strengths and use cases. Modern software development often combines multiple paradigms to leverage their respective benefits and create more flexible and maintainable codebases.
Choosing the appropriate programming paradigm depends on various factors, such as the nature of the problem, the characteristics of the system, the team's expertise, and the available tools and frameworks. It is essential for developers to have a good understanding of different paradigms and their trade-offs to make informed decisions and effectively solve complex problems in software development.

It seems to me we discussed on dataflow programming, process expression invocation, functional reactive, and r-Oriented Modeling and 
Exertion-Oriented Programming Languages
1 / 1
ChatGPT
ChatGPT
Indeed, we have discussed additional programming paradigms beyond the ones mentioned earlier. Let's delve into these paradigms and explore their unique characteristics.
Dataflow programming is a paradigm where the flow of data determines the execution of a program. It focuses on defining dependencies between data elements and automatically propagating changes throughout the system. In a dataflow programming model, programs are represented as directed graphs, where nodes represent operations or computations, and edges represent data dependencies. This paradigm allows for parallel execution and simplifies reasoning about the behavior of a program.
Process expression invocation is a paradigm that combines the concept of processes and expressions. It emphasizes the use of processes, which are isolated units of computation, and the invocation of expressions to perform computations within these processes. Process expression invocation provides a structured and modular approach to programming, promoting separation of concerns and enabling concurrent and distributed execution.
Functional reactive programming (FRP) integrates functional programming and reactive programming to handle reactive and event-driven systems. FRP treats time-varying values as first-class citizens, allowing developers to express computations that react to changes in these values over time. It provides abstractions such as behaviors and events to model dynamic behavior, enabling elegant and concise solutions for building interactive applications.
r-Oriented Modeling (ROM) is a modeling paradigm that focuses on relationships and dependencies between objects rather than the objects themselves. It places emphasis on the roles and responsibilities of objects and their interactions within a system. ROM encourages a more holistic and relational approach to modeling, leading to flexible and adaptable software designs.
Exertion-Oriented Programming Languages (EOPL) are a family of programming languages that prioritize the description of actions or exertions over traditional imperative or declarative programming constructs. EOPL emphasizes the notion of an exertion, which represents a specific task or action to be performed. This paradigm promotes a more action-centric and task-oriented style of programming, which can be beneficial for certain domains or problem domains.
These additional paradigms highlight the diversity and richness of approaches in programming. Each paradigm offers unique concepts, models, and abstractions that cater to specific problem domains or programming challenges. By understanding and leveraging these paradigms, developers can expand their toolkit and adopt a more versatile and effective approach to software development.

Sorry it was var-oriented modeling
1 / 1
ChatGPT
ChatGPT
Apologies for the confusion. Let's discuss var-oriented modeling, a programming paradigm that focuses on variation and variability in software systems.
Var-oriented modeling (VOM) is a paradigm that addresses the challenges of managing and representing variability in software systems. It recognizes that many software systems have to accommodate different variants or configurations to meet diverse requirements or adapt to changing conditions.
In VOM, variability is treated as a first-class citizen, and the goal is to explicitly model and manage the different variants or configurations of a system. VOM provides mechanisms and techniques to describe and represent the variability, allowing developers to reason about the relationships and dependencies between different variants.
One common approach in VOM is the use of feature models, which represent the different features or options of a software system and their relationships. Feature models allow developers to define the valid combinations of features and manage the constraints that govern their variability.
VOM also promotes the separation of common and variable parts of a system. By identifying and abstracting common functionality, developers can reduce redundancy and improve maintainability. Variable parts are encapsulated within modules or components, making it easier to manage and adapt to different configurations.
The benefits of var-oriented modeling include improved configurability, reusability, and adaptability of software systems. It enables the development of configurable and customizable software that can be tailored to specific needs without sacrificing maintainability or increasing complexity.
Var-oriented modeling is particularly relevant in domains where variability is a central concern, such as product line engineering, software product families, or systems that require flexible configuration options. By adopting VOM, developers can effectively handle variation and variability, leading to more efficient and scalable software development processes.
In conclusion, var-oriented modeling is a programming paradigm that addresses the challenges of managing variability in software systems. It provides techniques to explicitly model and manage variability, allowing for configurable and adaptable software solutions. By embracing VOM, developers can effectively handle variation, improve software quality, and achieve greater flexibility in software development.

ChatGPT
ChatGPT
Certainly! Here are a few examples of how var-oriented modeling can be applied in different contexts:
Software Product Line Engineering: In the domain of software product lines, where a family of related software products is developed, var-oriented modeling allows for the systematic representation and management of variability. Different product configurations can be defined using feature models, and the common and variable parts can be effectively separated, leading to more efficient development and maintenance of the product line.
Configuration Management: Var-oriented modeling can be used to manage the configuration of complex software systems. By representing the different configuration options as features and their dependencies, developers can easily specify and reason about different system configurations. This enables more flexible and adaptable software systems that can be easily tailored to meet specific customer requirements.
User Interface Customization: Var-oriented modeling can be employed to create customizable user interfaces. By modeling the variability in UI components, layouts, and interaction patterns, users can personalize the interface according to their preferences. This approach allows for a more personalized user experience while maintaining a common underlying system.
Adaptive Systems: Var-oriented modeling is valuable in the development of adaptive systems that can dynamically adjust their behavior based on changing conditions or user preferences. By representing the variability in system components and their relationships, the system can dynamically select and configure the appropriate components at runtime, adapting to different contexts or user needs.
Configuration-driven Development: Var-oriented modeling enables the development of configuration-driven applications where different system behaviors can be achieved by varying the configuration options. This approach allows for rapid customization and deployment of software systems tailored to specific use cases or deployment environments.
These examples highlight the versatility and practical applications of var-oriented modeling in various domains. By explicitly modeling and managing variability, developers can create more configurable, adaptable, and customizable software systems.

ChatGPT
ChatGPT
Yes, var-oriented modeling is closely related to variable-oriented research. Variable-oriented research refers to an approach in data analysis and statistical modeling where variables are the primary focus of investigation. Instead of examining specific cases or individuals, variable-oriented research focuses on studying the relationships and patterns among variables.
In the context of software development and modeling, var-oriented modeling adopts a similar philosophy. It emphasizes the explicit representation and management of variability as a core aspect of system design and development. Rather than focusing solely on the implementation of specific cases or instances, var-oriented modeling aims to capture the commonalities and variabilities within a system by modeling and manipulating variables.
The main goal of var-oriented modeling is to provide a systematic and flexible approach to representing, managing, and reasoning about variability in software systems. It enables the development of configurable, adaptable, and customizable software by explicitly modeling the variability in system components, behaviors, and configurations.
Var-oriented modeling techniques, such as feature modeling, configuration management, and variability modeling, are often employed in the field of software engineering to support the development of software product lines, adaptive systems, and customizable applications. These techniques draw inspiration from the variable-oriented research approach and apply it to the domain of software modeling and development.

Abstract

The Service ORiented Computing EnviRonment (SORCER) targets service abstractions for transdisciplinary complexity with support for heterogeneous service-oriented (SO) computing. SORCER's models are expressed in a top-down Var-oriented Modeling Language (VML) unified with programs in a bottoms-up Exertion-Oriented Language (EOL). In this paper the introduction to mogramming (modeling and programing), which uses both languages, is described. First, the emphasis is on modeling with service variables that allow for computational fidelity within VML. Then, seven types of service providers, both local and distributed, are described to form collaborative federations described in EOL. Finally, the unified hybrid of SO modeling and SO programming is presented. Fourteen simple mogramming examples illustrate the syntax and usage of both VML and EOL.

Localization and Mapping: Swarm-piloted vehicles need to localize themselves accurately and maintain a dynamic map of the environment. Localization techniques may involve GPS, inertial measurement units (IMUs), and sensor fusion algorithms to integrate data from multiple sensors. Simultaneous Localization and Mapping (SLAM) algorithms are commonly used to build and update maps in real-time.
Swarm Behavior and Decision-Making: Vehicles in the swarm need to exhibit coordinated behavior and make decisions collectively. This can be achieved through distributed decision-making algorithms, where each vehicle evaluates its own local information and shares relevant data with neighboring vehicles to reach a consensus. The behavior of the swarm can be programmed based on predefined rules or learned through machine learning techniques.
Safety and Redundancy: Ensuring the safety of swarm-piloted vehicles is of utmost importance. Redundancy measures can be implemented to address system failures or malfunctions. For example, vehicles can have backup systems, redundant sensors, and fail-safe mechanisms to prevent accidents or mitigate risks.
Scalability and Scalable Architectures: Swarm-piloted systems should be designed to handle different swarm sizes and accommodate the addition or removal of vehicles from the swarm. Scalable architectures and protocols allow the system to adapt to changing swarm dynamics and efficiently handle a large number of vehicles.
Security and Privacy: As with any networked system, swarm-piloted vehicles must address security and privacy concerns. Measures such as secure communication protocols, data encryption, authentication mechanisms, and privacy-preserving algorithms should be implemented to protect the system from cyber threats and safeguard user privacy.
These technical considerations provide a foundation for the development and implementation of swarm-piloted vehicles.

SLAM (simultaneous localization and mapping) is a method used for autonomous vehicles that lets you build a map and localize your vehicle in that map at the same time. SLAM algorithms allow the vehicle to map out unknown environments. Engineers use the map information to carry out tasks such as path planning and obstacle avoidance.

Why SLAM Matters
SLAM has been the subject of technical research for many years. But with vast improvements in computer processing speed and the availability of low-cost sensors such as cameras and laser range finders, SLAM is now used for practical applications in a growing number of fields.

To understand why SLAM is important, let's look at some of its benefits and application examples.

SLAM Examples
Consider a home robot vacuum. Without SLAM, it will just move randomly within a room and may not be able to clean the entire floor surface. In addition, this approach uses excessive power, so the battery will run out more quickly. On the other hand, robots with SLAM can use information such as the number of wheel revolutions and data from cameras and other imaging sensors to determine the amount of movement needed. This is called localization. The robot can also simultaneously use the camera and other sensors to create a map of the obstacles in its surroundings and avoid cleaning the same area twice. This is called mapping.

Benefits of SLAM for Cleaning Robots
Benefits of SLAM for Cleaning Robots

SLAM is useful in many other applications such as navigating a fleet of mobile robots to arrange shelves in a warehouse, parking a self-driving car in an empty spot, or delivering a package by navigating a drone in an unknown environment. MATLAB and Simulink provide SLAM algorithms, functions, and analysis tools to develop various applications. You can implement simultaneous localization and mapping along with other tasks such as sensor fusion, object tracking, path planning and path following.

SLAM (Simultaneous Localization and Mapping) is a critical method used in autonomous vehicles to simultaneously build a map of the environment and accurately determine the vehicle's position within that map. SLAM algorithms play a crucial role in enabling autonomous vehicles to navigate and interact with their surroundings effectively.
Here's a breakdown of how SLAM works:
Mapping: The vehicle uses its sensors, such as lidar, cameras, or radar, to gather data about the environment. This data is processed and fused together to create a map representation. The map can be in the form of a 2D occupancy grid or a more detailed 3D representation, depending on the application.
Localization: The vehicle utilizes its sensor measurements, such as odometry (from wheel encoders) or inertial sensors, to estimate its position within the map. This involves comparing the sensor data with the map to determine the most likely position of the vehicle.
Data Association: Matching the sensor measurements to the map is a critical step in SLAM. The vehicle needs to determine which features or landmarks in the sensor data correspond to existing features in the map. This is done through techniques like feature extraction, feature matching, and data association algorithms.
Estimation and Optimization: SLAM algorithms use estimation and optimization techniques, such as Extended Kalman Filter (EKF) or Graph-based methods, to refine the map and the vehicle's position estimation. These algorithms iteratively update the map and the vehicle's position based on new sensor measurements, minimizing errors and uncertainties.
SLAM with MATLAB:
MATLAB provides a range of tools, algorithms, and functions that facilitate the development and implementation of SLAM in various applications. It offers capabilities for sensor fusion, data processing, feature extraction, and optimization, all of which are essential components of SLAM.
Using MATLAB, engineers and researchers can:
Implement and customize SLAM algorithms for specific sensor configurations and platforms.
Perform data preprocessing, calibration, and synchronization to ensure accurate sensor measurements.
Develop feature extraction and matching algorithms to identify landmarks in the sensor data.
Employ estimation and optimization techniques to refine the map and the vehicle's position estimation.
Visualize and analyze the SLAM results using interactive plots, maps, and trajectory visualization tools.
MATLAB's extensive library of functions and toolboxes, such as Robotics System Toolbox and Computer Vision Toolbox, provide ready-to-use components for SLAM development and evaluation.
In summary, SLAM is a vital technology for autonomous vehicles, enabling them to build accurate maps of their surroundings and localize themselves within those maps. With the aid of MATLAB, engineers can implement and customize SLAM algorithms to suit specific applications, paving the way for advancements in autonomous navigation, path planning, and obstacle avoidance.
