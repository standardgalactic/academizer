Preface 
When teaching a graduate topology course, it���s tempting to rush through the point-set 
topology, or even skip it altogether, and do more algebraic topology, which is more fun 
to teach and more relevant to today���s students. Many point-set topology ideas are already 
familiar to students from real analysis or undergraduate point-set topology courses and 
may seem safe to skip. Also, point-set ideas that might be unfamiliar but important in 
other subjects, say the Zariski topology in algebraic geometry or the p-adic topology in 
number theory, can be picked up later when they are encountered in context. 
An alternative to rushing through point-set topology is to cover it from a more modern, 
categorical point of view. We think this alternative is better for several reasons. Since 
many students are familiar with point-set ideas already, they are in a good position to learn 
something new about these ideas, like the universal properties characterizing them. Plus, 
using categorical methods to handle point-set topology, whose name even suggests an old- 
fashionedwayofthinkingofspaces, demonstratesthepowerandversatilityofthemethods. 
The category of topological spaces is poorly behaved in some respects, but this provides 
opportunities to draw meaningful contrasts between topology and other subjects and to 
give good reasons why some kinds of spaces (like compactly generated weakly Hausdorff 
spaces) enjoy particular prevalence. Finally, there is the practicality that point-set topology 
is on the syllabus for our i rst-year topology courses and PhD exams. Teaching the material 
in a way that both deepens understanding and prepares a solid foundation for future work 
in modern mathematics is an excellent alternative. 
This text contains material curated from many resources to present elementary topology 
from a categorical perspective. In particular, we cover some of the same topics as Ronnie 
Brown (2006), although our outlook is, from the outset, more categorical. The result is 
intentionally less comprehensive but more widely useful. We assume that students know 
linear algebra well and have had at least enough abstract algebra to understand how to 
form the quotient of a group by a normal subgroup. Students should also have some basic 
knowledge about how to work with sets and their elements, even as they endeavor to work 
with arrows instead. Students encountering diagrams and arrows for the i rst time may

presumably familiar but the perspective may be new. 
Covering spaces, homology, and cohomology are not in this book, but students will be 
ready to learn more algebraic topology after reading through our text. The omitted top- 
ics are likely included in whichever algebraic topology book is used afterward, including 
Massey (1991), Rotman (1998), May (1999), Hatcher (2002), and tom Dieck (2008), for 
which the reader will be well prepared. When we teach the i rst semester topology course 
in our PhD program, we usually cover the classif i cation of compact surfaces. While this 
classif i cation theorem is not in the text, an instructor may wish to cover it in their course, 
and it is hard to beat Conway���s ZIP proof or the proof in Massey (1991). 
With detailed descriptions of topological constructions emphasizing universal proper- 
ties; i lter-based treatment of convergence; thorough discussions of limits, colimits, and 
adjunctions; and an early emphasis on homotopy, this book guides the student of topology 
through the important transition from an undergraduate with a solid background in analysis 
or point-set topology to a graduate student preparing to work on problems in contemporary 
mathematics.

Certainly! The preface describes the approach taken in teaching a graduate-level topology course. It discusses the temptation to skip point-set topology and jump into more algebraic topology but suggests an alternative approach. This alternative involves teaching point-set topology from a modern, categorical perspective, emphasizing universal properties, convergence, limits, colimits, and homotopy. The goal is to deepen understanding and lay a solid foundation for future work in modern mathematics, including algebraic topology. While certain topics like covering spaces, homology, and cohomology are not covered in this book, students are expected to be well-prepared for further study in algebraic topology after completing this course.

Summarize: 0Preliminaries 
I argue that set theory should not be based on membership, as in Zermelo-Frankel set theory, but 
rather on isomorphism-invariant structure. 
���William Lawvere (Freitas, 2007) 
Introduction.Traditionally, the i rst chapter of a textbook on mathematics begins by recalling 
basic notions from set theory. This chapter begins by introducing basic notions from category the- 
ory, the shift being from the internal anatomy of sets to their relationships with other sets. The 
idea of focusing on the relationships between mathematical objects, rather than on their internals, 
is fundamental to modern mathematics, and category theory is the framework for working from 
this perspective. Our goal for chapter 0 is to present what is perhaps familiar to you���functions, 
sets, topological spaces���from the contemporary perspective of category theory. Notably, category 
theory originated in topology in the 1940s with work of Samuel Eilenberg and Saunders MacLane 
(Eilenberg and MacLane, 1945). 
This chapter���s material is organized into three sections. Section 0.1 begins with a quick review of 
topological spaces, bases, and continuous functions. Motivated by a few key features of topological 
spaces and continuous functions, we���ll proceed to section 0.2 and introduce three basic concepts of 
category theory: categories, functors, and natural transformations. The same section highlights one 
of the main philosophies of category theory, namely that studying a mathematical object is akin to 
studying its relationships to other objects. This golden thread starts in section 0.2 and weaves its way 
through the remaining pages of the book���we encourage you to keep an eye out for the occasional 
glimmer. Finally, equipped with the categorical mindset, we���ll revisit some familiar ideas from basic 
set theory in section 0.3. 
0.1Basic Topology 
Def i nition 0.1 A topological space (X,T) consists of a set X and a collection T of subsets 
of X that satisfy the following properties: 
(i)The empty set ��� and X are in T. 
(ii)Any union of elements in T is also in T. 
(iii)Any i nite intersection of elements in T is also in T. 
2Chapter 0 
The collection T is called a topology on X, and we���ll write X in place of (X,T) if the 
topology is understood. Occasionally, we���ll also refer to the topological space X as simply 
a space. Elements of the topology T are called open sets, and a set is called closed if and 
only if its complement is open. 
Example 0.1 Suppose X is any set. The collection 2Xof all subsets of X forms a topology 
called the discrete topology on X, and the set {���,X} forms a topology on X called the 
indiscrete topology or the trivial topology. 
Sometimes, two topologies on the same set are comparable. When T ��� T0, the topology 
T can be called coarser than T0, or the topology T0can be called i ner than T. Instead of 
coarser and i ner, some people say ���smaller and larger��� or ���weaker and stronger,��� but the 
terminology becomes clearer���as with most things in life���with coffee. A coarse grind 
yields a small number of chunky coffee pieces, whereas a i ne grind results in a large 
number of tiny coffee pieces. Finely ground beans make stronger coffee; coarsely ground 
beans make weaker coffee. 
In practice, it can be easier to work with a small collection of open subsets of X that 
generates the topology.

Chapter 0 of the book introduces fundamental concepts from category theory as a departure from traditional set theory. It emphasizes the importance of understanding mathematical objects in terms of their relationships with others. The chapter is organized into three sections:
Section 0.1 - Basic Topology:
Defines a topological space (X, T) as a set X and a collection T of subsets of X with specific properties.
Describes the properties of open sets and closed sets in a topological space.
Provides examples of topologies, including the discrete topology and the indiscrete (trivial) topology.
Introduces the idea of coarser and finer topologies and relates them to coffee grind sizes for better understanding.
The chapter aims to establish a categorical mindset, emphasizing the relationships between mathematical objects. It encourages readers to explore these concepts from a modern perspective throughout the book.

Def i nition 0.2 A collection B of subsets of a set X is a basis for a topology on X if and 
only if 
(i)For each x ��� X there is a B ��� B such that x ��� B. 
(ii)If x ��� A���B where A, B ��� B, then there is at least oneC ��� B such that x ��� C ��� A���B. 
The topology T generated by the basis B is def i ned to be the coarsest topology containing 
B. Equivalently, a set U ��� X is open in the topology generated by the basis B if and only 
if for every x ��� U there is a B ��� B such that x ��� B ��� U. 
We call the collection of B ��� B with x ��� B the basic open neighborhoods of x. More 
generally, in any topology T, those U ��� T containing x are called open neighborhoods of 
x and together are denoted Tx. 
Example 0.2 A metric space is a pair (X,d) where X is a set and d: X �� X ��� R is a 
function satisfying 
���d(x,y) ��� 0 for all x,y ��� X, 
���d(x,y) = d(y, x) for all x,y ��� X, 
���d(x,y) + d(y,z) ��� d(x,z) for all x,y,z ��� X, 
���d(x,y) = 0 if and only if x = y for all x,y ��� X. 
The function d is called a metric or a distance function. If (X,d) is a metric space, x ��� X, 
and r > 0, then the ball centered at x of radius r is def i ned to be 
B(x,r) = {y ��� X | d(x,y) < r}. 
Preliminaries3 
The balls {B(x,r)} form a basis for a topology on X called the metric topology. So any 
set with a metric gives rise to a topological space. On the other hand, if Y is a space with 
topology T and if there is a metric d on Y such that the metric topology is the same as T, 
then Y is said to be metrizable. 
Any subset of a metric space is a metric space. In particular, subsets of Rnprovide numer- 
ous examples of topological spaces since Rnwith the usual Euclidean distance function is 
a metric space. For example, 
���the real line R, 
���the unit interval I := [0,1], 
���the closed unit ball Dn:= {(x1,..., xn) ��� Rn| x2 
1 + ������ + x2 n��� 1}, and 
���the n-sphere Sn:= {(x1,..., xn+1) ��� Rn+1| x2 
1 + ������ + x2 
n+1 = 1} 
are all important topological spaces. 
We���ll see more examples of topological spaces in chapter 1 and will discuss some im- 
portant features in chapter 2. One way we���ll glean information is by studying how spaces 
relate to each other. These relationships are best understood as functions that interact 
nicely���in the sense of the following def i nition���with open subsets of the spaces. 
Def i nition 0.3 A function f : X ��� Y between two topological spaces is continuous if and 
only if f���1U is open in X whenever U is open in Y. 
It is straightforward to check that for any topological space X, the identity idX: X ��� X is 
continuous, and for any topological spaces X,Y,Z and any continuous functions f : X ��� Y 
and g: Y ��� Z, the composition gf := g ��� f : X ��� Z is continuous, and moreover that 
this composition is associative. On the surface, these observations may appear to be ho- 
hum, but quite the opposite is true. Collectively, the seemingly routine observations above 
amount to the statement that topological spaces together with continuous functions form a 
category.

In this section, Definition 0.2 introduces the concept of a basis for a topology on a set X. A collection B of subsets of X is considered a basis for a topology on X if it satisfies specific conditions. The topology T generated by this basis B is the coarsest topology containing B. Open sets in this topology are defined based on the basis elements.
Example 0.2 explains how a metric space (X, d) with a metric function d gives rise to a topological space, where open sets are defined in terms of open balls. Metrizable spaces are those for which there exists a metric that generates the same topology.
The section concludes by mentioning that subsets of metric spaces, including subsets of Euclidean spaces like R^n, provide numerous examples of topological spaces. The notion of continuity of functions between topological spaces is introduced in Definition 0.3, emphasizing the relationship between open sets in these spaces. It's noted that topological spaces and continuous functions form a category, highlighting the categorical structure of this concept.

0.2Basic Category Theory 
In this section, we���ll give the formal def i nition of a category along with several examples. 
0.2.1Categories 
Def i nition 0.4 A categoryCconsists of the following data: 
(i)a class of objects, 
4Chapter 0 
(ii)for every two objects X,Y, a set1C(X,Y) whose elements are called morphisms and 
denoted by arrows; for example f : X ��� Y, 
(iii)a composition rule def i ned for morphisms: if f : X ��� Y and g: Y ��� Z, then there 
is a morphism gf : X ��� Z. 
These data must satisfy the following two conditions: 
(i)Composition is associative. That is, if h: X ��� Y, g: Y ��� Z, f : Z ��� W, then 
f(gh) = (fg)h. 
(ii)There exist identity morphisms. That is, for every object X, there exists a morphism 
idX: X ��� X with the property that f idX= f = idYf whenever f is a morphism 
from X to Y. By the usual argument, identity morphisms are unique: if id0X: X ��� X 
is another identity morphism, then id0X= id0XidX= idX. 
The associativity condition can also be expressed by way of a commutative diagram. A 
diagram can be thought of as a directed graph with morphisms as edges and with objects 
as vertices, though we���ll give a more categorical def i nition in chapter 4. A diagram is said 
to commute (or is commutative) if all paths that share the same initial and i nal vertex are 
the same. For example, if h: X ��� Y and g: Y ��� Z are composable morphisms, then there 
is a commutative diagram: XY 
Z 
h 
gh 
g 
And if f : Z ��� W is a third morphism, then the property, ���composition is associative,������ 
that is, f(gh) = (fg)h���is equivalent to the statement that the following diagram com- 
mutes: XYZW 
gh 
h g fg 
f 
Simply put, a diagram is a visualization of morphism composition. A commutative dia- 
gram is a visualization of equalities between compositions. We���ll see many more examples 
1Some authors denote the set of morphisms from X to Y by homC(X,Y) or simply hom(X,Y) if the categoryCis 
understood. Since keeping track of subscripts can be a chore, we���ll usually promote the subscript to the forefront 
and writeC(X,Y). While this notation may take some getting used to, we encourage the reader to do so. Authors 
also differ in their def i nitions of ���category.��� We require a category to have only a set���s worth of morphisms 
between any two objects���a property known as being locally small. Others sometimes allow categories to have 
more arrows.

in the pages to come. And speaking of examples, we already mentioned that topological 
spaces with continuous functions form a category. Here is another. 
Example 0.3 For any given i eld k, there is a category denotedVectkwhose objects 
V,W,... are vector spaces over k and whose morphisms are linear transformations. To 
verify the claim, suppose T : V ��� W and S : W ��� U are linear transformations. Then for 
any v,v0��� V and any k ��� k, 
ST(kv + v0) = S(kTv + Tv0) = kSTv + STv0 
and so ST : V ��� U is indeed a linear transformation. Associativity of composition is 
automaticsincelineartransformationsarefunctionsandcompositionoffunctionsisalways 
associative. And for any vector space, the identity function is a linear transformation. More 
generally, modules over a i xed ring R together with R-module homomorphisms form a 
category, RMod. 
Here are a few more examples. This time we���ll leave the verif i cations as an exercise. 
���Set: The objects are sets, the morphisms are functions, and composition is composi- 
tion of functions. 
���Set���: The objects are sets S having a distinguished element. (Such sets are called 
pointed sets.) A morphism f : S ��� T is a function satisfying fs0= t0whenever s0 
is the distinguished element of S and t0is the distinguished element of T. (Such func- 
tions are said to ���respect��� the distinguished elements.) Composition is composition of 
functions. 
���Top: The objects are topological spaces, the morphisms are continuous functions, and 
composition is composition of functions. 
���Top���: The objects are topological spaces with a distinguished point, often called a 
basepoint. (Such spaces are called pointed or based spaces.) The morphisms are 
continuous functions that map basepoint to basepoint, and composition is composition 
of functions. 
���hTop: The objects are topological spaces, the morphisms are homotopy classes of 
continuous functions, and composition is composition of these homotopy classes. The 
notion of homotopy will be introduced in section 1.6. 
���Grp: The objects are groups, the morphisms are group homomorphisms, and compo- 
sition is composition of homomorphisms. 
���Every group G can be viewed as a category with one object ��� and with a morphism 
g: ��� ��� ��� for each group element g. The composition of two morphisms f,g corre- 
sponds to the group element gf. 
6Chapter 0 
���A directed multigraph determines a category whose objects are the vertices and whose 
morphisms are the directed paths along i nitely many arrows joined head-to-tail.2For 
example, the directed graph ��������������� 
determinesacategorythatwillmakeanappearanceinexample4.1. Forsimplegraphs, 
one might want to display more information by drawing identities and composite mor- 
phisms. To avoid confusion, one can state whether identities and composites are dis- 
played. Here, of course, they are not drawn. This example also illustrates another 
notational convenience: we���ll frequently use symbols such as ��� and ��� as anonymous 
placeholders. So unless otherwise indicated, each ��������� should be considered a distinct 
object. 
���For any categoryC, there is an opposite categoryCop. The objects are the same as 
the objects ofC, but the morphisms are reversed. Composition inCopis def i ned by 
composition inC, that is,Cop(X,Y) =C(Y,X). To check that composition makes 
sense, suppose f ���Cop(X,Y) and g ���Cop(Y,Z) so that f : Y ��� X and g: Z ��� Y. 
Then fg: Z ��� X and therefore fg ���Cop(X,Z) 
as needed.

Category theory is an appropriate setting in which to discuss an age-old question: ���When 
are two objects really the same?��� The concept of ���sameness��� being a special kind of re- 
lationship means that objects are the same if there is a particular morphism���an isomor- 
phism���between them. How we talk about sameness is at the heart of category theory. We 
take Wittgenstein���s (1922) critique, 
Roughly speaking, to say of two things that they are identical is nonsense, and to say of 
one thing that it is identical with itself is to say nothing at all 
as an invitation to ask for less, namely isomorphic (or uniquely isomorphic) objects, rather 
than identical objects.

In this section, the formal definition of a category (Definition 0.4) is presented along with several examples of categories:
Definition 0.4 - Categories:
A category C consists of:
A class of objects.
For every pair of objects X and Y, a set C(X, Y) whose elements are called morphisms and denoted by arrows (e.g., f: X ��� Y).
A composition rule defined for morphisms: If f: X ��� Y and g: Y ��� Z, then there is a morphism gf: X ��� Z.
These data must satisfy two conditions:
Composition is associative: If h: X ��� Y, g: Y ��� Z, and f: Z ��� W, then f(gh) = (fg)h.
There exist identity morphisms: For every object X, there exists a morphism idX: X ��� X, such that f idX = f = idYf whenever f is a morphism from X to Y.
The section emphasizes that these conditions can also be expressed using commutative diagrams, which visually represent equalities between compositions.
Examples of Categories:
Vectk: Objects are vector spaces over a field k, and morphisms are linear transformations.
Set: Objects are sets, and morphisms are functions between sets.
Top: Objects are topological spaces, and morphisms are continuous functions.
Grp: Objects are groups, and morphisms are group homomorphisms.
hTop: Objects are topological spaces, and morphisms are homotopy classes of continuous functions.
Directed Multigraph: Objects are vertices, and morphisms are directed paths along infinitely many arrows joined head-to-tail.
The concept of "sameness" or isomorphism between objects is discussed, emphasizing that in category theory, objects are considered the same if there exists a particular morphism (an isomorphism) between them. This approach to understanding sameness is central to category theory.

Def i nition 0.5 Let X and Y be objects in any category, and suppose f : X ��� Y. 
(i)f is left invertible if and only if there exists a morphism g: Y ��� X so that gf = idX. 
The morphism g is called a left inverse of f. 
(ii)f isrightinvertibleifandonlyifthereexistsamorphismh: Y ��� X sothat fh = idY. 
The morphism h is called a right inverse of f. 
In the case when f has both a left inverse g and a right inverse h, then 
g = gidY= gfh = idXh = h 
and the single morphism g = h is called the inverse of f. (We encourage you to verify our 
use of ���the.��� If f has an inverse, it is unique.) Therefore 
2Including���for each object���a unique path of length zero starting and ending at that object. 
Preliminaries7 
(iii)f is invertible and is said to be an isomorphism if it is both left and right invertible. 
Two objects X and Y are isomorphic, denoted X ? Y, if there exists an isomorphism 
f : X ��� Y. 
The notion of being isomorphic is a form of equivalence, meaning it is ref l exive, sym- 
metric, and transitive���properties you should check. Isomorphic objects, therefore, form 
equivalence classes. Some categories have their own special terminology for both isomor- 
phism and these isomorphism classes. For instance, 
���Isomorphisms inSetare called bijections, and two isomorphic sets are said to have 
the same cardinality. A cardinal is an isomorphism class of sets. 
���Isomorphisms inTopare called homeomorphisms, and two isomorphic spaces are said 
to be homeomorphic. 
���Isomorphisms in hTopare called homotopy equivalences, and isomorphic spaces in 
hTopare said to be homotopic. (See section 1.6 for a discussion of homotopy.) 
Mathematics is particularly concerned with properties that are preserved under isomor- 
phisms in a given category. For instance, topology is essentially the study of properties 
that are preserved under homeomorphisms. Such properties are referred to as topological 
properties and distinguish spaces: if X and Y are homeomorphic and X has (or doesn���t 
have) a certain property, then Y must have (or cannot have) that property, too. 
Example 0.4 The cardinality of a topological space is a topological property since any 
homeomorphism f : X ��� Y is necessarily a bijective function, and so X and Y, when 
viewed as sets, must have the same cardinality. Metrizability is also a topological prop- 
erty. Connectedness (section 2.1), compactness (section 2.3), Hausdorff (section 2.2), i rst 
countability (section 3.2),... are examples of other topological properties that will be dis- 
cussed in the indicated sections. 
However, not every familiar property is a topological one. 
Example 0.5 A metric space is called complete if every Cauchy sequence converges. Be- 
ing a complete metric space is not a topological property. For instance, the map (���1,1) ��� 
R by x 7��� 
x 
(1���x2) is a homeomorphism, yet R is a complete metric space while (���1,1) is not. 
This example also shows that being bounded is also not a topological property: a metric 
space is said to be bounded if the metric is a bounded function. Clearly, (���1,1) is bounded 
while R is not. 
Comparing an object X with another object can help us to understand X better. Taking this 
idea further, we may also compare X with all objects at once. In other words, we can learn 
a great deal of information about X by looking at all morphisms both out of and in to X. 
This is the content of the next theorem. In essence, it states that the isomorphism class of 
an object is completely determined by morphisms to and from it. This is one of the main 
maxims of category theory:

Definition 0.5 introduces the concept of invertible morphisms (isomorphisms) in a category, along with the concept of objects being isomorphic. Here are the key points:
Left Invertible:
A morphism f: X ��� Y is left invertible if there exists a morphism g: Y ��� X such that gf = idX. g is called a left inverse of f.
Right Invertible:
A morphism f: X ��� Y is right invertible if there exists a morphism h: Y ��� X such that fh = idY. h is called a right inverse of f.
Invertible (Isomorphism):
If a morphism f has both a left inverse g and a right inverse h, then g = h, and f is called invertible (an isomorphism). In this case, g = h is called the inverse of f, and it's unique.
Isomorphism:
A morphism f is considered an isomorphism if it is both left and right invertible. Two objects X and Y in a category are considered isomorphic (denoted as X ? Y) if there exists an isomorphism f: X ��� Y between them.
Isomorphisms form equivalence classes, and categories may have special terminology for isomorphisms and isomorphism classes. For example, in Set, isomorphisms are called bijections, and in Top, they are called homeomorphisms.
The concept of isomorphism is essential for understanding properties preserved under isomorphisms in a given category. For example, topological properties, such as connectedness, compactness, and Hausdorffness, are preserved under homeomorphisms.
However, not all familiar properties are topological properties. For instance, completeness and boundedness in metric spaces are not preserved under homeomorphisms.
The section emphasizes that an object's isomorphism class is determined by morphisms to and from it, a fundamental principle in category theory.

an object is completely determined by its relationships with other objects. 
In fact, it���s a corollary of a major result to be discussed in section 0.2.3. But before we 
state the theorem formally, here is some useful terminology. 
Def i nition 0.6 For each morphism f : X ��� Y and object Z in a category, there is a map 
of sets f���:C(Z,X) ���C(Z,Y) called the pushforward of f def i ned by postcomposition 
f���: g 7��� fg. C(Z,X)C(Z,Y) 
XY 
Z 
f��� 
f 
g f���(g):=fg 
There is also a map of sets f���:C(Y,Z) ���C(X,Z) called the pullback def i ned by precom- 
position f���: g 7��� gf. C(X,Z)C(Y,Z) 
XY 
Z 
f��� 
f 
f���(g):=gf 
g 
The reason for the visual names pushforward and pullback is hopefully clear from the 
diagrams above. With this terminology in hand, here is the theorem whose summary we 
provided above. 
Theorem 0.1 The following are equivalent. 
���f : X ��� Y is an isomorphism. 
���For every object Z, the pushforward f���:C(Z,X) ���C(Z,Y) 
is an isomorphism of sets. 
���For every object Z, the pullback f���:C(Y,Z) ���C(X,Z) 
is an isomorphism of sets. 
Proof. We���ll prove that a morphism f : X ��� Y is an isomorphism if and only if for every 
object Z, the pushforward f���:C(Z,X) ���C(Z,Y) 
is an isomorphism of sets; then, we���ll 
leave the other statements as exercises. 
Suppose f : X ��� Y is an isomorphism. Let g: Y ��� X be the inverse of f. Then for any 
Z, the map g���:C(Z,Y) ���C(Z,X) is the inverse of f���. 
Conversely, suppose that for any Z, the map f���:C(Z,X) ���C(Z,Y) is an isomorphism 
of sets. Choosing Z = Y, we have f���:C(Y,X) 
? ��� ���C(Y,Y), 
so in particular f���is surjective. 
Therefore there exists a morphism g: Y ��� X so that f���g 
= idY, which by def i nition implies 
fg = idY. To see that gf = idX, consider the case Z = X. We know f���:C(X,X) 
? ��� ���C(X,Y),

so in particular f���is injective. And since f���(idX) = f and f���(gf) = fgf = f, injectivity of 
f���implies idX= gf as needed. 
In summary, if you understand all the morphisms X ��� Z, then you know X up to iso- 
morphism. Or if you understand all the morphisms Z ��� X, then you know X up to 
isomorphism. 
Now it turns out that categories themselves are objects worthy of study. And as per our 
maxim above, studying a category should amount to studying its relationships to other 
categories. But what is a relationship between categories? It is called a functor. That is the 
subject of the next section. 
You might wonder if we are about to construct a category of categories where the objects 
are categories and the morphisms are functors. This can be done, but there are a few impor- 
tant considerations. One consideration is size. When we def i ned categories, we assumed 
that for any two objects X and Y, there is a set of morphismsC(X,Y). This is convenient 
so that, as in the case of the pushforward f���:C(Z,X) ���C(Z,Y) of a morphism f : X ��� Y 
in the previous theorem, we can consider functions between sets of morphisms. However, 
ifCandDare categories, then there may be more than a set���s worth of functorsC���D. 
There���s also another, more subtle consideration to think about: The sharpest identif i cation 
of an object generally available when doing category is up to unique isomorphism. This 
should apply to the morphisms between categories as well. It can be dizzying, but the 
takeaway is that invertible functors provide a notion of equivalence that���s too rigid to be 
useful. So instead of an ���isomorphism of categories,��� we talk about an ���equivalence of 
categories,��� which is def i ned in a more subtle way. A third consideration is that one might 
want to remember that categories themselves have objects and morphisms, and the cate- 
gory of categories has more structure than a category���it���s probably better to think of it as 
a ���higher��� category, a concept we won���t stop to discuss here.

This section introduces some important concepts and a fundamental theorem in category theory:
Definitions
:
Pushforward
: Given a morphism f: X ��� Y and an object Z in a category, there is a map of sets f���: C(Z,X) ��� C(Z,Y) called the pushforward, defined by postcomposition: f���(g) = fg.
Pullback
: Similarly, there is a map of sets f���: C(Y,Z) ��� C(X,Z) called the pullback, defined by precomposition: f���(g) = gf.
Theorem 0.1 (Equivalence of Categories)
: The following statements are equivalent:
f: X ��� Y is an isomorphism.
For every object Z, the pushforward f���: C(Z,X) ��� C(Z,Y) is an isomorphism of sets.
For every object Z, the pullback f���: C(Y,Z) ��� C(X,Z) is an isomorphism of sets.
Proof
: The theorem establishes that a morphism f: X ��� Y is an isomorphism if and only if its pushforward f��� is an isomorphism of sets for all objects Z. The proof shows that if f is an isomorphism, it implies the isomorphism of pushforwards, and vice versa.
This theorem essentially states that understanding all the morphisms from or to an object X allows you to know X up to isomorphism. In other words, you can uniquely identify an object within a category based on its relationships with other objects.
The section also introduces the concept of functors, which are relationships between categories. Functors play a crucial role in category theory and are used to study how categories relate to each other. It's noted that while it's possible to construct a category of categories, some considerations such as size and the notion of equivalence of categories make it a more complex endeavor.
In summary, this section lays the foundation for understanding how objects in a category are determined by their relationships with other objects, introduces important terminology, and highlights the significance of functors in category theory.

0.2.2Functors 
Def i nition 0.7 A functor F from a categoryCto a categoryDconsists of the following 
data: 
(i)An object FX of the categoryDfor each object X in the categoryC, 
(ii)A morphism F f : FX ��� FY for every morphism f : X ��� Y. 
These data must be compatible with composition and identity morphisms in the following 
sense: 
(iii)(Fg)(F f) = F(gf) for any morphisms f : X ��� Y and g: Y ��� Z, 
(iv)F idX= idFXfor any object X. 
A functor as def i ned above is sometimes described as a covariant functor to distinguish it 
from its contravariant counterpart. A functor F:Cop���Dwhose 
domain is the opposite

a

functor simply as a functor. This usually doesn���t cause confusion since the direction of the 
arrows can often be worked out easily. 
Example 0.6 Here are some examples of functors. 
���For an object X in a categoryC, there is a functorC(X,���) fromCtoSetthat

That is, there is a ���Grothendieck group��� functor from the category of commutative monoids to the category of commutative groups that constructs a group from a com- 
mutative monoid by attaching inverses. 
Here are a few different kinds of functors. 
Def i nition 0.8 Let F be a functor from a categoryCto a categoryD. If for all objects X 
and Y inC, the map C(X,Y) ���D(FX,FY)given byf 7��� F f 
(i)is injective, then F is called faithful; 
(ii)is surjective, then F is called full; 
(iii)is bijective, then F is called fully faithful. 
Fully faithful functors preserve all relationships among objects of the domain category: 
F is fully faithful if and only if each FX ��� FY is the image of exactly one morphism 
X ��� Y. Think of it as an embedding, so to speak, of one category into another. But note, 
a fully faithful functor need not be injective on objects, so we use the term ���embedding��� 
loosely here. A fully faithful functor that is injective on objects is called a full embedding. 
We���ll def i ne one of category theory���s most famous fully faithful functors in the following 
section, but i rst we emphasize an important utility of functors. A functor F:C���D 
encodes invariants of isomorphism classes of objects withinC. This is a fundamental 
idea, arising from the fact that functors take compositions to compositions and identities 
to identities. Consequentially, 
functors take isomorphisms to isomorphisms. 
So if two objects X and Y are ���the same��� inC, then FX and FY must be ���the same��� inD, 
the contrapositive being just as useful. For instance, the value that any functorTop���C 
assigns to a topological space is automatically a topological property (or we might say a 
topological invariant). So the question arises, ���What is a useful choice of categoryC?��� If

A homology theory, for example, is a functor H:Top��� RModand is an excellent means

This section introduces the concept of functors in category theory:
Definition 0.7 - Functor
: A functor F from a category C to a category D consists of the following data:
For each object X in C, an object FX in D.
For every morphism f: X ��� Y in C, a morphism Ff: FX ��� FY in D.
These data must satisfy the following conditions:
3. (Fg)(Ff) = F(gf) for any morphisms f: X ��� Y and g: Y ��� Z in C.
F(idX) = idFX for any object X in C.
Functors are used to establish relationships between categories, where objects and morphisms are mapped to corresponding objects and morphisms in another category. Functors can be categorized as covariant (usual) or contravariant (opposite category). Contravariant functors reverse the direction of arrows.
Example 0.6
: Several examples of functors are given, including:
Functors related to sets and categories.
Functors between vector spaces.
Forgetful functors that forget certain structure.
The fundamental group functor from topological spaces to groups.
Definition 0.8 - Faithful, Full, and Fully Faithful Functors
:
A functor F: C ��� D is called
faithful
if the map from morphisms in C to morphisms in D is injective.
It is
full
if the map is surjective.
It is
fully faithful
if the map is bijective.
Fully faithful functors preserve relationships between objects and morphisms within the domain category C. They take isomorphisms to isomorphisms, making them useful for distinguishing objects based on their invariants.
Functors are valuable for encoding invariants of isomorphism classes of objects within a category. They provide a way to compare objects in different categories based on their relationships and structure. For example, functors can be used to define topological invariants, distinguishing topological spaces based on their properties.
The section concludes by emphasizing the utility of functors in comparing invariants and the importance of choosing appropriate categories for specific applications, such as algebraic topology and homology theory.

0.2.3Natural Transformations and the Yoneda Lemma 
Def i nition 0.9 Let F and G be functorsC���D. 
A natural transformation �� from F to G 
consists of a morphism ��X: FX ��� GX for each object X inC. 
Moreover, these morphisms 
inDmust satisfy the property that ��YF f = Gf��Xfor every morphism f : X ��� Y inC. 
In 
12Chapter 0 
other words, the following diagram must commute: 
FXFY 
GXGY 
F f 
��X��Y 
Gf 
For any two functors F,G:C���D, letNat(F,G) denote the natural transformations from 
F to G. If ��X: FX 
? 
��� ��� GX is an isomorphism for each X, then �� is called a natural 
isomorphism or a natural equivalence, and we say F and G are naturally isomorphic, 
denoted F ? G. 
Keep in mind that a natural transformation �� is the totality of all the morphisms ��X, and 
each ��Xcan be thought of as a component, so to speak, of ��. Simply put, a natural trans- 
formation is a collection of maps from one diagram to another, and these maps are special 
in that they commute with all the arrows in the diagrams.3 
The language of natural transformations not only provides us an avenue in which com- 
paring invariants (functors) becomes possible, but it also prompts us to revisit an idea 
mentioned in section 0.2.1. There we introduced the categorical philosophy that studying 
a mathematical object is more of a global, as opposed to a local, endeavor. That is, we can 
paint a better���rather, a complete���picture of an object once we investigate its interactions 
with all other objects. This theme i nds its origins in an���if not the most���important result 
in category theory. 
Yoneda LemmaFor every object X inCand for every functor F:Cop���Set, 
the set of 
natural transformations fromC(���,X) to F is isomorphic to FX, 
Nat(C(���,X),F) ? FX 
In other words, elements of the set FX are in bijection with natural transformations from 
C(���,X) to F. We omit the proof but take note of the special case when F =C(���,Y): 
Nat(C(���,X),C(���,Y)) ?C(X,Y)(0.1) 
It���s closely related to theorem 0.1 in the following way. 
First observe that given two categoriesCandD, we can form a new categoryDCwhose 
objects are functorsC���Dand whose morphisms are natural transformations. To ensure 
thatDCis locally small, we may requireCto be small andDto be locally small. When 
considering contravariant functors and taking D =Set, we obtain the categorySetC op. An 
object here is called a presheaf. This is a very nice category���it has all i nite limits and 
3So a natural transformation may be viewed simultaneously as a single arrow between two functors or as a 
collection of arrows between two diagrams. Therefore you might hope that diagrams can be viewed as functors. 
As we will see in section 4.1, this is indeed the case.

colimits (to be discussed in chapter 4), it is Cartesian closed, and it forms what���s called 
a topos. We won���t dwell on these properties, though. Instead we turn our attention to a 
special functor y:C���SetC op. It���s def i ned by sending an object X to the presheaf C(���,X) 
and a morphism f : X ��� Y to the natural transformation f���, 
XC(���,X) 
YC(���,Y) 
ff��� 
This is a slight abuse of notation, though. By f���:C(���,X) ���C(���,Y) we mean the natural 
transformation whose component morphisms are the pushforward of f. 
The isomorphism in (0.1) shows that the functor y is fully faithful and therefore embeds 
Cinto the functor categorySetC op. For this reason, y is called the Yoneda embedding. The 
punchline is that each object X inCcan be viewed as the contravariant functorC(���,X). 
Practically speaking, this means information about X can be obtained by studying the set 
of all morphisms in to it. But what about morphisms out of it? 
There is a version of the Yoneda lemma for covariant functors (called co-presheaves) in 
the categorySetCand, accordingly, a contravariant Yoneda embeddingCop���SetC. The 
corresponding result is that X can also be viewed as a functorC(X,���). So the moral of the 
story is that if you understand maps in and out of X, then you understand X. Thus we���ve 
come full circle to the theme introduced in section 0.2.1: 
objects are completely determined by their relationships with other objects. 
The adjective ���completely��� is justif i ed by the following important corollary of the Yoneda 
lemma: X ? Yif and only ifC(���,X) ?C(���,Y). 
One direction follows from the fact that the Yoneda embedding is a functor. The other 
direction follows from the fact that it is fully faithful. It���s also true that X ? Y if and only if 
C(X,���) ?C(Y,���), as can be verif i ed by considering the contravariant Yoneda embedding. 
And with that, we���ve just provided a restatement of theorem 0.1. 
As a i nal remark, at times we���ll adapt this philosophy and use it to consider just a 
few (and not necessarily all) morphisms to or from an object���this also yields fruitful 
information.

This section introduces the concept of natural transformations and the Yoneda Lemma in category theory:
Definition 0.9 - Natural Transformation
: A natural transformation �� from a functor F to a functor G consists of a morphism ��X: FX ��� GX for each object X in the category C. These morphisms must satisfy the condition that ��YFf = Gf��X for every morphism f: X ��� Y in C.
In simple terms, a natural transformation consists of a collection of morphisms that commute with all the morphisms in the category C. It establishes a relationship between two functors F and G.
Natural Isomorphism
: If ��X: FX ��� GX is an isomorphism for each object X, then �� is called a natural isomorphism or a natural equivalence, and we denote it as F ? G. This implies that F and G are naturally isomorphic.
The Yoneda Lemma is a fundamental result in category theory that relates objects in a category C to natural transformations involving presheaves.
The Yoneda Lemma states that for every object X in C and every functor F: Cop ��� Set (contravariant functor), the set of natural transformations from the functor C(���, X) to F is isomorphic to the set FX. In other words, elements of the set FX are in bijection with natural transformations from C(���, X) to F.
This lemma has important consequences, one of which is that objects in a category are determined by their relationships with other objects. It provides a deep understanding of how objects can be studied through their interactions with other objects and morphisms within the category.
Furthermore, there is a version of the Yoneda Lemma for covariant functors (co-presheaves) in the category SetC. This implies that an object X can also be viewed as a functor C(X, ���), showing that information about X can be obtained by studying maps both into and out of it.
The Yoneda embedding, represented by the functor y, fully embeds the category C into the functor category SetCop. This embedding allows us to view each object X in C as the contravariant functor C(���, X) and is a powerful tool in category theory.
In summary, the Yoneda Lemma and its implications emphasize that objects in a category can be understood by examining their relationships with other objects, and this idea is central to category theory.

Some analogies and everyday examples to help explain it.

ChatGPT
Certainly! Let's use some analogies and everyday examples to help explain the concepts related to natural transformations and the Yoneda Lemma in category theory:
Natural Transformations
:
Traffic Flow
: Imagine two cities, City A and City B. Each city has its own traffic system (functor). A natural transformation between the two traffic systems could be like having synchronized traffic lights at intersections, ensuring that traffic flows smoothly from City A to City B. This synchronization (natural transformation) ensures compatibility between the two systems, just like how natural transformations ensure compatibility between functors in category theory.
Translation Services
: Think of two people speaking different languages. A natural translator (natural transformation) can help bridge the communication gap by converting one person's speech (functor) into the other person's language (functor), ensuring a smooth exchange of information.
Yoneda Lemma
:
Library Catalog
: Consider a library with many books (objects) and various categories (genres) of books. The Yoneda Lemma is like a magical catalog that helps you understand each book (object) by listing its relationships with other books (objects) and how they connect (natural transformations). By studying this catalog, you can gain a comprehensive understanding of the library's contents without reading every book individually.
Social Networks
: Think of social media platforms where users (objects) interact with each other by following and connecting. The Yoneda Lemma is akin to a tool that analyzes these connections (natural transformations) between users. By understanding how users relate to one another, you can infer their interests and preferences, even if you don't know them personally.
Natural Isomorphism
:
Jigsaw Puzzle Pieces
: Imagine two jigsaw puzzle pieces (functors) that fit together perfectly. When you connect them, they form a complete picture (natural isomorphism). In category theory, if two functors are naturally isomorphic, it means they fit together seamlessly, providing equivalent information or structures.
Interchangeable Parts
: Think of different brands of electronic devices (functors) that have components (morphisms) with the same connectors (natural isomorphism). If you can swap these components without any issues, it's like having a natural isomorphism between the devices, indicating their compatibility.
These analogies and examples aim to simplify the abstract concepts of natural transformations and the Yoneda Lemma by relating them to familiar scenarios from everyday life. They highlight the idea that these concepts help establish compatibility, equivalence, and understanding between different entities within a category.
You
The concepts of Natural Transformations and the Yoneda Lemma in category theory can be quite abstract. To help understand them better, let's use some analogies and everyday examples:

### Natural Transformations

1. **Recipe Adaptation**:
   - Imagine two cookbooks (functors), each representing a style of cuisine (category) - say, Italian and Mexican. Each recipe (object) in the Italian cookbook has a counterpart in the Mexican cookbook, adapted to Mexican flavors. A natural transformation is like a guide (morphisms \( \eta_X \)) that tells you how to adapt each Italian recipe to a Mexican version. The requirement that this adaptation respects the 'structure' of recipes (commutative diagram) ensures that if you follow a recipe modification (like changing an ingredient), it should work similarly in both cuisines.

2. **Language Translation**:
   - Consider two dictionaries (functors), one for English-to-Spanish and another for English-to-French. A natural transformation is like a rule (morphisms \( \eta_X \)) that systematically translates an English word to Spanish and then ensures the same meaning is preserved when translated from Spanish to French. The commutative diagram ensures that directly translating from English to French gives the same result as going through Spanish.

### Yoneda Lemma

1. **Social Network Profiles**:
   - Imagine every person (object) has a profile on multiple social networks (functors), like Facebook, LinkedIn, etc. The Yoneda Lemma suggests that you can understand a person (object \( X \)) completely by looking at all their interactions (natural transformations) across these networks. The person's identity is reflected not just in their profile but in how they connect and interact with others across platforms.

2. **Library System**:
   - Think of a library system (category) where each book (object) can be found in various libraries (functors). According to the Yoneda Lemma, you can understand everything about a book (object \( X \)) by examining its presence and usage across all libraries. This includes checking which libraries have it, how often it���s borrowed, and what kind of readers are interested in it. The book is defined not just by its content but by its relevance and circulation in the broader library system.

These analogies help to translate the abstract concepts of natural transformations and the Yoneda Lemma into more relatable terms. The key takeaway is that in category theory, the essence of an object is captured by its relationships and interactions within the system, rather than just by its standalone properties.
ChatGPT
ChatGPT
Definitely! Natural transformations and the Yoneda Lemma can be challenging to grasp, but analogies and everyday examples can make them more accessible:
Natural Transformations
Musical Instruments
:
Imagine you have two musical instruments, a guitar (functor A) and a piano (functor B). Each instrument produces its unique sound (objects X, Y). Now, a natural transformation between the two instruments is like a musician who can smoothly switch from playing the guitar to playing the piano. This musician (the natural transformation) ensures that the transition from one instrument to another is seamless, even if the notes (morphisms) are different.
Multilingual Tour Guide
:
Suppose you're in a foreign city (category C) with multiple attractions (objects X, Y). You hire a multilingual tour guide (natural transformation) who can explain each attraction in various languages (functors A and B). The guide ensures that the description of each attraction remains consistent regardless of the language used, making your tour enjoyable and informative.
Yoneda Lemma
Virtual Reality (VR) Gaming
:
Think of a virtual reality game (category C) where you have different in-game characters (objects X, Y). The Yoneda Lemma is like the VR system itself, which immerses you in the game world and allows you to experience each character's perspective fully. You can understand the game world and its characters by stepping into their shoes and seeing the world from their point of view, thanks to the immersive VR technology.
Data Visualization Tool
:
Consider a sophisticated data visualization tool (functor A) that takes raw data (object X) and transforms it into insightful charts and graphs (object Y). The Yoneda Lemma is akin to the ability of this tool to display the data in multiple ways, allowing you to explore and understand the underlying patterns and insights fully. It's like viewing the same data from various angles to gain a comprehensive understanding.
These analogies aim to illustrate the concepts of natural transformations and the Yoneda Lemma in a more relatable manner. In both cases, the key idea is that they provide a way to seamlessly switch between different perspectives or representations while maintaining consistency and understanding within a category or system.
You
These analogies provide a great way to understand complex concepts in category theory. Let's expand on them with a few more examples:

### Natural Transformations:
1. **Music Remixing**:
   - Imagine two music genres (functors), like classical and electronic. A natural transformation could be seen as a process (set of rules or morphisms) that consistently transforms classical music pieces into electronic remixes. This transformation respects the structure of the original compositions while adapting them to a new style, analogous to how natural transformations respect functorial composition.

2. **Phone Apps Syncing**:
   - Consider two different apps on a smartphone, one for notes and another for reminders (functors). A natural transformation is like a syncing feature that ensures changes made in the notes app reflect appropriately in the reminders app. This seamless integration across apps aligns with how natural transformations maintain compatibility between functors.

### Yoneda Lemma:
1. **Restaurant Reviews**:
   - Think of a restaurant (object) reviewed on multiple platforms like Yelp, TripAdvisor, and Google Reviews (functors). The Yoneda Lemma implies that you can understand the essence of the restaurant (object) by aggregating and analyzing its reviews (natural transformations) across all these platforms. This comprehensive view is analogous to understanding an object by its relationships in all functors.

2. **Product Comparison Shopping**:
   - Imagine comparing a product (object) across various online shopping platforms (functors). The Yoneda Lemma suggests that the true nature of the product can be understood by observing how it's presented and perceived (natural transformations) across all these platforms, giving a complete picture beyond just looking at the product on a single website.

These examples help to conceptualize the principles of natural transformations and the Yoneda Lemma in more tangible terms, illustrating the fundamental idea in category theory that the identity and properties of objects are largely determined by their relationships and interactions within a system.

ChatGPT
Absolutely, these additional examples provide even more intuitive insights into the concepts of natural transformations and the Yoneda Lemma in category theory. They emphasize the idea that these concepts revolve around maintaining consistency and understanding while transitioning between different categories, functors, or perspectives.

ChatGPT
ChatGPT
Certainly! Let's create the concept of "anachronic anastomosis" or "anachronic crossover transfer" and then have two different models with varying abilities brainstorm about it.
Concept Introduction: Anachronic Anastomosis
Definition
: Anachronic Anastomosis refers to the hypothetical process of transferring information, experiences, or knowledge across different time periods or historical eras. It involves connecting elements from the past with elements from the future, allowing for a unique exchange of insights and perspectives.
Key Aspects
:
Temporal Connection
: Anachronic Anastomosis establishes a bridge between different points in time, enabling communication or exchange that transcends chronological boundaries.
Knowledge Fusion
: It involves merging knowledge, ideas, or cultural elements from different time periods to create novel insights or artifacts.
Temporal Paradox
: The concept blurs the line between past and future, challenging conventional notions of causality and historical progression.
Cross-Generational Insights
: Anachronic Anastomosis can lead to a deeper understanding of historical events, technology, or culture by allowing individuals from different eras to share their perspectives.
Now, let's have two different models, Model A and Model B, brainstorm about this concept:
Model A (Advanced Model):
Model A, with advanced reasoning capabilities, analyzes the concept deeply.
Model A suggests that Anachronic Anastomosis could be likened to a "time-traveling knowledge exchange." It imagines individuals from different historical periods, such as Leonardo da Vinci and a contemporary scientist, engaging in a conversation.
Model A explores potential applications, such as historians gaining first-hand insights into past events or future generations learning from the wisdom of their ancestors.
Model A wonders about the ethical implications, considering how altering historical knowledge might affect the present and future.
Model B (Intermediate Model):
Model B, with intermediate reasoning capabilities, grasps the concept but at a simpler level.
Model B sees Anachronic Anastomosis as "mixing old and new stuff to make cool things." It envisions creating hybrid music genres by blending classical and electronic music or inventing futuristic gadgets inspired by ancient designs.
Model B suggests that this concept could make history more fun and relatable for students, allowing them to experience historical moments through virtual reality or interactive simulations.
Model B finds it exciting to think about what fashion trends might emerge when people combine clothing styles from different time periods.
Now, let's have them exchange their insights in an analogy brainstorming session:
Analogy Brainstorming Session:
Model A to Model B
: "Think of Anachronic Anastomosis as a 'time-traveling recipe book.' It's like taking traditional recipes from different centuries and merging them to create unique, modern dishes. What do you think might be the outcome?"
Model B's Response
: "Oh, that sounds fun! It's like mixing grandma's old recipes with new cooking techniques. We could end up with some amazing fusion dishes that blend the best of both worlds!"
Model B to Model A
: "Anachronic Anastomosis could be like 'retro-futuristic fashion.' Imagine combining classic clothing styles from the past with futuristic materials and designs. How would that impact fashion trends?"
