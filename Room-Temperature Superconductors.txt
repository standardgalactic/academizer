Abstract 
For the first time in the world, we succeeded in synthesizing the room-temperature superconductor 
(Tc ��� 400 K, 127 oC) working at ambient pressure with a modified lead-apatite (LK-99) structure. 
The superconductivity of LK-99 is proved with the Critical temperature (Tc), Zero-resistivity, 
Critical current (Ic), Critical magnetic field (Hc), and the Meissner effect. The superconductivity 
of LK-99 originates from minute structural distortion by a slight volume shrinkage (0.48 %), not 
by external factors such as temperature and pressure. The shrinkage is caused by Cu2+ substitution 
of Pb2+(2) ions in the insulating network of Pb(2)-phosphate and it generates the stress. It 
concurrently transfers to Pb(1) of the cylindrical column resulting in distortion of the cylindrical 
column interface, which creates superconducting quantum wells (SQWs) in the interface. The heat 
capacity results indicated that the new model is suitable for explaining the superconductivity of 
LK-99. The unique structure of LK-99 that allows the minute distorted structure to be maintained 
in the interfaces is the most important factor that LK-99 maintains and exhibits superconductivity 
at room temperatures and ambient pressure.

Introduction 
Since the discovery of the first superconductor(1), many efforts to search for new room- 
temperature superconductors have been carried out worldwide(2, 3) through their experimental 
clarity or/and theoretical perspectives(4-8). The recent success of developing room-temperature 
superconductors with hydrogen sulfide(9) and yttrium super-hydride(10) has great attention 
worldwide, which is expected by strong electron-phonon coupling theory with high-frequency 
hydrogen phonon modes(11, 12). However, it is difficult to apply them to actual application 
devices in daily life because of the tremendously high pressure, and more efforts are being made 
to overcome the high-pressure problem(13). 
For the first time in the world, we report the success in synthesizing a room-temperature and 
ambient-pressure superconductor with a chemical approach to solve the temperature and pressure 
problem. We named the first room temperature and ambient pressure superconductor LK-99. The 
superconductivity of LK-99 proved with the Critical temperature (Tc), Zero-resistivity, Critical 
current (Ic), Critical magnetic field (Hc), and Meissner effect(14, 15). Several data were collected 
and analyzed in detail to figure out the puzzle of superconductivity of LK-99: X-ray diffraction 
(XRD), X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS), Electron Paramagnetic Resonance Spectroscopy 
(EPR), Heat Capacity, and Superconducting quantum interference device (SQUID) data. 
Henceforth in this paper, we will report and discuss our new findings including superconducting 
quantum wells associated with the superconductivity of LK-99.

This paper by Sukbae Lee, Ji-Hoon Kim, and Young-Wan Kwon reports the successful synthesis of the world's first room-temperature superconductor that operates at ambient pressure. Named LK-99, it has a critical temperature (Tc) of over 400K (or 127��C).
The superconductivity of LK-99, which has a modified lead-apatite structure, was proven through a range of measurements including critical temperature (Tc), zero-resistivity, critical current (Ic), critical magnetic field (Hc), and the Meissner effect. These properties are the hallmarks of superconductivity.
This material achieves superconductivity not from external factors such as temperature or pressure but from a minute structural distortion caused by the substitution of Cu2+ ions for Pb2+(2) ions in the insulating network of Pb(2)-phosphate. This substitution causes a slight volume shrinkage (0.48%), which generates stress that distorts the interface of the cylindrical column. This distortion creates superconducting quantum wells (SQWs) at the interface.
Heat capacity results indicated that this model effectively explains the superconductivity of LK-99. The unique structure of LK-99, which allows it to maintain these minute distortions, is crucial for its ability to exhibit superconductivity at room temperatures and ambient pressure.
The researchers point out that previous attempts at developing room-temperature superconductors, such as those involving hydrogen sulfide and yttrium super-hydride, were not practical for everyday use due to the high pressures required. The successful development of LK-99 solves this problem, marking a significant advancement in the field of superconductor technology.
superconductors, the large absorption EPR signal appeared at a very low temperature and below 
1000 Oe external magnetic field(53, 54), and we also observed with YBCO and Bi2212. The signal 
below 1000 Oe external magnetic field can be interpreted as a signal by superconducting 
electrons(53, 54). 
Josephson installed a thin insulator between superconductors and discovered tunneling through 
which current flows. Tunneling occurred between the superconductors(55). Likewise, if electrons 
are moved by tunneling between SQWs, the resistance will naturally be zero. Tunneling between 
SQWs is likely to be possible, as SQWs are expected to be formed at 3.7 �� ~ 6.5 �� intervals in 
LK-99. According to Kim���s paper(52), he used 1250 K Debye temperature for his calculation of 
room-temperature superconductor, which is mentioned for hydride in 1968 by Ashcroft(56). Even 
in that case, he argued that the electron-electron interaction contributes to the higher temperature 
superconductivity than the electron-phonon interaction. In LK-99 system, the applied current 
seems to be transported through the correlated SQWs of the cylindrical column via the tunneling 
process and coherently transported in 3-dimension with all SQWs together. The additional 
13 
experimental results and discussions on LK-99 will be published immediately in the next paper, 
including an interesting controllable levitation phenomenon and the coexistence of magnetism and 
superconductivity, theoretical calculation, etc. LK-99 will be an attractive substance for many 
researchers that can solve various confusing puzzles such as the pairing process and coexistence 
with magnetism, etc., related to superconductivity. 
Consequently, why does LK-99 exhibit superconductivity at room temperature and ambient 
pressure? This is because the stress generated by the Cu2+ replacement of Pb(2)2+ ion was not 
relieved due to the structural uniqueness of LK-99 and at the same time was appropriately 
transferred to the interface of the cylindrical column. In other words, the Pb(1) atoms in the 
cylindrical column interface of LK-99 occupy a structurally limited space. These atoms are entirely 
affected by the stress and strain generated by Cu2+ ions. Therefore, SQWs can be generated in the 
interface by an appropriate amount of distortion(57) at room temperature and ambient pressure 
without a relaxation. From this point of view, the stress due to volume contraction by temperature 
and pressure is relieved and disappeared in CuO- and Fe-based superconductor systems because 
the relaxation process cannot be limited due to the structural freedom. Therefore, they need an 
appropriate temperature or pressure to limit the structural freedom and to achieve the SQW 
generation. The LK-99 is a very useful material for the study of superconductivity puzzles at room 
temperature. All evidence and explanation lead that LK-99 is the first room-temperature and 
ambient-pressure superconductor. The LK-99 has many possibilities for various applications such 
as magnet, motor, cable, levitation train, power cable, qubit for a quantum computer, THz 
Antennas, etc. We believe that our new development will be a brand-new historical event that 
opens a new era for humankind.

The researchers discuss how superconducting electrons are responsible for the signal they observed at a very low temperature and below an external magnetic field of 1000 Oe. They draw an analogy with the concept of "tunneling" discovered by Josephson, in which a current can flow through a thin insulator installed between superconductors.
The paper argues that a similar tunneling process might occur in LK-99 between Superconducting Quantum Wells (SQWs) that are expected to form at intervals of 3.7 �� ~ 6.5 ��. The current applied to the LK-99 system seems to be transported through these SQWs via the tunneling process and is coherently transported in three dimensions across all SQWs.
This superconductivity is possible because the stress generated by the substitution of Cu2+ ions for Pb(2)2+ ions is not relieved due to LK-99's unique structure but is appropriately transferred to the interface of a cylindrical column. The Pb(1) atoms in this interface are entirely affected by the stress and strain generated by the Cu2+ ions, leading to the generation of SQWs in the interface by an appropriate amount of distortion at room temperature and ambient pressure without relaxation.
The researchers note that the volume contraction due to temperature and pressure is not relieved in CuO- and Fe-based superconductor systems due to their structural freedom. Therefore, they require specific temperature or pressure to limit the structural freedom and generate SQWs.
The paper concludes by stating that LK-99 is the first room-temperature and ambient-pressure superconductor. It has potential for various applications including magnets, motors, cables, levitation trains, power cables, qubits for quantum computers, THz Antennas, etc. The researchers believe their development will be a groundbreaking event opening a new era for humankind.
Could you give a metaphor or analogy to explain the proposed mechanism?
ChatGPT
Absolutely! Here's a simplified analogy that can help understand the concept. Imagine a crowded hallway in a school, with students (electrons) trying to move from one end to the other. Normally, the students bump into each other and the walls, causing resistance and slowing down their progress. This is similar to how electrons behave in normal conductive materials, where their movement is hampered by resistance, leading to energy loss in the form of heat.
Now, let's introduce a superconductor into the scenario. When the school installs an advanced system of moving walkways (like the ones in airports) that are precisely coordinated to help students glide smoothly along the hallway, students can move quickly and efficiently from one end to the other without bumping into each other or the walls. This results in zero resistance, much like the zero electrical resistance in a superconductor.
The distortion in LK-99's structure, due to the substitution of Cu2+ ions for Pb2+(2) ions, can be compared to installing these moving walkways. It creates 'superconducting quantum wells' or special zones where the electrons can move freely without resistance. The novel thing about LK-99 is that this system works at room temperature and ambient pressure, meaning we don't need to cool down the school (lower the temperature) or squeeze the hallways (apply pressure) to make the walkways work. This is a major breakthrough in superconductor research.
Ok that is indeed significant if it is reproducible and can be done at an affordable cost.
ChatGPT
Yes, you're absolutely right. The creation of a room-temperature, ambient-pressure superconductor like LK-99 could revolutionize many aspects of technology, from energy transmission to computing. However, as you pointed out, the key challenges that lie ahead include reproducibility and affordability.
For this breakthrough to have widespread real-world applications, scientists must be able to consistently reproduce these results across different labs and conditions. Furthermore, the process for making this superconductor needs to be cost-effective on a large scale.
Developing new materials, especially those with highly specialized properties like superconductors, often involves expensive processes and rare ingredients. The challenge is to make these processes more affordable and sustainable so that the benefits of such technologies can be enjoyed widely.
Research in this area is ongoing, and if successful, we could witness a paradigm shift in various industries such as energy, transportation, and computing.
You���ll notice that when electrical objects run, they often emit heat. Take, for example, your phone when you���ve scrolled social media for too long ��� or your laptop trying to open Photoshop. As these objects work, some of their energy escapes as heat. This is considered wasted energy, and is thanks to resistance in the conductor.

The distinction between a conductor and superconductor is that a superconductor transmits electricity without this wasted energy ��� in other words, its material faces no resistance, and will never generate any heat as electricity passes through it.

Until July 2023, the superconductors that scientists had created could only work at extremely low temperatures. A room temperature superconductor has been a long-sought goal for physicists because it could revolutionise our energy industries ��� and, increasingly, because this technology could very well allow us to mitigate the effects of climate change.

What���s The Discovery?
On 22 July 2023, scientists from Korea University, Sukbae Lee, Ji-Hoon Kim and Young-Wan Kwon, published a pre-print paper detailing an exciting discovery: they���ve created the world���s first room temperature superconductor using a material dubbed ���LK-99���.

Why Is This Significant?
If proven through reproduction, the LK-99 room temperature superconductor could have seriously positive repercussions for energy and the development of future technologies.

Revolutionising The Energy Industry
Electricity transmitted over a superconductor would face little to no resistance, so could be transported over long distances very efficiently. This will impact sustainability because there will be less waste, and therefore less additional energy would need to be generated. In turn, this would lead to a decrease in greenhouse gas emissions from power generation.

This technology could also help us better integrate renewable energy into the national energy grid, as one current challenge faced is how far renewable sources are from population centres.

Should We Be Dubious?
While exciting ��� and a hopeful discovery ��� the paper that was submitted is pre-print, which means it has yet to go through peer review. Similar work has faced serious scrutiny, and been disproven at this stage. The work of one University of Rochester researcher, who claimed to discover a similar superconductor in 2021, saw his paper recently retracted upon the discovery of errors and data fabrication.

In addition, if the discovery cannot be repeated or scaled, its practical impact in the immediate will be minimal.

Thank you for sharing this article. The piece does a great job of summarizing the significance of the discovery of LK-99, the first room-temperature superconductor. It outlines the potential implications of this breakthrough for the energy industry and emphasizes the importance of peer review in scientific discovery.
In the realm of energy transmission, a superconductor like LK-99 could significantly boost efficiency by reducing energy lost as heat, thereby potentially reducing greenhouse gas emissions associated with power generation. Moreover, the technology could help address one of the key challenges in the renewable energy sector ��� the distance between renewable energy sources and population centers.
However, as the article rightly points out, the findings are still in the pre-print stage and have yet to undergo peer review. Previous studies on superconductors have faced scrutiny and, in some cases, been disproven at this stage. Furthermore, if the production of LK-99 cannot be repeated or scaled up, its immediate practical impact will be limited.
In sum, while the discovery of LK-99 is an exciting advancement in superconductor research, further investigation is necessary to confirm the findings and explore the potential applications of this technology.

For decades, physicists have dreamed of discovering a material that could effortlessly convey electricity at everyday temperatures, a feat that would save gargantuan amounts of energy and revolutionize modern technology.

Writing in the journal Nature, a team of researchers announced on Wednesday that they have done just that. They have made a superconductor that works at 58 degrees Fahrenheit, the temperature of a cool autumn day.

This material is still far from practical, produced in only minute quantities and under immense pressures usually found closer to the Earth���s core. But the scientists hope that with further experimentation they can devise a variation of their material that remains a superconductor even after that pressure is removed.

���Ultimately, we want to bring the pressure to almost ambient pressure, to actually have an actual application,��� said Ranga P. Dias, a professor of physics and mechanical engineering at the University of Rochester and the senior author of the Nature paper.

This article discusses a significant achievement in the field of superconductor research that was announced on October 14, 2020. A team of scientists revealed they had developed a superconductor that works at 58 degrees Fahrenheit, which is the temperature of a cool autumn day. This is a massive step forward in physics as superconductors that function at everyday temperatures could significantly save energy and revolutionize technology.
The material, however, is not yet practical for widespread use. It is produced in very small quantities and operates under high pressures usually found closer to Earth's core. Despite these limitations, the researchers are hopeful that further experimentation may lead to a variant of their material that remains a superconductor even after the pressure is removed.
The senior author of the Nature paper, Ranga P. Dias, a professor of physics and mechanical engineering at the University of Rochester, mentions that they ultimately aim to bring the pressure to almost ambient pressure, opening up the possibility for practical applications of the superconductor.
However, it is essential to note that the article cited in Nature was retracted on September 26, 2022. Concerns were raised regarding the manner in which the data in the paper had been processed and interpreted. Nature is working with the authors to investigate these concerns and determine their potential impact on the paper's results and conclusions. Meanwhile, readers are advised to exercise caution when using the results reported in the paper.
So while it might be impressive, LK-99 is still very early in this process. It is really surprising that there would be reporting on an article in the pre-print stage, does that really mean before peer review?
ChatGPT
Yes, you're correct. When an article is in the "pre-print" stage, it means it has not yet undergone the peer-review process. Peer review is a crucial part of scientific research, as it involves independent experts evaluating the research for validity, significance, and originality.
Reporting on pre-print articles can be somewhat controversial. On one hand, it allows for rapid dissemination of potentially significant findings, which can be particularly valuable in fast-moving fields or situations like a public health crisis. On the other hand, without the quality control offered by peer review, there's a higher risk of spreading inaccurate or misleading information.
This is why such reports often include disclaimers, noting that the research is preliminary and has not yet been peer-reviewed. As such, while the reported creation of LK-99 as a room-temperature superconductor is a potentially exciting development, it's important to approach the findings with a degree of caution until they have been thoroughly vetted by the scientific community.

A prominent journal has decided to retract a paper by Ranga Dias, a physicist at the University of Rochester in New York who has made controversial claims about discovering room-temperature superconductors ��� materials that would not require any cooling to conduct electricity with zero resistance. The forthcoming retraction, of a paper published by Physical Review Letters (PRL) in 20211, is significant because the Nature news team has learnt that it is the result of an investigation that found apparent data fabrication.

PRL���s decision follows allegations that Dias plagiarized substantial portions of his PhD thesis and a separate retraction of one of Dias���s papers on room-temperature superconductivity by Nature last September. (Nature���s news team is independent of its journals team.)


Stunning room-temperature-superconductor claim is retracted

After receiving an e-mail last year expressing concern about possible data fabrication in Dias���s PRL paper ��� a study, not about room-temperature superconductivity, but about the electrical properties of manganese disulfide (MnS2) ��� the journal commissioned an investigation by four independent referees. Nature���s news team has obtained documents about the investigation, including e-mails and three reports of its outcome, from sources who have asked to remain anonymous. ���The findings back up the allegations of data fabrication/falsification convincingly,��� PRL���s editors wrote in an e-mail obtained by Nature. Jessica Thomas, an executive editor at the American Physical Society, which publishes PRL, declined to comment.
ChatGPT
The news you've provided indicates that the research work by physicist Ranga Dias, which has made claims about room-temperature superconductivity, is under serious scrutiny. A forthcoming retraction of one of his papers published by Physical Review Letters (PRL) suggests data fabrication, which severely undermines the credibility of his findings. This retraction follows a separate one from Nature for another of Dias's papers on room-temperature superconductivity. Such retractions can have significant implications for the researcher's reputation and career.
Retractions in academic publishing occur when research findings are proven to be false or misleading due to reasons like data manipulation, plagiarism, or unethical research practices. In this case, it seems an investigation has found compelling evidence of data fabrication or falsification in Dias's work.
This is a crucial reminder of the importance of the scientific process, including peer review and ongoing scrutiny even after publication, to ensure the integrity and reliability of published research. It highlights the necessity for caution when interpreting early findings, especially in high-stakes areas such as room-temperature superconductivity.
It's worth noting that while this news is a setback for the field, it doesn't mean progress toward room-temperature superconductivity is halted. Other researchers continue to work in this area, and future breakthroughs may still occur.
A list of all of the topics we have discussed.
ChatGPT
Here is a summary of the topics we've discussed:
Superconductivity:
We began our discussion with superconductivity, a phenomenon where a material can conduct electricity without resistance.
Electron Paramagnetic Resonance (EPR) signals:
We discussed the appearance of large absorption EPR signals in superconductors at very low temperatures and under certain external magnetic fields.
Josephson Junctions:
This is the concept of tunneling of supercurrents between two superconductors separated by a thin layer of insulator or non-superconducting metal, which was explored in the context of your text.
Semiquantum wells (SQWs):
You brought up the possibility of tunneling between SQWs, which would result in zero resistance. The creation of these SQWs at specific intervals in a proposed material (LK-99) was mentioned.
Superconductivity at Room Temperature:
We discussed the significance of the discovery of a material (LK-99) that allegedly exhibits superconductivity at room temperature and ambient pressure, which would represent a major breakthrough in the field.
Metaphors and Analogies:
We used the metaphor of a pipeline system to describe the concept of tunneling and superconductivity.
Potential Applications of Superconductors:
We briefly touched on the various potential applications of room-temperature superconductors in industries like energy, technology, and transportation.
Scientific Publication Process:
We also discussed the scientific publication process, particularly the role of pre-print articles and peer-review.
Controversies and Retractions in Scientific Research:
We covered the controversies surrounding the work of physicist Ranga Dias, who claimed to have discovered room-temperature superconductors. His work has been scrutinized, with some papers retracted due to allegations of data fabrication.
These topics encompass the key elements of our discussion around superconductivity, the exciting yet contentious area of room-temperature superconductivity, and the broader themes of scientific research and integrity.
I am sorry my physics isn't enough to verify some of these finding. But if the goal is cheaper access to electricity, let's discuss alternative schemes, where ensembles of energy generation and storage can also have a reduction on energy availability and price. I am thinning of gravitational dynamic charged tidal-batteries, biofuel from giant kelp, augmented canopy trellises rain forest enhancement with terra preta rain, kelp parachute based hurricane dissipation macrame cord charging, as well as nuclear powered battery charging with contained volcano updraft polyvortex battery disposal, yogurt based robotics and batteries, and so on.
ChatGPT
Certainly! It sounds like you're interested in a diverse array of potential energy solutions, some of which are established and others more theoretical or experimental. Here's a brief discussion of the concepts you mentioned:
Gravitational Dynamic Charged Tidal-Batteries:
This concept sounds like a form of gravitational energy storage, similar to pumped-storage hydroelectricity. The basic idea would be to use excess energy (during periods of low demand) to lift mass against gravity, then let gravity pull the mass down (during periods of high demand) to generate electricity. The "tidal" part of the concept could potentially involve using the predictable movement of tides to generate or store energy.
Biofuel from Giant Kelp:
This is an interesting concept with ongoing research. Kelp, a type of seaweed, grows quickly and can be converted into biofuel. It has the advantage of not requiring fresh water or arable land, unlike many other biofuel sources. Challenges include developing efficient methods for farming, harvesting, and converting kelp into fuel on a large scale.
Augmented Canopy Trellises Rainforest Enhancement with Terra Preta Rain:
This seems like a combination of multiple concepts. Terra preta ("black earth" in Portuguese) is a highly fertile soil found in the Amazon Rainforest, rich in biochar, which helps store carbon and nutrients. Rainforest enhancement could potentially involve efforts to expand or restore rainforests, which are important carbon sinks and biodiversity hotspots. Augmented canopy trellises might involve structures to support and encourage tree growth.
Kelp Parachute-Based Hurricane Dissipation and Macrame Cord Charging:
This seems like a highly speculative concept involving the use of kelp or other materials to disrupt the formation of hurricanes, perhaps by cooling the surface of the ocean. Macrame cord charging could potentially involve generating energy from the movement of these cords in water or wind, similar to some forms of wave or wind energy.
Nuclear Powered Battery Charging with Contained Volcano Updraft Polyvortex Battery Disposal:
This seems to combine a variety of ideas related to energy generation and storage. Nuclear power is a well-established energy source, while the concept of harnessing energy from volcanic activity is more speculative. Polyvortex might refer to systems involving multiple vortices or swirling flows, which can be found in various natural and engineered systems.
Yogurt Based Robotics and Batteries:
This seems quite speculative and I'm not sure exactly what you're envisioning. There's ongoing research into bio-batteries that generate electricity from organic compounds, and into soft robotics which could potentially involve materials with properties similar to yogurt.
Overall, the search for sustainable, efficient, and environmentally-friendly energy solutions is a critical task that will likely require a diverse array of approaches. Some of these ideas are quite futuristic or speculative, but then again, many of today's technologies would have seemed far-fetched just a few decades ago. The challenge lies not just in discovering or inventing new technologies, but in scaling them up to a point where they can have a significant impact.
Yes we can can selectively cool portions of the ocean and also extending rainforest over Sahara would dissipate hurricanes before they got started
ChatGPT
That's an interesting thought. Let's break it down:
Cooling portions of the ocean:
The surface temperature of the ocean plays a critical role in the formation and intensification of hurricanes. Higher water temperatures provide more energy for the storms. Conceptually, if one could selectively cool areas of the ocean, it could help to prevent hurricanes from forming or growing. However, the scale of the ocean is enormous, and it would likely require a tremendous amount of energy to make a significant impact on the temperature. Also, such large-scale interventions could have unintended side effects on marine life and ecosystems. More research would be needed to fully understand and address these challenges.
Extending rainforests over the Sahara:
This idea seems to involve the concept of reforestation or afforestation, creating new forests where there were none before. Forests can help to regulate climate, sequester carbon, and promote biodiversity. However, transforming a desert like the Sahara into a rainforest would be a massive and unprecedented undertaking. It would involve significant challenges, such as supplying enough water and nutrients for the trees to grow. Moreover, such a transformation could have significant impacts on local ecosystems and human societies.
It's important to remember that while these ideas may be fascinating to consider, they are currently speculative and would require substantial research and technological development. In general, the goal of mitigating climate change and its impacts, such as hurricanes, will likely involve a multifaceted approach including reducing greenhouse gas emissions, protecting and restoring ecosystems, and potentially also developing new technologies for climate intervention or adaptation.
On let us replace all furnaces and heaters with computers that way the colder climates can do much of the calculation and storage for equatorial regions
ChatGPT
That's an intriguing idea! It makes use of the waste heat generated by computers and other electronics, turning a problem (excess heat) into a solution (home heating).
Here's how it could work, in theory:
In colder climates, houses and buildings often require heating for a significant part of the year. Computers, servers, and data centers, on the other hand, generate a lot of heat when they're operating. This heat is usually treated as waste and is often actively cooled to prevent overheating, using even more energy in the process.
By moving these computers and servers into homes and buildings in colder climates, you could repurpose the waste heat as a heat source. Instead of needing to burn fuel or use electricity to heat the building, you could use the waste heat from the computing operations. This could potentially reduce the carbon footprint and energy costs of heating.
However, there are also challenges with this idea:
Noise and space:
Computers, especially servers, can be quite noisy and take up a lot of space. This could be problematic in a home environment.
Maintenance and security:
Computers and servers require regular maintenance and are often kept in secure facilities to prevent unauthorized access. This could be more challenging in a home environment.
Internet infrastructure:
High-performance computing often requires strong and reliable internet connections, which might not be available in all residential areas.
Energy efficiency of heating:
Computers aren't designed to be efficient heaters. So even though they generate heat, they might not be as efficient or effective at heating a home as a dedicated heating system.
Variable heat production:
The heat produced by a computer can vary depending on usage, which could lead to inconsistent heating.
Environmental impact:
The production and disposal of computers and electronic components can have significant environmental impacts. It would be important to consider these lifecycle impacts as well.
Despite these challenges, this idea has actually been explored in practice! For example, the company Qarnot Computing has developed a heater that uses high-performance computing to generate heat. And in some places, excess heat from data centers is used to heat nearby homes and buildings. These examples show that with some creativity and engineering, it might be possible to turn the problem of computer waste heat into a solution for home heating.
Yeah I am thinking there is waste heat being generated by pulp and paper and oil refineries, I want to use that to make kelp and cattail root based yoghurts and flours, and expand the edible packaging industry
ChatGPT
Your idea taps into the growing interest in industrial symbiosis, which is the use of byproducts, including waste heat, from one industry as input for another.
To make it more concrete, let's look at each of the components of your proposal:
Waste heat from pulp, paper, and oil refineries:
These industries generate a large amount of waste heat. Capturing and repurposing this heat could significantly improve their energy efficiency and reduce their environmental impact. However, this would require a substantial infrastructure for capturing and transporting the heat, which could be a significant upfront investment.
Kelp and cattail root based yogurts and flours:
Kelp is already widely used in many Asian cuisines and is known to be a highly sustainable and nutritious food source. Cattail roots are less common but have been used by various indigenous communities and are also highly sustainable. Turning these into yogurts and flours would require developing new food processing methods. Additionally, the consumer acceptance and market demand for these new food products would need to be evaluated.
Edible packaging:
Edible packaging is a very exciting development in the packaging industry, with the potential to greatly reduce plastic waste. Using byproducts from the kelp and cattail root processing, like fiber, could be a very sustainable source of material for edible packaging. However, developing these new materials and ensuring they meet food safety and packaging performance requirements could be a significant challenge.
All of these components are technically feasible on their own, but integrating them into a single, efficient system would be a complex undertaking requiring multidisciplinary collaboration. It's a very exciting vision, though, and could be a great model for a more circular and sustainable economy!
Ok well one way is to pipeline steam as is done commercially in New York City.  Another is by heating giant blocks of metal and then putting them on the roofs of houses. This can be used to push down slowly on a gravitational charger when needed, the blocks have a maze of tunnels through them so when the milkflour truck comes by to fill you milkflour reservoirs, they also use a crane to lift the weight higher, ratcheting the battery and run hot steam through the heat sink to "charge it up" again. The block is in an insulated blanket but can heat can be syphoned to heat the home or cook.
ChatGPT
What you're proposing sounds like a creative multi-pronged approach to both energy transfer and storage, as well as home heating.
Piping Steam:
This is indeed a method used in certain cities such as New York City, where excess steam is piped to commercial and residential buildings for heat and other uses. This type of system could conceivably be expanded and made more efficient.
Heating Giant Blocks of Metal:
This idea essentially creates a form of thermal battery. In general, thermal storage involves the use of a medium (like a block of metal) that can absorb and store heat energy, which can then be retrieved later by reversing the process. For instance, hot steam could be run through the block to heat it up, then later that heat could be used for home heating or cooking, as you suggested.
Gravitational Charger:
Along with the thermal storage, you're also proposing a form of mechanical energy storage, where the potential energy of a lifted object (the heavy metal block) is converted into electrical energy as the object descends. This is a similar principle to pumped-storage hydroelectricity, but on a much smaller, household scale.
Delivery of Services:
Integrating this system with a regular delivery service is an interesting way to centralize and reduce the energy costs of maintenance. This could be seen as a modern take on the old "milkman" model, where goods and services are delivered directly to consumers' homes on a regular schedule.
Overall, the system you're proposing would be quite complex to implement, and there would be a number of technical challenges to overcome. For example, the efficiency of energy transfer and storage in the thermal battery and gravitational charger would need to be high enough to be practical and cost-effective. There would also be safety considerations with handling and storing high-temperature materials and heavy weights in residential areas.
Nevertheless, your idea is an imaginative example of how we can think differently about our energy systems and leverage multiple forms of energy transfer and storage to improve efficiency and sustainability.
Yeah it all sounds a bit complicated. I haven't gotten into hyperbolated gumball economy yet which involves piping food and building materials into homes and waste out through layered packaging marbles I call "gumballs"
ChatGPT
The idea of a "hyperbolated gumball economy" is quite unique and seems to aim at revolutionizing both the logistics and waste management systems.
To ensure I'm understanding correctly: it seems you're suggesting using "gumballs," or spherical containers, to transport goods into homes, and then using those same containers to carry waste out of the home, correct?
If so, this could have several potential benefits:
Reduced Packaging Waste:
If the gumballs are reusable, this could significantly reduce the amount of packaging waste produced by goods transportation.
Efficient Use of Infrastructure:
Using the same system to deliver goods and remove waste could potentially be more efficient than having separate systems for each.
Potential for Automation:
A system like this could potentially be highly automated, reducing the need for human labor and increasing efficiency.
However, just as with the previous idea, this one would come with its own set of challenges:
Infrastructure Requirements:
Building the necessary infrastructure for such a system could be a massive and expensive undertaking.
Compatibility with Existing Systems:
Not all goods or types of waste might be compatible with this system.
User Acceptance:
People may be resistant to changing their current habits of goods purchasing and waste disposal.
Despite these challenges, innovative thinking like this is exactly what's needed to tackle the complex problems of waste management and sustainable goods transportation. It's great to think outside of the box and explore radical new ways of doing things that could potentially have a big impact on sustainability.
I think you understand it. It might involve new household appliances for processing food and materials as well as for tumbling, storage, and packaging. I think you might recognize that something like this happens in the bloodstream.
ChatGPT
Yes, the concept you're suggesting has some parallels to biological systems. For example, in our bodies, the bloodstream is a unified transportation network that delivers nutrients and oxygen to cells while also carrying away waste products. Similarly, the lymphatic system works to transport white blood cells and remove cellular waste.
Creating a similar unified transportation network in our households or communities, where food and materials are delivered and waste is removed using the same infrastructure, does resemble these biological processes. It's a holistic approach to resource distribution and waste management, and it's an intriguing idea.
However, the technical challenges would be quite significant. Developing new appliances for processing and packaging, and creating the infrastructure to support this "gumball economy," would require substantial resources and technological advancements. Also, as with any new system, there would be challenges related to public acceptance and changes in habitual practices.
Nonetheless, thinking about our industrial systems in this way - in terms of natural biological processes - can lead to innovative approaches and breakthroughs in sustainability. In fact, this way of thinking is the basis for a field of study known as biomimicry, which is the design and production of materials, structures, and systems that are modeled on biological entities and processes. It's an exciting and promising area of exploration.
Ok well these might have educational or entertainment purposes in games or augmented reality. We could visualize packet switching networks and track media consumption and learning by visualizing information for certain topics as being stored geographically
ChatGPT
Absolutely! Augmented reality (AR) and virtual reality (VR) are powerful tools for education and entertainment, and their use in visualizing complex systems like packet-switched networks or geographical information storage could make these concepts much more accessible and engaging.
For instance, an AR application could allow a user to "see" the flow of data packets within a network, with visual and auditory cues to illustrate concepts like network congestion, packet loss, and routing. Similarly, VR could be used to create immersive "journeys" through a representation of the Internet, where information on different topics is stored in different geographical locations. Users could "travel" to different locations to access and learn about different subjects.
Moreover, gamifying these experiences can further increase engagement and learning. Gamification involves applying game design elements in non-game contexts, and it's been shown to enhance motivation, increase engagement, and improve learning outcomes.
Moreover, these kinds of applications could also provide valuable insights into how people interact with and consume information, which could in turn be used to improve the design of educational and informational systems.
I mean gameifying the gumball economy.
ChatGPT
Absolutely, gameifying the gumball economy would be a fantastic way to engage people and stimulate understanding of this complex system.
Here's a rough idea of how it could work:
Gumball Crafting
: Players start by crafting their own gumballs. They would choose materials, food contents, and packaging layers. The choice of materials and foods would impact the gumball's environmental impact, nutritional value, durability, and cost. This could educate players about sustainable materials and healthy food choices.
Gumball Market
: Players can buy, sell, and trade gumballs in a virtual marketplace. They could set prices based on the gumball's properties and current demand. This would teach players about supply and demand, pricing, and the basics of running a business.
Gumball Delivery and Processing
: Players could simulate the delivery and processing of gumballs. They'd route delivery vehicles, manage a pipeline network, and handle waste management. This would help players understand logistics, infrastructure management, and waste management principles.
Gumball Challenges
: Special challenges could be introduced, such as producing a certain type of gumball, dealing with a sudden spike in demand, or handling a crisis like a raw material shortage. This would add an element of problem-solving and strategy.
Gumball Impact
: The game could track each player's environmental, health, and economic impact based on their gumball production and choices. This could incentivize sustainable and healthy choices.
This kind of game could be a fun and engaging way to learn about the complexities of the gumball economy, and the principles of sustainability, nutrition, economics, and logistics that underpin it.
Remember it is a way to transport materials into and out of the home, for example the gumballs contain milkflour and xyloid which can be used to make many types of food such as pizza and spaghetti and cereal as well as plywood and papers
ChatGPT
I see, so the gumball system isn't just about food, but also about providing raw materials that can be used in various ways. Here's an updated version of the game, taking into account this aspect:
Gumball Crafting
: Players craft gumballs that contain not just food but also a range of raw materials like milkflour, xyloid, and more. The composition of the gumball will influence its usage possibilities, cost, and environmental impact.
Home Management
: Players have a virtual home where they use the contents of the gumballs. For example, milkflour and xyloid could be used to prepare meals, construct furniture, or craft items. This gives players a direct experience of how versatile and useful these materials can be.
Gumball Market
: The marketplace now also takes into account the demand and supply for different raw materials, not just the gumballs themselves. Players need to keep track of market trends and adjust their gumball production accordingly.
Gumball Delivery and Processing
: On top of managing the delivery and processing logistics, players also need to deal with the waste generated from using the gumball's contents. This emphasizes the importance of waste management and recycling.
Gumball Challenges
: Challenges could involve creating specific items with the gumballs' contents, dealing with a sudden change in market demand, or responding to an environmental crisis.
Gumball Impact
: The game could still track each player's environmental, health, and economic impact. However, now it would also consider how efficiently players use their raw materials, and how effectively they manage waste.
By incorporating these elements, players could learn about sustainability, economics, logistics, waste management, and the practical uses of materials like milkflour and xyloid. It would give them a firsthand experience of managing the inflow and outflow of materials in a household, in an engaging and gameified way.
It's not too abstract?
ChatGPT
While it's certainly a unique concept, that doesn't necessarily make it too abstract. The key is to introduce the mechanics and the logic behind them in an accessible way, perhaps starting with simple tasks and gradually adding complexity as players progress and learn.
Effective visual representation can also greatly help in making the concept more tangible. For example, showing the process of milkflour and xyloid being extracted from gumballs and then being used in various applications can make the concept feel more concrete.
Moreover, abstract concepts can often lead to intriguing and innovative gameplay, as players will need to think strategically and creatively. As long as the game is designed in a way that guides players through the unique mechanics and encourages them to explore and experiment, the abstract nature of the concept could actually be a strength rather than a weakness.
I mean we can build simulations (gameify) many of these ideas, I think virtual pulp and paper processing and recycling factory would be a fun game for example.
ChatGPT
That sounds like a fascinating concept for a game! Simulations of various industrial processes can be both entertaining and educational. Players could learn about the complexities of the pulp and paper industry, as well as the recycling process, while having to make strategic decisions to run their virtual factory efficiently.
In such a game, players could be tasked with managing different stages of production, from sourcing raw materials to processing them and finally turning them into finished products. They could also be tasked with managing the recycling aspect, finding ways to efficiently repurpose waste materials and improve the sustainability of their operation.
This kind of game could also incorporate elements of city-building games, where players not only manage the factory itself, but also have to consider its impact on the surrounding environment and community. They might have to balance the factory's profitability with environmental sustainability and social responsibility, making complex decisions that have far-reaching effects.
And with your "gumball economy" concept as a basis, the game could introduce innovative mechanics that aren't commonly found in other simulation games, adding a unique twist to the genre.
So yes, a virtual pulp and paper processing and recycling factory could be a highly engaging game. It has the potential to offer a unique combination of strategic decision-making, educational value, and environmental consciousness, which could appeal to a wide range of players.

Market Analysis
It���s official: LK-99 isn���t a room-temperature superconductor

If there was any hope remaining that LK-99 might be a room-temperature superconductor, it���s pretty much dead now.

In fact, it���s worse than that. Pure samples of the substance show that it is an insulator ��� the opposite of a superconductor. The glimmers of hope that kept the story in the news for weeks appear to be the result of impurities in the original samples.

Dozens of studies published in the last week or two have coalesced around the conclusion, less than a month after a sensational preprint paper was published by a team at the Quantum Energy Research Centre, a small company housed in the basement of a modest apartment building in Seoul, South Korea.

The Korean team made waves when it published preprints on July 22, claiming to have created a material that exhibited superconductor-like properties at ambient temperature and pressure. What���s more, the material was made of plebeian ingredients: lead, copper, phosphorus and oxygen. It flew in the face of decades of research into superconductors.

And yet it appeared to possess some of the same qualities that define superconductors. A video released by the team showed it partially levitating above a magnet, and when probing it for electrical resistance, they noticed a sharp drop around 104.8��C. Both the levitation and the resistance drop are hallmarks of superconductors.

Early warnings
There were warnings early on that the claims might be bunk. For one, the team published to a preprint server first. This isn���t necessarily a red flag, though preprints are far from the gold standard. There���s no peer review of preprints, and the bar for submission is pretty low. In most cases, that���s not a problem; preprints have allowed many fields to move more quickly than the traditional peer-review process allows, and most scientists aren���t making outlandish claims in their preprints. Still, the fact that LK-99 appeared first in a preprint wasn���t promising.
