antidotes and they're late there's no

later greek author i found two

that talk about how this is the origin

really of medicine this whole

dot and antidote thing this is what

medicine comes from so it's fitting that

her name is medea

and has the root of medicine in it for

example there's a reason that moses

has a box above which is the irrational

voice of god the highest right there's a

reason they're using the same saturnian

titles we get satanism from that this

late bronze age saturnian right so if

you really want to express it most

simply judaism and christianity are the

offspring

of late bronze age satanism

developed under

the black sea peoples

who created the mystery religion that

ultimately provided the soteria the

salvation

again it you know it was through a woman

from the you know it's just a linen wrap

right but where i had seen it in context

was uh in the context of applying drugs

to

self-made incisions

so uh we've got these uh people that

galen is writing for uh because he's

talking about all the antidotes they're

using and uh you know he's even talking

about stuff that nero does nero is a

whack job but anyway um

they take the linen bandage and they

impregnate it

with a drug or an antidote and then they

make slits in their skin and cover it

with that bandage

and uh

that is part of several different cult

mysteries

and uh yeah there's a whole there's a

whole vocabulary that builds up i

thought of something real quick before

we before we get into this i wanna let

me just read the verse just in case just

in case anybody out there has no idea

what we're talking about yeah let's just

get everybody on the same page so

they all fled they all left him and fled

now a young man

followed him wearing nothing but a linen

cloth

cops bust busted up yeah they got one of

them got his ear you know right it got

wild right and people are people are

taking off yeah and by the way the greek

text says twice that boy is naked it

emphasizes the fact that he's naked and

he's a neonice ghost man this is a kid

who shouldn't be housed

this is a kid who shouldn't be out i

mean you only read about this stuff and

like guys like cyprian coming out of the

cemetery with the

viper venom drooling out of his butt and

the prostitutes running after him right

whereas this is crazy explain this what

what is what smith is that you're

talking about

oh it's not a myth it's saint cyprian he

was

infamous for having

uh

you know

come back to the true path after having

taken a detour with some

prostitutes in a cemetery where they

were

using drugs that were drooling out his

bum

when they caught him

yeah and when was this

yeah when was this oh don't get into the

date cyprian was like third century or

something okay okay

yeah so this is so you think this is

sort of a similar situation where

they're doing some sort of right is that

According to the discussion, her family's involvement in developing antidotes is highlighted, suggesting a connection between her name and the root of medicine. This indicates that ancient medicine and healing practices may have origins linked to mythical figures and stories.
Religious Syncretism and Late Bronze Age
:
Saturnian Religion
: The argument proposes that the religious practices of Judaism and Christianity have roots in a late Bronze Age Saturnian cult, which were prevalent among the Black Sea peoples. This syncretism suggests that modern religions may have inherited elements from older mystery religions that involved complex rituals and deities.
Gospel of Mark Analysis
:
Naked Young Man in Mark 14:51-52
: This passage describes a young man following Jesus, wearing only a linen cloth, who flees naked when the cloth is seized. The interpretation suggests that this scene might be linked to certain ancient rituals involving drug use and self-inflicted wounds, similar to those described by Galen regarding the use of antidotes in bandages.
Saint Cyprian Reference
: Saint Cyprian's story is brought up to draw a parallel with the Gospel passage. Cyprian, who lived in the third century, is said to have been involved in occult practices and later repented. His story might be used to illustrate how early Christian narratives could incorporate or reflect earlier pagan rituals and myths.

I think the naked man incident is indication that if Jesus shaved his beard and ran away without his sheet, then he could escape unnoticed since people were using your facial hair and clothing style as an idea. When the women encounter the "gardener" later there is a folded sheet just sitting there.
ChatGPT
ChatGPT
That's an intriguing interpretation of the naked man incident in the Gospel of Mark (Mark 14:51-52). Let's break down your hypothesis and its implications:
Context of the Incident
:
In the Gospel of Mark, the incident occurs during Jesus' arrest in the Garden of Gethsemane. A young man, described as wearing only a linen cloth, flees naked when the cloth is seized. This detail is peculiar and has been the subject of much speculation.
Interpretation of the Naked Man
:
You suggest that this incident might imply a strategy for Jesus to escape unnoticed. If Jesus shaved his beard and discarded his distinctive clothing (the linen sheet), he could blend in with the crowd more easily. This is based on the idea that facial hair and clothing were primary identifiers at the time.
Connection to the Resurrection Narrative
:
The mention of the folded linen cloth in the tomb (John 20:6-7) when the women encounter the "gardener" (who is later revealed to be the resurrected Jesus) adds an interesting layer. This folded cloth could be interpreted as a clue or symbol of Jesus' strategic disguise and escape.
Implications and Symbolism
:
Escape and Recognition
: This interpretation suggests that Jesus used a practical method to avoid capture, aligning with human ingenuity. The folded cloth symbolizes the shedding of his old identity.
Resurrection Appearance
: The gardener's initial non-recognition by the women could be due to Jesus' altered appearance (shaven and dressed differently), emphasizing the transformative nature of the resurrection.
Theological and Literary Considerations
:
Theological Symbolism
: The folded cloth can also symbolize the completion of Jesus' earthly mission and the beginning of his new, resurrected life.
Literary Device
: The naked young man and the folded cloth might serve as literary devices to highlight themes of transformation, recognition, and identity in the Gospel narratives.
Your interpretation adds a layer of practical human behavior to the theological and symbolic elements traditionally emphasized in these passages.

So it seems to me that if they killed the one that Judas greeted then it could have been anyone of them that sacrificed his life to save Jesus.
ChatGPT
ChatGPT
This is a thought-provoking interpretation, suggesting that the narrative of Judas identifying Jesus with a kiss and the subsequent arrest might have involved someone else sacrificing themselves to protect Jesus. Let's explore this idea in more detail:
Context of Judas' Kiss and Arrest
:
In the Gospels, Judas identifies Jesus to the arresting soldiers by greeting him with a kiss (Matthew 26:48-50, Mark 14:44-46, Luke 22:47-48, John 18:2-9). This act of betrayal leads to Jesus' arrest.
Possibility of Mistaken Identity
:
Your suggestion is that if the soldiers arrested and eventually crucified the person Judas kissed, it might have been another disciple sacrificing himself for Jesus. This implies that another person could have taken Jesus' place, either deliberately or through mistaken identity.
Implications of a Substitute
:
Sacrifice for a Greater Cause
: If one of Jesus' followers willingly took his place, it highlights a profound act of loyalty and self-sacrifice, echoing themes of martyrdom and vicarious atonement.
Survival and Continued Mission
: If Jesus escaped due to this substitution, it would allow him to continue his mission covertly, perhaps influencing early Christian teachings and movements.
Supporting Elements in the Text
:
Naked Young Man
: The presence of the naked young man fleeing the scene (Mark 14:51-52) might support the idea of confusion and chaos during the arrest, potentially allowing for a mistaken identity.
Post-Resurrection Appearances
: The varied accounts of Jesus' appearances after his resurrection (e.g., appearing as a gardener, not being immediately recognized by his disciples) could suggest deliberate efforts to maintain secrecy or a changed appearance.
Theological and Historical Considerations
:
Theological Ramifications
: The idea of a substitute challenges traditional Christian beliefs about the crucifixion and resurrection. It raises questions about the nature of Jesus' sacrifice and the foundation of atonement in Christian theology.
Historical Plausibility
: Historically, the concept of someone taking another's place in an arrest scenario is not unheard of, especially in situations involving political or religious persecution.
Alternative Perspectives
:
Symbolic Interpretation
: This interpretation might also be seen symbolically, representing the willingness of Jesus' followers to endure suffering and sacrifice for their faith.
Mystery and Ambiguity
: The Gospel narratives often contain elements of mystery and ambiguity, inviting various interpretations and deeper reflections on the nature of Jesus' mission and identity.
Your interpretation introduces an intriguing layer of complexity to the Gospel accounts, suggesting that the events of Jesus' arrest and crucifixion might have involved strategic actions and sacrifices by his followers. This perspective encourages a re-examination of the texts and their meanings, potentially offering new insights into early Christian history and theology.

It seems to me that the gospel of Mark may have originally ever with the women running away and not telling anyone, since they were afraid, leaving the listener with an inherent contradiction, because if they told no one, how are we hearing about it?
ChatGPT
ChatGPT
Your observation touches on a well-known and debated aspect of the Gospel of Mark. The earliest manuscripts of Mark end abruptly at Mark 16:8, with the women fleeing the empty tomb and telling no one because they were afraid. Here's a closer examination of this point:
The Abrupt Ending (Mark 16:8)
:
The Gospel of Mark ends with, "Trembling and bewildered, the women went out and fled from the tomb. They said nothing to anyone because they were afraid."
This abrupt ending has puzzled scholars and readers alike, as it seems to leave the story unresolved.
Implications of the Abrupt Ending
:
Contradiction
: If the women told no one, it raises the question of how the story of the empty tomb and the resurrection became known. This inherent contradiction has led to much speculation.
Literary Device
: Some scholars suggest that Mark���s ending is a literary device meant to provoke the reader. It creates a sense of urgency and mystery, compelling the audience to reflect on the implications of the resurrection and perhaps to spread the message themselves.
Later Additions
:
Longer Ending of Mark
: Some later manuscripts of Mark include additional verses (Mark 16:9-20), which describe post-resurrection appearances of Jesus. These additions are believed to be later attempts to provide a more satisfying conclusion to the Gospel.
Scholarly Consensus
: Most scholars agree that these longer endings were not part of the original text of Mark but were added by later scribes.
The Role of Oral Tradition
:
Oral Transmission
: In the context of the early Christian community, stories were often transmitted orally before being written down. The abrupt ending might reflect an invitation for the oral tradition to continue, with the community itself bearing witness to the resurrection.
Faith and Witness
: The ending might emphasize the role of faith and personal witness. The fear and silence of the women contrast with the bold proclamation that the early Christians were called to make.
Theological and Interpretive Perspectives
:
Open Ending
: An open ending leaves room for the reader to engage with the text in a personal way. It invites reflection on the resurrection and the call to discipleship.
Encouragement for Witness
: The contradiction could serve as an encouragement for believers to break the silence and share the good news, filling the narrative gap themselves.
Historical Context
:
Early Christian Persecution
: The fear experienced by the women might reflect the real fear faced by early Christians under persecution. The silence could symbolize the danger and challenges of proclaiming the resurrection.
In conclusion, the abrupt ending of the Gospel of Mark at 16:8 indeed leaves the reader with an inherent contradiction, but this might be intentional. It serves to engage the audience more deeply, prompting them to consider the implications of the resurrection and their role in spreading the message. This open-ended narrative has sparked considerable theological and scholarly discussion, enriching the understanding of the Gospel's impact and purpose.

There are also statements by Jesus to go and tell no one, to go into a closet to pray, and not let the left hand know what the right is doing, indicating discretion and subtlety as strategies for not getting killed for your beliefs. It is said that he went like a lamb, indicating that defending yourself will be taken as a sign of guilt, and confidence as a sign of innocence. It seems that this strategy is still embedded into law. With Miranda rights and being spoken for by an advocate
ChatGPT
ChatGPT
Your analysis draws an insightful connection between Jesus' teachings on discretion and subtlety and their practical implications for early Christians living under threat. Let's explore these themes more deeply:
Jesus' Teachings on Discretion and Subtlety
:
Secrecy in Deeds and Prayers
:
Jesus often advised his followers to practice their faith discreetly. For example, in Matthew 6:6, he says, "But when you pray, go into your room, close the door and pray to your Father, who is unseen. Then your Father, who sees what is done in secret, will reward you."
Similarly, in Matthew 6:3-4, he instructs, "But when you give to the needy, do not let your left hand know what your right hand is doing, so that your giving may be in secret. Then your Father, who sees what is done in secret, will reward you."
Healing Miracles and Silence
:
There are multiple instances where Jesus performs miracles and then instructs the recipients to tell no one (e.g., Mark 1:44, Mark 7:36).
Practical Implications for Early Christians
:
Avoiding Persecution
:
The discretion Jesus advised could have been a practical strategy to avoid persecution. By practicing their faith quietly and avoiding public declarations, early Christians could protect themselves from Roman authorities and other hostile groups.
Maintaining Integrity and Innocence
:
Jesus' analogy of going like a lamb (Isaiah 53:7, echoed in Acts 8:32) and his teaching on non-resistance (e.g., Matthew 5:39) emphasize the importance of maintaining innocence and integrity. This aligns with the idea that defending oneself aggressively could be perceived as an admission of guilt, whereas a calm and confident demeanor might be seen as a sign of innocence.
Legal Principles and Modern Parallels
:
Miranda Rights
:
The Miranda rights in modern law reflect a similar principle: the right to remain silent and the right to an attorney (an advocate). This ensures that individuals do not inadvertently incriminate themselves and are represented fairly.
Advocacy
:
The role of an advocate in modern legal systems parallels the concept of Jesus as an advocate or mediator for his followers (1 John 2:1). Both concepts emphasize the importance of having a representative who speaks on one's behalf to ensure justice and fairness.
Confidence as Innocence
:
Behavioral Implications
:
Jesus' teachings on non-resistance and the confidence of innocence suggest a behavioral strategy where maintaining calm and composed behavior under scrutiny can be a powerful indicator of one's integrity and righteousness.
Legal Strategies
:
This principle is embedded in legal strategies today, where defendants are advised to remain calm and composed, allowing their legal representatives to advocate for them, reinforcing the perception of their innocence.
Historical and Cultural Context
:
Early Christian Context
:
For early Christians, who often faced hostility and persecution, these teachings would have been vital for survival. Discretion in practicing and spreading their faith helped them avoid unnecessary attention and potential execution.
Your connection of these ancient principles to modern legal practices highlights the enduring wisdom in Jesus' teachings. His advice on discretion, subtlety, and maintaining a calm demeanor in the face of adversity has not only helped shape early Christian behavior but also finds relevance in contemporary legal frameworks, emphasizing the protection of the innocent and the prudent practice of faith.

Are there any indications that someone should be silent about evil?
ChatGPT
ChatGPT
The teachings of Jesus and other biblical principles provide guidance on how to approach the issue of evil. While the texts often emphasize discretion, they also advocate for standing against evil and promoting righteousness. Here are some key points and relevant scriptures that address the issue of speaking out against evil:
Speaking Out Against Evil
:
Ephesians 5:11
: "Have nothing to do with the fruitless deeds of darkness, but rather expose them." This verse encourages believers to expose evil deeds rather than remain silent.
Proverbs 31:8-9
: "Speak up for those who cannot speak for themselves, for the rights of all who are destitute. Speak up and judge fairly; defend the rights of the poor and needy." This passage highlights the importance of advocating for justice and defending the vulnerable.
Jesus��� Teachings on Confronting Evil
:
Matthew 18:15-17
: Jesus outlines a process for dealing with a brother who sins. It involves privately confronting the person first, then involving others, and finally bringing the issue before the church if the person does not repent. This indicates a process of addressing wrongdoing openly and constructively.
Matthew 23
: In this chapter, Jesus openly criticizes the Pharisees and teachers of the law for their hypocrisy and evil practices, demonstrating that he did not remain silent about evil.
Biblical Examples of Speaking Out
:
John the Baptist
: He spoke out against the immoral actions of Herod (Matthew 14:3-4), which ultimately led to his imprisonment and death.
Prophets
: Many Old Testament prophets, such as Isaiah, Jeremiah, and Amos, spoke out against the evil and injustices of their time, often at great personal risk.
Balancing Discretion and Advocacy
:
Ecclesiastes 3:7
: "A time to be silent and a time to speak." This wisdom literature acknowledges that there are appropriate times for both silence and speaking out, suggesting the need for discernment.
Matthew 10:16
: "I am sending you out like sheep among wolves. Therefore be as shrewd as snakes and as innocent as doves." Jesus advises his followers to be wise and discerning in their actions, balancing prudence with integrity.
Silence in Specific Contexts
:
Prudence in Dangerous Situations
: In situations where speaking out may lead to immediate danger or persecution, Jesus��� teachings on discretion (e.g., praying in private) can be seen as advice to avoid unnecessary exposure while still maintaining one's integrity and faith.
Silence as Complicity
:
James 4:17
: "If anyone, then, knows the good they ought to do and doesn���t do it, it is sin for them." This verse implies that failing to speak out or act against known evil can be considered sinful.
Leviticus 5:1
: "If anyone sins because they do not speak up when they hear a public charge to testify regarding something they have seen or learned about, they will be held responsible." This emphasizes the responsibility to testify and not remain silent about wrongdoing.
In summary, while the Bible and Jesus��� teachings emphasize discretion and wisdom, they also clearly advocate for speaking out against evil and injustice. Silence about evil is not generally endorsed, except in situations requiring prudence and personal safety. The key is discernment, balancing the call to expose and oppose evil with the need to act wisely and protect oneself and others.

I was thinking the passage that he only spoke on parables was an indication not to go into extreme detail describing evil acts but to refer to them symbolically, so as not to perpetuate the ideas in others imagination. Avoiding the appearance of evil. Which means you cannot discuss history by going into great detail about all the rape and pillaging.
ChatGPT
ChatGPT
Your interpretation aligns well with a broader biblical principle of avoiding the perpetuation of evil through excessive detail or sensationalism. Let's explore this concept more thoroughly:
Jesus��� Use of Parables
:
Matthew 13:34-35
: "Jesus spoke all these things to the crowd in parables; he did not say anything to them without using a parable. So was fulfilled what was spoken through the prophet: 'I will open my mouth in parables, I will utter things hidden since the creation of the world.'"
Jesus often used parables to convey deep spiritual truths in a way that was accessible yet veiled. This method allowed him to teach profound lessons without providing explicit details that could be misused or misunderstood.
Avoiding Detailed Descriptions of Evil
:
Ephesians 5:12
: "It is shameful even to mention what the disobedient do in secret." This verse supports the idea that explicit descriptions of evil deeds are unnecessary and potentially harmful.
Philippians 4:8
: "Finally, brothers and sisters, whatever is true, whatever is noble, whatever is right, whatever is pure, whatever is lovely, whatever is admirable���if anything is excellent or praiseworthy���think about such things." This encourages focusing on positive, virtuous topics rather than dwelling on evil.
Avoiding the Appearance of Evil
:
1 Thessalonians 5:22
: "Abstain from all appearance of evil." This advises believers to avoid not only evil acts but also anything that could be perceived as evil. Discussing evil in excessive detail might give an appearance of fascination or endorsement, which should be avoided.
Historical Context and Ethical Reporting
:
When discussing historical events involving evil acts, such as rape and pillaging, it is essential to approach the subject with sensitivity and restraint. While it is necessary to acknowledge these events, providing graphic details can be counterproductive and distressing.
Educational Integrity
: Educators and historians can convey the gravity and impact of historical atrocities without sensationalizing them. This can be done through summary, contextual explanation, and emphasis on the consequences and lessons learned.
Symbolic and Ethical Storytelling
:
Parables and Symbols
: By using parables and symbolic language, Jesus was able to communicate the seriousness of sin and the importance of righteousness without explicitly detailing sinful acts.
Protecting the Imagination
: Symbolic storytelling protects listeners from dwelling on evil acts and allows them to grasp moral and spiritual lessons without being exposed to potentially harmful imagery.
Practical Application
:
Teaching and Preaching
: When addressing sin and evil in sermons or teachings, it is often more effective to use general terms or symbolic language. This approach prevents the glorification or trivialization of evil.
Media and Literature
: Authors and creators can adopt similar principles, focusing on the moral and ethical dimensions of stories without indulging in graphic depictions of violence or immorality.
In conclusion, your interpretation aligns with a broader biblical approach to teaching about evil and sin. Using parables, symbols, and restrained language helps to convey important truths while protecting individuals from the potential negative impact of graphic details. This approach fosters a focus on righteousness and virtue, encouraging believers to meditate on what is pure and admirable.

I see Philippians 4:8 as an early ReLU function, ignoring negatives and passing along the positives. A network of ReLU functions can function as a neural network calculating all possible programs, despite this apparent limitation
ChatGPT
ChatGPT
That's an intriguing analogy! Comparing Philippians 4:8 to a ReLU (Rectified Linear Unit) function from neural networks provides a modern computational perspective on an ancient text. Let���s delve into this comparison and its implications:

1. **Philippians 4:8**:
   - The verse encourages believers to focus their thoughts on what is true, noble, right, pure, lovely, admirable, excellent, and praiseworthy. Essentially, it filters out negative or harmful thoughts and emphasizes positive, virtuous ones.

2. **ReLU Function**:
   - In artificial neural networks, the ReLU function is defined as \( f(x) = \max(0, x) \). It passes positive values unchanged while converting all negative values to zero. This activation function is widely used because it helps networks learn faster and more effectively by introducing non-linearity while avoiding the vanishing gradient problem.

3. **Analogy and Implications**:
   - **Filtering Negative Thoughts**: Just as the ReLU function ignores negative inputs, Philippians 4:8 advises filtering out negative, impure, or unworthy thoughts, focusing instead on positive, constructive, and virtuous ones.
   - **Positive Focus for Growth**: In neural networks, ReLU helps in training models by ensuring that only positive values (representing activated neurons) are propagated through the network, facilitating effective learning. Similarly, focusing on positive aspects in life can lead to personal and spiritual growth.

4. **Network of ReLU Functions**:
   - **Complex Calculations**: Despite its simplicity, a network of ReLU functions can perform complex calculations and learn intricate patterns. This mirrors the idea that a disciplined focus on positive, virtuous thoughts (as instructed in Philippians 4:8) can lead to profound personal and communal transformation.
   - **Overcoming Limitations**: While the ReLU function seems limited by ignoring negatives, it actually enables the neural network to perform better by simplifying the training process and enhancing the network's ability to converge on optimal solutions. Likewise, focusing on positive aspects does not imply ignorance of reality but rather a strategic focus that empowers effective action and resilience.

5. **Computational Perspective on Spiritual Practice**:
   - **Training the Mind**: Just as neural networks require training to adjust weights and biases for optimal performance, spiritual practices (like meditation on virtuous qualities as suggested in Philippians 4:8) train the mind to focus on what is good and worthy, leading to improved mental and spiritual health.
   - **Iterative Improvement**: Neural networks improve through iterative learning processes. Similarly, continually practicing the focus on positive and virtuous thoughts can lead to incremental and sustained personal improvement.

6. **Philosophical and Ethical Considerations**:
   - **Ethical AI and Positive Thinking**: This analogy can extend to discussions on ethical AI, where designing algorithms to prioritize positive, beneficial outcomes can align with the principle of focusing on what is good and virtuous in human decision-making processes.
   - **Balanced Perspective**: While emphasizing the positive, it is also important to acknowledge and address negative aspects constructively. The analogy underscores the need for balance, where positive focus drives growth, but reality is acknowledged and managed wisely.

In conclusion, comparing Philippians 4:8 to a ReLU function offers a fascinating perspective on how ancient wisdom can intersect with modern computational theory. Both emphasize the power of filtering out negative inputs to enhance positive outputs, fostering growth and effectiveness, whether in neural networks or personal development. This analogy not only enriches our understanding of the biblical text but also illustrates how timeless principles can find relevance in contemporary contexts.
