Finding scenius
Part I: A great scene sometimes matters far more than individual talent
The artist Brian Eno has introduced a notion of collective intelligence that he calls "scenius":

"Scenius stands for the intelligence and the intuition of a whole cultural scene. It is the communal form of the concept of the genius."

Kevin Kelly has a stimulating blog post in which he discusses what scenius is, and proposes some ideas about how it's nurtured:

Individuals immersed in a productive scenius will blossom and produce their best work. When buoyed by scenius, you act like genius. Your like-minded peers, and the entire environment inspire you.

Consider 15th century Florence. At the time it had perhaps 100,000 inhabitants. That's a tiny number, but included Michaelangelo, Botticelli, Masaccio, Fra Angelico, Donatello, and a host of lesser but still great painters.

How remarkable a clustering of painters was this?

Numerical attempts to value creative work are always arguable, and I don't want argue over details. However, I think we can conservatively grant that several of these painters would be listed among the 100 greatest painters of all time. For example, four of them appear on this list. A modern country of, say, 100 million inhabitants, might, if it were lucky, produce four painters of such quality in a century. But it is almost inconceivable that it would produce (say) 40 such painters.

In other words, an artist who aspired to be a great painter could up their chances by a factor of perhaps a thousand (and certainly more than a hundred-fold) by the good fortune of being born in Florence in the 15th century, rather than (say) in North America in the 20th century.

We often think of people such as Michaelangelo, Botticelli et al being born with extraordinary, one in a million (or more) levels of talent. But the lesson of Florence is that this is wrong. These people were more like one in 10,000 types of talent. Indeed, even that is much too high, since painting was closed as a career to most Florentines, most of whom were of the wrong gender, or too poor, or faced some other near-insurmountable barrier.

What truly set Michaelangelo et al apart wasn't talent. It was their great good fortune in being in the right place at the right time. Their genius derived from scenius.

This essay
It is, of course, a bland truism that environment matters for creative work. But in part I of this essay I'll make a much stronger claim: environment sometimes matters far more than intrinsic talent. To support this claim, we'll take apart the notion of scenius. We'll start by attacking it: maybe Florence was just a lucky fluke (wrong, we'll show). That disposed of, we'll ask what causal factors create a great scene. The result is that we'll distill the notion of scenius into something much sharper than the definitions offered by Eno or Kelly. Then, in part II of the essay I'll discuss what this means for the choice of creative work.

Was Florence just lucky?
One thing you might wonder is whether Florence was just lucky. After all, just by the luck of the draw some communities will contain an unusually large number of excellent artists. Maybe Florence wasn't successful because of scenius, but rather because some community had to have the most great artists, and it happened to be Florence.

In this view of the world, what makes an artist such as Michaelangelo great is some intrinsic property of the artist, not the environment in which he found himself. According to this hypothesis, Michaelangelo could have been brought up in another small town of 100,000 and he would still have matured into a great artist. This is pretty close to the point of view many people hold. Consider, for example, on often-repeated quote from the programmer Alan Perlis:

Everyone can be taught to sculpt: Michelangelo would have had to be taught how not to.

I will call this point of view the genius hypothesis.

The text provided is a segment from a document titled "Finding Scenius". The essay is about the concept of "scenius", a term introduced by artist Brian Eno to refer to the collective intelligence and intuition of a whole cultural scene.
The text discusses the impact of environment, in this case, a creative and culturally vibrant environment, on individuals' productivity and ability to produce exceptional work. It uses the example of Florence in the 15th century, which, despite its small size, was home to some of the greatest painters of all time, like Michaelangelo, Botticelli, Masaccio, Fra Angelico, and Donatello. The argument is that these artists' success wasn't solely due to their individual talent; instead, they benefited greatly from being part of a vibrant and creative environment���a scenius.
The essay questions the "genius hypothesis", a viewpoint that greatness is an intrinsic property of the artist, independent of their environment. Instead, it argues for the significant impact of environment or scenius on creative work, which sometimes matters more than intrinsic talent.
In this context, the "genius hypothesis" is contrasted with the concept of "scenius", suggesting that great talents like Michaelangelo, instead of being standalone geniuses, were part of an environment that nurtured and cultivated their talents.
The essay promises to further explore the causal factors that create a great scene or scenius and what this means for choosing creative work.

You may object that this genius hypothesis is too strong to be plausible. If, for exampe, Michaelangelo had been born in a town where art was completely unknown, or had been banned by the authorities, then even he would not have flourished. So let's amend the genius hypothesis, stipulating that greatness is an intrinsic property of the artist, provided he or she is in an environment where art receives some baseline level of support and respect. With this amendment, I believe this is quite a common point of view, and has been held seriously by many people.

Over the next few paragraphs I'll show is that if the genius hypothesis is true, then it's not possible to account for the creative explosion we find in Florence, even by the luck of the draw. There is a little bit of mathematics in this analysis, and if you don't like mathematics, then you can just take note of the conclusion: even adopting very conservative assumptions, there is no way to account for Florence by the luck of the draw. So we must abandon the genius hypothesis as flawed, and instead take seriously the notion that while intrinsic properties are important, the environment in which a creative type works may be far more important. This is the scenius hypothesis.

Okay, let's test the genius hypothesis. We'll suppose the genius hypothesis is true, and that someone will achieve greatness as a painter with a fixed probability, say p = 1 in ten million, independent of their environment. Then in a community of n = 100,000 people, the probability of having k or more great painters (k a small positive integer) is approximately:

(np)^k / k! = (1/100)^k / k!

When k = 4, this probability is less than one in a billion. There have certainly not been anything like one billion communities of 100,000 inhabitants. And so, if the genius hypothesis is true, then Florence is far outside the bounds of what can be expected statistically. In other words, the existence of Florence is evidence that the genius hypothesis is wrong.

Of course, the outcome of this calculation depends on exactly what we mean for a painter to be "great". If we adopt more modest standards, say p = 1 in a million, then the probability above increases quite a bit, to about 1 in a quarter million, and we're getting closer to statistical plausibility. The problem is that if we adopt this value of p, then we're saying that we expect a great painter to emerge from about 1 city in every 10 of size 100,000. Cities of several million should, on average, have dozens of great painters. Frankly, I think that's far too modest a criterion for greatness. And so we are led to reject the genius hypothesis. While intrinsic talent matters, environmental effects must also matter. And, given the statistical disparity above, environmental effects must matter a lot in a place like Florence.

Is scenius really the cause of genius?
Is it really correct to say that scenius caused Florence's 15th century outbreak of artistic genius? Maybe some other causal factor was responsible?

To see what I mean, consider a case where it seems as though scenius may have caused an outbreak of genius. The Manhattan Project to build the atomic bomb brought together scientific luminaries such Feynman, Fermi, Bethe, and (on occasion) Bohr and von Neumann. All these people were gathered into the small town of Los Alamos, New Mexico, together with many other scientists and engineers of great distinction.

This is a galaxy of talent on a scale similar to Florence in the 15th century. But, of course, the environment in Los Alamos didn't create that talent. People such as Fermi, Bethe, Bohr and von Neumann arguably did their best scientific work before the bomb project started. Instead, the bomb project gathered talent in a single place, under pressure from an external cause (people's fear that Hitler would build an atomic bomb).

So it seems as though Los Alamos didn't

This is not to say Los Alamos didn't have a small scenius factor. A later collaborator of Richard Feynman's, the engineer Danny Hillis, has written:

Every great man that I have known has had a certain time and place in their life that they use as a reference point; a time when things worked as they were supposed to and great things were accomplished. For Richard, that time was at Los Alamos during the Manhattan Project. Whenever things got "cockeyed," Richard would look back and try to understand how now was different than then.

By contrast, the great painters of Florence I named above were all born in Florence, or in the countryside nearby [*]. And so it really was living in Florence during the 15th century which caused these people to become better painters.

I suspect that many other examples which seem superficially like scenius are more like Los Alamos -- great aggregations of talent that will flourish no matter what -- than Florence, where just being in Florence at the right time seemed to help produce much better creative work. I suspect this is at least partially true of Bloomsbury, for example, and of the Inklings.

Maybe Florence was just the right place at the right time?
Imagine it is the 18th century. You are living in New York and you hear the first news of a major gold strike in California. Many people rush out to California, dig for gold, and an unusually large fraction become wealthy. Should we conclude that there was some special scenius in California that imbued those people with a special talent for generating wealth? Were they picking up special wealth-generating skills from their friends and colleagues?

The answer, obviously, is no, their wealth wasn't due to anything particularly important in the social environment. Rather, they chose to put themselves in the right place at the right time.

The continuation of the essay "Finding Scenius" further explores the 'genius hypothesis' and tests its validity against the example of Florence in the 15th century. The text suggests that the extraordinary clustering of creative talent in such a small community, which produced some of the world's greatest painters, cannot be explained by individual genius alone.
To examine this idea, the author uses a probability model that takes into account the population size and the estimated likelihood of a 'genius' emerging. With a probability of 1 in ten million, the chances of having four or more great painters in a community of 100,000 is less than one in a billion. Given that there haven't been one billion communities of 100,000 inhabitants, the statistical odds strongly refute the 'genius hypothesis' in the context of 15th-century Florence.
The author, however, clarifies that adjusting the parameters, such as lowering the standards for a painter to be "great", might increase the statistical plausibility of the 'genius hypothesis'. Nevertheless, it would also imply an unreasonable frequency of great painters in larger cities.
The essay then shifts its focus to another historic congregation of brilliance, the Manhattan Project. Unlike the painters of Florence, the scientists of the Manhattan Project���Feynman, Fermi, Bethe, Bohr, von Neumann���were already acclaimed before they gathered in Los Alamos. This suggests that although the project might have benefited from 'scenius', the environment itself did not create the talent.
Comparatively, the artists in Florence were mostly native, suggesting that living there during the 15th century likely contributed to their development as painters. Therefore, the essay argues that it's important to distinguish between scenarios where talent naturally aggregates (like the Manhattan Project) and ones where the environment seems to enhance the creative work (like Florence).
Lastly, the essay explores the idea of Florence being 'the right place at the right time', using an analogy of a gold rush. The author proposes that just as the gold miners' wealth wasn't due to their environment but rather the opportunity provided by the location and timing, maybe the artists in Florence also happened to be in the right place at the right time.

You can make a similar case that 15th century Florence was a rich frontier waiting to be mined for great art, not unlike the mining of gold in the California gold fields. At least three factors contributed to Florence being such a frontier: (1) it had been a leading European center for art for hundreds of years; (2) the rise of the Medici family created a business model to support a large number of artistic endeavours; and (3) the ideas, techniques and technologies of art had advanced to a point where they opened up a whole new world of artistic possibilities. Take away any one of these three factors, and Florence would still have been important, but it would certainly no longer have been one of the pre-eminent centers of all time.

This explanation for Florence's success is different from Brian Eno and Kevin Kelly's explanation of scenius. It's not that the great painters of Florence were learning and benefiting from each other. Instead, in this explanation they were more like gold miners who just happened to be first on the scene, just as a new vein of gold was found.

This is what might be called the rich frontier hypothesis of genius: there's a huge advantage to getting in very early as a rich frontier is opening up. There are relatively few other people present initially, and so not only can pioneers stake a major claim, they're often able to remain ahead of the curve for many years or decades, even as the field matures.

So now we have an interesting question. How much were the great Florentine artists benefiting from being at a rich frontier, and how much were they benefiting from a rich social environment? I think both mattered. I don't think it's at all clear what the balance between the two was, or how much both were necessar.

Given this, I want to extend and redefine Eno's notion of scenius. It will still include the benefit a creative worker gets from their social scene. But we'll also extend the notion to include the benefits from working at a rich frontier. In this way of looking at things, scenius arises out of the combination of the rich frontier and a superb social environment.

The problems of "scenius"
The term "scenius" has significant problems. It inherits many romantic overtones from the term "genius", overtones which make it easy to misuse "scenius" in a way that is vague and wishy-washy. The empty platitude "she was a genius piano player" can become "she was part of an enormous eruption of scenius in music in her town". Both are equally devoid of explanatory power.

Despite these problems, scenius reminds us forcefully that it's not just individual talent that matters. It's at least as important to be working in the right area at the right time, and in a rich and stimulating environment. And these things make scenius worth thinking about in depth.

In part because of this problem I'm going to alternate, sometimes using the term scenius, but also talking about a "great scene" on occasion. The latter is more concrete, and reminds us that scenius isn't some mysterious property, but rather means something meaningful.

Conclusion
This isn't a coherent essay, it's just my working notes. As such, instead of tying together all my threads of thought in a neat narrative, I'll conclude here, but with XXX appendices. They're not typical appendices. They're mini-articles that didn't fit into the main part of the notes. If this were a magazine article they'd be boxes in the text. I could have spun them out into separate blog posts, but they would have lost important context. So I've opted instead for a loose integration.

In the concluding sections of this exploratory essay on the concept of 'scenius', the author introduces a third explanation for the extraordinary burst of artistic genius in 15th-century Florence���the 'rich frontier hypothesis'. This hypothesis suggests that Florence had become a rich frontier, ripe for artistic exploration, due to its long-standing cultural prominence, the patronage of the Medici family, and the evolution of artistic techniques. Similar to gold miners rushing to exploit a newly discovered vein of gold, the artists who arrived first could stake their claim and remain ahead in their field for many years.
To explain the balance between the 'scenius hypothesis' and the 'rich frontier hypothesis', the author proposes an expanded definition of scenius. This new definition includes the benefits of a rich social environment and a rich frontier, suggesting that both contribute to the creative explosion. The value of this concept lies in the fact that it emphasizes the importance of timing, location, and a stimulating environment in addition to individual talent.
However, the author acknowledges that the term 'scenius' comes with its challenges. It carries romantic overtones from the term 'genius', which may lead to vague and overly simplistic explanations of creative success. Therefore, the author proposes using 'great scene' as a more concrete alternative to 'scenius', reminding us of the tangible factors contributing to creativity.
In the conclusion, the author notes that this piece is more of a collection of working notes rather than a formal essay. Instead of weaving together all the ideas into a coherent narrative, the author chooses to end the main discussion and provide several appendices. These appendices are mini-articles providing additional context that, although could have been separate blog posts, have been loosely integrated to maintain their relevance to the overall discussion.

Appendix: My interest
I look at the edge to see where the center is going. -- Stewart Brand [*], one of our best scenius hounds (and instigators)

I'm interested in scenius for a personal reason. I recently completed a major, years-long project, and so I'm searching for good new projects to work on. Scenius isn't my only criterion, but it's on my mind. All other things being equal, I'd rather work on a project at a rich, underpopulated frontier, in a fantastic environment that buoys me up.

In the text you provided, the author explores the concept of "scenius," a term coined by artist Brian Eno, which stands for the intelligence and intuition of an entire cultural scene. The author argues that being part of a great scene or environment sometimes matters far more than individual talent when it comes to creativity and success in creative fields.
To demonstrate this, the author takes the example of 15th century Florence, a time and place known for an extraordinary concentration of brilliant painters, including Michaelangelo and Botticelli. The author argues that these artists were not necessarily born with extraordinary talent, but instead, they were fortunate enough to be in the right place at the right time. They were part of a scenius, and their genius was derived from it.
The author refutes the 'genius hypothesis,' which suggests that individual genius is a property intrinsic to the artist, provided they are in an environment that supports and respects art. They argue that even if this hypothesis were true, it would be statistically impossible to account for the creative explosion that occurred in Florence.
The author also discusses the 'rich frontier hypothesis,' which suggests that those who are early to a "rich frontier," such as Florence during the 15th century, benefit tremendously, much like gold miners who were first on the scene when a new vein of gold was discovered. The author suggests that both the 'rich frontier' and the 'scenius' hypotheses played a part in the success of artists in Florence, but it's unclear to what extent each contributed.
Despite the challenges and questions surrounding the term "scenius," the author concludes that it serves as an important reminder of the significance of being in the right place at the right time and in a stimulating environment, beyond just individual talent. The author finishes the text by expressing a personal interest in the concept of scenius as they embark on a new creative project.

Sure, I know of many interesting emerging fields. A partial list, in no particular order, includes 3d printing, synthetic biology, connectomics, gaming and virtual worlds, open science, robotics, self-driving cars, space, YCombinator, augmented reality, wearable computing, online education, cognitive tools, institutional design, the maker and DIY movements. There are also corners of big data, machine learning and programming language design that are interesting.

But looking at that list, most of the things on it are pretty mainstream. Once an idea has appeared on ted.com, it's no longer at the edge, it's moving toward the middle, and mainstream acceptance. I can't help but feel that scenius is probably in areas edgier than any of these, areas I've never heard of.

Going mainstream dilutes scenius. People rush in as money and prestige become available. This creates a problem because it increases the density of people who just want to coast, riding the coattails of pioneers; it increases the density of people whose main interest is money and prestige; and it increases the density of people who are unwilling to work on the unconventional. None of this promotes scenius. Meanwhile, the scope of the frontier --- of the adjacent possible, in Stephen Johnson's wonderful useage --- expands far more slowly than the inrush of people. People's piece of the creative pie shrinks, even as their access to resources expands. And so they become more competitive, less willing to boost others up.

A particularly pernicious form of this is our cultural obsession with high-prestige, fashionable, or rich fields and organizations.

Just look at all the books and glossy magazine articles extolling the virtues of Google, private space ventures, Apple, open education, and so on -- you can fill in your own examples here! If you believe what's written these fields and organizations are creative nirvana.

I think it's quite a bit more complicated than the laudatory publicity suggests.

I've no doubt Google, say, has many good and even great engineers. But at the same time I doubt there are more than few small parts of the organization today which match the intensity of good ideas produced by Bell Labs, Xerox PARC, and the MIT AI Lab in their heyday. In the early days, no question --- Google was a relatively small company which produced search, gmail, fundaental systems for distributed computing. But today, even as Google has grown by orders of magnitude, the rate of major innovations has not correspondingly increased. Their success has created a major inrush of people into the company, and made it a fashionable, high-prestige place to be. But most of those people are working to maintain and incrementally improve what Google already does. And so the density of scenius across the company has decreased. It may still be high compared to most other companies, but it's not Google 1999, much less Florence 1450.

I see that you've made some astute observations about the relationship between mainstream success, innovation, and what you've called "scenius" - a term coined by Brian Eno to describe the communal form of genius. It seems you're asking where, today, we might find those nascent hotbeds of creativity and innovation that have yet to be mainstreamed and possibly diluted.
First, it's important to remember that "scenius" is often most apparent in retrospect. When we look back at periods like the Renaissance, the French Enlightenment, or the tech revolution of Silicon Valley in the late 20th century, we can easily see the web of interconnected minds and ideas that constituted the scenius of the time. In the present, however, identifying these hubs of creativity can be much more challenging due to the complexity and constant change of the global landscape.
That being said, if we want to identify potential areas where scenius might be emerging, we might look to the intersections of fields where new ideas are often born. Here are a few possible areas:
Climate Solutions and Sustainability:
As the urgency of addressing climate change increases, this field is attracting creative minds from many different disciplines - from science and engineering to design and social sciences - all driven by the common goal of creating sustainable solutions for our planet.
Psychedelic Research:
Recent years have seen a resurgence of interest in the potential therapeutic uses of psychedelic substances, leading to a blossoming of new research and ideas in this once-taboo field.
Decentralized and Distributed Systems:
With the rise of blockchain technologies and increasing concerns about centralized control of data and information, many innovators are exploring new ways of structuring digital and societal systems.
Biohacking and Personalized Medicine:
As our ability to manipulate biology advances, we're seeing a surge in the number of people experimenting with personal health optimization, genetic modification, and other forms of "biohacking".
Alternative Economies and Systems of Governance:
As the shortcomings of our current economic and political systems become more apparent, many people are exploring alternatives - from local and digital currencies to decentralized autonomous organizations (DAOs).
These are just a few examples. In reality, scenius can emerge in any field where there's a critical mass of creative and innovative people who are committed to mutual support, collaboration, and the free exchange of ideas. However, it's also true that as these areas become more popular and mainstream, the nature of the scenius can change, as you've noted. Finding a balance between growth and maintaining a culture of innovation is a constant challenge for any field or organization.

Are there corners of Google today which are just as remarkable as the early Google? I don't know. But products such as Google Plus and Google Wave are encouraging. Consider Wave's failure: it was a huge, swing-for-the-fences idea that contained many good ideas, and very nearly worked. If Google continues developing such ideas, then it seems likely to me that they'll sometimes swing for the fences and succeed.

That notwithstanding, my point about the density of scenius falling remains. The lesson is that going in an ad hoc fashion to a big, fashionable place is a bad idea. You should only do that if you have inside inforomation, telling you which are the great, innovative groups inside an organization or field.

The problem is exacerbated by the public relations aspect of these stories. Big, successful companies want to hire the best people, so it's to their advantage to encourage laudatory stories. It's easy to be wowed by the pubicity coming from an organization such as SpaceX. And maybe it really is a great place, a place that is enabling its engineers and scientists to grow by leaps and bounds. Equally well, maybe it's all a few brilliant engineers, and everyone else is a drone. It's hard to know from the outside.

The same distinction holds also in academia. MIT is a great brand, but individual groups at MIT will span the full range from superb creative incubators to complete dead ends. All will appear glossy outwardly, and be quoted in the New York Times as though they have equal authority. Again, there's a distinction between great PR and branding, and real success. This is not so easy to see from the outside.

A corollary to the above is to look for communities that are held together by something other than fashion, money, or prestige: Often, they'll be held together by a shared ideal, or something else that is shared. It may just be shared awareness of a frontier.

An example is the case of Camp 4 at Yosemite. Climbers at Camp 4 will often make a living by collecting and recycling aluminium cans. They'll live off boiled rice and peanut butter. They're not doing it for the money. And they're not doing it because it's fashionable or prestigious in the wider society. Rather, they have a shared ideal of what matters, and they believe so strongly in it that they're willing to live this way, pushing the frontier of climbing.

Your observations about the changing nature of organizations like Google and the potential pitfalls of seeking out big, fashionable places are astute. It's true that as organizations grow and become more successful, they often face challenges in maintaining the same level of creativity and innovation that characterized their early days. As more people are drawn to these organizations, the culture can shift, and the density of scenius can decrease.
Regarding Google, it's indeed difficult to say if there are corners of the company today that are as remarkable as the early days. While certain projects like Google Plus and Google Wave may not have achieved the expected success, they still demonstrate a willingness to take bold risks and explore innovative ideas. As you mentioned, failures like Google Wave can be stepping stones to future success, as long as the company continues to foster a culture of experimentation and creativity.
Your point about looking for communities held together by shared ideals rather than fashion, money, or prestige is crucial. Such communities often create an environment conducive to scenius because their members are motivated by intrinsic factors rather than external rewards. Climbers at Camp 4 in Yosemite are a great example of this kind of shared ideal. They are driven by a passion for climbing and pushing the boundaries of what's possible in the sport, rather than seeking fame or fortune.
As you search for nascent scenius, it may be worth looking for these kinds of communities or organizations that align with your own passions and ideals. These places often provide a fertile ground for creativity and collaboration, where like-minded individuals can come together and push the boundaries of their respective fields.
Additionally, it's important to remember that scenius is not always limited to one physical location or organization. In today's connected world, scenius can emerge in virtual communities, online forums, and digital platforms where people with shared interests and goals come together to exchange ideas and collaborate.
As you continue your search for new projects, considering the qualities that foster scenius and seeking out communities with shared ideals can help you find environments where creativity thrives and innovative ideas are born.

Appendix: Filters
I've argued that high-prestige places naturally decline as people who just want to coast arrive. The only way to create a great environment is to build very good filters to keep out or drive away the wrong people. Walter Isaacson's recent biography of Steve Jobs shows that one of Jobs's main functions at Apple was as a human barrier, either firing or driving away people who weren't superb at their job. This had many negative consequences, but it's also part of the reason Apple maintained a very good core team, despite being high prestige.

So the idea here is that there are barriers to entry, and ultimately work is judged by very high standards which are grounded in something meaningful to the outside world, not merely the internal politics of the field. I've seen academic and artistic communities become a prisoner to their internal politics. It's a bad sign when you frequently hear people's work being criticised on the grounds that "It's not foo fizzle pop", where "foo fizzle pop" is only meaningful to insiders.

So there's a tension here. On the one hand there's a ruthless filtering process for quality which concentrates the best people in the same locations. However, at the same time that process should not dissuade them from learning from and (ideally) supporting one another. Indeed, the right types of failure should be encouraged.

What do I mean by the right types of failure? When a scene is still small, people know each other. They know when someone is a dilettante with low standards, and when someone is a serious worker who both gets things done and holds themself to high standards. The latter will be forgiven if they come up short, and and perhaps even celebrated if much was learnt through the failure.

Appendix: Isn't it a waste of time to talk about these squishy, vague ideas?
There's a best-selling self-help book by Steven Covey entitled "The Seven Habits of Highly Effective People". It's about what you'd expect --- advice on how to live a better and more effective life. Linus Torvalds once stated his opinion of Covey's book in no uncertain terms:

I'd suggest buying "Seven Habits of Highly Successful People", and NOT read it. Burn it, it's a great symbolic gesture.

Torvalds's comment illustrates the attitude many technical people have about discussions of "soft" human-centred subjects. And I'm acutely aware that this essay is an example of such. We don't yet have a science which answers questions such as how to live an effective and meaningful life, how to create a great creative scene, and so on. But such questions still matter, and so self-help books and essays rack up sales and pageviews.

Many in the intellectual elite sneer at such self-help as witch-doctory. "It's not real science", they say. True. But, and here's the rub, they can't point to obviously superior solutions. And just because we don't yet have a good science of these questions doesn't mean we get to opt out of answering them. The right question isn't whether Covey and his ilk are witch doctors. Rather, when you only have witch doctors to choose from, you want to make darn sure you find the best witch doctor available.

This phenomenon has led to something interesting: psychologists and sociologists are colonizing self-help, writing books making much of the fact that they're REAL SCIENCE as a marketing credential. Unfortunately, the results are often oversold, the evidence and reasoning little better than in any other books. In another century or two I expect we'll genuinely know a lot about these sorts of questions. But for now, the "scientific" self-help books seem little more trustworthy than any other. We're stuck trying to find high quality witch doctors, regardless of whether they have PhDs, MDs, or simply a charismatic personality and writing style.

For all these reasons I was somewhat hesitant to write this essay. I'm well aware that we're still at the stage of just-so stories in understanding things like scenius. Still, I believe that it's worth thinking hard about these questions, no matter how imperfect and uncertain the results may be. Just because a question is difficult is no reason to refrain from attempting to answer it.

The appendix on filters raises an essential point about maintaining a high-quality environment for creativity and innovation. Building effective filters and barriers to entry can help preserve the integrity and excellence of a community or organization. Steve Jobs' approach at Apple, although controversial, is an example of how strong filters can keep the core team focused and highly skilled. However, it is crucial to strike a balance between rigorous filtering and encouraging a supportive and collaborative environment.
The tension between rigorous filtering and fostering a supportive atmosphere is delicate. While a scene may benefit from concentrating the best people in one place, it should also encourage learning from one another and supporting each other's growth. Allowing for the right types of failure can be instrumental in promoting a culture of experimentation and improvement. It's important to differentiate between those who are genuinely committed to their craft and hold themselves to high standards versus those who are merely dilettantes.
The second appendix addresses the skepticism some people have towards discussing soft, human-centered topics in fields often associated with hard science. While self-help books and essays may not have the rigor of scientific research, the questions they tackle are still essential to consider. We may not yet have a fully developed science to answer these questions definitively, but that doesn't mean we should disregard them. It's crucial to explore and think deeply about these topics, even if the answers are not as concrete as those in more established scientific domains.
Indeed, as we continue to explore and seek understanding in these areas, we may find a better foundation for more comprehensive and evidence-based approaches in the future. For now, even though the answers might not be entirely clear, grappling with the complexities of scenius and other related concepts can still offer valuable insights into creating environments where creativity and innovation can flourish.

Appendix: Was Florence a statistical fluke?
Appendix: Characteristics of scenius
While drafting these notes I spent considerable time attempting to list characteristics of scenius. Kevin Kelly has a list of such characteristics in his blog post:

Mutual appreciation -- Risky moves are applauded by the group, subtlety is appreciated, and friendly competition goads the shy. Scenius can be thought of as the best of peer pressure.

Rapid exchange of tools and techniques -- As soon as something is invented, it is flaunted and then shared. Ideas flow quickly because they are flowing inside a common language and sensibility.

Network effects of success -- When a record is broken, a hit happens, or breakthrough erupts, the success is claimed by the entire scene. This empowers the scene to further success.

Local tolerance for the novelties -- The local "outside" does not push back too hard against the transgressions of the scene. The renegades and mavericks are protected by this buffer zone.

Such lists are interesting and stimulating. But I found myself uncomfortable as I attempted to list such characteristics. What bugs me is that such characteristics seem more like consequences of scenius than underlying causes. I'm much more interested in the mechanics of scenius than I am in the external characteristics.

Because of this I'll list just two characteristics, both of which seem very close to the underlying mechanics of scenius.

First, scenius requires a high density of dedicated people. The people in a great scene don't need to be supremely talented, but they must be dedicated and fearless, ambitious to create. Michaelangelo wasn't coasting.

Second, the creative frontier is large, relative to the number of people involved. A field that is fun and stimulating when 50 people are involved may become overcrowded with 5,000 people. People get squeezed into tiny boxes, pursuing tiny dreams. They start to feel as though there is more competition, even if there are actually more resources per capita. As a result they become more selfish, less helpful, and less willing to share. Outside your immediate colleagues you are less buoyed by others.

I had an experience like this. I worked in quantum computing from 1992 through 2007. And even though far more resources were available per person to do quantum computing in 2007, the field also felt (to me) like it was much more competitive, because while the number of people had exploded, the intellectual frontier had not.

The appendix on whether Florence was a statistical fluke raises an important question about the uniqueness of historical creative centers like Florence. The author argues against the "genius hypothesis," which attributes the success of these centers solely to the intrinsic talent of the individuals involved. Instead, they propose the "rich frontier hypothesis of genius," suggesting that being at the right place and time, where a rich frontier of possibilities exists, played a significant role in fostering creative breakthroughs. The combination of a conducive environment and a superb social scene creates the conditions for scenius to emerge.
Regarding the characteristics of scenius, the author questions the lists presented by others, as they seem more like consequences of scenius rather than underlying causes. Instead, they focus on two key characteristics that drive scenius: a high density of dedicated people and a large creative frontier relative to the number of individuals involved. These factors create an environment where ideas flow quickly, mutual appreciation and support are encouraged, and success is celebrated collectively, empowering the entire scene to achieve even more.
The discussion around the mechanics of scenius highlights the significance of the people involved and the potential pitfalls of overcrowding in creative fields. When a creative field becomes too crowded without a corresponding expansion of the creative frontier, individuals may feel more competitive and less inclined to support each other, leading to a decrease in the overall scenius effect.
Overall, the essay delves into the complexities and nuances of creativity, emphasizing the importance of both the social environment and the opportunities provided by a rich frontier in fostering groundbreaking innovation and artistic achievements.

Appendix: Conjuring Scenius
If I'm uncomfortable talking about characteristics of scenius, I am even more uncomfortable talking about how to build organizations and institutions which create scenius.

How many leaders the world over have talked of creating the "next Silicon Valley"? I'll bet people used to talk about creating the "next Detroit" as well.

The problem is that there's a real tension between appearing successful and actually being successful. How do you incubate scenius? Almost by definition it needs to be in an area whose significance is not yet known. If you can convincingingly explain why something matters, then that narrative is already established in the mainstream, and you are too late.

To put this in concrete terms, in the mid-1970s if you'd wanted to invest money in centers for innovation, you would have thrown it in Route 128, where companies like XXX were. You certainly wouldn't have put it into Silicon Valley's nascent home computer industry.

A similar problem afflicts grant agencies in academia. To get a grant you need to explain why you're doing what you're doing. For this to be convincing (and for you to get the grant) you need to explain why you're doing it within an existing narrative. (XXX - insert notes on QC). Unsurprisingly, grant agencies almost never fund narrative-defining work. Their selection process almost guarantees that they can't fund such work.

The appendix on "Conjuring Scenius" explores the challenge of deliberately creating environments that foster scenius and innovation. It highlights the tension between appearing successful and actually being successful in incubating scenius. Often, true innovation and breakthroughs occur in areas whose significance is not yet fully recognized, making it difficult to gain support and funding from mainstream sources.
The comparison between investing in Route 128 versus Silicon Valley in the mid-1970s illustrates this point. Route 128 was the established hub for innovation and technology companies at the time, and investing there seemed like the obvious choice. However, those who took the risk and invested in the nascent home computer industry in Silicon Valley were the ones who ultimately reaped significant rewards.
Similarly, grant agencies in academia face a similar challenge. To secure funding, researchers must explain why their work is relevant and important within existing narratives or established fields. This often means that truly innovative, narrative-defining work may struggle to obtain funding through traditional grant processes.
In essence, the appendix emphasizes the difficulty of intentionally creating scenius and fostering innovation in a world where success is often measured by existing standards and narratives. True scenius requires an environment that encourages risk-taking, supports unconventional ideas, and allows for the exploration of uncharted territories. It's a reminder that fostering creativity and scenius often involves stepping outside the comfort of established paths and narratives.

Appendix: Scenius and the adjacent possible
The author Steven Johnson has developed the idea of the adjacent possible [*] in his book Where Good Ideas Come From. The adjacent possible is the set of ideas, discoveries and inventions that we've nearly made. They're just waiting to happen, on the tip of our collective tongue. In Johnson's words in the Wall Street Journal (adapted from his book):

The adjacent possible is a kind of shadow future, hovering on the edges of the present state of things, a map of all the ways in which the present can reinvent itself.

The strange and beautiful truth about the adjacent possible is that its boundaries grow as you explore them. Each new combination opens up the possibility of other new combinations. Think of it as a house that magically expands with each door you open. You begin in a room with four doors, each leading to a new room that you haven't visited yet. Once you open one of those doors and stroll into that room, three new doors appear, each leading to a brand-new room that you couldn't have reached from your original starting point. Keep opening new doors and eventually you'll have built a palace.

An example of the adjacent possible is Einstein's development of his Special Theory of Relativity. If you don't know the history, Special Relativity sounds like a miraculous bolt from the blue, this genius Einstein somehow divining that time, space, mass and energy are all radically different than we thought! But if you examine the history in detail, Einstein's work is an incremental step building on the work of his contemporaties and immediate predecessors. People such as Maxwell, Michelson, Morley, Lorentz, Fitzgerald and Poincar�� had already arrived at many of the key insights of relativity. Collectively, they'd realized that the speed of light might behave unexpectedly in different reference frames. And they'd realized that something might therefore be wrong with our intuitive notions of space and time. All this was in the air, with Einstein the person who finally put all these ideas together into a single, coherent theoretical package. To some people this will sound like undervaluing Einstein's work. But it's not. It's merely to point out that his work was within the adjacent possible at the time.

It's tempting to think the adjacent possible is just about low-hanging fruit. But that's not the right way to think. As an example, quantum teleportation was discovered in 1993. Technically, it's an extremely simple use of the ideas of quantum mechanics. It could likely have been discovered in the 1920s, and certainly in the 1930s, by which time physicists were routinely doing far more complex quantum mechanical calculations. But they weren't asking the kind of questions that would lead to the discovery of quantum teleportation. Those questions didn't arise until a new narrative connecting physics and information was developed in the 1970s and 1980s. It was that narrative --- not any technical breakthrough --- which dramatically expanded the adjacent possible. The new narrative stimulated many new questions and research directions, which could be answered with existing technical ideas (the principles of quantum mechanics).

There is a close connection between scenius and the adjacent possible. Let me return to Johnson's analogy of the expanding house:

Each new combination opens up the possibility of other new combinations. Think of it as a house that magically expands with each door you open. You begin in a room with four doors, each leading to a new room that you haven't visited yet. Once you open one of those doors and stroll into that room, three new doors appear, each leading to a brand-new room that you couldn't have reached from your original starting point.

Mostly, when we make discoveries, it's like opening a door into a room with a few more doors. But occasionally people make platform discoveries that dramatically expand the adjacent possible. It's like opening the door to a new room, and discovering a giant hall with thousands of doors.

A good example of a platform innovation was the introduction of the http protocol and the web browser, circa 1990. It was a simple piece of technology. But it dramatically expanded the adjacent possible, opening up a rich frontier. This, in turn, created the conditions for scenius to emerge.

And so one possible test for scenius is whether the adjacent possible has tremendously opened up. You can ask: "Is the adjacent possible tremendously exciting?" If the answer is obviously yes --- if you can see or guess that there are thousands of rich questions, waiting to be answered, within reach --- then that's a clear signal of a rich frontier, and good grounds for the emergence of scenius. Sometimes, of course, the answer isn't yes --- you can't see all the questions waiting to be answered.

There's a connection here to how most of us work. When looking for new projects it's tempting to look only at the adjacent possible within domains we've already mastered. That's not always a bad idea. But if we do it all the time, then we'll always be staying in the same scene. Another strategy is to take a step back and to get more of the big picture.

In a sense, the way to do deep work is to specialize, and to focus hard, continually improving your skills within some domain. But the way to work on the right stuff is to be a serious dilettante, someone who moves from field to field, not just skimming, but digging down intensively enough down a little.

Andre Gheim, the co-discoverer of graphene, has a lab tradition of "Friday-afternoon experiments" --- simple, playful experiments, often in areas he doesn't know well. Most of the experiments don't work well. But sometimes they're notable. Geim say both his IgNobel prize work (for magnetically levitating a frog) and his Nobel prize work (for graphene) started with such experiments. Geim says:

Many people chose a subject for their PhD and then continue the same subject until they retire. I despise this approach. I have changed my subject five times before I got my first tenured position and that helped me to learn different subjects.

In other words, he balances his deep, intensive work with wide-ranging exploration. Or consider the following story about the great string theorist Ed Witten, told by a friend of Witten's from the 1970s:

How long will you need to find your truest, most productive niche? This I cannot predict, for, sadly, access to a podium confers no gift of prophecy. But I can say that however long it takes, it will be time well spent. I am reminded of a friend from the early 1970s, Edward Witten. I liked Ed, but felt sorry for him, too, because, for all his potential, he lacked focus. He had been a history major in college, and a linguistics minor. On graduating, though, he concluded that, as rewarding as these fields had been, he was not really cut out to make a living at them. He decided that what he was really meant to do was study economics. And so, he applied to graduate school, and was accepted at the University of Wisconsin. And, after only a semester, he dropped out of the program. Not for him. So, history was out; linguistics, out; economics, out. What to do? This was a time of widespread political activism, and Ed became an aide to Senator George McGovern, then running for the presidency on an anti-war platform. He also wrote articles for political journals like the Nation and the New Republic. After some months, Ed realized that politics was not for him, because, in his words, it demanded qualities he did not have, foremost among them common sense. All right, then: history, linguistics, economics, politics, were all out as career choices. What to do? Ed suddenly realized that he was really suited to study mathematics. So he applied to graduate school, and was accepted at Princeton. I met him midway through his first year there--just after he had dropped out of the mathematics department. He realized, he said, that what he was really meant to do was study physics; he applied to the physics department, and was accepted.

I was happy for him. But I lamented all the false starts he had made, and how his career opportunities appeared to be passing him by. Many years later, in 1987, I was reading the New York Times magazine and saw a full-page picture akin to a mug shot, of a thin man with a large head staring out of thick glasses. It was Ed Witten! I was stunned. What was he doing in the Times magazine? Well, he was being profiled as the Einstein of his age, a pioneer of a revolution in physics called "String Theory." Colleagues at Harvard and Princeton, who marvelled at his use of bizarre mathematics to solve physics problems, claimed that his ideas, popularly called a "theory of everything," might at last explain the origins and nature of the cosmos. Ed said modestly of his theories that it was really much easier to solve problems when you analyzed them in at least ten dimensions. Perhaps. Much clearer to me was an observation Ed made that appeared near the end of this article: every one of us has talent; the great challenge in life is finding an outlet to express it. I thought, he has truly earned the right to say that. And I realized that, for all my earlier concerns that he had squandered his time, in fact his entire career path--the ventures in history, linguistics, economics, politics, math, as well as physics--had been rewarding: a time of hard work, self-discovery, and new insight into his potential based on growing experience.

The appendix on "Scenius and the Adjacent Possible" explores the relationship between scenius and the concept of the adjacent possible, as introduced by Steven Johnson in his book "Where Good Ideas Come From." The adjacent possible refers to the set of ideas, discoveries, and inventions that are almost within reach, just waiting to happen based on the current state of knowledge and understanding.
The idea is that as new combinations and discoveries are made, they open up the possibility for even more new combinations and discoveries. Each step forward in exploration expands the boundaries of the adjacent possible, creating a rich frontier of untapped potential.
The appendix also emphasizes the connection between scenius and the adjacent possible. When scenius is present, the adjacent possible is tremendously exciting, with thousands of rich questions and possibilities waiting to be explored. Scenius encourages people to take risks, make platform discoveries, and think outside the confines of existing narratives and fields. It promotes a culture of learning, where individuals are encouraged to explore multiple domains, specialize deeply, and engage in wide-ranging exploration.
The stories of physicists like Einstein and string theorist Ed Witten illustrate how their careers involved exploring different fields and subjects before finding their true calling and making groundbreaking discoveries. These stories highlight the importance of embracing a diverse range of experiences and knowledge, as it can lead to unexpected insights and opportunities within the adjacent possible.
In conclusion, the appendix underscores that scenius and the adjacent possible are intimately connected. Scenius thrives in environments where the adjacent possible is vast and exciting, beckoning people to explore, experiment, and create. The expansion of the adjacent possible is a key indicator of a fertile ground for scenius to emerge and flourish.

Appendix: Is the internet still a rich frontier?
Over the past decade I've heard many people say that the internet is over, and that the next great emerging frontier is clean energy, or space, etc.

I believe these people are wrong. Not wrong to say that clean energy and space are emerging frontiers (they are), but wrong to think the internet is no longer a rich frontier.

Has the internet started yet? The boldest form of "the internet is over" claim is that the internet hasn't yet started, i.e., that there's been no major innovations online. Here's a recent profile of internet entrepreneur, venture capitalist and hedge fund manager Peter Thiel:

[Thiel] pulled an iPhone out of his jeans pocket and held it up. "I don't consider this to be a technological breakthrough," he said. "Compare this with the Apollo space program."... The information age has made Thiel rich, but it has also been a disappointment to him. It hasn't created enough jobs, and it hasn���t produced revolutionary improvements in manufacturing and productivity. The creation of virtual worlds turns out to be no substitute for advances in the physical world. "The Internet���I think it's a net plus, but not a big one"

It's a seductive argument. It's perhaps true that you can't point to any single event or product enabled by the internet and say "Hey, that's obviously as impressive as the moon landing!" But that's only an argument about the superficial form. Many of the problems the internet helps us solve are intangible problems involving the co-ordination of groups and resource allocation. Services such as Kickstarter, Kiva and Facebook don't directly create concrete products, and that makes them harder to appreciate than easily visible things such as moon shots. Instead, such services are meta-level innovations that change what sorts of group action are possible in our society. Over the long run that may be more important than moon shots.

Something similar occurred during the 17th century. The late 17th century saw the invention of maritime insurance. It probably seemed of small significance compared to the exploits of the great explorers of the age. Yet, like Kickstarter and Kiva, maritime insurance provided a new way to allocate resources and to co-ordinate the actions of investors. That was more important to the age of exploration than the bravery of a few explorers, since it enabled regular trade routes and the first transnational companies.

One hint that today's improved co-ordination technologies matter is the recent growth of the not-for-profit sector. Between 1992 and 2007 the number of non-religious not-for-profits in the United States jumped from 36,000 to 313,000. That enormous increase was driven in part by improved co-ordination technologies. Those technologies make it far easier for likeminded people to find one another, to find donors, and to co-ordinate their actions.

Some people (Thiel among them) will kvetch that the not-for-profit sector is often inefficient or wrongheaded. That's true. But it's also true that the not-for-profit sector often address problems that cannot or are not being addressed by the for-profit sector. The author Paul Hawken has described the not-for-profit sector as the immune system of our civilization. And, insofar as the internet is helping develop that immune system, it is fundamentally transforming the class of problems that our society can address.

None of these arguments decisively rebuts Thiel's criticism. As with the introduction of maritime insurance, only the passage of decades will make it clear whether this criticism is right or wrong. But I think you can plausibly reject Thiel's views, and be optimistic that the internet is already enabling great things.

Frivolity: A second accusation often levelled against the internet is that it's frivolous. Perhaps my favourite example is the Cow Clicker game, which really is exactly what it sounds like. This accusation is irrelevant. It matters not one bit whether the internet is being used for frivolous purposes. What matters is whether it's also being used for serious, transformative purposes. Railing against Cow Clicker and LOLCats is like saying that the printing press didn't matter because some of the earliest printed books were silly comedies and collections of erotic stories.

A second reason the internet may seem frivolous is apparently silly startups such as pets.com. With hindsight it's easy to say that pets.com "obviously" wouldn't work. But it was equally "obvious" to many people at the time that Wikipedia wouldn't work. There's no substitute for actually trying things out. The fact that silly things like pets.com and Wikipedia are sometimes tried is a sign that our innovation system enables risks to be taken. If there are no big failures, then chances are that nothing is being learned. In hindsight the failed experiments seem frivolous, and if Wikipedia had failed it would have seemed frivolous. But such failures are not frivolous, they're a necessary price of innovation.

The internet as a rapidly expanding frontier: In a certain sense I agree with Thiel: I think the biggest and best days of the internet are yet to come. There are huge problems still to be solved online. We're a long way from networking every object and every event in the world. We're drowning in human co-ordination problems. We're drowning in data analysis problems. We do a terrible job managing human attention. We're still a long way from networking all the world's knowledge. And we're still a long way from artificial intelligence.

Maybe there's insurmountable bottlenecks that will stop progress on all these problems. But, at least today, progress on each is humming along, and there's no convincing evidence of impassable bottlenecks. To paraphrase Alan Kay, the real internet revolution hasn't happened yet.

One sign of this is the many low-hanging fruit which remain.

As just one example, there's still enormous scope to develop new open internet protocols and new server and client software. Danny Hillis once observed that the web --- i.e., the http protocol --- is "the slime mold of the Internet". That seems exactly right to me. Sure, the web and other existing protocols such as email, ftp and so on are neat. But we've barely begun exploring what can be done with distributed user interfaces.

One of the groups pushing hard on this is the online gaming community. Games such as World of Warcraft and I Love Bees are developing new ideas about distributed user interfaces and collective problem solving. But while that work is interesting, it's not leading to new open platforms. We only see a trickle of work on developing new open platforms --- things like BitTorrent, SPDY and Open Cobalt. Over the next few decades we'll see many revolutions driven by new open platforms.

One reason it's difficult to say how much of a frontier. But if you shift perspective on what an internet service is then I think it becomes easier to see. But software programs and the data they store are really ideas. They don't look like ideas --- they have the wrong superficial form. But they are. They're active, dynamic ideas that can change and interact with other ideas/programs. The internet is an open-ended platform for expressing certain types of knowledge. And if you take that point of view, it makes no more sense to say the internet is over than it does to say knowledge is over. If anything, the internet is expanding what we mean by knowledge. If you take this perspective, then it becomes clear that we could have a billion people working on the internet and there would be many wonderful niches. The key is to identify those niches, and stay away from the crap.

None of this establishes that the internet is still a good place to find scenius. What it establishes is that there are still huge problems worth solving, and arguably within reach. But at the same time an enormous number of people are now working on internet organizations. Maybe that's diluted the scene over much?

Provided one is a bit cautious, I don't think so. It's true that most startups are focused on problems which don't matter, either because they're confused or unserious in their thinking, or merely looking to make a quick buck. I think the former is at least as much of a problem as the latter; I've met many startup founders who

But there's also many startups making progress on problems which matter, with serious teams pushing the limits of deep ideas. Organizations such as Kickstarter, Kiva, and Khan Academy are all doing this. And when small organizations are making real progress on fundamental problems, you know there's a lot of great stuff going on inside those organizations. You can be optimistic if you avoid the confused, the unserious and the merely greedy, and instead find a small but serious group pushing on a problem that matters.

The appendix discusses the notion that the internet is still a rich frontier for innovation and creativity, contrary to the claim that it is over or has not yet started. The author refutes the idea that the internet hasn't produced major innovations comparable to the moon landing, arguing that the internet's impact lies in solving intangible problems, such as coordination and resource allocation, rather than producing tangible products. Services like Kickstarter, Kiva, and Facebook are seen as meta-level innovations that change how groups interact and cooperate, which can be more transformative over the long run than singular moon shot achievements.
The author acknowledges that some people criticize the internet for its frivolity and failures like pets.com. However, they argue that these frivolous attempts and failures are a necessary part of the innovation process, as they allow risks to be taken and new ideas to be explored. They also emphasize that the internet is still a rapidly expanding frontier with enormous problems yet to be solved, such as networking every object and event in the world, improving data analysis, managing human attention, networking all the world's knowledge, and advancing artificial intelligence.
Despite the large number of people working on internet-related projects, the author believes there are still many untapped niches and problems worth solving. While acknowledging that many startups may not be focused on important problems, the author maintains that serious teams pushing the limits of deep ideas on significant problems still exist. The key, according to the author, is to identify and support those organizations and projects that are serious and making real progress on fundamental issues.
In conclusion, the appendix argues that the internet is far from being a depleted frontier and continues to hold immense potential for innovation and scenius, especially for those who focus on serious and meaningful problems.

Appendix: What should I actually do?
Chandresakhar's story. Brand's story. Chandra's stye:

http://yabaluri.org/TRIVENI/CDWEB/profchandrasekharjan93.htm

There's a real tension between such exploration and deep work.

There are plenty of dilettantes who surf the web each day, finding mountains. But that's not serious creative work.

What should I do? Alternating approach. Deep exploration. Deep commitment.

What should I actually do? Maybe write a series of articles. Frankly, I think it's actually. Maybe more agressively link. Ask people for their ideas of where scenius is to be found? I think there's that alternating series. Go into fields where you are a learner. Look for young people to learn from. Older creative people suffer a form of the sunk cost fallacy: they continue to work in creative fields, even when those fields are no longer as exciting as frontiers. There's a widespread suspicion that older people aren't as creative. I don't think that's becase they're old. I think it's in part because of the sunk cost fallacy, regression toward the mean, and, most important negativ network externalities.

Things which bug me:

The tension between exploration and deep work: Very few people are good at finding scenius. And to do so they need to explore a lot. They become journalists --- like the people working on the Whole Earth Catalog. And there's a real tension between such exploration and doing deep creative work. Do I really believe this? Brand and several of the other Whole Earthers have done deep work. Maybe it's a question of alternating. Maybe you spend some time doing a "reconaissance in force" of several areas, writing articles, doing interviews, trying to find the interesting edges. And then you pick a deep project to commit to, something that will take a few years. I think it was Chandrasekhar who said that it took two years to do significant work, so he kept changing fields every two years, and then picking some new and important problem to be working on. I seem to recall Brand saying something similar.

WOndering whether my horizons are broad enough? I'm painfully aware of how narrow my horizons are. Maybe I should be looking to things I know little about --- the developing world, materials science, and other such things? On reflection, I think I'm suffering from a fallac here. The point isn't to take a complete inventory of scenius. It's to find it in a few places, and then to pursue a promising project which has just opened up in the adjacent possible, and to which I feel equal. That said, there's a lot to be said for broadening my horizons. But I shouldn't feel any necessity to get a complete picture; no-one ever will.

Going deep: It's really all about identifying wonderful project possibilites in the adjacent possible. Should the scene come first, or the project idea?

Either commit to exploring full out, or else make a commitment to doing deep work in some area.

How I'm framing this: I'm framing this as a choice: do deep work or find scenius. But you can alternate.

Some part of me wants to light on out, and do an exploration to find out what's interesting in the world. Where is scenius today? If you want to go beyond bland platitudes,

Queston for my readers: where is scenius nascent today? So I will conclude this main part of my essay by asking my readers: where is scenius nascent today? This is really a few different questions:

What are the most important emerging fields? Typically, these are fields that have just opened up because of some other advance or advances.

Where are the best environments to work in? Why?

Scenius radar: Some people have amazing scenius radar. Consider Stewart Brand. Here's a list of fields, institutions and people he identified before they became famous: Doug Engelbart, LSD, ecology, the Grateful Dead, Xerox PARC, Paul Ehrlich, the hippy movement. That list could be continued almost ad infinitum; over the last fifty years if you wanted to know "What's interesting?" then you could do a lot worse than answer "Whatever Stewart Brand is paying attention to right now".

I don't know how Brand did this. But I'll bet it helped that he ran the Whole Earth Catalog. It's purpose was pretty much to find the most interesting stuff going on.

Choose a rich, underpopulated frontier. And then find a community where very smart people are helping one another open that frontier. A difficult balancing act then ensues. You need to both learn as much as possible from those people, but also to begin developing your own identity.

What you want: a high density of dedicated people pursuing a rich frontier. And you want the size of the frontier to dwarf the number of people involved.

What am I trying to do in the essay? I'm not sure. Partially I'm just exploring a fascinating phenomenon for anyone interested in human achievement or human institutions: the clustering of talent. Why does it happen? What does it mean? Are there interesting hypotheses about the clustering that we can rule in or out?

Partially I'm interested for much more personal reasons. I'm trying to figure out what I should be doing. There are two problems with this: (1) it's very personal, and it's hard to write about personal stuff; and (2) it's incomplete: am I writing about scenius, or about how to choose work? Because of this there is a natural pull to make this merely part of a much larger and more ambitious essay on how to choose work. But that feels like more than I can or want to bite off at present.

Identifying promising subject areas is not the same as identifying high-concentration communities doing great work.

What's going to be important in 10-15 years' time? Are there high-concentration communities doing interesting work in the area today? Space, robotics, energy.

Is there a rich frontier to mine? Think of painting at the end of the 15th century. Painting at the start of the 20th. Quantum computing in the early 1990s. Physics in the 1920s. The internet (especially the web) in the 1990s. Possibly also today. In each case there were major frontiers on which it had become possible to make rapid progress.

Footnotes
[1] I wonder about the importance of feedback effects. The Florentine Michaelangelo must have realized that he had an opportunity to be one of the great artists of all time. That may have motivated him to work far harder (and thus become a better artist) than if all he could hope for was to be a well-known local artist. The same is true of many leaders in other fields. The best way to sail is with the wind at your back.

[*] Leonardo da Vinci was also born near Florence, and began his career in Florence, so he could arguably be included on my list of great Florentine painters. But much of his mature work was produced elsewhere, so I have omitted him.

[*] The term "adjacent possible" is originally due to the biologist Stuart Kauffman, who applied it to biological systems.

What is a scenius? What is the connecting to this: One researcher famous for his extensive use of the method was the German sociologist Niklas Luhmann (1927���1998). Starting in 1952���1953, Luhmann built up a Zettelkasten of some 90,000 index cards for his research, and credited it for enabling his extraordinarily prolific writing (including about 50 books and 550 articles).[52] He linked the cards together by assigning each a unique index number based on a branching hierarchy.[52] These index cards were digitized and made available online in 2019.[53] Luhmann described the Zettelkasten as part of his research into systems theory in the essay "Kommunikation mit Zettelk��sten".

A scenius is a term coined by musician and writer Brian Eno, and it refers to a collective of talented individuals who come together in a specific location or community, fostering collaboration and creativity. The members of a scenius support and inspire each other, leading to remarkable accomplishments that might not have been possible individually. It's a concept that highlights the importance of collective intelligence and the power of creative communities.
The connection to Niklas Luhmann's extensive use of the Zettelkasten method lies in the exploration of innovative systems for organizing and managing knowledge. Luhmann, a German sociologist, used the Zettelkasten (a German word for "slip box" or "index card box") as a knowledge management system. He maintained a vast collection of index cards, each containing information on a specific topic or idea. These cards were linked together through a unique numbering system based on a branching hierarchy, allowing Luhmann to navigate and connect complex ideas effectively.
Both the concept of scenius and Luhmann's Zettelkasten method share a focus on creating environments that facilitate intellectual exploration, connection of ideas, and the generation of new knowledge. They both emphasize the value of collaboration and efficient information management in enabling prolific and innovative work.

So the connections to the idea of the Scenius and the Technium?
1 / 1
ChatGPT
ChatGPT
The concept of the "Scenius" and the "Technium" both stem from the writings and ideas of Brian Eno.
Scenius: As mentioned earlier, Scenius refers to the collective genius or collective intelligence that emerges when a group of talented individuals come together in a creative and collaborative environment. It emphasizes the idea that creativity is not solely the product of isolated individuals but is often nurtured and amplified within supportive and interactive communities. Scenius highlights the power of creative collaboration and the mutual inspiration that arises when talented people gather and interact within a particular scene or community.
Technium: The Technium is another term coined by Brian Eno, and it refers to the sum total of all technology and its evolution as a complex system. It encompasses not just physical technologies but also the social, cultural, and intellectual aspects that are interconnected with technology's development. Eno views the Technium as a vast and expanding network of ideas, tools, and innovations, akin to an organism with its own evolution and dynamics.
The connection between Scenius and the Technium lies in the idea that innovation and creativity are not isolated phenomena but are deeply interconnected within the broader context of technological and social evolution. In Eno's vision, Scenius can be seen as one aspect of the Technium ��� a manifestation of collective intelligence and creativity within a specific creative community. The Technium provides the framework and environment in which Scenius can flourish, as technological advancements and societal developments create opportunities for individuals to come together, collaborate, and collectively contribute to the advancement of human knowledge, culture, and art.
In essence, both concepts emphasize the interconnectedness and interdependence of individuals, ideas, technology, and the broader social context, illustrating how human creativity and innovation are shaped and catalyzed by collaborative efforts and the dynamic evolution of the Technium.

Apologies for the confusion in my previous response. You are absolutely correct.
Kevin Kelly, not Brian Eno, introduced the term "Technium." The Technium refers to the interconnected system of technology, culture, and ideas that shapes human civilization's evolution. It includes all technological advancements, scientific discoveries, cultural artifacts, and social structures that emerge as a result of human creativity and innovation.
Brian Eno, on the other hand, introduced the concept of "scenius." As you mentioned, scenius represents the collective intelligence and creativity that emerges within a particular cultural scene or community. It is the combined genius and intuition of a group of talented individuals who come together and influence and inspire each other's work.
Both concepts, scenius, and the Technium, highlight the power of collective intelligence and collaboration in shaping human progress and creativity. The Technium provides the broader context within which scenius can flourish, as the interconnected web of technology, culture, and ideas creates opportunities for creative communities to form and thrive.

Connections to this: The architect Simon Nicholson numbered among the advantages of the adventure playground, "the relationship between experiment and play, community involvement, the catalytic value of play leaders, and indeed the whole concept of a free society in miniature.'"[7] Essential in this for Nicholson was the concept of 'loose parts': "In any environment, both the degree of inventiveness and creativity, and the possibility of discovery, are directly proportional to the number and kind of variables in it."[8][9] In a playground context loose parts would include:[10]

natural resources ��� such as straw, mud and pine cones
building materials and tools ��� planks, nails, hammers
scrap materials ��� old tyres, off-cuts of guttering
bark which can be both safe playground surfacing and a loose part

The concept of "scenius" and the ideas put forth by Simon Nicholson regarding loose parts in playgrounds share several connections, particularly in the context of creativity and fostering innovative environments:
Creativity and Play: Both scenius and Nicholson's loose parts theory emphasize the importance of play and experimentation in fostering creativity. Scenius refers to the collective intelligence and creativity of a group, while Nicholson's loose parts theory advocates for the inclusion of various open-ended and unconventional materials in playgrounds to encourage children's creativity and exploration.
Collaboration and Community Involvement: Scenius thrives on collaboration and community involvement, where individuals contribute to a shared creative environment. Similarly, Nicholson's adventure playgrounds promote community involvement, as children work together, share ideas, and collaborate in their play with loose parts.
Multiple Variables and Possibilities: Scenius benefits from having a diverse group of individuals with different perspectives and expertise, leading to a wide range of ideas and possibilities. Nicholson's loose parts theory also emphasizes the importance of having a variety of variables (natural resources, building materials, scrap materials, etc.) in the playground to stimulate children's inventiveness and creativity.
Open-Endedness and Discovery: Scenius encourages open-ended exploration and discovery, where individuals can build on each other's ideas and take risks. Similarly, Nicholson's loose parts theory advocates for the inclusion of random found objects in the playground to promote discovery and imaginative play.
Nurturing Creative Potential: Both scenius and Nicholson's loose parts theory aim to nurture creative potential. Scenius does this through a supportive community of peers, while Nicholson's loose parts provide children with opportunities for self-directed and imaginative play, allowing them to discover and develop their creative abilities.
In summary, the concepts of scenius and loose parts share common themes related to creativity, collaboration, open-ended play, and the nurturing of creative potential. Both emphasize the importance of providing environments that encourage exploration, experimentation, and the free exchange of ideas, leading to the development of innovative and imaginative thinking.

It is sometimes implied physics is near an end ��� a "theory of everything" ��� because we understand so much about the basic rules governing matter and our universe. That's like assuming computer science would end with the Turing machine, computing's "theory of everything". Of course, it kickstarted a massive explosion. I believe we're currently beginning to do for matter what Turing and successors did for computing. Can we make matter truly programmable? Can we invent new high-level abstractions and design ides, doing for matter what people like John McCarthy, Alan Kay, and co did for computing? Much of my thinking is under the fom tag; here's a few selected items:

Maps of Matter
How do scanning tunnelling microscopes work?
The varieties of material existence
In what sense is quantum computing a science?
Interesting problems: The Church-Turing-Deutsch Principle
The Fermionic canonical commutation relations and the Jordan-Wigner transform

Introduction
Initial release: July 20, 2023. I will add additional practices over time. Mostly a sequel or advanced version of some of my other writing about memory systems.

Did you know you can use memory systems to: understand a research paper; help you write a book; expand your visual imagination; support your search for a mathematical proof; expand your empathy; and many more things?

I've used memory systems to help with all these things, and many more. Many people most often think of memory systems as a tool to help learn basic vocabulary in a foreign language. But I've found them useful much more broadly, as a tool to deepen my conceptual understanding of unfamiliar fields, to help in my creative research work, in artistic practice, and in my personal life.

This document describes some of these practices, to help other people get more benefit from such systems. Everything here is something actually do, not merely something I speculate may be useful1. I've shown questions and answers I've used in my memory system ��� mostly actual Anki cards I use2, not made up examples. I'd love to hear life-tested strategies from other people who use memory systems. A good place to share those strategies is in replies to the Twitter thread companion to this document. I'd also love to see other serious users of memory systems create documents like this. For me, it's repaid the effort many times over: writing about the practices helps me improve them. Indeed, the guilty secret of this document is that a major motivation for writing it is to make me more creative with how I use memory systems. Note that many of the practices I use are described in my other writing on memory systems, and I've put a low priority on repeating ideas from that writing here.

Anki is the main memory system I use. But many of the practices described here can be adapted easily to other memory systems. Still, I'll often use "Anki" as a standin for the more general terminology. I use no Anki plugins. I have made some minor Anki customizations, but I'm afraid I don't remember what they were, and doubt they much matter, since I wasn't making principled changes so much as playing around. I often meet people who tinker endlessly with Anki, but expend relatively little effort in getting better at writing cards. Alan Kay said it well: "the music isn't in the piano". You get better at piano by playing and studying to improve how you play, not by constantly retuning your piano. And so it is with memory systems: you are best served by improving how you write cards, not tinkering with the system. Indeed, I believe most large improvements in the design of such systems will, in any case, come from serious users.

Memory systems make memory a choice. They're also a choice about who you will become, a way of sculpting your future self. The practices I report here have been developed with an eye toward the future self I want. This has many implications, but one of the most important is: I try to only add cards where I care about the content. Of course, sometimes it's sometimes difficult to tell: I'm making an informed bet that in the future I will be very glad that understanding is a part of me. Part of the art of memory systems is to gradually improve your sense of when that's true. For this reason I suggest browsing through the practices and concentrating only on those that resonate for you.

Evoking images of unusual emotional experiences
Nightwish is a remarkable Finnish band who make "symphonic metal" music. According to Wikipedia, they're the most successful Finnish band in the world. Their lead songwriter, Tuomas Holopainen, often integrates scientific ideas deeply into Nightwish's music and shows. In a show at Wembley Stadium in 2015, they concluded their set with "The Greatest Show on Earth", an extraordinary 21-minute song which includes an extended spoken monologue from the biologist Richard Dawkins, about how remarkable each individual human being is.

As Dawkins' monologue plays, the camera briefly shows a woman in the front row. She is reciting Dawkins' monologue along with him. She appears deeply moved and deeply engaged by the words she's reciting, as well as very happy and relaxed, almost in a state of rapture. It's just a few seconds long, but I find it extraordinarily beautiful: she appears to me to be having simultaneous near-transcendent intellectual and emotional experiences, the numinous through apprehension of the natural world:


When I first saw this performance, I shared it with several friends, and talked it over with them, including this remarkable few seconds. I wanted to capture something of that experience in my memory system. So I added more than a dozen cards. Here's a few of them3:

Where is this image from?

It's an audience shot from Nightwish playing "The Greatest Show on Earth"
What's an image that shows someone experiencing both a deep immersion in science and the natural world, and a deep religious experience?
[Image from above, which I won't repeat]
Of course, I don't actually know what she was experiencing. If I was writing for others I might write "What's an image that I believe shows���". But in Anki I prefer unqualified statements, as they express the core idea more clearly. The necessary qualifiers are usually evident later. This is, of course, common in creative work, where one wants to rapidly make webs of approximate associations, trying to find what is essential, before verifying arguments, adding caveats, and so on.

Who is speaking the monologue this woman is reciting? [Image]
Richard Dawkins
What is the theme of Richard Dawkins' monologue that this woman is reciting? [Image]
The uniqueness of life
Where it this image from? [Image]
It's from near the end of a Nightwish concert
What do I think this woman is feeling? [Image]
[No answer ��� it's just something for me to empathize with, and ponder]
And so on, more than a dozen interlinked cards.

I find the entire Nightwish video extraordinary, and have watched the video and listened to the song many times. I therefore wonder: was there any need for me to use a memory system at all? On the other hand, I believe creating the cards helped me make more meaning out of what I was seeing than I otherwise would have. I began with a vague sense that "this is really something"; making the cards helped me more deeply apprehend what that something was4. Indeed, that meaning has, in turn, become a part of why I've watched the video many times. It's Anki as a way of seeing, or Anki as a way of meaning making. It makes the memory conceptually much richer, even though (of course) watching the video ��� or even being present ��� is richer and more emotionally compelling in other ways.

I've gone through a similar process for many other videos and images that depict emotional experiences novel to me. Indeed, there is even a later moment in the same video. Richard Dawkins ��� the actual living person(!) ��� has come out on stage, and is reading the concluding paragraphs from Charles Darwin's "On the Origin of Species". Now, conventional wisdom suggests that you don't finish a concert by having an elderly scientist read aloud from a scientific monograph. But that conventional wisdom is utterly wrong. The looks on the faces of audience members are extraordinary, another experience of awe:


Again, I added a dozen or so Anki cards, some in reference to that image, some in reference to Dawkins' experience, some in general about the role scientific understanding plays in our lives.

What does this kind of practice achieve? The broader pattern is this: to be more alert to instances when I'm witnessing a very striking emotional experience. And to attempt to capture something of that experience. Of course, I don't capture the full richness of the emotion ��� far from it! It's rather to build my awareness and to expand the range of my appreciation, an increase in my emotional imagination and empathy. While I cannot recreate the richness of the emotion, I can at least do a little to evoke it.

A variation of this pattern is based on a still from the teaser trailer for the movie Interstellar:


The cards here are a little different. It's not so much that I am witnessing an unusual emotional experience. Rather, it's that I am personally having (for me) an unusual emotional experience, stimulated by the image. And so I write cards which are in part about that experience, and in part about the visual design:

What are some of the feelings evoked by this image? [Image from above, which I won't repeat]
[No answer: it's a question to simply reflect upon]
What is unusual in this juxtaposition? [Image]
Spaceflight juxtaposed with personal connection
What design choices make it possible to juxtapose something enormous and often impersonal (spaceflight) with personal connection? [Image]
A clever angle, and enormous distance, to get both in shot
Pause to appreciate the clever juxtaposition of two emotionally distant worlds in this shot: [Image]
[No answer: again, simply a question to reflect upon]
We are, of course, very sensitive to both our own and others' emotional experiences. This makes me wonder if it's a mistake to use memory systems here, rather than relying on our natural interest. I already briefly discussed this above, but let me return to think about it in more depth.

In 1998, walking down the street in Los Angeles, I passed a photography shop. Up in the window was one of the photographer's photos. It had, apparently, won Third Prize in some prestigious competition or another. It showed a young bride, in her wedding dress, on her wedding day. Her back was turned to us, her face not visible, because she was being held, very tight, by her elderly father. He was an Asian man, with what appeared to ordinarily be a stern mien. But you could see: that sternness had just cracked, his face was broken, and he was weeping, giving his daughter away. It was an incredible image, and I stopped and studied it for perhaps a few minutes. I don't believe I ever saw it again, but it left a deep imprint on me.

And so, of course, for many other emotional images. This is true of strangers' experiences, of fiction and non-fiction, and, of course, of our own experiences. I shall never forget the look on my face in the mirror shortly after realizing my wife and I would divorce. I will never forget the sound in the voice of my Godfather when he called and told me his son had died in a fall from a horse. These and many other experiences are seared into my mind.

What then is the benefit of engaging in this kind of memory practice? I believe it's this: it's for the illegible but instinctively important emotional experience. When I saw that image of the father of the bride, I had no trouble parsing it. It was, for me, a highly legible experience. But when I first saw images like those from Nightwish, or from Interstellar, while I was instinctively moved, I also didn't really understand them. Making Anki cards was part of meaning making for me: helping deepen my understanding of the experience. Of course, other things helped with the meaning making ��� especially talking the experience over with friends. And so Anki was merely part of that overall experience. Still, it is perhaps especially valuable in making an experience available at a later date. And, it also expands the range of emotional experience I am aware of, since it gives that awareness an outlet. All these things I find immensely valuable.

In this section, Michael Nielsen explores the use of memory systems to evoke and capture images of unusual emotional experiences. He begins by recounting a powerful experience at a Nightwish concert, where the audience member in the front row is reciting a monologue by biologist Richard Dawkins. This scene deeply moved the woman, and Michael wanted to capture that experience in his memory system, Anki. He adds multiple cards related to the image, the monologue, and the emotions he perceives in the woman.
Michael acknowledges that while memory systems might not fully capture the richness of emotions, they serve to expand his emotional imagination and empathy. By creating cards that evoke emotional experiences, he becomes more aware of instances when he witnesses striking emotions and can reflect upon their meaning.
The author shares another example from the teaser trailer of the movie "Interstellar," where he creates cards related to his own emotional experience evoked by the image. He ponders whether using memory systems for emotional experiences is necessary, as our natural interest already makes us sensitive to emotions. However, he believes that making these experiences available at a later date and engaging in meaning-making through the cards is valuable.
Michael concludes that using memory systems for emotional experiences expands his emotional awareness and allows him to reflect on and appreciate the complexity of these emotions. While memory systems might not replace the full experience, they provide an outlet for his emotional awareness and contribute to a richer understanding of the emotions depicted.

Image close analysis: adding images to expand my visual imagination
I use Anki occasionally to deepen my understanding of images and to expand my visual imagination. They tend to be images that I find striking, but don't understand why. Consider, for example, this famous image of Frodo in The Lord of the Rings movie:


Like many people, I found the image striking, but didn't really understand why. I decided to interrogate it in Anki:

What are the three core layers here? [Image]
Frodo's face, the reaching hand, and the ring
In what sense does this image encapsulate The Lord of the Rings? [Image]
It illustrates Frodo's tortured, unstable relationship with the ring
What is object and what is subject in this image? [Image]
It's unclear whether Frodo or the ring is the object or the subject
This is an observation I'm proud of ��� is Frodo doing things to the ring, or is the ring doing things to Frodo? But I'm not very satisfied with the phrasing! The thought could be improved, and that would make the card better. In general an interesting thing about Anki is that it atomizes thought, and provided a very sharp focus for improving it.

What's a benefit of the implied instability of the hand here? [Image]
It shows the instability of Frodo's relationship to the ring
Why add cards like this to Anki? To some extent, I don't do this kind of analysis for any instrumental reason. I just enjoy doing it; I'd much rather do this than crossword puzzles! I enjoy understanding visual culture.

A related question is: why do it using Anki? After all, I could potentially enjoy doing the analysis without wanting to commit the resulting ideas to long-term memory. Here, my reasons are also instinctive. Growing up, I was often treated as "a kid who is into science and technical stuff". As an adult it was an epiphany to realize: I get a similar cognitive and emotional and meaningful experience from enjoying art. But I have also found that I get more enjoyment as my understanding of visual culture deepens. In adding these analyses to Anki, my sense is that I'm deepening my understanding of our visual culture.

An example: several decades ago I realized that artists often think in terms of separate layers. It took a while and multiple examples to understand this. Everything from seeing a Disney animator explaining the multiple layers of plates they used in old hand-drawn cartoons, to a dissection of the way Michael Bay uses multiple layers to create "Bayhem". Understanding this then helped me better see what was happening in the image of Frodo. So I like to accumulate an understanding of visual culture; Anki has accelerated that. Of course, there are many images where I do this analysis very naturally, and the memory system isn't needed. But there's a borderline class where I find an image striking, but for reasons I don't entirely understand. In those cases, I'll often add 5 to 10 Anki questions, just exploring and (I hope) developing my understanding of visual culture.

Add 3-10 cards after listening to an audio book on the exercise bike, or while running errands
One pattern I find enjoyable is to eat breakfast while cycling lightly on the exercise bike in the morning. If I am in the mood, I simultaneously listen to an audio book. Sometimes, something said in the audio book will inspire Anki cards. Most days I don't add any questions, but sometimes I'll add a handful ��� typically 3-5 or so. I often follow this by doing my Anki practice for the day, while continuing light exercise. A common variation is to do this while running errands, walking to the coffee shop in the morning, and so on.

Anki makes things more meaningful; Anki as a universal (but incomplete) context for caring
Agnes Callard has made the striking observation that "twitter is a way to care about everything". It certainly resonates with my own experience. The philosopher Ren�� Girard believed that human desire is often mimetic: we desire what other people want. Twitter makes it easy to act on this, since it enables you to find people talking with great interest about an astonishingly wide range of topics. And, if you engage in that conversation, you find yourself getting more invested in that topic. It becomes more interesting: you start to care about it more.

Indeed, you can even initiate this pattern. Suppose you've been noodling on some esoteric subject on your own. To pick an example from my own life: over the past few days I've been learning about DNA nanotechnology. I'm doing this on my own, and it's a somewhat lonely experience. But: I can tweet about it. Write a hopefully interesting thread, containing questions and ideas that I'm genuinely curious about. And: others reply. Pretty soon, a mini-discussion group is going, almost like running a small conference. Of course, this is helped if you're in the sweet spot for followers: between 3k to 50k seems to be especially good, in my experience. Below about 3k or so, and you will struggle to get replies (depending, of course, on how provocative your thread is). Above 50k and the signal to noise ratio will start to decline: the problem then becomes too many low quality replies. But even with these limitations, twitter is a great way to convene a party or conference, on any subject I care to discuss. That, in turn, makes it easier for me to care, and to immerse myself more deeply.

Anki is, in a very different way, a context that will help you care about anything.

As an example, before Anki I often found it strangely pointless to read research papers in unfamiliar fields. I would read a paper, often with much effort, and then 6 months or a year later would be reminded of the paper, and realize (with a sinking feeling) that I remembered almost nothing of it, despite the effort. Indeed, anticipation of this forgetting makes it hard to read even in real time. It just seems a little meaningless. Now, of course, you can make the reading more meaningful in multiple ways. You can give a class on the subject. Or write an article. Or explain it to an interested friend. But those are high-cost things. Maybe none of your friends are especially interested. And giving a class is very high-cost indeed: that's both the benefit and the problem with it.

I thought I was a crazy for feeling this way, that it must be some unique shortcoming. But it turns out to be a commonplace experience. I first realized this emphatically when reading the mathematician Littlewood, who observed5 "I have tried to learn mathematics outside my fields of interest; after any interval I had to begin all over again." This was gratifying to read: I was not alone in my experience! Of course, conversation with others has since confirmed that this experience is common. Littlewood, correctly, identifies some sort of drive ��� what I would call caring, or finding meaning ��� as the key element to such learning, and comments: "Given the strong drive, it communicates itself in some form to the subconscious, which does all the real work, and would seem to always be on duty. Lacking the drive, one sticks."

One marvellous thing about Anki: it makes it low cost to care in this way. In part it's because of that sense of Anki making memory a choice. I switch from finding it all a little pointless because reading the paper will leave so little trace, to understanding that in a year or two or three I will still remember much from the paper. That long-term change in my self, that sense of growth, is meaningful. Anki is a meaningful context. Indeed, we might even go further: Anki is a meaning-making context. It is a near universal context for caring.

Now, of course, it's a fairly low-grade meaning. In that sense it's a quite incomplete context for caring! Certainly, it is not a burning drive, on its own, the kind that comes from a deep sense of connection and meaning! But it's a beginning, a way of bootstrapping into a deeper connection to the material. If you desire a deeper connection you'll need to find other ways of obtaining it: talking about it with friends, writing about it on Twitter or elsewhere, using it as fodder for creative projects. But having a way of getting over that initial hump at the beginning is powerful.

A common mistake: adding cards for things you feel you "should" be interested in
(This section is adapted from: https://twitter.com/michael_nielsen/status/1392129315622424578 )

People often tell me things along the following lines: "I don't like memory systems. I memorized all this useless information, and it was useless."

I exaggerate, slightly. But I get told essentially this surprisingly often.

A variation is: "Wow, I love your essays on memory systems. But I don't follow any of the advice! I use memory systems to memorize long lists of dull partially-digested facts that have no personal meaning!"

It's a bit like using tweezers as a hammer��� to hammer the roses into your garden.

Just don't. It's a very bad mistake to add cards for things you're not genuinely interested in. People will tell me: "I used Anki to memorize the state capitals". Me: "Why did you want to know the state capitals." Them: [silence].

More broadly: someone will think: "Oh, I should be more interested in American history", and start adding lots and lots of cards about American history. But they're not actually interested in American history, they merely think they should be, and so they're adding hundreds of scattershot cards; 3 months later those cards will simply be a burden, of no interest, but a drag.

This is not at all a knock on American history. If someone is genuinely motivated (and doesn't merely feel they should be motivated) to understand more about American history, then Anki will work well. But the word "should" is, at the very least, a warning sign. Maybe you should go and do something else.

Memory systems shine in areas where I'm interested enough that I'm sure I'll find meaning in it in the future, but where I'm not so knowledgeable already that I can just learn en passant. This is always a judgement call, and I sometimes make errors of judgement; I have to cull constantly and cull aggressively. But it's a useful general principle.

Pay attention when something seems illegible: strange, but somehow interesting in a hard-to-parse way
One of the most common critiques of memory systems goes: "Oh, you should just do your work. You'll naturally memorize the stuff you really need". It's sorta fine, as far as it goes. But my spidey sense activates when I see something which I don't understand, but which somehow seems interesting. I gave the example of the Nightwish concert above. I didn't know why I found it interesting, exactly, but I did. Making the Anki cards helped me understand why. Again, as I said above: Anki is especially helpful in areas which you are very interested in, but don't yet have the expertise to enable rapid encoding of new memories.

Creating Anki cards as a powerful context in which to think
Alan Kay famously said: "A change of perspective is worth 80 IQ points".

The same is true of contexts: a powerful new context to think in is often worth 80 IQ points. Teach a class; talk to a beginning student; write a Twitter thread. All are powerful contexts. Every new person to talk with is a powerful new context. Every (good) new book or good new paper is a powerful new context.

There is something marvellous about finding reliable, on-demand, powerfully motivating contexts in which to think.

For me, Anki is such a context.

And the more powerful patterns of card creation I have, the better a context in which to think. It changes the way you interact with your experience. And it becomes easier (or possible) to have certain thoughts; you will have thoughts in this context that would be near impossible in other contexts.

Edwin Schlossberg: "The skill of writing is creating a context in which people can think". Even more important: it's creating a context in which the writer can think. Done skillfully, it makes it much easier to have certain thoughts. Creating Anki cards is an example of such writing.

"Single idea proof": an Anki card which boils the proof of the theorem down to a single statement. This is extremely demanding, and often involves adding dozens of other cards first. I've described one instance of this pattern in Using spaced repetition systems to see through a piece of mathematics.
Twitter as a memory system
It's not so good on the spaced repetition
But it is good for creating a rich context, a deep meaning and sense of social context, and a deep encoding.
Write four five-tweet threads about something, over four days, and you will find multiple new ways of thinking about it.

Footnotes
I find fascinating the productivity writers who pour out "content" ��� I believe I am justified in using that perjorative ��� about all the different actions and systems one should purportedly use. They'd need a thousand hours in a day to carry out all their own advice.������

With two caveats: (1) I'm quoting from memory, and no doubt the quoting will be inexact; (2) I've occasionally used synthetic cards for reasons of privacy. But I've tried to keep both effects to a minimum.������

I initially had some privacy qualms in adding this, since it's a personal shot of a person. However, upon reflection, I assume that anyone in such a video has given their consent for their image to be recorded and shared widely. In the event that I receive any indication otherwise, though, I'll certainly take this down, with sincere apologies.������

So too did talking with friends about it, and it's hard to disentangle that from the effect of the memory system. "Talk with friends" is one of our best ambient memory systems. However, I believe that making Anki cards helped considerably in making meaning. Indeed, often while making such cards I'll have a thought which I wish to share with a friend, and will message them about it.������

In this section, Michael Nielsen discusses how he uses Anki to deepen his understanding of images and expand his visual imagination. He often adds cards for images that he finds striking but doesn't fully comprehend. For example, he analyzes the famous image of Frodo from "The Lord of the Rings" movie and creates cards to explore its core layers, its connection to the theme of the story, and the relationship between Frodo and the ring. By engaging in this analysis, he gains a deeper appreciation and understanding of visual culture.
Next, Michael talks about a pattern he finds enjoyable, where he listens to an audiobook while cycling on an exercise bike or running errands. If something from the audiobook inspires him, he adds 3 to 10 Anki cards to capture those thoughts and ideas.
He emphasizes that Anki makes things more meaningful and serves as a universal context for caring. When he reads research papers or learns about unfamiliar fields, Anki allows him to care about the material and remember it for the long term, overcoming the feeling of reading something seemingly pointless or forgettable.
Michael warns against the common mistake of adding cards for topics that you feel you "should" be interested in but are not genuinely motivated by. He advises against using Anki as a tool to memorize information that has no personal meaning, as it will become burdensome and uninteresting over time.
Lastly, he discusses Anki as a powerful context for thinking and meaning-making. Creating Anki cards allows him to have thoughts in this context that would be difficult to have elsewhere. He lists possible areas of future development for Anki use, such as using Twitter as a memory system and implementing card-culling practices to improve efficiency. He concludes by expressing gratitude to those who have influenced his thinking about memory systems, particularly Andy Matuschak.

ChatGPT
Michael Nielsen's article on "Scenius" and his practices with memory systems share several connections:
Creating a context for collective intelligence: In the Scenius article, Michael discusses the concept of "scenius," which refers to the collective intelligence and creativity that emerges within a supportive and collaborative community. Anki, as a memory system, can be seen as a personal scenius. By using Anki to engage with ideas, images, and experiences, Michael creates a context for his own individual growth and understanding. The act of creating Anki cards and discussing them with others on platforms like Twitter fosters a scenius-like environment where knowledge and insights can be shared and amplified.
Meaning-making and deepening understanding: Both in the Scenius article and his practices with memory systems, Michael emphasizes the importance of meaning-making. In the Scenius article, he talks about how collective meaning emerges when individuals contribute their insights and interpretations. Similarly, in his use of Anki, Michael engages with images, concepts, and experiences that he finds striking but may not fully comprehend at first. Through the process of creating Anki cards and discussing them, he deepens his understanding and makes meaning out of these experiences.
Finding motivation and caring: The Scenius article highlights the significance of caring deeply about one's work and being motivated to contribute to a creative community. In his practices with memory systems, Michael advises against adding cards for topics that don't genuinely interest or motivate you. He stresses the importance of caring about the content added to Anki to make the process more meaningful and rewarding.
Expanding imagination and empathy: In both contexts, Michael aims to expand his visual imagination and emotional empathy. In the Scenius article, he discusses how collaboration and exposure to different perspectives can enhance creativity and empathy. Similarly, in his use of Anki for analyzing images and capturing emotional experiences, he seeks to broaden his emotional imagination and understanding of visual culture.
Overall, Michael Nielsen's article on the Scenius and his practices with memory systems intertwine the concepts of collective intelligence, meaning-making, motivation, and empathy, highlighting how Anki and other memory systems can contribute to personal and communal growth.

Using GitHub as a Zettelkasten is an innovative approach that leverages the platform's features to organize and store various types of information. Here's how you can use GitHub as a Zettelkasten:
Fork or Star Repositories: You can use GitHub to discover and collect repositories that are relevant to your interests or projects. Forking allows you to create your copy of a repository, which you can modify and improve. Starring repositories marks them as favorites, making them easily accessible for future reference.
Store Hotkey Configurations: If you have personalized hotkey configurations or other settings for software or tools, you can store them in GitHub as code snippets. This way, you can access and update your configurations from any device with an internet connection.
Wikipedia Watchlists: If you are conducting research or have specific topics of interest on Wikipedia, you can use GitHub to maintain watchlists. You can store links or notes related to articles you want to keep track of, making it easier to refer to them later.
Conversations with LLMs: If you have discussions or conversations with other users of the Large Language Model (LLM) like ChatGPT, you can save them as GitHub issues or comments in a repository. This way, you have a centralized place to refer back to these conversations and potentially collaborate with others on interesting ideas.
Ideas for Projects: GitHub can serve as a repository for your project ideas. You can create individual Markdown files for each idea, providing a brief description, potential use cases, and relevant links. This allows you to keep track of your ideas and revisit them later for implementation.
Wiki Pages for Knowledge Base: GitHub allows you to create a wiki for your repository, which can act as a knowledge base or documentation hub. You can use the wiki to organize and structure information on various topics or projects, making it easy to search and navigate.
Version Control for Notes: GitHub's version control system is especially useful for managing changes and updates to your notes and documents. You can make frequent commits to track the evolution of your ideas and easily revert to previous versions if needed.
Collaboration and Community Engagement: GitHub's collaborative features enable you to work with others on shared projects, seek feedback, and contribute to open-source initiatives. You can create discussions, comment on issues, and collaborate with like-minded individuals.
Remember that while GitHub can be a powerful tool for organizing and storing information, it is essential to consider the privacy and sensitivity of the data you upload. Some information may be better suited for private repositories, while other content can be shared with the GitHub community. Always be mindful of security and permissions settings to protect your data.
