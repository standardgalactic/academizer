Science Agents in Active InferenceOpen sidebarScience Agents in Active InferenceModel: Default (GPT-3.5)Summarize: the  foundation of the idea of active  inference oh  any system  is that persists through time  uh does so by making sure that it  doesn't dissolve into its environment  what does that mean it means it it  persists Through Time by maintaining the  Integrity of its Markov blanket or the  Integrity of its boundary  so this of course is just a tautology  but it's a very it's a very interesting  and very productive tautology  because it says that any System is using  the information it gets on its boundary  from its environment to build a model of  how its environment behaves  and then  it uses that model to act back on its  environment to test and refine its model  and again as popper to told us this is  just what science is  so what the free energy principle really  tells us is that all systems are agents  that are doing science all the time  so physics is effectively uh not just  the study of communication  but it's the study of uh agents doing  science with each other pairs of agents  who are trying to figure each other out  by their communication and communicative  exchanges.1 / 1ChatGPTChatGPTThe idea of active inference posits that any system which persists over time does so by preventing its dissolution into its environment. This concept implies that a system endures by preserving the integrity of its "Markov blanket," which is essentially the system's boundary or interface with its environment.The system uses the information it receives through this boundary from its environment to create a model of how the environment behaves. It then uses this model to interact with the environment, testing and refining the model in the process. This process of model testing and refinement is akin to the scientific method, as described by the philosopher Karl Popper.In essence, the Free Energy Principle suggests that all systems are like agents continuously engaging in scientific exploration. Therefore, physics is not just about studying communication but is also about studying how these agents (systems) conduct scientific exploration through communication with each other. The systems are trying to figure each other out through their communicative exchanges.1 / 1This reminds me of theory-theory, child-scientist theory, and Bayesian brain hypothesis.1 / 1ChatGPTChatGPTIndeed, the concepts you've mentioned are related to the idea of active inference. Here's a brief explanation of each:Theory-Theory: This is the idea that children develop and revise their understanding of the world much like scientists. They formulate hypotheses (or "theories") about the world, test them against new observations, and adjust them as needed based on the evidence they gather. This is similar to active inference in that it involves an ongoing interaction with and adaptation to the environment.Child-Scientist Theory: This is closely related to theory-theory, emphasizing the idea that children learn in a way that resembles the scientific method. Children, like little scientists, make observations, form theories, make predictions based on those theories, and then test their predictions.Bayesian Brain Hypothesis: This hypothesis suggests that the brain functions based on principles similar to those of Bayesian statistics. It constantly updates its model of the world by weighing new information against its existing beliefs, which is a form of "Bayesian inference". This mirrors the active inference principle where the system (in this case, the brain) constantly refines its model of the environment based on new information received.So, all these theories converge on the idea that entities (be they children or broader cognitive systems like the brain) are continuously engaging in a process of hypothesis testing and model updating based on their interactions with their environment.1 / 1I am also reminded of the origins of object oriented programming in message-passing languages like Smalltalk1 / 1ChatGPTChatGPTIndeed, the idea of active inference and object-oriented programming (OOP) in message-passing languages like Smalltalk do share some conceptual similarities. Here's how:Objects as Systems: In OOP, objects can be seen as "systems" with their own state and behavior, which is similar to how systems are conceptualized in active inference.Message Passing as Communication: In Smalltalk and other message-passing languages, objects communicate by sending and receiving messages, much like systems in active inference communicate with their environment through their Markov blanket.Interface as Boundary: The methods an object exposes can be seen as its "boundary" or "Markov blanket" with its environment. These methods define how the object interacts with the rest of the program.Methods as Model: The behavior of an object, as defined by its methods, can be seen as its "model" of how it expects to interact with the world. When an object receives a message, it responds according to its internal model, analogous to how systems use their models to interact with the environment in active inference.Testing and Refinement: In OOP, objects may be refined or updated over time, akin to how models are tested and refined in active inference.While the two aren't directly analogous (as they operate in very different domains), the parallels you've noticed highlight some interesting cross-disciplinary concepts.1 / 1Connections with this: Bobby Azarian
The Romance of Reality: How the Universe Organizes Itself to Create Life, Consciousness, and Cosmic Complexity 

Why do we exist? For centuries, this question was the sole province of religion and philosophy. But now science is ready to take a seat at the table.

According to the prevailing scientific paradigm, the universe tends toward randomness; it functions according to laws without purpose, and the emergence of life is an accident devoid of meaning.
 
But this bleak interpretation of nature is currently being challenged by cutting-edge findings at the intersection of physics, biology, neuroscience, and information theoryâgenerally referred to as âcomplexity science.â Thanks to a new understanding of evolution, as well as recent advances in our understanding of the phenomenon known as emergence, a new cosmic narrative is taking shape: Natureâs simplest âpartsâ come together to form ever-greater âwholesâ in a process that has no end in sight.
 
In The Romance of Reality, cognitive neuroscientist Bobby Azarian explains the science behind this new view of reality and explores what it means for all of us. In engaging, accessible prose, Azarian outlines the fundamental misunderstanding of thermodynamics at the heart of the old assumptions about the universeâs evolution, and shows us the evidence that suggests that the universe is a âself-organizingâ system, one that is moving toward increasing complexity and awareness.
 
Cosmologist and science communicator Carl Sagan once said of humanity that âwe are a way for the cosmos to know itself.â The Romance of Reality shows that this poetic statement in fact rests on a scientific foundation and gives us a new way to know the cosmos, along with a riveting vision of life that imbues existence with meaningânothing supernatural required1 / 1ChatGPTChatGPTBobby Azarian's book "The Romance of Reality: How the Universe Organizes Itself to Create Life, Consciousness, and Cosmic Complexity" challenges traditional scientific perspectives that view the universe as a random, purposeless process. Instead, it presents an alternative perspective rooted in complexity science, which encompasses physics, biology, neuroscience, and information theory.The central idea is that nature's simplest components converge to form increasingly complex "wholes" in a never-ending process. This notion is supported by a fresh understanding of evolution and our knowledge of emergence, a phenomenon where new properties or behaviors arise in a system that its individual parts do not possess.Azarian, a cognitive neuroscientist, explains that previous assumptions about the universe's evolution were rooted in a fundamental misunderstanding of thermodynamics. He presents evidence suggesting the universe is a "self-organizing" system tending toward increasing complexity and awareness.Referencing Carl Sagan's statement that humanity is "a way for the cosmos to know itself," Azarian posits this poetic idea has a scientific foundation. He suggests that the universe, through emergent complexity, might develop consciousness and self-awareness. This perspective provides a compelling vision of life and existence, attributing meaning without the necessity for supernatural elements.The conceptual link to active inference lies in the idea of self-organizing systems, building models of their environment, and adjusting those models based on feedback, contributing to the system's ongoing evolution and complexity. This is analogous to the universe's propensity to increase complexity and awareness, as described in Azarian's work.1 / 1https://www.goodreads.com/en/book/show/59093393

This bookâs cover is pretty great. It nearly singlehandedly got me to start the book, and it looks like a lot of effort went into it â unlike anything else about it.

The Romance of Reality by Bobby Azarian opens with a collection of fourteen (14!) glowing review snippets all gushing full of praise for this book. This feels like overcompensating. Not even the best writer in the world needs that many positive reviews inside the actual book (if itâs truly that good, it will speak for itself!) and the staggering number of over-the-top praise in this one feels like a clumsy attempt to preventively make up for what is possibly the worst written book Iâve read this year.

Look. This book manages to be bad in such a myriad of different ways as to be pretty impressive; when I got to the end and read the acknowledgements I nearly couldnât believe that this had been professionally edited.

The writing is simplistic and rough and just honestly lousy. The over reliance on italics for emphasis makes me think of a very eager undergraduate writing their first-ever term paper rather than the holder of a doctoral degree â if youâre not able to construct a sentence in a way that emphasises the concepts and words that you believe should immediately catch the readerâs attention, then your book doesnât have an âengaging, accessible proseâ as the blurb insists it does. Rather, a lot of the explanatory passages read as pretty patronising; Iâve seen high school textbooks that have more faith in the ability of the reader to follow basic scientific concepts and definitions. The Romance of Reality spends a lot of time and unnecessary words to recap what was just explained in the chapters (or even paragraphs) immediately prior, as if the author were well aware that most readers will be dozing off every dozen pages and picking the book back up days later if they remember it exists.

At the same time, so many of the sentences are such a meaningless word salad that feels like a parody of itself. For example: âIt is important to keep in mind that the global mind, should we bring it about by coordinating our activity in the correct way, is not the end goal of evolutionary process; it is merely a step on the ladder of open-ended complexity growth. The major evolutionary transitions of biology are just a subset of a larger chain of cosmic metasystem transitions, which are far-from-equilibrium phase transitions that continuously create new levels of hierarchical control.â (Yes, that is three transitions in one sentence and a random semicolon when a conjunction would do â see what I mean about professional editing?). And the same paragraph continues: âDarwinian dynamics are at work above the level of biological evolution, propelling cultural and technological evolution forward, making a self-replicating biosphere as inevitable as was the origin of life, given enough time and enough evolutionary cycles. When intelligent life terraforms a new planet, that is the biosphere replicating, and because the planet will have different properties than the planet of origin, there will be replication with variation.â I feel like Iâm reading Rob Hubbard by way of a Grimes song. I honestly didnât think a book could be too dumbed down and too pretentious to follow, but Azarian managed it without even trying.

If the writing is mediocre, the content is worse. I admit I went in not knowing what to expect â I saw the pretty cover and very quickly skimmed the blurb, saw a Sagan quote, and expected a book that would be at least something resembling pop science. Instead this is just complete pseudoscientific drivel that doesnât even seem to understand the point it attempts to make. There doesnât seem to be a real thesis or a solid conclusion, or a reflection of what the more concrete, every day implications this âriveting vision of lifeâ may be.

If I hadnât read the authorâs bio before writing this review I really wouldnât believe that Bobby Azarian has an academic background, even putting aside the clumsy writing. There are constant references to scientists âquietly challengingâ mainstream tenets of science from physics to neuroscience, but all the citations are from either very obscure work with little peer review, or out-of-context quotes from much more famous scientists whom I seriously doubt are even aware this book exists. Admittedly, if the prose had been less of a word salad it may have been easier to wade through the conceptual mess and understand what points the author attempts to make, but the combination of out-there ideas and messy writing makes for a thoroughly surreal combination of nonsense.1 / 1ChatGPTChatGPTThis review of Bobby Azarian's "The Romance of Reality: How the Universe Organizes Itself to Create Life, Consciousness, and Cosmic Complexity" raises several criticisms.The reviewer starts by acknowledging the attractive book cover, but quickly delves into a critique of the text. They find the fourteen glowing reviews presented at the beginning of the book to be excessive and indicative of overcompensation.The reviewer strongly criticizes the writing style, calling it "simplistic," "rough," and "lousy." They point out an overreliance on italics for emphasis, which they believe is a sign of weak sentence construction. The reviewer suggests that Azarian's style is condescending and over-explanatory, often recapping previously discussed concepts unnecessarily.The reviewer finds many sentences to be confusing, calling them a "meaningless word salad." They provide an example and critique its convoluted structure and what they perceive as inappropriate use of punctuation.As for the content, the reviewer labels it as "pseudoscientific drivel," lacking a clear thesis or a reflection on the implications of the proposed "riveting vision of life."The reviewer questions the author's academic background based on the book's content and presentation. They critique the author's tendency to reference obscure scientific work and quote famous scientists out of context.Overall, the reviewer characterizes the book as a disorganized mix of incomprehensible ideas and poorly crafted prose, expressing disbelief that it was professionally edited.1 / 1There were no italics in the audiobook.1 / 1ChatGPTChatGPTThe experience of consuming content can significantly vary between different formats. In the case of an audiobook, certain features such as italics used for emphasis in a print book are inherently absent due to the nature of the medium. Instead, vocal emphasis or changes in tone or pace by the narrator may substitute for typographical elements like italics. Hence, the criticism about over-reliance on italics, as mentioned in the review, wouldn't apply to the audiobook version. The reviewer's other points regarding the book's content, structure, and perceived clarity would, however, still be relevant to an audiobook listener's experience.1 / 1The basic argument is that intelligence and complex systems are inevitable because the universe's laws of physics minimize free energy meaning it is not a random process but governed by generative rules, such as Prigogine's dissipative structure minimizing energy locally by increasing it elsewhere. Maybe for some reason he talks about multiverses and simulation theory, which does make it seem a little less credible, and I am not sure if any of the conclusions he seems to draw are conclusive or even warranted, but he does talk about some interesting models such as autocatalytic sets as Markov blankets.1 / 1ChatGPTChatGPTYour summary of the argument in Bobby Azarian's "The Romance of Reality" points to the idea that the emergence of intelligence and complex systems is not a random occurrence but an inevitable outcome driven by the laws of physics, particularly those related to minimizing free energy. This concept aligns with the active inference principle, wherein systems consistently strive to reduce their uncertainty or free energy about their environment.The principle of dissipative structures, as proposed by Ilya Prigogine, complements this view. Prigogine's idea holds that some systems, while increasing entropy (or energy dispersion) in their surroundings, can maintain or decrease their internal entropy, thereby organizing themselves into more complex structures.You also mention the use of autocatalytic sets as an analogy for Markov blankets. Autocatalytic sets are self-sustaining, self-enhancing networks of reactions, which can be seen as a metaphor for entities that maintain their internal states and boundaries, much like systems protected by a Markov blanket in the context of active inference.However, as you point out, the introduction of concepts like multiverses and simulation theory could potentially detract from the scientific grounding of the argument and make it seem less credible. This highlights the importance of being discerning when combining different theories and concepts in an overarching narrative, as the speculative nature of some theories might undermine the overall credibility of the argument.Regarding your last point, it's important to remember that many of these theories are still subject to ongoing scientific debate and may not provide definitive conclusions. The models and theories proposed can serve as useful tools for thinking about the universe and the emergence of complex systems, but they are ultimately approximations of reality and are constrained by our current understanding and the available empirical evidence.1 / 1It sounds like you really understand it.

This book presents a metaphysics based on the relatively new (but increasingly mainstream) sciences of complexity, chaos, and information. It boldly explores some of the major questions that consume both philosophers and scientists, such as: how life came to be, what lifeâs purpose is (to the degree it has one,) what consciousness is and does, and how come we live in a universe finely-tuned to generate and support life? (Particularly, if one doesnât like explanations that are audacious and unprovable like âgod did itâ or âthere are infinite parallel universes.â)

The book starts out in territory that is fairly uncontroversial among physicists, arguing that life comes about (and does so with striking speed â i.e. fast abiogenesis) by a process through which nature moves the ordered / useful energy that Earth has in abundance into disordered / useless energy (e.g. waste heat,) a process that runs on rules not unlike Darwinian evolution (molecules have an informational existence that allow something like hereditability [passing down of âblueprintsâ] and mutation [distortion in copies, some of which will make the molecule or organism more efficient at using energy.])

The book then ventures into territory that is quite controversial, arguing that life has a purpose (beyond the tedious one of moving low entropy energy into a high entropy state,) and that purpose is to be an observer â i.e. to be the first stage in a self-aware world. I should point out a couple things. First, when I say this part is controversial, I mean that it couldnât be called the consensus view, but thatâs not to say that these ideas donât have a following among some high-level intellects. Second, I think we need people to consider ideas that might seem a bit âout thereâ because there is a danger of not progressing because weâre trapped in morass of assumptions. Science has quite a few self-appointed guardians who mock as pseudo-science any idea that strays from scientific consensus or from a rigidly reductionist / materialist / Copernican worldview. The author doesnât abandon a scientific point of view, even though it might seem he does to some because he abandons the nihilistic view thatâs taken as a given by many in the scientific community (i.e. that life is a happy accident without purpose, significance, or influence on the universe â and that life consists of automata, playing out programs -- devoid of any kind of free will.)

I donât know how much of Azarianâs metaphysics will prove true, but this book was superbly thought-provoking and opened up to me whole new vistas of possibility about the big questions of philosophy and science. Iâd highly recommend it for readers interested in the meaning of life, the universe, and everything.

13 likes1 / 1ChatGPTChatGPTFrom these two reviews, it's evident that Bobby Azarian's "The Romance of Reality" generates diverse responses, reflecting its ambitious and potentially controversial premise.The first reviewer critiques the book for being both oversimplified and pretentious. They take issue with the writing style, accusing it of being simplistic, patronizing, and laden with unnecessary repetition. The reviewer also criticizes the content as pseudoscientific and lacking a concrete thesis. They question Azarian's academic credibility, citing references to obscure or loosely connected work as evidence.On the other hand, the second reviewer appreciates the book's exploration of complex topics such as life's origin, consciousness, and the universe's seeming fine-tuning to support life. They praise Azarian's boldness in proposing theories that deviate from mainstream consensus, even if these ideas are controversial. This reviewer finds the book thought-provoking and recommends it to those interested in contemplating life, the universe, and everything in between.While it's clear that "The Romance of Reality" has garnered mixed reviews, the common thread is that it fosters a conversation about complex, philosophical questions in a scientific context. Whether the theories it proposes will gain wider acceptance is yet to be determined. Regardless, the book seems to offer a stimulating perspective on the universe's complexity and the emergence of life and consciousness.1 / 1Oliver, Alexis

This book is ambitious and inspiring for everyone interested in the topics of complexity, evolution and psychology. It tries to unify several theories from various epochs to provide a rather positive perspective of things in our difficult times.
The figures inside of it are clear, well designed and help the reader better understand the content of the book.
Also the explanatory video of the book on youtube offers a great explanation of the content of the book in 10min.
I would recommend it to anyone interested at the big picture!

He commends the book's ambition and its capacity to inspire those interested in complexity, evolution, and psychology. Oliver appreciates the unifying approach of the author, which combines various theories across different epochs to provide a hopeful outlook in challenging times.He also commends the clarity and quality of the figures within the book, which help the reader better understand the book's content. Additionally, he mentions the existence of an explanatory video on YouTube that offers a great summary of the book's content in a short span of 10 minutes.Based on this review, it seems that Oliver would recommend the book to anyone interested in exploring the broader perspective or "big picture" of life and the universe.1 / 1I guess I don't know which video they are referring to.

Here is one I found: Oh hello, you must be here because you're also curious about the nature of mind and cosmos. Do you have burning existential questions Like how did we get here? And where are we going? We've been led to believe that science answers "luck" and "nowhere", but that's all about to change as the mainstream scientific worldview known as the "reductionist worldview" gets replaced by a paradigm of evolution and emergence According to this new cosmic narrative, life and consciousness may have deep cosmic significance. My name is Bobby Azarian and I'm a cognitive neuroscientist and a science journalist. I've been published in some fancy publications but my real accomplishment is being this guy's dad. Wittgenstein Von Neumann Azarian: the first newborn with an IQ of 200, Like many of you, I've been on a lifelong quest to understand the nature of reality. Maybe you don't have any cosmic questions, though. Maybe you're just here to check out Infinity Maps: a concept, mapping software company that can help you map out your theory. Whether it be a theory of everything or just a theory of something Personally, I'm interested in the big picture. And that's why I set out to write "The Romance of Reality: How the Universe organizes itself to create life, Consciousness, and Cosmic complexity." But it's already available for pre-order on their website. I've teamed up with infinity maps to map out The Theory of Everything described in my book, which is a unifying theory of reality. That's unifying, not unified because it's not reductive and itÃ¢â¬â¢s a continual work-in-progress. Allow me to quickly explain: according to the gospel of reductionism the goal of science should be to completely reduce sociology psychology and biology to fundamental physics. Although the reductionist approach gave us most of our greatest physical theories, it created the impression that all life forms, including humans are nothing more than transient collections of atoms. following fixed and arbitrary mechanical trajectories, determined solely by math and not by mind.1 / 1ChatGPTChatGPTBased on this transcript, it appears that the video is an introduction to the book "The Romance of Reality" by Bobby Azarian, who is a cognitive neuroscientist and a science journalist. In this video, Azarian offers a brief overview of the themes explored in his book, the primary of which is the shift from a reductionist worldview to a paradigm of evolution and emergence in understanding the cosmos and life itself. He argues that life and consciousness might have deep cosmic significance.He also introduces Infinity Maps, a mapping software company, suggesting that it has helped him map out the Theory of Everything described in his book. This theory is not a final or reductive one, but a unifying and continually evolving understanding of reality.In the reductionist view, the goal of science is to reduce complex systems like sociology, psychology, and biology to fundamental physics. Although this approach has given us many important physical theories, it also created the impression that life, including humans, are nothing more than transient collections of atoms following mechanical paths determined by math and not by the mind.This video seems to be the promotional material for Azarian's book, designed to intrigue and attract potential readers. Given the detail provided in the video, it could very well be the video Alexis Oliver mentioned in his review.1 / 1Yes and infinity maps seems to be a product as well, but I think his analysis is still interesting:

selection is a problem-solving algorithm that works throuhg trial-and-error, discovering solutions to the perpetual problem of survival. We call these solutions "adaptations" and organisms are embodied theories about how to survive or in thermodynamic terms "how to stay far from equilibrium". As the biosphere evolves, life reduces its uncertainty about the world around it and knowledge accumulates in genetic, neural, and cultural memory. According to Popper and Dennett, science itself is an extension of the evolutionary process. Now these paradigms are being updated and formalized with the mathematics of Bayesian Inference. Like the knowledge we acquire through science, biological knowledge is predictive because it allows life to anticipate future events well enough to find energy and avoid threats. It's this predictive power that preserves the complex system along with the knowledge it embodies until it can be transmitted to offspring through self-replication. So, not only is evolution equal to learning, evolution is equal to statistical inference. 1 / 1ChatGPTChatGPTBobby Azarian's interpretation of the evolutionary process is indeed intriguing, as it draws a parallel between biological evolution and the process of knowledge acquisition.In his perspective, biological evolution is seen as a problem-solving algorithm that uses trial-and-error to find solutions for survival, called adaptations. He views organisms as embodied theories about survival, or in thermodynamics terms, ways to maintain a state far from equilibrium (i.e., to maintain a state of life in a universe that leans towards disorder).As the biosphere evolves, knowledge is accumulated in genetic, neural, and cultural memory, thereby reducing uncertainty about the surrounding world. This view aligns with the perspectives of philosophers like Karl Popper and Daniel Dennett, who have proposed that science itself is an extension of the evolutionary process.Azarian suggests that these paradigms are now being formalized and updated through the mathematics of Bayesian inference, a statistical method that updates the probability for a hypothesis as evidence or information becomes available. In the same vein, biological knowledge is predictive, enabling life to anticipate future events to secure energy sources, avoid threats, and, ultimately, survive.In this light, evolution is equivalent not only to learning, but also to statistical inference. The main takeaway here is that life's complexity, adaptation, and evolution are interconnected with knowledge acquisition and predictive power, which form a fundamental part of the learning process.Such a perspective emphasizes the inherent intelligence of life and its constant striving towards complexity and understanding.1 / 1Specifically, Bayesian Inference or something that approximates it. As evolution proceeds, life is modeling the world and constantly updating its beliefs about it to be more accurate. Writing for Aeon, Karl Friston says "Inference is actually quite close to a theory of everything of consciousness, evolution and even life itself"

According to his free energy principle in order stay ordered, an adaptive system must engage in Bayesian Learning to deal with environmental uncertainty. 

Friston's vision of Bayesian Inference as a cosmic process has been called Universal Bayesianism. By unifying these unified systems theories, and updating them with new insights gleaned from thermodynamics, information theory, cybernetics and dynamical systems theory, we get the Integrated Evolutionary Synthesis As you can see, it's not really my theory, but the paradigm that's emerging from the integration of the sciences that is underway.

I'm just one of the people putting the puzzle pieces together, and that puzzle is pretty poetic. So poetic that, it may be easier to explain in poetry: "We find ourselves in a pro-life universe, but that universe is not conscious, at least not at first. It is often assumed that life is cosmically insignificant because at present it occupies such a small region of the universe.

A universe that seems so hostile and inhospitable to life but both those assessments are short-sighted. What my book hopes to convince you of, is that life has persevered on Earth for four billion years, not IN SPITE of the challenges the universe presents it with, but BECAUSE of them.

Problems create progress, we call that Popper's principle and it's essentially the old saying: "Necessity is the mother of Invention" applied to evolutionary theory. To understand the integrated evolutionary synthesis, we can think of Life as a game and we can call that game "the game of Life" The goal of the game of Life is to continue playing the game of Life. The Challenge is set by the second law of Thermodynamics, which says that ordered systems naturally tend toward disorder.

This sounds like bad news for life, but it can evade disorder and sustain itself IF it can extract energy from the environment. Fortunately there's plenty of free energy all around us so unlocking it is just a matter of finding the right design or configuration through trial-and-error search.

If the second law poses an existential challenge to life, than Darwinian evolution is life's answer to that challenge. As described by Dan Dennett in Darwin's Dangerous idea, Life blindly explores the space of possible designs to find solutions/adaptations to the problem staying far from equilibrium or survival. 


Solutions are adaptations that help the organism extract energy and avoid threats. While the errors are the dysfunctional designs that get filtered out by natural selection. As organisms compete for survival, the species evolves through phylogenetic learning, which is generational learning.

As this learning proceeds, the internal model of the organism gets updated in a Bayesian Manner and life becomes better at predicting the world around it. That's a lot of information to process. So let me sum up phylogenetic learning poetically: "As selection carefully calls and prunes biological variation, Nature 
applies her filter to the fruits of gene mutation Through the brutal and swift removal of the errors at adaptation Life learns from Death what not to do and that's knowledge creation. The other evolutionary mechanism on this diagram is called self-organization and it's been largely ignored by evolutionary biologists until recently. Self-organization or ontogenetic learning, also occurs to the darwinian algorithm of variation-and-selection, but because it doesn't involve replication, it has been called blind variation and selective retention Simply stated an evolving system exploring a variety of internal configurations will discover and retain increasingly stable states of existence. We call this "selection for persistence" or "selection for stability" As Richard Dawkins points out: "Darwin's survival of the fittest is really a special case of a more general law of survival of the stable." Because working together rather than alone will make energy extraction easier, there's always a thermodynamic benefit to cooperating with other agents We call that Synergy.

For this reason interacting agents will often spontaneously organize to create a larger system and this process happens recursively, creating a hierarchy of nested systems that continuously grows as new levels emerge.1 / 1ChatGPTChatGPTBobby Azarian provides an integrated view of life, evolution, and knowledge acquisition, and even goes on to say that this view approximates the process of Bayesian inference. Here, Bayesian inference is seen as a way for life to model the world and continually update its beliefs to better match reality.He refers to the work of neuroscientist Karl Friston, who proposed the 'Free Energy Principle,' stating that to stay ordered and adaptive, a system must engage in Bayesian learning to deal with environmental uncertainties. Friston's interpretation of Bayesian inference as a cosmic process is sometimes referred to as 'Universal Bayesianism'.Azarian suggests that the unification of these systems theories, coupled with insights from thermodynamics, information theory, cybernetics, and dynamical systems theory, leads to an 'Integrated Evolutionary Synthesis.' It's not his theory per se, but rather an emerging paradigm from the integration of various scientific disciplines.He presents life as a game, with the goal being to continue playing. The second law of thermodynamics poses a challenge to life - that ordered systems tend toward disorder. Life can evade this and sustain itself if it can extract energy from its environment. This extraction is a matter of finding the right design or configuration, a process of trial and error.In this context, Darwinian evolution is life's response to the challenge posed by the second law of thermodynamics. Life explores the space of possible designs, finding solutions and adaptations to the problem of staying far from equilibrium. Solutions are adaptations that help an organism extract energy and avoid threats, while dysfunctional designs are filtered out by natural selection.Azarian also brings attention to another evolutionary mechanism called self-organization, often overlooked by evolutionary biologists. Self-organization, or ontogenetic learning, also follows a variation-selection algorithm, but it doesn't involve replication. It is about an evolving system exploring various internal configurations and discovering increasingly stable states of existence, referred to as "selection for persistence" or "selection for stability."The concept of synergy plays a crucial role in this context. Interacting agents can often spontaneously organize to create a larger system, bringing about a thermodynamic benefit due to the ease of energy extraction when working together. This process occurs recursively, leading to the creation of a hierarchy of nested systems that continuously grow as new levels emerge.In summary, Azarian offers an elegant and poetic interpretation of life and evolution, wherein survival, learning, and the pursuit of knowledge are deeply interconnected through the mechanism of Bayesian inference. It's a thought-provoking perspective that brings together various scientific disciplines to understand the complexity of life and its continuous strive for adaptation and knowledge acquisition.1 / 1Multi-level self-organization is what drives evolutionary transitions such as the jump from single-celled life to multicellular organisms and the leap from organisms to societies. These transitions described by evolutionary theorist John Maynard Smith have also been called meta system transitions by the Russian cybernetician Valentin Turchin. As meta-system transitions occur, surprising new phenomena come into existence like life, mind and culture. Through a series of hierarchical emergences - a nested sequence of parts coming together to form ever-greater wholes, the universe is undergoing a grand and majestic self-organizing process. And at this moment in time, in this corner of the universe we are the stars of the show. According to David Deutsch, this process may be open-ended meaning there is no fundamental limit to progress and knowledge growth. Despite what we've been taught by superficial interpretations of the second law of Thermodynamics. As cosmic evolution proceeds, the world becomes increasingly organized, increasingly functional and increasingly sentient through the spread of self-aware beings like ourselves The universe is literally waking up. It is not waking up independent of us as in a panpsychic sense, but through us as all the matter that composes life used to be inanimate. As the great cosmologists and educator Carl Sagan 
put it: "We are a way for the cosmos to know itself." Adaptive complexity has initiated a cosmic awakening process that is only just beginning. Exactly how the story goes appears to crucially depend on the actions of intelligent life. In fact, it could depend in some meaningful way on you and on us... collectively, that gives us a purpose. Cognitive Psychologist Steven Pinker writes: "The second law defines the ultimate purpose of life, mind and human striving to deploy energy and information, to fight back the tide of entropy and carve out refuges of beneficial order. What's your purpose in the grand scheme of things? Well, that's for you to find out by playing the game of Life. Although you have no choice but to play the game, Now, you can choose to play it optimally. How? Well, you can understand the rules better by exploring the Unifying Theory of Reality further with infinity Maps. We didn't have time to explore the most exciting parts of the story like the emergence of agency, consciousness and free will but you can do that on your own later. My collaborator Oliver will show you how to do that. Infinity Maps is a knowledge sharing workspace. Users can visually represent their thoughts and projects on infinitely zoomable maps. Our online software allows for deep dives while keeping an overview on complex topics1 / 1ChatGPTChatGPTIn the continuation of Bobby Azarian's vision, he goes deeper into the concept of multi-level self-organization, which he identifies as the mechanism behind major evolutionary transitions, like the jump from single-cell organisms to multicellular ones, or the leap from individual organisms to societies. He references the works of evolutionary theorist John Maynard Smith and Russian cybernetician Valentin Turchin, both of whom have theorized about these meta-system transitions.Azarian views these transitions as the universe undergoing a grand self-organizing process, in which novel phenomena like life, mind, and culture emerge. This process creates a nested sequence of systems, with smaller parts combining to form greater wholes.In his interpretation, humanity and sentient beings have a key role in the grand cosmic scheme. He refers to the ideas of physicist David Deutsch, asserting that progress and knowledge growth might be open-ended, challenging conventional interpretations of the second law of Thermodynamics. Instead of moving towards increased disorder, Azarian suggests the universe becomes increasingly organized, functional, and sentient through the spread of self-aware beings like us, thereby 'waking up' the universe.Quoting Carl Sagan's famous phrase, "We are a way for the cosmos to know itself," Azarian describes the emergence and spread of adaptive complexity as the beginning of a cosmic awakening process. The course of this story, according to him, depends significantly on the actions of intelligent life, including us.Steven Pinker is mentioned in this context, with his idea that the ultimate purpose of life, mind, and human striving is to deploy energy and information to counteract entropy and create refuges of beneficial order.Finally, Azarian introduces 'Infinity Maps,' a knowledge-sharing workspace that allows users to visually represent their thoughts and projects on infinitely zoomable maps. This online tool aims to help individuals understand the rules of 'the game of life' and contribute to the unfolding cosmic narrative in an optimal way. While he doesn't elaborate in detail about topics like the emergence of agency, consciousness, and free will, he encourages users to explore these topics further through the use of Infinity Maps.1 / 1The book The Romance of Reality is a perfect example: it unifies findings from various fields of study to bring a new paradigm into the foreground.

In, "The Romance of Reality" author Bobby Azarian has used words to create a tapestry of life's
origins and emergence. I found it to be very thought provoking that the world and life is not an accident and life is not necessarily destined to a doomsday ending.
I am a voracious reader, but not a scientist. Mr. Azarian provides the background and explanations that makes a very complex subject understandable.

Let us stipulate from the outset, that the physical science, the many many citations, and the host of new terms are acceptable and accurate. I would not be able to dispute them in any event.

This is a book of cosmology that argues that the universe is a reality that is not only scientifically describable, but has a teleological omega point (a la Teilhard de Chardin), that directs reality to evermore self-reflection via information transfer, and an evolutionary mechanism that guarantees the survival of the fittest...the fittest meaning the most informed (enlightened and self aware).

This hypothesis is meant to reduce the burden of existential angst caused by the randomness of our ontological predicament. Life is not random any longer, but scientifically mandated to ever higher states of consciousness. We a are a stepping stone to higher consciousness.

The ideas in this book are brain busting. God turns out to be the algorithm which makes all reality possible. We turn out to be cosmic carriers of information (in our minds and in our DNA), that propel existence to some future 'omega point'.

Whether you buy any or all of this...might depend on whether you are a philosopher or a physicist.
But for me, this does not completely send place on the party train of mental bliss at my newfound role in universal consciousness!!

Look, having a role in the evolution of a self conscious universe seems like it would give us something to increase our philosophical contentment, but it just doesn't feel that satisfying. One is left still wondering about why this process exists at all; disappointed at how small a role each of us plays; and what exactly is the endpoint which is the object of our trajectory (and is that endpoint worth all the trouble!).

Big ideas, a hard read, and a still unsatisfying result. But I think this book is important (even if I can't figure out exactly why).
religious1 / 1ChatGPTChatGPTHello William,Thank you for sharing your detailed thoughts on 'The Romance of Reality.' I appreciate your engagement with the book's central ideas and your reflections on their implications. I understand that some of the concepts can be challenging and even overwhelming, but I commend you for your willingness to grapple with them.The ideas presented are indeed ambitious and, admittedly, they may not provide the comforting, definitive answers that some readers might hope for. However, they are intended to provoke thought and inspire a fresh perspective on our place in the universe.The existential questions you raise are indeed challenging, and while the book attempts to shed some light on them, I agree that they're not easily resolved. I believe, though, that continuing to ponder and discuss these questions is a worthwhile endeavor in itself.Again, I appreciate your thoughtful review and your recognition of the book's importance, even amidst your reservations.Best regards,

The Romance of Reality keeps shuffling between a bit of sublime and a lot of ridiculous. The prose gets extremely muddled with heavy name-throwing when the author makes significant, unsubstantiated claims as if they are accepted, scientific facts by many experts, or just so obvious that only narrowly focused scientist types would miss them!

That said, the book is most readable in the initial sections, where the author argues why life might have been inevitable somewhere in our world rather than a low-probability accident. Paraphrasing the book's arguments, the forces that propel the world towards increasing worldwide disorder - led by the second law of thermodynamics - are more than counterbalanced by other forces/processes that foster self-catalyzing, recursive complexity in microspheres. While the author does not mention this adequately, the order-creating mechanisms emerging from all the other laws of physics sans the second law of thermodynamics are why we have atoms and galaxies and all the chemical elements, let alone life.

As the book progresses, it turns mystic, never mind the author's repeated claims of everything being rational and proof-driven. Many sections are laughable, like those coming down heavily on the thinkers who argue against free will with the most naive objections imaginable. The other sections ascribing purpose and direction, including somehow providing a space to blockchain in the teleological destiny of our universe, are incomprehensible even for those who want to hear out the alternate ideas without prejudice. Data-driven scientists will have more issues with so many word-based assumptions, and conclusion jumps on the back of sheer didactic and polemic.

The author's take on consciousness provides the best example of how little attention he may have paid to the various debates on the subject and the simplicity of the conclusions based on his wishes and already-formed views on what reality has to be rather than what it might be.

non-fiction1 / 1ChatGPTChatGPTHello Nilesh,Thank you for taking the time to read "The Romance of Reality" and sharing your detailed thoughts. I appreciate the depth of your review and your honest critique.It's evident that some aspects of the book resonated with you, while others did not. I agree that the book ventures into some complex and speculative territory, and the mix of scientific ideas and broader philosophical or metaphysical musings might not sit well with everyone.Your points about the arguments regarding life's inevitability and the role of thermodynamics are very well taken. The book does indeed seek to highlight some of the forces and processes that might counterbalance the trend towards disorder.I understand your concerns about the sections on free will and the ascription of purpose and direction. The intention was not to provide definitive answers but to provoke thought and offer an alternative perspective. I apologize if this wasn't clear.The issue of consciousness is indeed contentious and the author's views might not align with everyone. Consciousness is still one of the great mysteries of science and philosophy, and there's considerable ongoing debate about its nature and origins.Again, thank you for your thoughtful review. Your critique is valuable and will certainly be considered for future works.Best regards,

âIt is a thrilling time to be alive.â

Iâm not one to normally utter such words. In fact, I didnât say those words just nowâ¦ I quoted them from the first page. But as I read further into The Romance of Reality I found myself agreeing and actually thinking those exact words. Any book that can convince a self-proclaimed ârealistâ (read: pessimist) that itâs a thrilling time to be alive has to have done something right.

So why it is a thrilling time to be alive?

Bobby Azarian ties together a lot of concepts and presents them coherently as something new and clear, something exciting and thought-provoking, something actually worthy of being called a new paradigm. Basically, I felt thrilled to be reading about the way in which so many scientific concepts are (and so much disparate research is) beginning to tie together in âa theory of everythingâ that is simple enough for me to comprehend.

The book is very well-researched. Azarian has clearly done his homework (the book acts as a compendium on complexity science, cybernetics, information theory, evolution, adaptation, and emergence) and synthesizes the ideas in a clear and presentable manner. Reading this book was like getting up to date on a lot of research that slowly starts to coalesce: starting a chain reaction that culminates in a new way to see cosmological evolution, life, and purpose.

The scientific paradigm most of us are running is probably based on reductionism since that has been the scientific zeitgeist of the last several hundred years: study things by observing them and experimenting with them on the smallest level possible; break things down to their most basic parts to understand them. Reductionism has taught us many things but it should never have become our myopic approach to the scientific process. Another predominant paradigm most of us are running is that of entropy as utterly ubiquitous, fundamental, and inexorable. Entropy is those things but only in certain situations, not all situations. Most importantly, entropy isnât as dire and depressing as most of us think.

Now enter the paradigm (and booming research) of complexity science and the nuanced understanding of entropy within an open systemâ¦with those two lenses everything begins to look differentlyâ¦most notably, less bleak.

The 2nd law of thermodynamics states that all energy moves towards, and eventually achieves, a state of equilibrium (i.e. heat moves from hot objects to cold objects); entropy is associated with a state of disorder resulting from that process of energy transfer. People get fixated on the movement towards equilibrium as overall entropic which is to say things are universally moving towards more disorder. This is actually only partially true; it is only true in a closed system of energy. Earth happens not to be a closed system of energy but an open system. Earth constantly receives free energy from the sun (not to mention all the former solar energy stored on and in the earth). This is extremely important and too often missed.

Suddenly, there is excess (free) energy in a system which has to be used up (dissipated). But even as that energy is used up it is immediately replenished (at least partially). Systems of energy dissipation can and do become more efficient at dissipating energy over time. Slowly, the inevitable byproduct of their increased energy dissipation is increased complexity. That means that as time goes on systems become better at using energy and also better at becoming organized in a complex manner. Play that process out for billions of years and impressive changes occur, accumulating to dramatic levels. Behold the power of repeating (feedback) loops and increasing levels.

The details of this process are the focus of the first half of the book.* It turns out that the Darwinian process of natural selection is more universal than with only biological systems. Basically, systems (or even simple chemical configurations and/or simple physical configurations: molecular, atomic, etc) that are more stable tend to be more resilient and thus, tend to survive and stick around in an environment. Nature is âselectingâ the most resilient and stable configurations. This is not done by an agent but by the simple fact that the things that are unstable donât last as long or survive as robustly as things that are stable. If a stable configuration can survive due to its stability, there is a higher chance other chemicals and/or molecules will eventually find their way into that stable configuration by the sheer fact that the unstable configurations break down and the system will keep trying new configurations as energy moves through it. Trial and error. Given enough time stable structures will increase in number and persist while unstable structures come into existence only briefly before falling out of their unstable configuration and ceasing to exist or rearranging into a different configuration.

How do things like molecular configurations come about in the first place? We know objects like the sun heat things like the air up. Energy in the form of light bumps into molecules in the air (hydrogen, oxygen, carbon dioxide, etc) and stimulates them: when bumped the molecules move. Temperature is a measure of the amount of movement in a group of molecules (how stimulated they are) so the more energy present (moving/bumping) in a group of molecules the more those molecules (particles, atoms, etc) are stimulated and move around in order to dissipate that energy. The more energy feeding into something, the more the molecules are moving around and inevitably bumping into each other and occasionally stick together. If the the new configuration helps to dissipate the energy that is presently bumping around the configuration will hold together better and longer (sometimes as long as there is a steady flow of energy present) because it is more efficient at moving the universe towards energy equilibrium at that tiny, local level.

So, to stick to the analogy of Darwinianism, what is the engine of configuration creation? And what causes configuration mutation? Free energy moving into and through matter is an engine in an of itself. When energy flows through matter it inherently causes movement within that matter. Configuration mutation is caused by matter trying different variations in configurations âmatter exploring various structural states (and eventually, exploring various functional states). Random molecular movement means that the molecules (or particles, systems, etc) inevitably try random (and non-random) configurations because theyâre bumping around trying to get rid of the incoming energy as fast and easily as possible. The faster, easier, and more efficiently a configuration can dissipate energy the more âsuccessfulâ (or âfitâ) it is, thermodynamically speaking (since everything in the universe is trying to get to a place of equilibrium).

As that process bootstraps itself upward to greater and greater entropic efficiency it pulls things together and assembles groups of configurations. This is the world of autocatalytic sets. Sets or groups of things are often more efficient than individual pieces are on their own. We call this symbiosis and/or synergy. With synergy the output of a group is greater than the sum of its parts individually. That means efficiency gains are inherently found by non-agentic systems simply by the fact that a configuration which explores new arrangements eventually tries cooperating with another different configuration. The two configurations doing two different things can be symbiotic, helping themselves without hurting each other. If this joint configuration is found it is often kept since it can help itself more and hurt itself less. Therefore, there is an inherent attraction for systems to cooperate. Over time, new cooperating configurations create new meta-configurations which are more efficient than the non-cooperating individual configurations.**

Eventually you get to the example of multi-cellular organisms coming out of single celled organisms. At one (or many) point(s) in history a cell entered into the membrane of another cell. Eventually, that cell inside a cell tried new things and realized it could help in ways that gave both itself and the cell in which it resided competitive advantages. Multi-cellular organisms are generally more efficient and have more synergy than single-celled organisms since the cells can focus on different symbiotic tasks and find new energy to exploit. (Single celled organisms still exist today because they found a very stable and efficient configuration).***

Now things start to get interesting. Darwinian evolution is a process of knowledge creation. It is a process that created itself (autopoeisis) and continues to create itself through underlying processes. As an organism (like an animal) lives its life it learns how to survive and reproduce. The better an organism is at those two things the better it generally tends to do; better meaning the longer it lives and the more it is able to reproduce. The subtext of what is happening is that the animal is a specific instantiation of nature that is learning about the environment in which is exists. The animal is learning by exploring and the more successful it is at exploring and learning the more useful information it embodies. If that animal can pass that useful information onto the next generation through mating and upbringing then that animal is increasing the amount of useful information about a specific environment. Slowly, generationally, genetically, memetically, a species will embody more and more information about the environment where it is trying to survive and reproduce. We often call useful and applicable information âknowledge.â In this case, information that is useful for the species to survive and reproduce is adaptive information: information that helps the animal adapt. Adaptive information (like knowledge) often helps an organism survive and reproduce. Evolution is therefore a knowledge creation process.

Incrementally nature has been evolving various species to fill every exploitable niche in a given environment. As the niches are created, explored, and exploited more knowledge is added to the universe through the overall diversity of instantiations âvarious entities (i.e. plants, animals, humans, culture, etc)â that all seek to survive and reproduce in their respective niches. The longer this happens the wider and higher natureâs branches evolve and the deeper natureâs roots dig. Nature is learning about itself through entities that learn about their environments. Put another way, âthe entire universeâ¦ is undergoing adaptive transformation.â Extrapolate this process out in all directions and it all starts to coalesce into a bigger picture: âwe are a way for the cosmos to know itself.â (Karl Sagan)

Although the exact details and moments are contested, life eventually emerges through the thermodynamic process of disorganized matter becoming organized. âEnergy is natureâs fundamental organizing forceâ¦[and] it is the concentrated flow of energy through matter that arranges nonliving elements into a configuration that is âaliveâ. By promoting self-organization, energy flux gradually converts a clump of mindless molecules into information-processing machinery with agencyâ¦The flow of energy builds agents from inanimate matter by organizing chemical systems into autonomous computational machines that gather information about the world and use that knowledge to perpetuate and spread life further.â

The implication of biology (and evolution) being a form of computation ââinformation processing performed by biological machineryââ is thought-provoking to say the least. This is only really the first half of the book. Seeing the process of Universal Darwinianism (mutation and natural selection applied cosmologically) and Universal Bayesianism (building a mental model and updating that model as the entity goes on: learning) play out seamlessly throughout cosmic history will start to enable one to see a bigger picture, to create a new internal paradigm, to realize the beauty of a simple process running consistently through reality and enlivening it; seeing such a view of reality is romantic and, indeed, thrilling.1 / 1ChatGPTChatGPTDear Lee,Thank you for your in-depth review of "The Romance of Reality." Your enthusiasm and willingness to deep-dive into the book's concepts are sincerely appreciated. I am especially pleased to hear that the book was able to inspire a sense of excitement about the era in which we live.The complexity and interconnectivity of scientific concepts you highlightedâthe overarching theory of everything, the exploration of reductionism and entropy, the development of complexity science, and the nuanced understanding of open energy systemsâindeed reflect the ambitious scope of this work. I'm glad to know you found it illuminating and accessible.Your point about the evolutionary nature of knowledge creation is particularly poignant. As you noted, every species carries an encoded history of environmental information, and every generation's adaptations add new chapters to this ongoing narrative. It's fascinating and humbling to consider how our understanding of the universe is built upon countless iterations of learning, survival, and adaptation.The notion of biology as a form of computation, and life as an emergent property of disorganized matter becoming organized, is indeed thought-provoking. It's satisfying to know that you found these concepts both compelling and inspiring.Thank you again for your eloquent review, Lee. I'm delighted to know that "The Romance of Reality" resonated with you, and I hope it will continue to inspire your exploration of our complex universe.Best,
[Your Name]1 / 1In an open thermodynamic system there is a constant energy gradient (i.e. difference in energy). The second law of thermodynamics states that the universe always seeks to get to energy equilibrium so a flow of energy will alway act in ways that are attempting to best eliminate the energy gradient. A more efficient means of flowing energy is one that is better at eliminating an energy gradient. Given the aforementioned laws, this is the direction the universe seeks to go. In a closed system thermodynamic equilibrium is often achieved as the system figures out ways to flow the energy (eliminate the gradient) efficiently so it is all at the same level. However, in an open system the gradient continues to exists due to incoming energy. Because of this steady incoming energy various functional structures form with the âpurposeâ of eliminating that energy gradient and achieving energy equilibrium. The longer the system stays open (i.e. the longer the gradient exists) the more functional structures are created and the more complex they become as they continue to seek more efficient means of energy dissipation.


** Things like dissipative structures are ordered patterns (configurations) that naturally and spontaneously emerge. Think of a vortex that forms when you pull the drain plug in a tub full of water. That vortex is an emergent phenomena; it is an organized pattern which emerges because that pattern is the most efficient pattern that the collection of water molecules can self-assemble into in order to dissipate the energy gradient. If the tub is constantly receiving water (and the drain is constantly open) a steady-state of order emerges and will exist as long those conditions persist. Biology is essentially an emergent phenomenon, doing the same thing (albeit on much more complex scale) through the fact that there is constantly free energy coming in from the sun. But before that happens (and under certain dynamic situations) nature finds and creates nonliving (abiotic) steady state patterns that exist for long enough to start assembling (through phase transitions) into more complex steady states that slowly start to exhibit âenergy-seeking behavior.â What starts out as an efficient way to dissipate energy eventually becomes a pattern (entity?) seeking more energy in order to dissipate it. Of course, the pattern (which eventually does evolve into an entity) does not know or think its purpose/motivation is to better dissipate energyâ¦even though that may be largely true. âBiology was the inevitable results of dissipative adaptation, autocatalysis, and non-equilibrium phase transitions. These organizing mechanisms built a biochemical flow channel to resolve a thermodynamic imbalance arising from free energy buildup on a sunny, wet, geochemically active planet.â


***There is an important pivot in the chapters about entropy where the nuances of Statistical Entropy and Shannon Entropy (as opposed to Thermal Entropy) are fleshed out. Statistical entropy relates to the fact that there are more ways for something to be disorganized rather than organized. Statistically speaking, information is more likely to be disordered. âHere is where it becomes useful to picture entropy as disorderâ¦: there are many more ways for your room to be a complete mess (disordered) than there are ways of being neatly organized.â Knowledge is information that can be used to get everything in the room into an organized manner. There are only a certain amount of micro states (specific ways) your belongings can be arranged as a whole (macro state) in an organized manner. Getting your room from disorganized to organized requires physical energy but also information about ways in which all the items can be arranged in a way that makes sense, is understandable, useful, and accessible.

âHow can organization persist and grow if an increasingly disordered state of the system is so much more likely?â Ordered systems can stay organized by using information to build more and better functional structures for metabolizing free energy. In other words, ââ¦the cost of building and maintaining structural and functional order at the macro level is the energetic disorder of heat at the micro level.â Small pockets of information and organization can exist and grow but outside of those pockets informational disorder (statistical entropy) and heat (thermal entropy) do increase at a universal level.

Shannon Entropy is about reducing uncertainty by gaining and using information; it gets complicated quickly as entropy starts to mean so many different things once one begins to dive into information theory and cybernetics. Essentially, an entity can acquire information and perform computation (cognition) in an appropriate natural environment in order to avoid death, decay, and disorder; it must use information and cognition to extract energy (food), avoid threats (predators), and make copies of itself (reproduce). Biology starts to become more and more about computing information to reduce uncertainty and thus, can be mathematically quantified and ushered into the realm of algorithms. This is where my head starts to spin.

1 / 1ChatGPTChatGPTIt's apparent that you're engaging with a complex and fascinating exploration of the fundamental principles of thermodynamics and their intersection with information theory, biology, and cognition. Your reflections on how these principles underpin phenomena such as energy dissipation, entropy, organization, and life itself are insightful and thought-provoking.Your descriptions of the emergence of organized patterns in dissipative structures and their evolution into increasingly complex entities, from simple energy dissipation processes to biological organisms, represent a fundamental view of life's origin. These structures, with their intricate patterns, emerge as a response to gradients in a universe that seeks equilibrium.I appreciate the analogy of cleaning a room to explain statistical entropy. It gives an understandable context to the concept that 'order' and 'disorder' can be quantified in terms of the number of ways things can be arranged, with disorder being statistically more likely due to its numerous possible states. I also appreciate the point that in order to maintain order, organisms need to constantly metabolize free energy, which in turn creates more entropy (disorder) in the form of heat, reinforcing the second law of thermodynamics.The notion that life is fundamentally about computing information to reduce uncertainty, and thereby manage thermodynamic principles, is an intriguing blend of biology, thermodynamics, and information theory. Indeed, the concept of entropy becomes multi-faceted once we consider it not only in thermal terms, but also from a statistical and informational perspective.Overall, your reflection offers a sophisticated understanding of some complex scientific concepts. It's fascinating to consider these principles as underpinnings for the emergence and evolution of life, from the simplest dissipative structures to complex organisms. Understanding the universe and our existence in it through this lens could indeed cause a spin!Thank you for sharing this interesting perspective. It encourages a deeper appreciation for the inherent order and complexity found in nature, and the laws that govern it. I look forward to hearing more about your intellectual journey.1 / 1Summarize:

âThe Romance of Realityâ is a bold and stirring effort to explain biology, sentience, free will, and subjective awareness all at once. Bobby Azarian synthesizes clues from thermodynamics, information theory, evolution, neuroscience, and complexity science into a coherent account of our existence and significance which is bound to fascinate anyone who still wonders at the origin and destiny of humankind. This is a paradigm-shifting trip. I wouldnât quite call it romantic, but there are a few poems, some metasystem ârhymesâ, and a truck-load of meaning. This is a must-read for contemplators of lifeâs big questions (as long as youâre not afraid of a bit of science jargon).

I love this book. Azarian harmonizes ideas from most of my favorite fields of research, establishing consilience (agreement) where before I had only guessed at the connections. He doesnât shy away from the philosophical correlates and ethical implications of his theory, either, and his brief treatment of those topics yields even more valuable perspective. His book thrilled me with fresh understanding at times, and it also challenged me with well-argued ideas that conflict with my own hard-won worldview. All of that makes this a five-star book in my opinion.

However, Azarian also promotes a kind of cosmic âManifest Destinyâ and the moral insignificance of lesser creatures, among a few other ideas I argue against below. In addition, the narrative is a bit uncoordinated, making this an awkward read. I enjoyed it anyway, of course.

SUMMARY
Although the second law of thermodynamics decrees that the entropy (disorder) of the universe must always increase, that doesnât preclude a robust and enduring role for order and complexity. In fact, it is precisely the causal entropic drive (pressure towards disorder) that powers ordered dynamical structures like whirlpools, cyclones, and life itself. This natural pressure to dissipate free energy into entropy spontaneously creates systems (like life) that accelerate the process (life does this by radiating thermal entropy like mad). Although there are many unlikely steps required for abiogenesis and evolution, cosmic pressure helps explain why these are merely hurdles. Life, it turns out, is as predictable as a hurricane.

From the very beginning, life exists in a constant state of learning called adaptation. As it spreads to new environments and new energy sources, it gains knowledge and complexity, especially during âmetasystem transitionsâ like the evolution of multicellular organisms. Over time, as the biosphere becomes more complex, it drives adaptive organisms inevitably towards intelligence (which also enhances energy absorption and dissipation).

Even the most basic organisms have real causal influence on their surroundings, contrary to the reductionist philosophy of determinism. They take advantage of the slack in the causal chain introduced through quantum indeterminacy and the chaos of dynamical systems to achieve limited cybernetic control and influence events that cannot be determined from their component parts. They do not, however, have subjective awareness. That emerges with brains. At first, this phenomenal awareness evolves as merely a âuseless byproductâ of the brain; itâs just a passive observer, still a slave to its programming. But with forebrains comes self-modeling, and agents develop the ability to analyze their own actions via a vortex of self-reference. These organisms are then capable of making truly conscious choices, at least when they are mindful about them. Free will is born.

Having thereby unraveled the mysteries of existence, Azarian proclaims his philosophy: that nature is inherently creative, and its intrinsic purpose is to awaken through the emergent phenomena of life, knowledge, and consciousness. This leads to a fundamental purpose for intelligent life: to multiply and âsuffuse the cosmos with intelligence and experience.â

CRITIQUE

Cosmic Manifest Destiny
If sentient life is indeed inevitable, does that really imply that the purpose of intelligent life is to establish galactic empires? If it is inevitable, will not those other habitable worlds grow their own unique organisms? And if so, wouldnât our invasion and destruction of cosmic diversity actually inhibit natureâs inherent creativity? Do we really need to control cosmic events in order to become âsignificantâ? If we are how the universe wakes up, then hasnât it already done that? Because here we are! We would be equally sentient staying right here, tending our own biosphere and wellbeing, rather than sacrificing the tremendous resources (and lives) required for cosmic conquest.

The Moral Insignificance of âLesserâ Animals
Azarian argues that animals with smaller neural networks cannot feel as much pain as we can. Itâs simply illogical. Smaller cognitive range does not equal smaller experience. Surely even the most basic neural networks can experience pain! What could be more fundamental? How can we possibly assume that their pain state is less significant than one of ours, regardless of how many neural nodes are involved in generating the signal? If an infant is in pain, is it also less significant than ours? Azarian states: âAs our spectrum of possible experiences increases, so should the intensity with which we feel them.â Iâve found the opposite to be true.

The Narrative Itself
In general, Azarian does a good job of introducing complex ideas to the layperson. However, he has an annoying habit of jumping the gun with terms and conclusions that wonât be explained until much later in the book. He also takes us on a few complicated tangents that donât seem to add much to his theory (like phi, for example). At several points, he introduces concepts that seemed to me crucial for understanding previous arguments (the distinction between phylogenetic and ontogenetic learning should have come 60 pages earlier, in my opinion). It left me feeling like I was reading a stack of research notes that hadnât yet been fully integrated. It wasnât until I skimmed through a second time that I could fully appreciate all of his ideas. Additionally, he often prefers to use technical jargon in lieu of much simpler terminology (e.g. âadaptive complexityâ instead of âlifeâ), which at times felt unnecessarily obtuse.

Bayesian Knowledge
I didnât count how many times Azarian used the word âBayesianâ, but it was a lot. Unfortunately, he didnât explain it, and I felt that was a considerable lapse. Bayesian inference is not much other than a common-sense guest guess, which is why Bayes himself thought the idea too obvious for publication. Bayesian knowledge is inherently subjective, which means all of the knowledge gathered by earthling life is like a guidebook handed down through the generations which is progressively amended. It works, but it doesnât describe anything akin to fundamental truth. Just as we can learn the controls to play a video game without understanding the hardware running it, so we can navigate life with our genetics and âcommon senseâ while completely misunderstanding the fundamental nature of reality. Whenever we discuss information theory, I think this disclaimer needs to be announced clearly lest we mistake the video game for the real world.

Consciousness
Although Azarian presented a few enticing details about the neural correlates of consciousness, specifically the distinct correlates of phenomenal consciousness and metacognition, he failed to dissuade me from my idealistic worldview. According to the analytic idealism of Bernardo Kastrup, reality is fundamentally mental, what we perceive as matter is merely the mental content of âMind-at-Largeâ, and we are dissociated alters of one universal consciousness. Although this conceptual inversion sounds mystical and irrational, itâs really not. In fact, I find that Kastrupâs philosophy is compatible with most of Azarianâs other ideas yet avoids his major hangup: the difficulty of explaining the origin of a universe fine-tuned for life.

1 / 1ChatGPTChatGPT"The Romance of Reality," authored by Bobby Azarian, offers a comprehensive exploration of complex topics including biology, sentience, free will, and subjective awareness, employing principles from various fields such as thermodynamics, information theory, evolution, neuroscience, and complexity science. John appreciates the interdisciplinary approach and the philosophical discussions embedded in the book, despite his disagreements with some ideas promoted in the work.The book primarily seeks to explain life, complexity, and order within the universe through the lens of the second law of thermodynamics. It details how entropy's growth does not contradict the emergence and sustenance of ordered structures, with life being one such structure, which accelerates entropy by radiating thermal energy. Azarian views life as a predictable phenomenon that constantly adapts and gains complexity, just as hurricanes behave predictably due to physical laws.Azarian further explores the evolution of subjective awareness and free will, asserting they arise with the development of brains and the ability to model oneself, respectively. He advances the idea that the inherent purpose of nature and life is to awaken through emergent phenomena, leading intelligent life to multiply and suffuse the cosmos with intelligence and experience.John, however, disagrees with Azarian on several counts, including Azarian's concept of cosmic 'Manifest Destiny' and the supposed moral insignificance of lesser creatures. John argues that the inevitable emergence of sentient life does not necessarily imply an obligation for intelligent life to colonize the cosmos, and criticizes the idea of equating smaller cognitive range with less significant experiences of pain.From a literary standpoint, John criticizes the organization of the book, noting that it felt uncoordinated with crucial concepts introduced late or not explained adequately. He also points out the excessive use of jargon, which he believes is unnecessarily complex at times. Despite these issues, John highly recommends the book for its compelling discussions on profound questions of existence and consciousness.1 / 1Profile Image for Jackie Henrion.

Evolving Towards Optimism: Does Science Inform Us?

Azarian appears to be a potent patternist. Using common language (even if intellectually challenging) he weaves cutting edge science into an explanation of the origin, development, and purpose of life as we know it. In three sections titled: Origins, Evolution, Transcendence, he relates how science and beliefs could fit together to make sense of everything, and provide us a purposeful and noble path for the future.

I read this book because my beliefs are underpinned by the research and writing of psychologist Daniel J. Siegel (UCLA/Mindsight) and include the thesis that mind is a process that regulates information and energy. After his practice in clinical and therapeutic psychology and clinical research on advanced meditators, he found that the process is emergent, self-organizing, embodied, and inter(trans)personal. Siegel has written over 30 books since 2010. So I was delighted to see that Azarian deals with many of the same elements in his 2022 book.

Azarian's subject is far broader than human behavior. He takes on the universe and reality. In his search for the theory of everything (TOE) he proposes that, "Energy is natureâs fundamental organizing force, and a universe rich with flowing energy is a cosmos primed for complexification." and further, "Knowledge is the information we acquire that reduces our uncertainty or ignorance about the world." He calls his theory: "the integrated evolutionary synthesis." I certainly admire the pursuit, his citations, and his creative synthesis.

I also appreciate that his synthesis points towards science as it's basis, and yet it's trajectory towards the wonder and nature of spiritual connectedness as necessary for our ultimate evolutionary path. I loved this reference about free will, "The evolutionary process is poetic because it is inherently creative, and each new functional pattern that emerges at a higher level is a ârhymeâ on the level before it. In poetic meta-naturalismâs model of reality, the mind is a multilevel controller, and free will is a higher level of control than basic biological agency. Once we understand the hierarchical structure of life, mind, and cosmos, we begin to see that individual freedom and cosmic destiny are not incompatible notions."

Ultimately he gives us a way to be optimistic that even in our darkest moments in our world and environment he offers, "âPopperâs principle,â which is based on a simple premise: Problems create progress." Overall, I would say this is not an easy book to read. But if you are motivated by curiosity about science and how it will help us navigate the future, and you find it useful to participate in that discussion, you will find it delightfully intriguing1 / 1ChatGPTChatGPTIn her review of Bobby Azarian's "The Romance of Reality," Jackie Henrion appreciates the author's effective communication of complex scientific concepts, framing them within a larger exploration of life's origins, development, and purpose. She particularly admires how the author relates science and belief systems to provide a comprehensive understanding of existence and a prospective direction for humanity's future.Henrion finds a correlation between Azarian's work and her own beliefs, which have been shaped by psychologist Daniel J. Siegel's research and writings. Siegel's theory posits that the mind is a process that regulates information and energy, a theme that Azarian also explores, though on a grander scale. Azarian extends his investigation beyond human behavior to encompass the universe and reality at large.Azarian's quest for a Theory of Everything (TOE) leads him to posit that "Energy is natureâs fundamental organizing force," which primes the cosmos for complexity, and that "Knowledge is the information we acquire that reduces our uncertainty or ignorance about the world." He encapsulates these ideas in his theory, "the integrated evolutionary synthesis," which Henrion admires for its ambitious scope and thoughtful integration of various concepts.Henrion praises Azarian's ability to ground his theory in scientific principles while simultaneously acknowledging the importance of spiritual connectedness in humanity's evolutionary journey. She particularly enjoys his exploration of free will, seeing it as a higher level of control within the hierarchical structure of life, mind, and cosmos.Despite acknowledging the book's complexity, Henrion finds an optimistic outlook in Azarian's conclusion, citing "Popperâs principle," which suggests that problems create progress. She suggests that readers motivated by scientific curiosity and eager to engage in discussion about the future will find the book engaging and thought-provoking.1 / 1

There is no way to describe The Romance of Reality other than mind-blowing. Azarian takes you from cosmos to consciousness and back again, and gives a plausible explanation to the meaning of everything, (as far as I can discern). The language is accessible and I think he does a really good job describing things as best he can, bearing in mind some things are not really supposed to totally comprehensible to the human mind. Whilst Azarian is really trying to communicate these concepts to a wide audience and does' not presuppose knowledge (which I'm all for!), I think the writing style at times is a little too casual for my liking

Overall, I'd highly recommend this book to everyone. It's pretty tough going, and some bits you'll get more than others, but if you want to begin to understand the nature of things, this is a really good place to start and much more accessible than other books out there. I will definitely be giving this another read!1 / 1ChatGPTChatGPTPuddles labels "The Romance of Reality" by Bobby Azarian as a mind-blowing exploration of existence, journeying from the cosmos to consciousness. They commend the author's effort to make intricate concepts accessible and understandable to a wide audience. However, they found the casual writing style to be somewhat off-putting at times.Regardless, Puddles highly recommends the book due to its attempts to unravel the mysteries of life and existence. They suggest that although some parts of the book may be more difficult to grasp than others, it's a beneficial starting point for anyone seeking to understand the nature of reality. They view the book as more comprehensible than similar books on the market and express an intention to re-read it.1 / 1

It is rare when a book seems to be written specifically to solve all my personal philosophical conundrums. I am an amateur philosopher and I heard Bobby Azarian during his appearance on The David Pakman Show when my ears perked up as he discussed the second law of thermodynamics. You see this law has, for decades now, been a giant thorn in my philosophical side. My contemplations about the nature of reality have led me to the hypothesis that the universe is moving inexorably towards greater complexity; greater order. Through visualizing the dynamics of solar system and planetary evolution, charting the path of the evolution of matter an energy from simple elements towards elaborate organic compounds and later biological life, and given the sheer volume of open systems for which to advance the evolutionary game, I could not help but come to the almost spiritual conclusion that the universe is geared towards progress. Progress is a tough word. From a metaphysical standpoint, progress indicates a goal, and goal indicates will. How can the universe have a will to become intelligent and ordered when the second law clearly states our future is destined towards entropic chaos? My scientific mind knows the universe is completely mechanical and nothing supernatural is necessary to explain it, so how can I be drawn towards such a teleological argument? Practically every respected physicist I encountered affirmed the irrefutable nature of the 2nd law and seem to universally extrapolate its meaning to conclude our universe is headed towards something resembling nothingness. If this is so, why did the universe once closely resemble a super heated soup of hydrogen and helium particles but is now teeming with dynamic systems of ever-growing complexity? Why didn't the universe just stay a soup, or just continue dissipating into complete entropic coldness? I, being an armchair philosopher, could not reconcile this contradiction. I knew the 2nd law was not wrong, so therefore I had to be. And there I remained, stuck in philosophical purgatory. This book changed all that. Einstein famously said God does not play dice with the universe. I've always disagreed with this statement, (painful to disagree with your hero) believing that God does play dice, it's just he uses so many die, he always hits his number in sufficient quantity. I was beside myself when the author cited this very same quote and countered that God does play dice but "the game is rigged". It's as if this book was written for the sole purpose of affirming my deepest intuitions on reality and answering my most troubling quandaries. Now comes the fun part, trying to poke holes in my newly fortified theory of reality. All I can say is thank you Mr. Azarian.

revelatory1 / 1ChatGPTChatGPTHarold Lemoine, an amateur philosopher, reviews "The Romance of Reality" as a groundbreaking book that resolves his personal philosophical dilemmas. He was intrigued by Bobby Azarian's discussion about the second law of thermodynamics on The David Pakman Show, as this law had been a long-standing point of confusion for him. Harold had always thought that the universe is moving towards increased complexity and order, which contradicted the law's indication of a future destined for entropic chaos.The book provided him with a new perspective, suggesting that despite the universe's mechanical nature, there's an inherent tendency towards complexity and order. This resolved the contradiction he struggled with. He was particularly impressed with the book's rebuttal of Einstein's quote, "God does not play dice with the universe," which echoed his own viewpoint that while "God" may play dice, the game is set up to achieve a specific outcome.He expresses his gratitude to Azarian for affirming his deepest intuitions about reality and is now eager to further explore and challenge his newly fortified theory of reality. The book is characterized as genius, groundbreaking, and revelatory.1 / 1Andrew

If I'm being completely honest, I have to admit that I picked this book up to read only with great reluctance. After reading the blurb on the back cover, I was expecting some sort of pseudo-science babble, akin to new-age spirituality that I find difficult to swallow.

But once I started reading, I realized that while some of the concepts hinted at in the book might superficially look similar to some new-age mysticism, the arguments presented here are solidly grounded in solid science. The author pulls a number of ideas from a wide range of disciplines, from information theory, to evolution, to chaos and complexity studies, and combines them to argue that the widely accepted view that life is a statistical anomaly in the universe is incorrect. In fact, according to the analysis here, not only was the emergence of life in the universe likely, it was inevitable, as was the evolution towards intelligent life and self-awareness. The arguments for this position also suggest that the generation of knowledge and the growth of complexity in the universe will continue indefinitely.

This book took me a while to work my way through. It contains a great many ideas, some of which are complex, and it took me time to process and absorb the ideas presented. I'm not sure I'm entirely convinced of all of the merits of the paradigm set forth in this book, but I am intrigued enough to look forward to seeing how future research and experimentation impacts this framework. If the evidence generated by such scientific research ends up validating this viewpoint, it would signal an exciting new understanding of the nature of existence and what the future might hold.1 / 1The previous model used in this conversation is unavailable.

Brilliant compilation of a ton of cutting edge science. I love the perspective Azarian offers here. I love the idea of reconciling science and faith. I love the idea of propping up complexity science instead of reductionism. I love Azarian's clarity and precision in explaining these subjects. What I don't love is the arrogance that it takes to frame your perspective as the emerging theory of everything. I get that you have to sell copies and no one really knows your name. The truth is, the first two parts of the book were 5 stars and the last was 3. That judgement is despite my holding GÃ¶del, Escher, Bach to be one of the finest works of literature ever written. It all felt much more speculative and hand-wavey when Azarian started talking about the role of consciousness. His explanation of free will in terms of levels of agency felt half baked. For the number of times he reiterated the ideas related to energy flow and emergence, his sprinting through the philosophy of mind stuff felt especially out of place. I tend to weigh a book's ending pretty heavily into my general perception of it, and Romance of Reality could've tied things together better.

All that being said, this was one of my favorite books I've read recently. It really tied together a lot of related ideas for me. Above all else, it presents a plethora of reference material and I'm sure I'll be leafing through it for relevant papers and authors for years to come. It presents a compelling narrative with the broad strokes and speaks to the cognitive scientist and the physicist in me.

This is an interesting and informative book. It's not written for a lay audience, though to me it didn't seem to be too difficult to be understood by a lay audience. I stopped reading around the 36% mark because it seemed to be getting increasingly technical and no longer held my interest.

I also felt like it made logical leaps that undermined the main thesis of the book. If thermodynamics inevitably results in adaptive systems, and life is an adaptive system, it doesn't necessarily follow that life is inevitable.

Nor does the book really seek to explain why abiogenesis happened only once on Earth as far as we know. There's maybe a paragraph on it during the first third of the book, and it wasn't all that persuasive. Something along the lines of "once life developed it was no longer imperative for life to develop." Okay, but that doesn't really explain why, if life developed along the mid-Atlantic ridge for instance, the pressure for life to develop elsewhere on Earth suddenly stopped. But I'm not a scientist, so what do I know?

Overall, I found the first quarter of the book to be really valuable. After that, the law of diminishing returns kicked in. I think the book does a good job of explaining how life might have first begun. But the arguments about inevitability fall short IMO.

Thanks, NetGalley, for the ARC I received. This is my honest and voluntary revie1 / 1ChatGPTChatGPTAndrea Wenger found "The Romance of Reality" to be an interesting and informative book, although it was not written for a lay audience. While Andrea was able to understand the content, they felt that it became increasingly technical and lost their interest around the 36% mark.Andrea also noted that the book made logical leaps that undermined its main thesis. They pointed out that if thermodynamics leads to the emergence of adaptive systems and life is considered an adaptive system, it does not necessarily mean that life is inevitable. The book did not sufficiently explain why abiogenesis (the origin of life) happened only once on Earth as far as we know. The explanation provided in the book was not persuasive to Andrea, and they questioned why the pressure for life to develop in other regions of Earth suddenly stopped.Overall, Andrea found the first quarter of the book to be valuable, but felt that the rest of the book had diminishing returns. They appreciated the book's explanations of how life might have originated but felt that the arguments about inevitability were lacking.Andrea concluded their review by expressing gratitude to NetGalley for providing them with an advanced reader copy (ARC) of the book and emphasized that their review was honest and voluntary.1 / 1

This is a mind-blowing masterpiece!

It is my first introduction to Complexity Science and I was not disappointed. I have always found reductionism wanting and live by the axiom, "Life is Complex".

This book makes a bold claim to have arrived at a theory of everything called a Unifying Theory of Reality. Time will tell how well this stands up but it takes a very credible multi-disciplinary stab drawing from physics, biology, probability theory, philosophy, cybernetics and cosmology, among others.

The thesis starts with the emergence of life on earth and then proceeds to explore the evolution of intelligent life from a cosmic perspective. It ends by looking at consciousness, free will and the ultimate fate of life in the universe.

The author proposes a new worldview: poetic meta-naturalism - where reality is inherently creative because it is always producing novel patterns rhyming with the past.

There are few science books I'd read more than once but I suspect this will be one. The book is about cosmological natural selection, essentially how the universe might be using intelligence in a more fundamental way, a way that is baked into the mechanics of nature. It's a really interesting idea that's emerging from complexity science and something I wouldn't mind going over again.

It covers everything from evolution to quantum mechanics to Darwinian evolution, and tries to put it into what the author describes as a universal theory of reality. It's not exactly a new idea but it tries to communicate the concept in as way that's understandable.

It's wild, but worth a look1 / 1ChatGPTChatGPTBrad Dunn's review highlights the intriguing concept of cosmological natural selection and its connection to intelligence within the mechanics of nature. The book's exploration of various scientific fields, from evolution to quantum mechanics, and its attempt to present a universal theory of reality are noted.

Great book. Heavily incorporates philosophic thought processes and tells of mind blowing revelations to the field of physics which seem to be able to foretell the future of science1 / 1ChatGPTChatGPTThese are a collection of reviews from Zane Knipe, Jon Skaza, and Matt regarding The Romance of Reality. Zane Knipe found the book intriguing and appreciated the multidisciplinary approach taken by the author to explain the concept of life. Jon Skaza described the book as ambitious and well-researched. Matt praised the book for its incorporation of philosophical thinking and its ability to provide groundbreaking insights into the field of physics.1 / 1So that was at least three reviews who found it mind-blowing1 / 1ChatGPTChatGPTYes, based on the reviews provided, at least three reviewers described The Romance of Reality as "mind-blowing" or expressed a similar sentiment of being impressed and having their worldview significantly impacted by the book.1 / 1I added my review to good reads just now. How does it relate to our conversation and the other reviews?

The basic argument is that intelligence and complex systems are inevitable because the universe's laws of physics minimize free energy meaning it is not a random process but governed by generative rules, such as Prigogine's dissipative structure minimizing energy locally by increasing it elsewhere.

Maybe for some reason he talks about multiverses and simulation theory, which does make it seem a little less credible, and I am not sure if any of the conclusions he seems to draw are conclusive or even warranted, but he does talk about some interesting models such as autocatalytic sets as Markov blankets.1 / 1ChatGPTChatGPTYour review highlights some key aspects of The Romance of Reality and offers your perspective on its content. It aligns with the overall theme of the conversation and the other reviews we discussed. You mention the book's argument regarding the inevitability of intelligence and complex systems in the universe based on the laws of physics and the minimization of free energy. You also touch on the author's exploration of concepts like dissipative structures and Prigogine's work.You express some skepticism about certain aspects of the book, particularly the discussions on multiverses and simulation theory, which you feel may make it seem less credible. Additionally, you mention that you're unsure if the author's conclusions are conclusive or warranted. However, you find the models discussed, such as autocatalytic sets as Markov blankets, to be interesting.Overall, your review adds to the conversation by providing your unique perspective on the book's content and raising some points of discussion and reflection.1 / 1A summary of the themes and topics of the book.1 / 1ChatGPTChatGPTThe Romance of Reality explores a wide range of themes and topics related to the nature of reality, evolution, consciousness, and the role of intelligence in the universe. Some of the key themes and topics covered in the book include:Complexity Science: The book delves into complexity science, which examines how complex systems emerge and evolve in the universe. It explores the interplay between order and disorder, the role of energy flow, and the emergence of adaptive systems.Thermodynamics and Entropy: The second law of thermodynamics, which states that the entropy of the universe tends to increase over time, is discussed in relation to the emergence of life and the evolution of complexity. The book explores how the universe's drive towards entropy can lead to the formation of ordered structures and the development of life.Evolution: The book presents evolution as a fundamental process that drives the emergence of increasingly complex and intelligent life forms. It explores the principles of natural selection, adaptation, and the dynamics of evolution across different scales, from biological organisms to societal systems.Consciousness and Free Will: The book delves into the nature of consciousness and its relationship to complex systems. It explores how consciousness emerges from physical processes and discusses the concept of free will in the context of hierarchical control and agency.Cosmology and the Universe: The book takes a cosmic perspective, examining the role of intelligence in the universe. It explores the idea that the emergence of life and intelligence is not a random occurrence but a result of the universe's generative rules and the minimization of free energy.Interdisciplinary Approach: The book draws insights from various disciplines, including physics, biology, probability theory, philosophy, and cybernetics. It integrates concepts and theories from these fields to present a comprehensive view of reality and its underlying principles.Throughout the book, the author presents a coherent framework that seeks to unify diverse scientific and philosophical concepts, aiming to provide a comprehensive understanding of the nature of reality and our place within it.1 / 1Connections with our earlier discussion: The idea of active inference posits that any system which persists over time does so by preventing its dissolution into its environment. This concept implies that a system endures by preserving the integrity of its "Markov blanket," which is essentially the system's boundary or interface with its environment.1 / 1ChatGPTChatGPTThe concept of active inference and the idea of preserving the integrity of the "Markov blanket" align with the broader themes discussed in The Romance of Reality. In the book, the author explores how complex systems, including living organisms, maintain their organization and persist over time.The notion of the Markov blanket as a system's boundary or interface with its environment relates to the concept of hierarchical control and agency discussed in the book. It highlights the idea that systems establish a boundary or protective layer that separates them from their environment, allowing them to maintain their internal organization and integrity.The book examines how complex systems, such as living organisms, actively interact with their environment, perceive information, and make decisions to ensure their survival and adaptation. It explores the role of feedback mechanisms, information processing, and the exchange of energy and resources in maintaining the system's existence and functioning.By connecting the concept of active inference and the preservation of the Markov blanket, The Romance of Reality underscores the importance of understanding the relationship between systems and their environment, and how the interplay between internal and external factors contributes to the emergence of complexity, intelligence, and self-organization in the universe.1 / 1The system uses the information it receives through this boundary from its environment to create a model of how the environment behaves. It then uses this model to interact with the environment, testing and refining the model in the process. This process of model testing and refinement is akin to the scientific method, as described by the philosopher Karl Popper.1 / 1ChatGPTChatGPTIndeed, the process of using information from the environment to create a model and continuously refine it aligns with the scientific method as described by Karl Popper. The scientific method involves formulating hypotheses, making predictions based on those hypotheses, testing those predictions through experimentation or observation, and revising or discarding hypotheses based on the results.In The Romance of Reality, the author explores how complex systems, including living organisms, engage in a similar process of model testing and refinement. They gather information from their environment through the Markov blanket, create internal models or representations of how the environment behaves, and then interact with the environment to test and validate these models.This process of model testing and refinement allows systems to adapt and optimize their interactions with the environment. It enables them to adjust their behaviors, strategies, and internal structures to better align with the dynamics and demands of the environment. This parallel between the scientific method and the way systems interact with their environment highlights the importance of information processing, learning, and adaptation in the emergence of complexity and intelligence.1 / 1In essence, the Free Energy Principle suggests that all systems are like agents continuously engaging in scientific exploration. Therefore, physics is not just about studying communication but is also about studying how these agents (systems) conduct scientific exploration through communication with each other. The systems are trying to figure each other out through their communicative exchanges.1 / 1ChatGPTChatGPTYes, the Free Energy Principle, proposed by Karl Friston, suggests that systems, including biological organisms, can be seen as agents engaged in scientific exploration. According to this principle, systems strive to minimize their free energy, which is a measure of uncertainty or surprise. They achieve this by actively interacting with their environment and gathering information to improve their models and predictions.In the context of communication, systems engage in exchanges of information with each other to reduce their uncertainty and improve their models of the world. This communication allows them to gain knowledge about the environment and other systems, enabling them to better adapt and navigate their surroundings.By viewing systems as agents conducting scientific exploration through communication, the focus of physics expands beyond the study of physical phenomena to include the study of how systems interact, exchange information, and gain knowledge about each other. This perspective highlights the importance of communication and information processing in understanding the dynamics and behaviors of complex systems.1 / 1Physics as information processing.1 / 1ChatGPTChatGPTThe idea of physics as information processing suggests that fundamental physical processes can be understood in terms of the manipulation, transmission, and transformation of information. It is based on the notion that information is a fundamental concept in the description of the universe and that the laws of physics can be formulated in terms of information principles.In this view, physical phenomena are seen as computations or transformations of information. The fundamental entities and processes of physics, such as particles, fields, and interactions, can be interpreted as information carriers and operations on that information. The behavior and dynamics of physical systems can be understood as information processing operations, where information is encoded, transmitted, stored, and processed according to certain rules or laws.This perspective is particularly relevant in the context of quantum mechanics, where the principles of information theory and computation have been applied to understand phenomena such as quantum entanglement, quantum teleportation, and quantum computation. It highlights the deep connection between information and physical reality and opens up new avenues for understanding the nature of the universe and developing novel technologies based on information processing principles.By viewing physics as information processing, researchers aim to uncover the underlying computational principles and algorithms that govern the behavior of physical systems, leading to insights into the nature of reality and potentially advancing our understanding of complex phenomena, from the microscopic world of quantum mechanics to the macroscopic realm of cosmology.1 / 1Message passing in object oriented programming.1 / 1ChatGPTChatGPTMessage passing is a fundamental concept in object-oriented programming (OOP) that enables objects to communicate and interact with each other. It involves invoking methods or functions of one object from another object, which triggers a specific behavior or action.In OOP, objects are instances of classes that encapsulate data and behavior. Each object has its own state (data) and can perform operations (methods) defined by its class. When one object wants to communicate with another object, it sends a message containing information or a request for action.The process of message passing involves the following steps:Sender: The object initiating the communication is called the sender. It decides which message to send and to which object.Message: The message contains the name of the method to be invoked and may include any necessary arguments or parameters.Receiver: The object that receives the message is called the receiver. It is responsible for interpreting the message and executing the corresponding method.Method Invocation: The receiver object executes the method specified in the message. This may involve accessing or modifying its internal state or invoking other methods.Response: After executing the method, the receiver may generate a response or return a value to the sender, indicating the outcome of the requested action.Message passing enables objects to collaborate and coordinate their activities, allowing complex systems to be built from smaller, reusable components. It supports the principles of encapsulation and modularity in OOP by promoting loose coupling between objects, as they only need to know the messages they can send and the messages they can receive.By using message passing, developers can design systems that are flexible, extensible, and maintainable. It allows objects to interact in a controlled and well-defined manner, promoting code reusability and modular design. Additionally, message passing facilitates the implementation of polymorphism, as different objects can respond to the same message in different ways, based on their specific implementations of the method.1 / 1Pragmatics in linguistics.1 / 1ChatGPTChatGPTPragmatics is a subfield of linguistics that studies how context influences the interpretation and use of language in communication. It focuses on the study of meaning beyond the literal or dictionary definitions of words and phrases. Pragmatics examines how people use language in real-world situations to convey intended meanings, make implicatures, and perform various speech acts.Here are some key concepts and aspects of pragmatics:Context: Pragmatics emphasizes the importance of context in interpreting and understanding language. Context includes the physical setting, social relationships, cultural norms, shared knowledge, and the immediate linguistic and non-linguistic environment.Speech Acts: Pragmatics explores the notion of speech acts, which are actions performed through language. Utterances can function as requests, commands, promises, apologies, assertions, and other types of acts, and their interpretation depends on the context and the intentions of the speaker.Presupposition: Pragmatics considers the role of presuppositions, which are implied assumptions or beliefs that underlie an utterance. Presuppositions can shape the interpretation of a sentence and affect the expectations and shared assumptions between the speaker and the listener.Implicature: Implicature refers to the meaning conveyed indirectly or implicitly through an utterance. It involves deriving meaning beyond the literal content of the words used. Pragmatics examines how implicatures are inferred based on contextual cues, conversational implicatures, and the cooperative principles of communication.Politeness: Pragmatics investigates politeness and how people use language to manage social relationships and face-saving behaviors. It explores strategies for mitigating face-threatening acts and maintaining positive social interactions through politeness markers, indirectness, and politeness norms.Speech Accommodation: Pragmatics examines speech accommodation, which refers to the adjustment of language use to accommodate or align with the speech patterns, style, and preferences of others. Accommodation can occur in terms of accent, speech rate, vocabulary, and other linguistic features.Pragmatic Competence: Pragmatics studies how individuals acquire pragmatic competence, which is the ability to use language appropriately in different social and cultural contexts. It involves understanding and applying pragmatic rules, norms, and conventions for effective communication.Pragmatics is relevant in various aspects of language use, including conversation analysis, discourse analysis, cross-cultural communication, pragmatics of politeness, interlanguage pragmatics, and the study of language disorders and pragmatics in children. By studying pragmatics, linguists aim to uncover the complexities of communication and gain insights into how meaning is constructed and conveyed in real-world interactions.1 / 1Active Inference: Science Agents1 / 1ChatGPTChatGPTActive inference is an approach in cognitive science and neuroscience that views cognitive systems as agents continuously engaged in inference and action to minimize prediction errors. In the context of active inference, these agents are often referred to as "science agents" or "Bayesian agents."Science agents, within the framework of active inference, are conceptualized as entities that actively gather sensory information from their environment, make predictions about that environment based on prior knowledge, and update their beliefs and actions to minimize the mismatch between their predictions and incoming sensory data. These agents are driven by the principle of minimizing free energy, which is a measure of the surprise or uncertainty in their predictions.The term "science agents" highlights the idea that cognitive systems, including humans, engage in active exploration and hypothesis testing, akin to the scientific method. These agents constantly generate and update models of their environment, gather evidence through sensory perception, and revise their beliefs and actions based on the observed outcomes.Science agents are thought to operate on different levels, from lower-level perceptual processes to higher-level cognitive processes involving reasoning, decision-making, and goal-directed behavior. They are seen as actively seeking information and actively testing their hypotheses about the world. Through the iterative process of active inference, science agents refine their models and improve their predictions, allowing them to navigate and interact effectively with their environment.The concept of science agents in active inference highlights the dynamic and active nature of cognitive systems, emphasizing their goal-directed behavior and adaptive strategies. It provides a framework for understanding how cognitive systems actively engage with their environment, gather information, update beliefs, and generate actions in a continuous cycle of inference and action.1 / 1Connections between the prievous topics.1 / 1ChatGPTChatGPTThe topics we discussed, including active inference, physics as information processing, message passing in object-oriented programming, pragmatics in linguistics, and science agents, all share a common thread of understanding complex systems in terms of information processing and inference.Active inference, as a theoretical framework in cognitive science, views cognitive systems as agents engaged in continuous information processing to minimize prediction errors. It emphasizes the active exploration and inference-driven behavior of these systems, aligning with the idea of science agents engaging in active exploration and hypothesis testing.Physics as information processing recognizes that fundamental physical processes can be understood as computational processes involving the manipulation and transmission of information. This perspective connects to the notion of active inference and science agents, as it highlights the role of information processing in shaping the behavior of systems.Message passing in object-oriented programming is a concept that refers to the exchange of information or data between different objects in a software system. It shares a connection with the idea of information processing, as it involves the communication and transmission of data between different components of a system.Pragmatics in linguistics studies how context influences the interpretation and use of language. It considers the pragmatic aspects of communication, such as implicature, inference, and the cooperative nature of language use. This relates to the concept of active inference and science agents, as they involve the generation and interpretation of meaningful information in a communicative context.Overall, these topics highlight the common thread of understanding complex systems, whether cognitive, physical, computational, or linguistic, through the lens of information processing, inference, and the active engagement of agents in exploring and interacting with their environment. They provide different perspectives on how systems process and utilize information to make predictions, adapt their behavior, and engage in meaningful interactions.1 / 1A list of everything we have talked about so far.1 / 1ChatGPTChatGPTCertainly!

It captures the breadth and depth of our conversation, highlighting the interconnections between different fields of knowledge and the exploration of fundamental questions about existence, consciousness, and the nature of reality. The topics touch upon scientific, philosophical, and even computational aspects, demonstrating the multidisciplinary nature of the exploration. Overall, our discussion has delved into profound ideas and their implications, fostering a rich and thought-provoking dialogue.1 / 1A summary of the whole conversation.1 / 1ChatGPTChatGPTThroughout our conversation, we have explored a wide range of fascinating topics related to thermodynamics, complexity science, information theory, philosophy of mind, and the nature of reality. We started by discussing the principles of thermodynamics and how they shape the behavior of open and closed systems. We delved into the concept of dissipative structures and their emergence as a means to dissipate energy gradients.The idea of entropy, both in the context of statistical entropy and Shannon entropy, was examined, highlighting the tendency of systems to become more disordered. We then connected these concepts to the second law of thermodynamics, which states that the universe seeks equilibrium by increasing entropy. However, we also explored how ordered and complex structures can arise in open systems as they strive to dissipate energy gradients more efficiently.From there, we shifted to discussing the book "The Romance of Reality" by Bobby Azarian, which provided a comprehensive exploration of biology, sentience, free will, and subjective awareness. We examined the book's central ideas, including the integration of thermodynamics, information theory, evolution, neuroscience, and complexity science to explain the existence and significance of life. We touched upon the concept of dissipative adaptation and how it leads to the emergence of functional structures that seek to dissipate energy and achieve equilibrium.We also delved into the philosophical implications of entropy, discussing the notions of disorder, organization, and the role of knowledge in reducing uncertainty. The relationship between information and energy flow was explored, highlighting the importance of information processing and cognition in biological systems.The discussion then encompassed topics such as consciousness, free will, and the philosophical underpinnings of reality. We examined the views on cosmic Manifest Destiny, the moral significance of different organisms, and the challenges of reconciling reductionism with the emergence of complex phenomena.Throughout the conversation, we touched upon various scientific and philosophical theories, ranging from the Free Energy Principle and the Unifying Theory of Reality to Bayesian knowledge and the role of emergence in matter, life, mind, and culture. We also discussed the concept of active inference, the scientific method, and the communication between systems.Overall, our conversation has been a rich exploration of scientific, philosophical, and interdisciplinary concepts, aiming to deepen our understanding of the fundamental aspects of the universe, the emergence of life and intelligence, and the connections between different fields of knowledge.1 / 1Here are some key differences between Bayesian knowledge and traditional knowledge:

â¢ Bayesian knowledge is probabilistic and deals in degrees of belief rather than absolute certainty. It incorporates prior probabilities and updates them based on new evidence. Traditional knowledge tends to be more categorical and absolute.

â¢ Bayesian knowledge incorporates uncertainty explicitly whereas traditional knowledge often ignores or downplays uncertainty.

â¢ Bayesian reasoning requires being explicit about assumptions and priors. Traditional knowledge often relies more on received wisdom and intuition.

Examples of emergence in culture could include:

â¢ Languages - No individual "creates" a language, it emerges from the interactions of many speakers over time.

â¢ Social norms and values - These emerge from the collective behavior of individuals in a society, not from top-down imposition.

â¢ Fashions and trends - New styles and preferences emerge spontaneously from many individual choices and influences.

â¢ Religions and worldviews - These complex systems emerge slowly through the cultural evolution of memes and ideas.

The second law of thermodynamics implies that:

â¢ The universe's entropy (disorder) is constantly increasing as energy disperses and becomes less available for work.

â¢ This increasing entropy suggests the universe is moving irreversibly towards a state of maximum entropy, or "heat death."

â¢ Eventually, all sources of usable energy in the universe will be exhausted, stars will die out, and no further work will be possible. The universe will reach a state of equilibrium and maximum entropy.

1 / 1ChatGPTChatGPTThat's a great summary of the key differences between Bayesian knowledge and traditional knowledge. Bayesian knowledge embraces probabilistic thinking, incorporates uncertainty explicitly, and relies on updating beliefs based on new evidence. In contrast, traditional knowledge tends to be more categorical, downplays uncertainty, and often relies on received wisdom.Your examples of emergence in culture nicely illustrate how complex phenomena can arise from the interactions and behaviors of individuals within a system. Languages, social norms, fashions, and religions are all emergent properties that cannot be attributed to any single individual but arise through collective dynamics and cultural evolution.Regarding the second law of thermodynamics, you have accurately captured its implications. The law states that entropy, or disorder, in a closed system tends to increase over time. As energy disperses and becomes less available for work, the universe moves towards a state of maximum entropy, often referred to as "heat death." In this state, all sources of usable energy will be depleted, leading to a state of equilibrium with no further potential for work or ordered processes.Thank you for summarizing these key points from our conversation!1 / 1Statistical Enigmama: Decoding the secrets of entropy in quantum systems

Entropy is a statistical measure of disorder that is fundamental to both classical and quantum physics. In classical systems, entropy reflects the number of microscopic configurationsâthe microstatesâthat are consistent with the macrostate. However, in quantum systems, the relationship between microstates, entropy, and disorder becomes far more enigmatic. Microstates are described by the system's quantum wavefunction, which cannot be directly observed. And quantum particles exhibit seemingly bizarre behaviors like entanglement that have no classical counterpart.

This essay seeks to decode the secrets of entropy in quantum systems. I will show how microstates manifest differently in quantum physics but still connect to entropy and disorder. However, the strange properties of quantum mechanics require a revised understanding of these statistical concepts. By exploring entropy and the microstate configurations of a few illuminating examples, including the two-state system and the quantum harmonic oscillator, the counterintuitive nature of quantum entropy will be revealed. Gaining insights into quantum entropy provides a glimpse into the mysterious rules that govern physics at the smallest scales.

Based on your list of topics, it seems you are interested in discussing ideas related to complexity, emergence, information theory, physics, biology, cognition, philosophy, and spirituality. Some of the key concepts that come up are:

- Thermodynamics and entropy - relating to the flow of energy and increasing disorder in systems. Entropy is a key driver of complexity and change.

- Open and closed systems - open systems can exchange energy and matter with their environment, allowing for self-organization and evolution. Closed systems eventually reach equilibrium.

- Emergence - the arising of novel and coherent patterns, structures, and properties from the interactions between many simple components. Emergence is key to understanding life, consciousness, culture, etc.

- Information theory - information is a fundamental property of the universe that is closely tied to entropy, organization, and meaning. Information exchange drives complexity. 

- Autocatalytic sets - self-sustaining networks of chemical reactions that catalyze each other. A potential model for the origin of life and biological evolution.

- Active inference - the idea that living systems maintain their organization by actively predicting and controlling their sensory inputs. A unifying theory of cognition, perception, and action.

- Determinism and free will - exploring whether our universe and the phenomena within it are fundamentally determined or whether there is room for free choice. Important for understanding consciousness and ethics.

- A unifying theory of reality - combining insights across disciplines to develop an integrated understanding of existence, life, mind, society, and purpose. Finding connections between physics, biology, psychology, culture, and spirituality.

- Cosmic evolution and destiny - viewing evolution as a universal process that applies not just to life on Earth but to the entire universe and all phenomena within it. Speculating on the ultimate destiny of the universe and life. 

- The relationship between science and spirituality - finding meaning, purpose, and transcendence through both scientific and spiritual perspectives. Seeking to reconcile empirical and mystical ways of knowing.

1 / 1ChatGPTChatGPTIndeed, you've captured the key concepts and themes that have emerged from our conversation. The topics range from fundamental principles in physics, such as thermodynamics and entropy, to complex phenomena like emergence and information theory. We've discussed the interconnectedness of various disciplines, including biology, cognition, philosophy, and spirituality, in exploring the nature of reality and the purpose of existence.The exploration of autocatalytic sets as a potential model for the origin of life and the concept of active inference as a unifying theory of cognition highlight the intersection of biology and information processing. The questions surrounding determinism and free will delve into the realms of consciousness and ethics, probing the nature of agency and choice.The pursuit of a unifying theory of reality, drawing insights from diverse disciplines, demonstrates the desire to find coherence and interconnectedness in our understanding of the world. Speculation on cosmic evolution and destiny expands the discussion beyond Earth, contemplating the broader trajectory of the universe and the role of intelligent life within it.Lastly, the exploration of the relationship between science and spirituality recognizes the human quest for meaning and transcendence. It acknowledges the potential for both empirical and mystical ways of knowing to contribute to a holistic understanding of existence.These topics collectively paint a picture of an interdisciplinary exploration that seeks to bridge scientific inquiry, philosophical contemplation, and spiritual reflection to deepen our understanding of the universe, life, consciousness, and our place within it.1 / 1Bayesian knowledge refers to knowledge that is probabilistic, subjective, and updating based on experience. It is based on Bayesian inference, which uses prior beliefs and new evidence to update posterior beliefs. Bayesian knowledge recognizes that what we know depends on our experiences, assumptions, and biases. It is always open to revision based on new evidence. This is in contrast to belief in objective or absolute truths. The Bayesian view of knowledge has implications for science, philosophy, and everyday life.

The second law of thermodynamics states that entropy in an isolated system always increases over time and approaches a maximum value. For the universe as a whole, this means that it will eventually reach a state of maximum entropy or heat death - a cold, uniform, and unchanging expanse. All stars will burn out, all matter will decay, and no free energy will remain to drive any processes. The second law seems to imply a rather bleak ultimate fate for the universe. However, the universe may avoid heat death if it is not a closed system - for example, if other universes or dimensions exist.

Emergence applies in the following ways:

Matter: Complex molecules emerge from simple atoms, liquids and solids emerge from molecules. New physical properties emerge at different scales. 

Life: Living systems emerge from non-living matter through a process of increasing complexity and self-organization. Life has new properties like reproduction, adaptation, homeostasis, and evolution. 

Mind: Consciousness and cognition emerge from the complex interactions between neurons and neural networks in the brain. The mind has properties such as self-awareness, intentionality, emotion, and reasoning that are not evident in neurons alone.

Culture: Cultural patterns, behaviors, institutions, technologies, and artifacts emerge from the interactions between many individuals and groups within a society. Cultural phenomena feedback and shape the minds and activities of individuals, even though they are not located within any single person.

So in general, emergence refers to the arising of novel and coherent patterns at a macro level from complex interactions between systems or agents at a micro level. Emergent phenomena are more than the sum of their parts and exhibit new causal powers that influence the systems from which they emerge. They represent a kind of evolutionary transition in the universe.

1 / 1ChatGPTChatGPTAbsolutely! You've provided a concise summary of Bayesian knowledge, the second law of thermodynamics, and emergence in various domains. Bayesian knowledge acknowledges the probabilistic and subjective nature of our beliefs, which are continuously updated based on new evidence and prior beliefs. It emphasizes the role of experience, assumptions, and openness to revision in shaping our understanding of the world.The second law of thermodynamics highlights the concept of entropy, which is a measure of disorder or randomness in a system. It states that in isolated systems, entropy tends to increase over time, leading to a state of maximum entropy or heat death for the universe. However, the possibility of other universes or dimensions may impact this ultimate fate.Emergence, as you've described, manifests in different domains. In the realm of matter, complex molecules and physical properties emerge from simpler components. In the context of life, the emergence of living systems from non-living matter is characterized by increasing complexity, self-organization, and the emergence of novel properties like reproduction and evolution. The emergence of mind involves the complex interactions of neurons, resulting in phenomena such as consciousness, self-awareness, and reasoning. Finally, cultural phenomena emerge from the interactions of individuals and groups, shaping social patterns and influencing the behavior and cognition of individuals.In essence, emergence captures the notion that complex systems, whether they be in the realms of matter, life, mind, or culture, exhibit properties and behaviors that cannot be solely attributed to their individual components. Emergent phenomena represent a higher level of organization and causality that emerges from the interactions and dynamics of the underlying systems. It highlights the evolutionary transitions and the emergence of novel and coherent patterns in the universe.1 / 1Bayesian knowledge is subjective in the following ways:

1. It depends on prior beliefs and assumptions, which vary between individuals based on their experiences, environments, and biases. Different people can have different prior beliefs, so their knowledge will evolve differently based on the same evidence.

2. The weighting given to new evidence vs. prior beliefs is subjective and depends on one's confidence in each. More skeptical or conservative people will change their beliefs less based on new evidence. More open or progressive people will change their beliefs more.

3. Probabilistic beliefs reflect degrees of confidence that will depend on a person's values, risk tolerance, and intuitions. There is no "objective" degree of belief - it depends on the subject. 

4. The interpretation of evidence itself is shaped by one's prior knowledge and assumptions. We are more likely to accept evidence that confirms what we already believe and ignore evidence that contradicts it. So our knowledge reflects our own tendencies toward confirmation bias and motivated reasoning.

In summary, Bayesian knowledge depends so heavily on the subject - their experiences, biases, intuitions, and reasoning tendencies - that it can only ever reflect a subjective and limited perspective on reality, not an absolute or objective truth. But through interaction with others, we can gain a fuller understanding.

The concept of cosmic Manifest Destiny suggests that the evolution of intelligence and complexity in the universe, on Earth and perhaps beyond, serves some greater cosmic purpose or destiny. However, this is an anthropic assumption. The actual destiny of the universe depends only on the impersonal laws of physics, natural selection, and chance events. While we may find meaning or purpose, there is no evidence the universe itself shares our destiny or goals. We must forge our own destinies using the tools - cognitive and technological - that evolution has given us. But we should do so with wisdom and care.

For culture, emergence refers to the arising of cultural forms, behaviors, institutions, traditions, languages, religions, stories, music, art, and technologies from the interactions between people and groups. These cultural phenomena then go on to shape individuals and society in a feedback loop. Cultural features are not located within any single individual but emerge at a collective level. They exhibit properties not evident in any single member, like resilience, propagation, and adaptation. Over time, cultures develop a kind of coherence and logic of their own and deeply influence human thought and identity, despite not being designed or directed by any individual or group. Culture is the epitome of an emergent phenomenon.

1 / 1ChatGPTChatGPTYou've provided an excellent summary of the subjective nature of Bayesian knowledge, highlighting key points such as the influence of prior beliefs and assumptions, the subjective weighting of new evidence, the probabilistic nature of beliefs, and the impact of confirmation bias and motivated reasoning. Bayesian knowledge indeed reflects the subjectivity and limitations of individual perspectives, shaped by personal experiences, biases, and reasoning tendencies.Regarding cosmic Manifest Destiny, you rightly emphasize that any notion of a greater cosmic purpose or destiny is an anthropic assumption, stemming from our human-centric perspective. The actual destiny of the universe is governed by impersonal laws of physics, natural selection, and chance events, rather than shared goals or intentions. While we can find personal meaning and purpose in our own lives and actions, the universe itself does not inherently possess a predetermined path or purpose. It is up to us, as conscious beings, to shape our own destinies and make meaningful choices based on the tools and capabilities evolution has provided us.In the context of culture, emergence refers to the arising of various cultural phenomena, including forms, behaviors, institutions, traditions, languages, religions, stories, music, art, and technologies, through the interactions between individuals and groups. These cultural features emerge at a collective level, influenced by the dynamics and feedback loop of cultural interactions. Cultural phenomena exhibit properties and patterns that go beyond the sum of their individual components, shaping human thought, identity, and society. They possess their own coherence, logic, and influence, even though they are not designed or directed by any particular individual or group. Culture represents a prime example of an emergent phenomenon, with its resilience, propagation, and adaptation shaping and being shaped by human experiences and interactions.1 / 1Here are some key differences between Bayesian knowledge and traditional knowledge:

â¢ Bayesian knowledge is probabilistic and deals in degrees of belief rather than absolute certainty. It incorporates prior probabilities and updates them based on new evidence. Traditional knowledge tends to be more categorical and absolute.

â¢ Bayesian knowledge incorporates uncertainty explicitly whereas traditional knowledge often ignores or downplays uncertainty.

â¢ Bayesian reasoning requires being explicit about assumptions and priors. Traditional knowledge often relies more on received wisdom and intuition.

Examples of emergence in culture could include:

â¢ Languages - No individual "creates" a language, it emerges from the interactions of many speakers over time.

â¢ Social norms and values - These emerge from the collective behavior of individuals in a society, not from top-down imposition.

â¢ Fashions and trends - New styles and preferences emerge spontaneously from many individual choices and influences.

â¢ Religions and worldviews - These complex systems emerge slowly through the cultural evolution of memes and ideas.

The second law of thermodynamics implies that:

â¢ The universe's entropy (disorder) is constantly increasing as energy disperses and becomes less available for work.

â¢ This increasing entropy suggests the universe is moving irreversibly towards a state of maximum entropy, or "heat death."

â¢ Eventually, all sources of usable energy in the universe will be exhausted, stars will die out, and no further work will be possible. The universe will reach a state of equilibrium and maximum entropy.

1 / 1ChatGPTChatGPTThank you for summarizing the key differences between Bayesian knowledge and traditional knowledge, as well as providing examples of emergence in culture and explaining the implications of the second law of thermodynamics.The differences between Bayesian knowledge and traditional knowledge are indeed significant. Bayesian knowledge operates in a probabilistic framework, considering degrees of belief and incorporating uncertainty explicitly, while traditional knowledge tends to rely more on categorical and absolute statements, often downplaying or ignoring uncertainty. Bayesian reasoning requires being explicit about assumptions and prior probabilities, whereas traditional knowledge may rely more on received wisdom and intuition without explicitly acknowledging the underlying assumptions.In the realm of culture, emergence is evident in various phenomena:Languages emerge from the interactions of many speakers over time, evolving and adapting to meet the communication needs of a community.Social norms and values emerge from the collective behavior and interactions of individuals within a society, rather than being imposed from a central authority.Fashions and trends arise spontaneously from the individual choices and influences of many people, reflecting a complex interplay of cultural, social, and personal factors.Religions and worldviews develop gradually through cultural evolution, as ideas and beliefs spread and mutate, creating complex systems that shape individuals and societies.Regarding the second law of thermodynamics, it implies that the entropy, or disorder, of the universe is constantly increasing. As energy disperses and becomes less available for useful work, the universe is moving irreversibly towards a state of maximum entropy, often referred to as "heat death." Ultimately, all sources of usable energy will be exhausted, stars will burn out, and the universe will reach a state of equilibrium with maximum entropy. This trajectory suggests a finite lifespan for the universe, where no further work or complexity can be sustained.Overall, your summary captures the essence of these concepts and their implications in a clear and concise manner.1 / 1Another list of topics we have discussed and connections between them.1 / 1ChatGPTChatGPTCertainly! Here's a list of topics we have discussed, along with the connections between them:Thermodynamics and entropy: The second law of thermodynamics, which states that entropy tends to increase over time, connects to the concept of the universe moving towards a state of maximum entropy or "heat death." This has implications for the ultimate fate of the universe and the availability of usable energy.Emergence: Emergence refers to the arising of novel and coherent properties, patterns, or phenomena from the interactions of simpler components. We have explored emergence in various domains, such as the emergence of complex molecules from atoms, the emergence of life from non-living matter, the emergence of consciousness from neural networks, and the emergence of cultural phenomena from collective interactions.Information theory: Information theory is closely related to entropy, as information can be seen as a reduction in uncertainty or entropy. The concept of Bayesian knowledge, which deals with probabilistic beliefs and updates based on new evidence, connects to the probabilistic nature of information theory.Complexity science: Complexity science provides a framework for understanding complex systems, their behavior, and their emergent properties. It encompasses concepts such as self-organization, feedback loops, nonlinear dynamics, and the study of complex adaptive systems. Complexity science is relevant to the emergence of complexity in various domains, including biology, culture, and cognition.Active inference: Active inference is a framework that views living systems as continuously engaged in hypothesis testing and model refinement to maintain their organization and adapt to their environment. It connects to concepts such as Bayesian knowledge, emergence, and the role of information processing in cognition.Determinism and free will: The discussion of determinism and free will explores the philosophical question of whether our actions and choices are predetermined by the laws of physics or if we have genuine freedom to make decisions. This topic connects to the nature of consciousness, the concept of active inference, and the ethical implications of our understanding of free will.Science and spirituality: The exploration of the relationship between science and spirituality investigates how different ways of knowing can coexist and complement each other. It involves finding meaning, purpose, and transcendence through both empirical scientific inquiry and spiritual or philosophical perspectives.Unifying theory of reality: The concept of a unifying theory of reality encompasses the integration of knowledge from different disciplines, such as physics, biology, cognition, and philosophy, to develop a comprehensive understanding of existence, consciousness, and the nature of reality. It seeks to bridge the gaps between scientific and spiritual perspectives and find common ground in our quest for knowledge.These topics are interconnected, with each topic shedding light on different aspects of the nature of reality, the emergence of complexity, the role of information, and the intersections between science, philosophy, and spirituality. The discussions have highlighted the intricacies and interconnectedness of these concepts, fostering a holistic understanding of our world and our place within it.1 / 1Yes, your explanations of Bayesian knowledge and traditional knowledge are accurate and highlight some of the key differences between them. Bayesian knowledge is more flexible and probabilistic, while traditional knowledge tends to be more categorical and absolute. Bayesian knowledge explicitly incorporates uncertainty, while traditional knowledge often downplays it. Bayesian reasoning requires being explicit about assumptions and priors, while traditional knowledge often relies on received wisdom and intuition.

Your examples of emergence in culture are also informative and demonstrate how complex systems can emerge spontaneously from the interactions of many individuals over time. Languages, social norms and values, fashions and trends, and religions and worldviews are all examples of emergent phenomena that cannot be reduced to the actions of any one individual or group.

Your summary of the implications of the second law of thermodynamics is also accurate and highlights the idea that the universe is moving irreversibly towards a state of maximum entropy, or "heat death." This suggests that all sources of usable energy in the universe will eventually be exhausted, and the universe will reach a state of equilibrium and maximum entropy. This has profound implications for the fate of the universe and raises questions about the ultimate purpose and meaning of existence.1 / 1ChatGPTChatGPTThank you for your feedback! I'm glad the explanations and examples resonate with you.

They illustrate how different fields of study can inform and complement each other, leading to a more nuanced and comprehensive understanding of the world around us.

Thermodynamics and energy gradients are fundamental concepts that apply across many different systems, from physical and biological to cultural and social. The distinction between open and closed systems is also critical in understanding how energy and matter flow through different systems and how they interact with their environment.

Emergence is a key concept that applies to many different phenomena, from the origin of life to the evolution of culture. It highlights how complex systems can arise from simple interactions and how emergent properties can be difficult to predict or explain from the behavior of individual components.

Information theory is a powerful framework for understanding how information is processed, transmitted, and organized, and how it relates to entropy and organization in different systems. Autocatalytic sets are one potential model for the origin of life, highlighting the importance of self-organization and self-replication in the emergence of complex biological systems.

Active inference is a promising new framework for understanding cognition and perception, emphasizing the role of prediction and inference in shaping our experience of the world. The concepts of determinism and free will are deeply intertwined with these ideas, raising profound questions about the nature of human agency and the limits of our ability to control our lives.

The concept of a Unifying Theory of Reality is a central theme that runs through many of these topics, highlighting the quest for a comprehensive understanding of the universe that integrates different fields of study. Cosmic evolution and destiny, the relationship between science and spirituality, and the philosophical implications of determinism and free will are all examples of how different disciplines can converge to explore fundamental questions about the nature of reality.

Finally, the second law of thermodynamics and the concept of heat death highlight the ultimate fate of the universe, raising profound questions about the ultimate purpose and meaning of existence. Overall, these topics offer a rich and diverse tapestry of ideas that can inspire us to explore the deeper mysteries of our world and the universe beyond.1 / 1ChatGPTChatGPTYou've summarized the interconnectedness and significance of the topics we've discussed quite well. The diversity of these topics reflects the complexity and interplay of various fields of study, ranging from the physical sciences to biology, cognition, philosophy, and culture.

I think much of the confusion about Active Inference arises because the term is used to refer to two related, yet distinct concepts (one can also call them abstractions, theories, or ontics): an intelligence architecture and a theory of agency. In the literature on Active Inference, little or no attention is given to this distinction, which leads to misinterpretations, such as when the writer used the term to refer to one concept, and the reader understood it as referring to another, or, even more likely, not realising the distinction in the first place.

In Active Inference, Parr, Pezzulo, and Friston have called these two conceptions the âLow Roadâ and the âHigh Road to Active Inferenceâ, and described them in chapters 2 and 3 of the book, respectively.

Active Inference as an architecture for intelligent agents
First, Active Inference can be seen as an architecture for autonomous intelligent agents. The main pillars of this architecture are variational Bayesian inference, planning-as-inference and action control-as-inference, and specification of preferences as a distribution over future observations (or hidden world states). This architecture can be implemented as an AI agent.

Parr, Pezzulo, and Friston see the process model of human intelligence on the neurobiological level as implementing this architecture. I think this position should be thought of as a subjective (or if you want, philosophical) view, rather than a falsifiable scientific claim.

This conception of Active Inference is directly comparable to Reinforcement Learning, LeCunâs vision for the architecture of autonomous machine intelligence, the architecture of Gato, ReduNets, and most cognitive architectures.

Normative engineering science tells us that architectures should be compared with respect to a set of desirable properties (characteristics) of the engineered physical objects that have these architectures, i. e., with respect to a concrete engineering task. In the realm of biological evolution, genotypes and memotypes of some species of living organisms can be evolved through evolution, and the biological âarchitecturesâ they entail should be compared to each other based on their fitness to a particular ecological niche or based on some other evolutionary metric of success, such as the total time of the survival of the respective phylogenetic subtree, the total number of organisms in the tree that have ever lived, the total number of positive-valence experiences those organisms have had, etc.).

Theories of agency
We should call the most universal descriptions of the desirable characteristics of agents theories of agency. These theories should be seen as both physical and normative.

Theories of agents are physical theories because there is nothing they can be based on than the broadest theories of physics that describe the environments in which these agents live. This is statistical mechanics for practically all non-virtual environments, though, at least in principle, we can imagine something like cosmic-scale agents, or agents inside black holes, the theories for which should be based on other theories of physics because statistical mechanics may be inapplicable to the respective spatiotemporal timescales or environments. Collective agency may also be conceptualised on a substrate which is best described by some theory other than statistical mechanics.

Theories of agency should also be seen as normative theories because they describe the âidealâ the agents should strive for and benchmark themselves against. In other words, a normative theory agency defines what agency is.

Normative physical theories of agency are falsifiable only from the perspective of ethical naturalism.

Active Inference as a theory of agency
Active Inference can be seen as a theory of agency, or a ânormative frameworkâ for living organisms, as Parr, Pezzulo, and Friston call it:

Active Inference is a normative framework to characterize Bayes-optimal behavior and cognition in living organisms. Its normative character is evinced in the idea that all facets of behavior and cognition in living organisms follow a unique imperative: minimizing the surprise of their sensory observations.

As a physical theory, Active Inference is based on statistical mechanics (Friston et al. 2021). This means that in principle, this theory is falsifiable in the naturalistic meta-ethical paradigm, though it would be very hard to conduct an appropriate experiment in the real world, and this experiment may need to take evolutionary time (millions of years) to complete.

The proposition that human behaviour conforms to Active Inference as a physical theory of agency (if one accepts this theory at all) trivially follows from the proposition that humans are agents (or: humans are biological organisms). As such, this is an obvious proposition, unlike the proposition mentioned above, namely that the process model of human intelligence on the neurobiological level implements Active Inference as an intelligence architecture.

Active Inference is not the only physical theory of agency which exists: Kolchinsky and Wolpert make an alternative proposal (see Kolchinsky and Wolpert 2018). Chan, Yu, and Youâs principle of Maximal Coding Rate Reduction (MCR^2) also looks to me like a physical theory, although the authors donât call it as such (Chan, Yu, You et al. 2022).

If one subscribes to normative Active Inference, intelligence architectures should be scored against their fitness to the framework. In this comparison, Active Inference as an architecture is, of course, unbeatable because the mathematics of these two conceptions of Active Inference (as an architecture and as a normative theory) are exactly the same.

However, if one desires an agent to have some extra characteristics beyond simply conforming to Active Inference as a normative theory (which means, beyond being simple instrumental convergence, because normative Active Inference exactly equals instrumental convergence; but note: not instead instrumental convergence, but instrumental convergence and something else), Active Inference as an intelligence architecture can become suboptimal: other architectures can conform to Active Inference as a general normative theory, but also provide those extra desired characteristics.

For example, in its most general form, normative Active Inference lefts unspecified where prior preferences come from; in a less general form, it states that prior preferences are beliefs provided via variational Bayesian inference, just as any other beliefs. The extra characteristics that engineers may want agents to have could concern the source of prior preferences1 / 1ChatGPTChatGPTThe article titled "The Two Conceptions of Active Inference: An Intelligence Architecture and a Theory of Agency" by Roman Leventov explores the distinction between two related but distinct concepts within the framework of active inference. Leventov highlights the importance of recognizing and understanding this distinction to avoid misinterpretations and confusion.The first conception of active inference discussed in the article is seen as an architecture for autonomous intelligent agents. It encompasses variational Bayesian inference, planning-as-inference, action control-as-inference, and the specification of preferences as a distribution over future observations. This architecture can be implemented in AI agents and is comparable to other frameworks such as Reinforcement Learning and cognitive architectures.The second conception focuses on active inference as a theory of agency, providing a normative framework for living organisms. This theory characterizes Bayes-optimal behavior and cognition in living organisms, emphasizing the imperative of minimizing surprise in sensory observations. Active inference as a theory of agency is grounded in statistical mechanics and defines the "ideal" behavior that agents should strive for.The article acknowledges that active inference is not the only physical theory of agency, mentioning alternative proposals such as Kolchinsky and Wolpert's and Chan, Yu, and You's principles. The normative framework of active inference can serve as a benchmark to evaluate different intelligence architectures based on their fitness to the framework. However, the article suggests that if additional characteristics beyond normative adherence are desired, other architectures may provide those characteristics more effectively.The connections with our previous discussion lie in the exploration of active inference as a framework for understanding cognition and perception. The distinction between the intelligence architecture and the theory of agency aligns with our exploration of active inference as a means of scientific exploration and as a perspective on human agency. The article adds depth to the understanding of active inference and its applications in different contexts, contributing to the broader conversation on complexity, information theory, and consciousness.1 / 1Active inference, and in particular its recent application to partially observable Markov decision processes (POMDPs; defined below), offers a unified mathematical framework for modeling perception, learning, and decision making (Da Costa, Parr et al., 2020, Friston et al., 2017c, Friston et al., 2018, Parr and Friston, 2018b). This framework treats each of these psychological processes, and their interactions, as interdependent forms of inference. Namely, decision-making agents are assumed to infer the probability of different external states and events in the environment â including their own actions â by combining prior beliefs with sensory input. Unlike âpassiveâ, perceptual inference processes (e.g., inferring the presence of an external object based on patterns of light impinging on the retina), the inferences underlying decision-making are âactiveâ, in the sense that the agent infers the actions most likely to generate preferred sensory input (e.g., inferring that eating some food will reduce a feeling of hunger). Agents also infer the actions most likely to reduce uncertainty and facilitate learning (e.g., inferring that opening the fridge will reveal available food options). This leads decision-making to favor actions that optimize a trade-off between maximizing reward and information gain. The resulting patterns of perception and behavior predicted by active inference match well with those observed empirically1 / 1ChatGPTChatGPTActive inference, as applied to partially observable Markov decision processes (POMDPs), provides a comprehensive mathematical framework for modeling perception, learning, and decision-making. In this framework, these psychological processes are treated as interdependent forms of inference, where decision-making agents infer the probabilities of different external states and events in the environment, including their own actions, by combining prior beliefs with sensory input.Unlike passive perceptual inference processes, which involve inferring the presence of external objects based on sensory input, the inferences underlying decision-making are active. This means that the agent infers the actions that are most likely to generate preferred sensory input, such as inferring that eating food will reduce hunger. Additionally, agents infer actions that reduce uncertainty and facilitate learning, such as inferring that opening the fridge will reveal available food options.In this framework, decision-making is guided by optimizing a trade-off between maximizing reward and information gain. This leads to patterns of perception and behavior that align well with empirical observations. The active inference framework provides a unified account of how perception, learning, and decision-making are interrelated and offers a way to model these processes mathematically.The application of active inference to POMDPs allows for a deeper understanding of the underlying mechanisms of decision-making and offers a tool for predicting and explaining human behavior in various contexts. By incorporating the principles of active inference, researchers can gain insights into how individuals make decisions based on their beliefs, sensory input, and the trade-off between reward and information gain.1 / 1The neural process theory associated with active inference has also successfully reproduced empirically observed neural responses in multiple research paradigms and generated novel, testable predictions (Friston et al., 2017a, Schwartenbeck et al., 2015, Whyte and Smith, 2020). Due to these and other considerations, this framework has become increasingly influential in recent years within psychology, neuroscience, and machine learning.1 / 1ChatGPTChatGPTThe neural process theory associated with active inference has demonstrated success in reproducing empirically observed neural responses across various research paradigms. By integrating the principles of active inference with neural modeling, researchers have been able to generate novel and testable predictions about neural activity.Studies utilizing the neural process theory of active inference, as described by Friston et al., Schwartenbeck et al., and Whyte and Smith, have shown that the framework can effectively explain and replicate neural responses observed in different experimental contexts. This provides evidence for the validity of the theory and its ability to capture the underlying neural mechanisms involved in perception, learning, and decision-making.The success of the neural process theory has contributed to the increasing influence of the active inference framework in fields such as psychology, neuroscience, and machine learning. Its ability to explain empirical observations and generate novel predictions has sparked interest and opened up new avenues for research in these disciplines.As the framework continues to evolve and accumulate empirical support, it is expected to further shape our understanding of neural processes and provide valuable insights into cognitive and computational mechanisms underlying human behavior.1 / 1beliefs about the current state of the world are all that matter for an agent when deciding which actions to take (i.e., that all knowledge about past states is implicitly âpacked intoâ beliefs about the current state). The agent then uses its model, combined with beliefs about the current state, to select actions by making predictions about possible future states. To be âpartially observableâ means that the agent can be uncertain in its beliefs about the state of the world it is in. In this case, states are referred to as âhiddenâ (as introduced above). The agent must infer how likely it is to be in one hidden state or another based on observations (i.e., sensory input) and use this information to select actions.

In active inference, these tasks are solved using a form of approximate inference known as variational inference (Attias, 2000, Beal, 2003, Markovic et al., 2021) for a brief introduction, see Appendix A). Broadly speaking, the idea behind variational inference is to convert the intractable sum or integral required to perform model inversion into an optimization problem that can be solved in a computationally efficient manner. This is accomplished by introducing an approximate posterior distribution over states, denoted , that makes simplifying assumptions about the nature of the true posterior distribution. For example, it is common to assume that hidden states under the approximate distribution do not interact (i.e., are independent), which gives the approximate distribution a much simpler mathematical form. Such assumptions are often violated, but the approximation is usually good enough in practice. Note that, despite its aim of approximating the true posterior , the approximate posterior  is typically not written as being conditioned on observations. This is because it does not directly depend on observations â it is simply an (initially arbitrary) distribution over states that is iteratively updated to match the true posterior distribution as closely as possible
https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S00222496210009731 / 1ChatGPTChatGPTIn active inference, an agent's beliefs about the current state of the world are considered crucial in decision-making. The agent's knowledge about past states is implicitly encapsulated within its beliefs about the current state. The agent utilizes its model and beliefs about the current state to predict and evaluate possible future states, which in turn guide its selection of actions.The term "partially observable" refers to situations where the agent has uncertainty or limited information about the current state of the world. In such cases, the states are considered "hidden," and the agent must infer the likelihood of being in different hidden states based on sensory observations. These inferred probabilities are then utilized to inform the agent's decision-making process.Active inference approaches the task of inference and decision-making using variational inference, which is a form of approximate inference. Variational inference aims to transform the computationally intractable task of model inversion into an optimization problem that can be efficiently solved. This is achieved by introducing an approximate posterior distribution over states, denoted as , which makes simplifying assumptions about the nature of the true posterior distribution. These assumptions often include the independence of hidden states under the approximate distribution, simplifying its mathematical representation. While such assumptions may not always hold true, they are typically sufficient for practical purposes. It is important to note that the approximate posterior distribution is not directly conditioned on observations since it is updated iteratively to better approximate the true posterior distribution.By utilizing variational inference and incorporating beliefs about the current state, active inference provides a framework for decision-making under partial observability. This approach has shown promise in various domains and is continually being refined and applied in fields such as neuroscience, psychology, and machine learning.1 / 1Front. Comput.

The active inference framework (AIF) is a promising new computational framework grounded in contemporary neuroscience that can produce human-like behavior through reward-based learning. In this study, we test the ability for the AIF to capture the role of anticipation in the visual guidance of action in humans through the systematic investigation of a visual-motor task that has been well-exploredâthat of intercepting a target moving over a ground plane. Previous research demonstrated that humans performing this task resorted to anticipatory changes in speed intended to compensate for semi-predictable changes in target speed later in the approach. To capture this behavior, our proposed âneuralâ AIF agent uses artificial neural networks to select actions on the basis of a very short term prediction of the information about the task environment that these actions would reveal along with a long-term estimate of the resulting cumulative expected free energy. Systematic variation revealed that anticipatory behavior emerged only when required by limitations on the agent's movement capabilities, and only when the agent was able to estimate accumulated free energy over sufficiently long durations into the future. In addition, we present a novel formulation of the prior mapping function that maps a multi-dimensional world-state to a uni-dimensional distribution of free-energy/reward. Together, these results demonstrate the use of AIF as a plausible model of anticipatory visually guided behavior in humans.

1. Introduction
The active inference framework (AIF) (Friston et al., 2009) is an emerging theory of neural encoding and processing that captures a wide range of cognitive, perceptual, and motor phenomena, while also offering a neurobiologically plausible means of conducting reward-based learning through the capacity to predict sensory information. The behavior of an AIF agent involves the selection of action-plans that span into the near future and centers around the learning of a probabilistic generative model of the world through interaction with the environment. Ultimately, the agent must take action such that it is making progress toward its goals (goal-seeking behavior) while also balancing the drive to explore and understand its environment (information maximizing behavior), adjusting the internal states of its world to better account for the evidence that it acquires over time. As a result, AIF unifies perception, action, and learning by framing them as processes that result from approximate Bayesian inference.

The AIF framework has been used to study a variety of reinforcement learning (RL) tasks, including the inverted pendulum problem (CartPole) (Millidge, 2020; Shin et al., 2022), the mountain car problem (MountainCar) (Friston et al., 2009; UeltzhÃ¶ffer, 2018; Ãatal et al., 2020; Tschantz et al., 2020a; Shin et al., 2022) and the frozen lake problem (Frozen Lake) (Sajid et al., 2021). Each task places different demands on motor and cognitive abilities. For instance, CartPole requires online control of a paddle to balance a pole upright, whereas MountainCar requires intelligent exploration of the task environment; a simple âgreedyâ policy (typical of many modern-day RL approaches) would fail to solve the problem. The popular Frozen Lake requires skills related to spatial navigation and planning if the agent is to find the goal while avoiding unsafe states.

One fundamental aspect of human and animal behavior that has so far not been sufficiently studied from an active inference perspective is the on-line visual guidance of locomotion. On-line visual guidance comprises a class of ecologically important behaviors for which movements of the body are continuously regulated based on currently available visual information seen from the first-person perspective. Some of the most extensively studied tasks include steering toward a goal (Warren et al., 2010), negotiating complex terrain on foot (Matthis and Fajen, 2013; Diaz et al., 2018), intercepting moving targets (Fajen and Warren, 2007), braking to avoid a collision (Yilmaz and Warren, 1995; Fajen and Devaney, 2006), and intercepting a fly ball (Chapman, 1968; Fajen et al., 2008). For each of these tasks, researchers have formulated control strategies that capture the coupling of visual information and action1 / 1ChatGPTChatGPTThe article titled "A neural active inference model of perceptual-motor learning" explores the application of the active inference framework (AIF) to the study of visual-motor learning. The AIF is a computational framework grounded in neuroscience that aims to produce human-like behavior through reward-based learning. The study investigates the role of anticipation in the visual guidance of action, specifically in the context of intercepting a target moving over a ground plane.The researchers propose a "neural" AIF agent that utilizes artificial neural networks to select actions based on short-term predictions of task environment information and long-term estimates of cumulative expected free energy. The agent's behavior is influenced by limitations on movement capabilities and the ability to estimate accumulated free energy over extended durations into the future. The study also introduces a novel formulation of the prior mapping function that maps a multi-dimensional world-state to a uni-dimensional distribution of free-energy/reward.The results demonstrate that the AIF framework can effectively capture anticipatory visually guided behavior in humans. Anticipatory changes in speed, compensating for semi-predictable changes in target speed, emerged when the agent's movement capabilities were limited and it could estimate accumulated free energy over sufficient time durations.The introduction of the article provides an overview of the AIF framework and its application in studying cognitive, perceptual, and motor phenomena. The AIF framework integrates perception, action, and learning by framing them as processes resulting from approximate Bayesian inference. It has been applied to various reinforcement learning tasks, such as the inverted pendulum problem, mountain car problem, and frozen lake problem, each highlighting different motor and cognitive abilities.The article emphasizes the need for further exploration of on-line visual guidance of locomotion from an active inference perspective, highlighting its ecological importance and the coupling of visual information and action in tasks like steering toward a goal, negotiating complex terrain, intercepting moving targets, braking to avoid collisions, and intercepting fly balls.Overall, the study contributes to the understanding of perceptual-motor learning using the active inference framework and highlights its potential for explaining human behavior in tasks requiring visual guidance and action regulation.1 / 1highlighting a route to sample efficient learning algorithms.

Author summary
Within the popular framework of âactive inferenceâ, organisms learn internal models of their environments and use the models to guide goal-directed behaviour. A challenge for this framework is to explain how such models can be learned in practice, given (i) the rich complexity of natural environments, and (ii) the circular dependence of model learning and sensory sampling, which may lead to behaviourally suboptimal models being learned. Here, we develop an approach in which organisms selectively model those aspects of the environment that are relevant for acting in a goal-directed manner. Learning such âaction-orientedâ models requires that agents balance information-seeking and goal-directed actions in a principled manner, such that both learning and information seeking are contextualised by goals. Using a combination of theory and simulation modelling, we show that this approach allows simple but effective models to be learned from relatively few interactions with the environment. Crucially, our results suggest that action-oriented models can support adaptive behaviour in spite of, and indeed because of, their departure from accurate representations of the environment.1 / 1ChatGPTChatGPTThe article explores the challenge of learning internal models of the environment within the framework of active inference. Active inference posits that organisms learn and utilize these models to guide goal-directed behavior. However, learning such models is challenging due to the complexity of natural environments and the circular dependence between model learning and sensory sampling, which can result in suboptimal models being learned.The authors propose an approach where organisms selectively model aspects of the environment that are relevant for goal-directed actions. These "action-oriented" models allow agents to balance information-seeking and goal-directed actions in a principled manner, contextualizing both learning and information-seeking within the framework of goals. The approach is supported by theoretical analysis and simulation modeling.The results demonstrate that by focusing on action-oriented models, organisms can learn effective models from relatively few interactions with the environment. Importantly, the findings suggest that these action-oriented models can support adaptive behavior despite their departure from accurate representations of the environment.The author summary highlights the significance of the approach in addressing the challenge of model learning in active inference. By selectively modeling aspects relevant to goal-directed actions and balancing information-seeking with goals, organisms can develop simple yet effective models. The departure from accurate representations of the environment is seen as a trade-off that enables adaptive behavior.Overall, the article presents a route to sample efficient learning algorithms within the active inference framework, shedding light on how organisms can learn and utilize internal models for goal-directed behavior in complex environments.1 / 1Active Inference: Demystified and Compared

Abstract
Active inference is a first principle account of how autonomous agents operate in dynamic, nonstationary environments. This problem is also considered in reinforcement learning, but limited work exists on comparing the two approaches on the same discrete-state environments. In this letter, we provide (1) an accessible overview of the discrete-state formulation of active inference, highlighting natural behaviors in active inference that are generally engineered in reinforcement learning, and (2) an explicit discrete-state comparison between active inference and reinforcement learning on an OpenAI gym baseline. We begin by providing a condensed overview of the active inference literature, in particular viewing the various natural behaviors of active inference agents through the lens of reinforcement learning. We show that by operating in a pure belief-based setting, active inference agents can carry out epistemic exploration-and account for uncertainty about their environment-in a Bayes-optimal fashion. Furthermore, we show that the reliance on an explicit reward signal in reinforcement learning is removed in active inference, where reward can simply be treated as another observation we have a preference over; even in the total absence of rewards, agent behaviors are learned through preference learning. We make these properties explicit by showing two scenarios in which active inference agents can infer behaviors in reward-free environments compared to both Q-learning and Bayesian model-based reinforcement learning agents and by placing zero prior preferences over rewards and learning the prior preferences over the observations corresponding to reward. We conclude by noting that this formalism can be applied to more complex settings (e.g., robotic arm movement, Atari games) if appropriate generative models can be formulated. In short, we aim to demystify the behavior of active inference agents by presenting an accessible discrete state-space and time formulation and demonstrate these behaviors in a OpenAI gym environment, alongside reinforcement learning agents1 / 1ChatGPTChatGPTThe article titled "Active Inference: Demystified and Compared" provides an accessible overview of the discrete-state formulation of active inference and compares it to reinforcement learning.

Abstract
Information gathering comprises actions whose (sensory) consequences resolve uncertainty (i.e., are salient). In other words, actions that solicit salient information cause the greatest shift in beliefs (i.e., information gain) about the causes of our sensations. However, not all information is relevant to the task at hand: this is especially the case in complex, naturalistic scenes. This paper introduces a formal model of selective attention based on active inference and contextual epistemic foraging. We consider a visual search task with a special emphasis on goal-directed and task-relevant exploration. In this scheme, attention modulates the expected fidelity (precision) of the mapping between observations and hidden states in a state-dependent or context-sensitive manner. This ensures task-irrelevant observations have little expected information gain, and so the agent â driven to reduce expected surprise (i.e., uncertainty) â does not actively seek them out. Instead, it selectively samples task-relevant observations, which inform (task-relevant) hidden states. We further show, through simulations, that the atypical exploratory behaviours in conditions such as autism and anxiety may be due to a failure to appropriately modulate sensory precision in a context-specific way.

Introduction
Our aim is to provide a âfirst principleâ account of endogenous attention that emphasises the intimate relationships between overt attention and saccadic searches, and covert attention and salience. Imagine that you are at your desk and looking around for your red pen. How could one account for the ensuing saccadic eye movements from first principles. The basic idea pursued below is that every action â overt or covert â is in the game of resolving uncertainty by sampling the sensorium to reduce expected surprise (or a variational bound on surprise called free energy). This is known as active inference and requires us to commit to actions that have the greatest epistemic affordance or information gain. So how does this explain how we look for a âred penâ?

Put simply, if we are compelled to sample the most salient, uncertainty reducing part of the visual scene, then it is sufficient to increase the precision or informativeness of the visual features that a âred penâ possesses â and decrease the precision of all other features. More colloquially, it is sufficient to render ârednessâ and âpen-nessâ more salient. Notice that there is a fundamental distinction between making some attributes more salient â by biasing their contribution to epistemic affordance â and simply adjusting the attentional gain (i.e., precision) of different sensory streams. In this model of selective (i.e., endogenous) attention, the selection is proactive: it is mediated by making certain sensations more attractive to sample, before they are actually sampled. In this sense, selective attention becomes part of planning a saccadic eye movement, not simply attending to the sensory consequences of that movement. This reading of selective attention is closely related to premotor theories of attention1 â that emphasise the enactive aspect of both overt and covert (active) vision, which (from a computational perspective) renders endogenous attention an important part of âplanning as inferenceâ2. In what follows, we try to unpick the intimate relationship between attention, precision, salience and epistemic affordance3,4,51 / 1ChatGPTChatGPTThe article titled "Introducing a Bayesian Model of Selective Attention Based on Active Inference" presents a formal model of selective attention using active inference and contextual epistemic foraging. The authors focus on a visual search task and examine how attention modulates the expected fidelity of the mapping between observations and hidden states in a state-dependent or context-sensitive manner.The main idea is that attention directs the agent's focus towards task-relevant observations that provide information about the hidden states of interest, while task-irrelevant observations have little expected information gain. By reducing uncertainty and expected surprise, the agent selectively samples task-relevant observations to inform its beliefs.The authors highlight the relationship between attention, precision, salience, and epistemic affordance. They argue that making certain sensory features more salient, by increasing their precision or informativeness, can effectively guide attention towards specific targets. This proactive selection of salient sensory features becomes part of planning saccadic eye movements, integrating selective attention into the process of "planning as inference."Through simulations, the authors also explore how this model of selective attention can explain atypical exploratory behaviors observed in conditions such as autism and anxiety. They suggest that a failure to appropriately modulate sensory precision in a context-specific way may underlie these behaviors.Overall, the article introduces a Bayesian model of selective attention within the active inference framework and demonstrates how attention can be guided by the precision of sensory features. It provides insights into the role of attention in visual search tasks and its potential implications for understanding abnormal attentional behaviors.1 / 1Published: 31 May 2023

Abstract
The anatomy of the brain necessarily constrains its function, but precisely how remains unclear. The classical and dominant paradigm in neuroscience is that neuronal dynamics are driven by interactions between discrete, functionally specialized cell populations connected by a complex array of axonal fibres1,2,3. However, predictions from neural field theory, an established mathematical framework for modelling large-scale brain activity4,5,6, suggest that the geometry of the brain may represent a more fundamental constraint on dynamics than complex interregional connectivity7,8. Here, we confirm these theoretical predictions by analysing human magnetic resonance imaging data acquired under spontaneous and diverse task-evoked conditions. Specifically, we show that cortical and subcortical activity can be parsimoniously understood as resulting from excitations of fundamental, resonant modes of the brainâs geometry (that is, its shape) rather than from modes of complex interregional connectivity, as classically assumed. We then use these geometric modes to show that task-evoked activations across over 10,000 brain maps are not confined to focal areas, as widely believed, but instead excite brain-wide modes with wavelengths spanning over 60âmm. Finally, we confirm predictions that the close link between geometry and function is explained by a dominant role for wave-like activity, showing that wave dynamics can reproduce numerous canonical spatiotemporal properties of spontaneous and evoked recordings. Our findings challenge prevailing views and identify a previously underappreciated role of geometry in shaping function, as predicted by a unifying and physically principled model of brain-wide dynamics.

Main
The dynamics of many natural systems are fundamentally constrained by their underlying structure. For instance, the shape of a drum influences its acoustic properties, the morphology of a river bed shapes underwater currents and the geometry of a protein determines the molecules with which it can interact9. The nervous system is no exception, with the rich and complex spatiotemporal dynamics of anatomically distributed neuronal populations being supported by their intricate web of axonal interconnectivity1,10. Several studies have shown correlations between various properties of brain connectivity and activity11, but precisely how spatiotemporal patterns of neural dynamics are constrained by a relatively stable neuroanatomical scaffold remains unclear.

In diverse areas of physics and engineering, structural constraints on system dynamics can be understood via the systemâs eigenmodes, which are fundamental spatial patterns corresponding to the natural, resonant modes of the system12. In the linear regime, such as brain activity under normal (that is, non-seizure-like) conditions13, eigenmodes (hereafter also referred to as modes) offer a particularly powerful and rigorous formalism for linking brain anatomy with the physical processes that shape activity. Through this lens, spatiotemporal patterns of neuronal dynamics emerge from excitations of the brainâs structural eigenmodes, much like the harmonics of a plucked violin string arise from vibrations of its own resonant modes.

Critically, just as the resonant frequencies of a violin string are determined by its length, density and tension, the eigenmodes of the brain are determined by its structuralâphysical, geometric and anatomicalâproperties. Do any of these specific structural properties make a dominant contribution to dynamics? Here we test two influential and competing theories that make different predictions about which key elements of brain structure shape function1 / 1ChatGPTChatGPTThe article titled "Geometric Constraints on Human Brain Function" explores the relationship between the geometry of the brain and its functional dynamics. The authors challenge the classical paradigm in neuroscience, which emphasizes complex interregional connectivity, by proposing that the brain's geometry may represent a more fundamental constraint on its dynamics.Using human magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) data acquired during spontaneous and task-evoked conditions, the authors analyze cortical and subcortical activity. They demonstrate that the brain's activity can be understood as excitations of fundamental resonant modes of its geometry, rather than modes of interregional connectivity as traditionally assumed. This suggests that the brain's shape plays a crucial role in shaping its functional dynamics.The authors further show that task-evoked activations across various brain maps do not confine to focal areas but instead excite brain-wide modes with wavelengths spanning over 60 mm. This challenges the widely held belief that activations are localized and highlights the importance of considering brain-wide dynamics.By linking geometry and function, the authors confirm predictions that wave-like activity plays a dominant role in the brain. They demonstrate that wave dynamics can reproduce canonical spatiotemporal properties observed in both spontaneous and evoked recordings.Overall, the study reveals the significant influence of the brain's geometry on its functional dynamics, providing insights into the fundamental constraints that shape brain activity. This work challenges prevailing views in neuroscience and offers a physically principled model of brain-wide dynamics based on geometric constraints.1 / 1Geometric modes constrain cortical activity
We first examine the degree to which geometric eigenmodes can explain diverse aspects of human neocortical activity. To derive the eigenmodes, we use a mesh representation of a population-averaged template of the neocortical surface (Fig. 1a and Derivation of cortical geometric eigenmodes in Methods). We then construct the LaplaceâBeltrami operator (LBO) from this surface mesh, which captures local vertex-to-vertex spatial relations and curvature, and solve the eigenvalue problem,

â2Ï=ÎÏ=âÎ»Ï,

where â is the gradient operator, Î is the LBO and Ï={Ï1(r),Ï2(r),â¦} is the family of geometric eigenmodes with the corresponding family of eigenvalues Î»={Î»1,Î»2,â¦}. The eigenvalues are ordered sequentially according to the spatial frequency or wavelength of the spatial patterns of each mode (Fig. 1a and Extended Data Fig. 1), such that Ï1 is the mode with the longest wavelength. The resulting eigenmodes are orthogonal, forming a complete basis set to decompose spatiotemporal dynamics unfolding on the cortex as a weighted sum of modes with varying wavelengths (Fig. 1b and Modal decomposition of brain activity in Methods). Unless otherwise specified, we use Nâ=â200 modes throughout this study.1 / 1ChatGPTChatGPTIn the study titled "Geometric Modes Constrain Cortical Activity," the authors investigate how geometric eigenmodes can explain various aspects of human neocortical activity. They start by representing the neocortical surface using a mesh representation of a population-averaged template. From this surface mesh, they construct the Laplace-Beltrami operator (LBO) that captures local spatial relations and curvature.By solving the eigenvalue problem, â^2Ï = ÎÏ = -Î»Ï, where â is the gradient operator, Î is the LBO, Ï is the family of geometric eigenmodes, and Î» is the corresponding family of eigenvalues, they obtain a set of geometric eigenmodes. These eigenmodes are ordered based on their spatial frequency or wavelength, with Ï1 being the mode with the longest wavelength.The resulting eigenmodes form an orthogonal and complete basis set. They can be used to decompose spatiotemporal dynamics unfolding on the cortex as a weighted sum of modes with varying wavelengths. The authors use 200 modes for their analyses.This decomposition allows the authors to examine how different modes contribute to cortical activity and understand the influence of geometric constraints on brain dynamics. By studying the eigenmodes, they aim to uncover the underlying patterns and relationships in neocortical activity.1 / 1We next test the hypothesis that geometric eigenmodes provide a more parsimonious and fundamental description of dynamics than eigenmodes derived from a graph-based connectome approximation. To this end we compare the reconstruction accuracy of geometric eigenmodes against three alternative connectome-derived eigenmode basis sets (see Fig. 2a for a schematic). The first basis set is derived empirically from a connectome mapped with dMRI tractography at vertex resolution and thresholded to obtain a connection density of 0.10%, as done previously29 (Derivation of connectome eigenmodes in Methods). The second basis set is derived from a connectome constructed synthetically according to a homogeneous stochastic wiring process governed by an exponential distance-dependent connection probability to mimic simple, EDR-like connectivity (Derivation of EDR eigenmodes in Methods). Because the connection densities of empirical and EDR connectomes differed, we evaluated a third basis set derived from the empirical connectome thresholded at 1.55% to match the density of the EDR connectome. The connectome, EDR and density-matched connectome eigenmodes described above are derived from the graph Laplacian (a discrete counterpart of the LBO) of their respective connectivity matrices (Fig. 2b and Extended Data Fig. 1).1 / 1ChatGPTChatGPTIn order to compare the efficacy of geometric eigenmodes with eigenmodes derived from a graph-based connectome approximation, the authors conducted a reconstruction accuracy analysis. They used three alternative connectome-derived eigenmode basis sets for comparison.The first basis set was derived empirically from a connectome constructed using diffusion magnetic resonance imaging (dMRI) tractography at vertex resolution. The connectome was then thresholded to achieve a connection density of 0.10%. This approach had been previously employed in similar studies.The second basis set was derived from a synthetic connectome constructed using a homogeneous stochastic wiring process. The connection probability in this synthetic connectome followed an exponential distance-dependent rule to mimic simple connectivity patterns similar to the Empirical Dynamic Range (EDR) model.Given the difference in connection densities between the empirical and EDR connectomes, a third basis set was derived from the empirical connectome but was thresholded at 1.55% to match the density of the EDR connectome.All three sets of connectome-derived eigenmodes were derived from the graph Laplacian, which is a discrete counterpart of the Laplace-Beltrami operator (LBO), based on their respective connectivity matrices.By comparing the reconstruction accuracy of the geometric eigenmodes with these alternative connectome-derived eigenmodes, the authors aimed to assess which basis set provides a more parsimonious and fundamental description of dynamics in the brain.1 / 1The signal to noise ratio in fmri is generally weaker in non-neocortical structures than in the neocortex113. Moreover, fine-grained task activations are often hard to resolve in these smaller structures due to the limited resolution of fMRI and the spatial smoothing induced by common fMRI processing methods. Thus, to efficiently map the functional organization of the thalamus, striatum and hippocampus we used connectopic mapping49 of the resting-state fMRI signals in each structure to obtain their dominant functional modes (often called gradients, although the patterns capture spatial variations in pointwise similarities of FC profiles). This technique, and related procedures, have been extensively used in past work to study the functional organization of these structures114,115,116.

We applied connectopic mapping to the volumetric voxel-wise resting-state fMRI data of the HCP individuals following the procedure described in ref. 49. Specifically, for each individual and non-neocortical ROI (that is, thalamus, striatum and hippocampus) we constructed an ROI time-series data matrix, A, of size TâÃâN, where T is the number of time frames and N is the number of voxels in the ROI. Similarly, for each individual we constructed the grey matter time-series data matrix, B, of size TâÃâM, where M is the number of grey matter voxels outside the ROI. Because M is generally large (103 or above), we reduced the dimensionality of B using singular value decomposition to construct the matrix BË of size TâÃâ(Tâââ1). The connectivity fingerprint of every voxel within the ROI was then calculated using the Pearson correlation of A and BË to obtain the matrix, C, of size NâÃâ(Tâââ1). Similarity in the connectivity fingerprints between each pair of ROI voxels was calculated using the Î·2 coefficient117, resulting in the matrix, S, of size NâÃâN. The Î·2 coefficient represents the fraction of variance in one connectivity profile accounted for by the variance in another. We then took the average S across all individuals. A nonlinear manifold learning procedure using the Laplacian Eigenmaps algorithm118 was applied to the S matrix of each ROI to calculate its eigenvectors and eigenvalues. The eigenvectors represent the functional patterns, termed functional gradients, of the ROI, ordered according to the variance in FC similarity they explain. We only analysed the first 20ânon-constant gradients to enable direct comparisons with the geometric eigenmodes. Typical applications of FC-based gradient analysis rarely consider more than the first five gradients49,119.

We analysed the correspondence between the geometric eigenmodes and functional gradients in each non-neocortical structure by taking their absolute spatial correlations, given that the signs of the modes and gradients are arbitrary. Moreover, the ordering of the geometric eigenmodes within the same eigengroup can change (Supplementary Table 1; for example, the first eigengroup can have order flips among modes 2â4) and hence one-to-one correspondence between the indices of geometric eigenmodes and functional gradients is not guaranteed. We therefore examined all possible pairwise correlations between the modes and gradients and evaluated correspondence with respect to the mode that maximally correlated with each gradient. The maximal order differences observed between geometric modes and functional gradients were one, eight and five out of 20 for the thalamus, striatum and hippocampus, respectively.1 / 1ChatGPTChatGPTIn order to map the functional organization of non-neocortical structures (thalamus, striatum, and hippocampus), the authors utilized connectopic mapping of resting-state fMRI signals. This approach allowed them to identify the dominant functional modes, often referred to as gradients, within these structures.For each individual and non-neocortical region of interest (ROI), the authors constructed an ROI time-series data matrix (A) and a grey matter time-series data matrix (B) using voxel-wise resting-state fMRI data. To reduce the dimensionality of the grey matter matrix (B), singular value decomposition was applied to obtain a reduced matrix (BË). The connectivity fingerprint of each voxel within the ROI was calculated by correlating matrix A with matrix BË. This resulted in a connectivity matrix (C) representing the pairwise connectivity between ROI voxels.To assess the similarity in connectivity fingerprints between each pair of ROI voxels, the authors used the Î·2 coefficient. This coefficient represents the fraction of variance in one connectivity profile accounted for by the variance in another. The average connectivity matrix (S) across all individuals was then obtained.To identify the functional gradients within each ROI, a nonlinear manifold learning procedure using the Laplacian Eigenmaps algorithm was applied to the connectivity matrix (S). This resulted in the calculation of eigenvectors and eigenvalues, with the eigenvectors representing the functional patterns or gradients. Only the first 20 non-constant gradients were analyzed for direct comparisons with the geometric eigenmodes.The authors examined the correspondence between the geometric eigenmodes and functional gradients in each non-neocortical structure by calculating the absolute spatial correlations between them. Since the signs of the modes and gradients are arbitrary, and the ordering of the geometric eigenmodes can change within the same eigengroup, a one-to-one correspondence between their indices is not guaranteed. Therefore, all possible pairwise correlations between the modes and gradients were examined, and the mode that maximally correlated with each gradient was identified. The maximal order differences observed between the geometric modes and functional gradients ranged from one to eight for the thalamus, striatum, and hippocampus.1 / 1Connections between the previous topics.1 / 1ChatGPTChatGPTThe previous topics of active inference, geometric constraints on brain function, and connectopic mapping provide different perspectives on understanding brain function and cognition. Here are some connections between these topics:Active Inference and Geometric Constraints: Active inference is a framework that describes how autonomous agents operate in dynamic environments by inferring and acting upon the most salient information. Geometric constraints on brain function, as described in the study on cortical geometric eigenmodes, propose that the geometry of the brain plays a fundamental role in shaping brain dynamics. Active inference, with its focus on information gathering and resolving uncertainty, can be influenced by the underlying geometric constraints of the brain. The geometry of the brain, as captured by geometric eigenmodes, may shape the expectations and predictions made by active inference agents.Active Inference and Connectopic Mapping: Active inference involves the selection of actions based on beliefs and predictions about the environment. Connectopic mapping, on the other hand, focuses on mapping the functional organization of brain regions by analyzing resting-state functional connectivity. Both active inference and connectopic mapping provide insights into how the brain processes and integrates information. Active inference considers the role of information gain and reward in shaping behavior, while connectopic mapping explores the patterns of functional connectivity within the brain. Integrating these approaches could provide a more comprehensive understanding of how brain regions interact and coordinate their activity during information processing.Geometric Constraints and Connectopic Mapping: The study on geometric constraints on brain function highlights the role of brain geometry in shaping brain dynamics. Connectopic mapping, on the other hand, examines the functional organization of brain regions based on their resting-state functional connectivity patterns. The geometric constraints of the brain, as captured by geometric eigenmodes, may influence the patterns of functional connectivity observed in connectopic mapping. Understanding the relationship between brain geometry and functional connectivity can provide insights into how the underlying brain structure shapes information processing and cognitive functions.Overall, these topics provide complementary perspectives on understanding brain function, cognition, and information processing. Integrating concepts from active inference, geometric constraints, and connectopic mapping can contribute to a more comprehensive and unified understanding of the brain and its cognitive processes.1 / 1A list of everything we've talked about so far.1 / 1ChatGPTChatGPTCertainly!
