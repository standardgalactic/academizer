What is the purpose of a propagating null wavefront in null convention logic?
Nuspeak Translator
In Null Convention Logic (NCL), a propagating null wavefront plays a crucial role. It is a special type of signal used to indicate that a device or part of a circuit is not currently transmitting data. This aspect of NCL is central to its design for asynchronous communication, where data is transmitted without a clock signal to synchronize the transmission.
The propagating null-wavefront, which is a high impedance state, is significant for several reasons:
Indicates Inactivity:
It shows when a device is not transmitting data. This is important in NCL because devices are not required to transmit data continuously.
Efficient Resource Use:
The use of propagating null-wavefronts allows for the efficient use of communication resources. Devices can transmit data only when necessary and return to a high impedance state when not transmitting.
Complex Protocol Implementation:
It facilitates the implementation of complex communication protocols. Devices can coordinate data transmission using handshaking signals and arbitration, allowing for efficient and conflict-free communication.
Diagnostic Tool:
The presence or absence of a propagating null-wavefront can serve as a diagnostic tool to assess if a device or circuit is functioning correctly or if there is an issue with the communication protocol.
In summary, the propagating null-wavefront in NCL provides a mechanism for efficient, asynchronous data transmission and is key to the functionality and reliability of systems designed using this logic.

Abstract
We had shown that synthetic rat scotophobin A caused several effects upon goldfish, apparently mediated by the pineal gland. Here we report that norepinephrine decreased goldfish dark avoidance in a manner that was blocked by scotophobin or pinealectomy. Increased dark avoidance was caused by either propranolol or scotophobin alone. Certain components of the pineal melatonin pathway also affected goldfish light-dark preference: serotonin, and especially N-acetylserotonin, increased dark avoidance, as did the hydroxyindole-O-methyl-transferase (HIOMT) product inhibitor, S-adenosyl-homocysteine. Melatonin and S-adenosyl-methionine were without effect in this regard. Pinealectomy prevented the dark avoidance increase caused by serotonin and N-acetylserotonin. These data suggested that increased dark avoidance behavior in goldfish was correlated with N-acetylserotonin buildup in the pineal, and that scotophobin could cause this, if it were to inhibit pineal HIOMT. To test this hypothesis the effect of various agents upon pineal melatonin levels was determined. Scotophobin was found to both reduce pineal melatonin and to block the melatonin-increasing effect of N-acetylserotonin. This led to the discovery that, indeed, scotophobin was an effective inhibitor (KI50, 6 x 10(-7) M) of purified bovine HIOMT.

The study by N Satake et al. from 1979 investigated the effects of scotophobin A, a synthetic compound, on goldfish behavior, specifically focusing on dark avoidance and its relation to the pineal gland. Key findings include:
Effect of Scotophobin and Pinealectomy:
Scotophobin A and pinealectomy (removal of the pineal gland) were found to block the decrease in dark avoidance behavior caused by norepinephrine in goldfish.
Dark Avoidance Behavior:
Increased dark avoidance in goldfish was observed with the administration of scotophobin alone or propranolol (a beta-blocker).
Role of Pineal Melatonin Pathway:
Components of this pathway, particularly serotonin and N-acetylserotonin, were found to increase dark avoidance in goldfish. However, melatonin and S-adenosyl-methionine did not have this effect.
Pinealectomy's Impact:
Removing the pineal gland prevented the increase in dark avoidance caused by serotonin and N-acetylserotonin, suggesting a pineal-related mechanism.
N-acetylserotonin Buildup:
The study hypothesized that increased dark avoidance behavior is correlated with the buildup of N-acetylserotonin in the pineal gland.
Scotophobin's Effect on Pineal Melatonin Levels:
Scotophobin reduced pineal melatonin levels and blocked the increase in melatonin typically caused by N-acetylserotonin.
Scotophobin as HIOMT Inhibitor:
The research found scotophobin to be an effective inhibitor of hydroxyindole-O-methyl-transferase (HIOMT), an enzyme involved in melatonin synthesis.
In conclusion, the study demonstrated that scotophobin A influences dark avoidance behavior in goldfish by modulating the pineal melatonin pathway, particularly through the inhibition of HIOMT and the resulting changes in N-acetylserotonin levels.

A peptide (15 aa) isolated from the brains of rats that were trained to fear the dark. The claim that this dark-aversion was transferable to naive animals has been considered rather improbable, although there does seem to be some positive experimental data for pharmacological effects of the peptide.

Scotophobin is a peptide consisting of 15 amino acids, which was isolated from the brains of rats trained to exhibit fear of the dark. The initial claim associated with scotophobin was that this dark-aversion behavior could be transferred to naive animals who had not undergone the same fear conditioning. This concept, however, has been met with skepticism and considered improbable by many in the scientific community.
Despite the controversy surrounding the behavioral transferability of scotophobin, there is some experimental evidence suggesting that the peptide does have pharmacological effects. These effects have been studied to understand the mechanisms by which scotophobin might influence fear or aversion behaviors, particularly in relation to the role of the pineal gland and associated neurochemical pathways in animals.

Re: Haeckel and N-rays: Fraud or self-deception ?

Greetings Pim:
Thanks for the additional information. Now, here is an example of a
supposed fraud that actually turned out to be real, like Haeckel's drawings.

In 1968 a neuroscientist by the name of Georges Unger working at the Baylor
College of Medicine claimed to have isolated a peptide that would transfer
scotophobia (fear of the dark) to animals that did not display that behavior
[Unger, Galvan and Clark. _Nature_ 217, 1259-1261 (1968)]. He had taught
rats to be scotophobic (not a normal condition for rats), then harvested and
pureed their brains before injecting the extracts into mice. The mice then
displayed scotophobia without having been trained. Unger isolated the
peptide and demonstrated that it too would induce scotophobia in mice. He
named the peptide _scotophobin_. Four years later he announced that he had
sequenced and synthesized the peptide, and that the synthetic peptide also
induced scotophobia in mice [Unger, Desiderio and Parr. _Nature_ 238,
198-202 (1972)]. Unger then went on to isolate other fear-inducing peptides
before he died in the mid-Eighties.

The same pattern as for N-rays and polywater was repeated, with some
researchers being able to reproduce Unger's results in mice, goldfish and
hamsters (to name a few species), while others could not. [See Wilson.
_Nature_ 320, 313-314 (1986) for a short review.] Some researchers
questioned the accuracy of Unger's structure for scotophobin, some suggested
that the synthetic peptide could induce scotophobia but that no natural
scotophobin had ever been produced, some suggested that scotophobin simply
increased an animals overall level of activity so it only seemed like it
avoided the dark, and some suggested the whole affair was simply another
case of wishful thinking. It wasn't long before scientific historians were
comparing scotophobin with N-rays and polywater. Even today there are
historians, scientists and textbooks who claim scotophobin was a fraud and
that it did real harm to neuroscience. The parallels with Haeckel and his
drawings are too strong to ignore.

However, unlike N-rays and polywater, the transfer of scotophobia by
scotophobin was verified as a real phenomenon by the discovery of the
peptide's mechanism of action. A series of papers by Satake and Morton were
published in the journal _Pharmacology and Biochemistry of Behavior_ in 1979
[10(2):183-188; 10(4):449-456; and 10(4):457-462] which showed how
scotophobin could induce scotophobia.

In the first paper, the authors demonstrated that the pineal gland was the
likely site of action for scotophobin. They noted that scotophobin
increased dark avoidance, increased shock sensitivity and suppressed the
norepinephrine-induced aggregation of chromatophores in goldfish. The
researchers also noted that goldfish that had undergone a pinealectomy were
reported to show the same results. Finally they noted that chromatophore
aggregation was controlled in part by pineal melatonin.

In the second paper, the authors demonstrated that scotophobin inhibited the
pineal enzyme hydroxyindole-O-methyl-transferase (HIOMT) which is necessary
in the biosynthesis of melatonin (a neurotransmitter). HIOMT converts
N-acetylserotonin (NAS) to melatonin by the transfer of a methane group
(methylation) from the methyl donor S-adenosylmethionine (SAM), producing
S-adenosylhomocysteine (SAH). Norepinephrine (another neurotransmitter),
which decreases dark avoidance, is known to induce this reaction, whereas
SAH, serotonin (another neurotransmitter and precursor to N-acetylserotonin)
and NAS itself increased dark avoidance. This suggested that increased dark
avoidance was linked to an increase in NAS levels in the pineal and that
inhibition of HIOMT by scotophobin would cause this increase. To test this
hypothesis they measured pineal melatonin levels in the presence and absence
of SAH and scotophobin. The former, being a known inhibitor of HIOMT, did
indeed reduce melatonin levels; scotophobin did the same, reinforcing its
role as an HIOMT inhibitor. The authors later verified that scotophobin
directly inhibited purified HIOMT.

In the third paper, the authors determined the actual mechanism of
scotophobin. HIOMT binds SAM first, then binds NAS in close proximity,
creating a transitional compound by binding NAS to SAM directly. The
unstable compound then breaks about into melatonin and SAH, which are then
released. Scotophobin competitively binds to the HIOMT-SAM complex, thus
preventing the binding of NAS and the creation of product. The authors
noted that part of scotophobin's structure was similar to the structure of
NAS, thus reinforcing this model.

The point of all this biochemistry is to point out that, despite past and
present claims, Unger could have hardly committed fraud considering that the
peptide he had claimed to isolate did indeed have a specific biochemical
mechanism that induced scotophobia in chordates possessing a pineal gland.
How NAS induces dark avoidance I have not been able to discover, but that
does not invalidate Unger's specific claims. What is doubly interesting,
however, is that there is good evidence to show that Unger had made a
mistake when determining the structure of scotophobin. Yet despite this
mistake, his specific claims were verified and are now part of
neuroscientific theory, even though scotophobin has not received the
_popular_ recognition it should have.

The take home lesson with regards to Haeckel and his drawings is that it
demonstrates that Haeckel could have been inaccurate, yet his drawings still
correctly portray the basic elements of his biogenetic law and
recapitulation. It also demonstrates that if the biogenetic law and
recapitulation have some basis in reality (which they do) the inaccuracy of
the drawings will not prevent scientists from discovering that basis.
Unfortunately, it also demonstrates how powerfully self-deceptive people can
be once they decide a scientific phenomenon is a fraud, and how they
perpetuate that self-deception even when there is proof that can be easily
found that refutes their belief.

So while N-rays and polywater teach us the folly of excess credulity,
scotophobin and Haeckel teach us the folly of excess skepticism.

In the message by Kevin O'Brien dated November 1, 1998, he discusses the phenomenon of scotophobin, a peptide initially thought to be a possible example of scientific fraud but later verified as a real entity with a specific biochemical mechanism. The main points of his discussion are:
Background of Scotophobin:
Georges Unger, a neuroscientist, claimed to have isolated scotophobin in 1968. He demonstrated that this peptide, extracted from the brains of scotophobic (fearful of the dark) rats and injected into mice, could induce scotophobia in these mice.
Controversy and Skepticism:
Similar to other dubious scientific discoveries like N-rays and polywater, scotophobin's legitimacy was questioned. Some researchers could replicate Unger's results in various species, while others couldn't, leading to skepticism and theories ranging from questioning the peptide's structure to suggesting it was a case of wishful thinking.
Verification of Scotophobin's Effects:
A series of papers by Satake and Morton in 1979 confirmed scotophobin's real effects. They showed that scotophobin likely acted on the pineal gland, affecting the melatonin pathway and inducing scotophobia.
Biochemical Mechanism:
Satake and Morton demonstrated that scotophobin inhibited the pineal enzyme hydroxyindole-O-methyl-transferase (HIOMT), which is vital for melatonin synthesis. This inhibition leads to increased levels of N-acetylserotonin (NAS), correlating with increased dark avoidance.
Comparison with Haeckel's Work:
O'Brien draws parallels between scotophobin and Ernst Haeckel's controversial embryological drawings. He suggests that, like Haeckel's work, which could be inaccurate yet still portray essential biological principles, scotophobin���s initial doubts did not invalidate its actual biochemical effects.
Lessons on Scientific Skepticism:
O'Brien highlights the dangers of excessive skepticism in science, noting how it can lead to the dismissal of real phenomena. He points out that while it's crucial to be critical, one must also be open to verifying claims through empirical evidence.
Overall Takeaway:
The message emphasizes the importance of balancing skepticism with openness in scientific research and acknowledges that initial inaccuracies in scientific discovery do not necessarily negate the validity of the underlying phenomena.

All this (and there is more) is hard to swallow, but what are the 
alternatives? Thinkers as diverse as B. F. Skinner, Norman Malcolm 
and Hubert Dreyfus have insisted that the very concept of neural systems of representation is a monstrous error. Let us call that the extreme right wing view. On the extreme left, then, would be researchers such as McConnell and Ungar, who take brain-writing so literally that they suppose one might physically extract token sentences of the inner code 
from one creature and teach another by injection or ingestion. (Ungar reports he has trained cats to fear the dark and then isolated a substance in them, 'scotophobin', which injected into untrained cats causes them to fear the dark!) Middle-of-the-road positions have yet to be formulated 
in satisfactory detail, but it is safe to say that Fodor has laid claim to a 
position far to the left of centre and is insisting that no less extreme 
position can provide the foundations for the promising theories of neo-cognitivism.

This excerpt discusses a range of views regarding the concept of neural systems of representation in the brain, specifically within the context of cognitive science and neurobiology.
Extreme Right Wing View:
Thinkers like B.F. Skinner, Norman Malcolm, and Hubert Dreyfus are said to represent an extreme right wing perspective, asserting that the idea of neural systems functioning as systems of representation is fundamentally flawed. This view likely aligns with perspectives that emphasize behaviorist or phenomenological approaches over cognitive or representational ones in understanding the mind and brain.
Extreme Left Wing View:
On the opposite end of the spectrum, researchers like McConnell and Ungar are mentioned as holding an extreme left wing position. They seemingly take the concept of brain-writing quite literally, to the extent of hypothesizing that specific mental states or learned behaviors (like fear of the dark, in the case of scotophobin) could be transferred from one creature to another through physical means like injection or ingestion.
Middle-of-the-Road Positions:
The author notes that moderate or centrist positions on this spectrum are not well-defined or detailed. However, it's suggested that these would involve a more nuanced understanding of how cognitive processes and neural mechanisms interact, without fully embracing either extreme view.
Jerry Fodor's Position:
Philosopher Jerry Fodor is mentioned as staking a claim to a position left of center. He is known for his work on the "Language of Thought" hypothesis, which posits that mental representation has a linguistic structure. The author suggests that Fodor argues for a somewhat extreme stance within the neo-cognitivist framework, which emphasizes the role of mental representations and computational processes in the brain.
Context of Discussion:
This discussion is presented in the context of a critical notice of Jerry Fodor's book "The Language of Thought." The book is a significant work in cognitive science, proposing that thought has a specific, language-like structure, a concept that has had a profound impact on the field of cognitive psychology and philosophy of mind.
Overall, the excerpt reflects the breadth of opinions in the debate over how the brain processes and represents information, ranging from the outright rejection of representational theories to the acceptance of quite literal interpretations of how experiences and knowledge might be physically transferred between individuals.

Scotophobin: Darkness at the Dawn
of the Search for Memory Molecules

by Louis Neal Irwin
Nuspeak Translator
The passage from Louis Neal Irwin's "Scotophobin: Darkness at the Dawn of the Search for Memory Molecules" reflects on the complex and somewhat contentious history of scotophobin, a molecule initially claimed to transfer specific learned behaviors (like fear of the dark) between animals.
Key points from the excerpt are:
No Triumphant Conclusion:
The story of scotophobin did not end with clear scientific success or validation. Although it was one of the most notable molecules alleged to have behavioral effects, its journey in the scientific community was turbulent.
Behavioral Effects of Molecules:
Scotophobin was among several molecules identified and suggested to have behavioral effects. While scotophobin became particularly well-known, the field also saw the discovery of other neuroactive peptides.
Impact on Researchers' Careers:
The author mentions having a successful career in science but notes the adverse effect that working on scotophobin had on the careers of those involved, including its discoverer, Georges Ungar. Ungar, despite his significant achievements, faced professional challenges and a diminished reputation because of his association with scotophobin.
Fate of Scotophobin:
The molecule was eventually discredited in the scientific community but never fully explained. This left an enduring mark on the field and on those who worked on the concept of biochemical transfer of memory.
Personal Reflection:
The author reflects on the experience as unforgettable and significant, indicating both the excitement and the challenges that come with exploring groundbreaking yet controversial ideas in science.
Overall, the passage highlights the complexities of scientific exploration, particularly in areas that challenge established norms and theories. It underscores the potential risks researchers face when delving into uncharted or controversial territories and reflects on the personal and professional impacts of such endeavors.

An alternate theory was posited in the 1960s, when scientists conducted experiments in a search for molecules responsible for memory. In one experiment, rats, normally nocturnal animals, were conditioned to fear the dark and a substance called "scotophobin" was supposedly extracted from the rats' brains; this substance was claimed to be responsible for remembering this fear. These findings were subsequently debunked.[5]

Scotophobin (from ancient Greek ������������ sk��tos "darkness" and ���������� ph��bos "fear") is the name of a hypothetically fear-producing compound that was discovered by the neuroscientist [1] Georges Ungar in 1968 [2] and named in a press release on December 26, 1970 [3 ] became. Scotophobin, Ungar and his colleagues' results appeared to show, causes fear of the dark in various mammals and fish . The scientifically controversial identification, isolation and synthesis of this substance [4] was the core argument for the hypothesis that memories are stored molecularly in the brain for about a decade, and was followed by numerous conferences and books on the subject. [5]

Based on current knowledge, scotophobin cannot have had the effect that was attributed to it because memory is not molecular, but rather stored in the structure and strength of the connections between nerve cells . [6]

The supposed results with Scotophobin had a clear impact on the public. There were a number of articles in numerous newspapers in the late 1960s and 1970s, and the idea of ������the principle of ���molecular memory��� survives to this day, for example in the 1996 film Unforgettable , the television series iZombie or in popular science works. [29]

Despite the once intensive study of the peptide, this line of research came to an end about 15 years after the first specialist articles. According to neurobiologist James L. McGaugh, this chapter of brain research is still viewed with a certain amount of embarrassment today. So many scientific careers have been destroyed by these experiments that there is still a kind of shame within the field about the entire era:

���The memory transfer experiments drew in so many researchers initially and subsequently destroyed enough careers that, even today, there seems to be a sense of collective embarrassment in the field about the whole era.���

���The memory transfer experiments originally captivated so many researchers and subsequently destroyed enough careers that there is a certain collective embarrassment about the entire era in the field even today.���

Abstract
During the 1960s, at a time of skepticism about the possibility of invertebrate learning, James McConnell and other researchers attracted to the glamour created by McConnell for planarian learning established invertebrate learning with a Pavlovian conditioning paradigm and a wide variety of control groups and procedures that are still used today in work on the biochemistry of learning and memory. McConnell abandoned his dream of a Nobel prize and turned to popularizing psychology after a failed attempt to transfer memory from one organism to another through RNA as a "memory molecule." As a science writer and "pop" psychologist, McConnell was a public relations genius who oversold planarian learning and, later, behavior modification. This article solves the mystery of why the Unabomber tried unsuccessfully to kill McConnell with a letter bomb.

The concept of scotophobin, a hypothetical fear-producing compound, emerged in the 1960s and was a subject of significant interest and controversy in neuroscience and psychology. Here's a summary of the key points related to scotophobin:
Discovery and Naming:
Scotophobin was reportedly discovered by neuroscientist Georges Ungar in 1968. The compound was named in 1970 and was suggested to cause fear of the dark in various mammals and fish.
Scientific Controversy:
The identification, isolation, and synthesis of scotophobin were scientifically controversial. The substance was central to the hypothesis that memories could be stored molecularly in the brain. This idea sparked considerable debate, leading to numerous conferences and publications on the topic.
Current Understanding of Memory:
Modern neuroscience understands that memory is not stored molecularly but rather in the structure and strength of connections between nerve cells. This understanding discredits the initial claims about scotophobin's role in memory transfer.
Public Impact and Cultural References:
The idea of molecular memory, as illustrated by scotophobin, captured public imagination and found its way into media and popular culture, including films and television series.
End of Research and Legacy:
Research on scotophobin and similar memory transfer experiments ended about 15 years after the initial publications. The field views this chapter with a certain collective embarrassment, as noted by neurobiologist James L. McGaugh, due to the negative impact on scientific careers.
Related Research:
During the same era, James McConnell's work on planarian learning and the search for a biochemical engram (memory molecule) also gained attention. McConnell later shifted focus to popularizing psychology after failing to demonstrate memory transfer through RNA.
Media Coverage:
Significant media coverage, such as a 1970 Washington Post article, highlighted the supposed breakthroughs in memory research, including claims of creating memory in a test tube, reflecting the sensational nature of the topic at the time.
In summary, scotophobin represents a fascinating but ultimately discredited chapter in the history of neuroscience, highlighting the complexities and challenges in understanding memory and the brain.

I think that what was discredited was that it was the molecule of learned fear, since it was first isolated in rats that had been trained to be afraid, ostensibly:

Based on current knowledge, scotophobin cannot have had the effect that was attributed to it because memory is not molecular, but rather stored in the structure and strength of the connections between nerve cells .

The molecular structure of scotophobin [7] with the sequence: serine - aspartic acid - asparagine - asparagine - glutamine - glutamine - glycine - lysine - serine - alanine - glutamine - glutamine - glycine - glycine - tyrosine - NH 2 .
Scotophobin is a peptide of 15 amino acids , i.e. a pentadecapeptide; the single letter code is SDNNQQGKSAQQGGY. [4] [8] It was first extracted from the brains of dark fear-trained rats, is commercially produced by genetic engineering [9] and can also be produced by total synthesis . [7]

The exact function of scotophobin is still unclear today (as of 2016). The amino acid sequence is similar to that of various neuropeptides , [7] particularly the enkephalins and substance P. It was concluded that it could therefore play a similar role in the nervous system. If scotophobin is indeed relevant to the nervous system, it would probably be a peptide hormone or a neuromodulator .

Dugesia subtentaculata : a representative of Dugesia
A series of simple experiments in which representatives of Dugesia , a genus in the class of roundworms , were classically conditioned and then fed to other Dugesia individuals seemed to support that memories could be passed on in this way. [13] [14] The idea of ������a ���molecular memory��� was subsumed with the term ���biochemical engram���. From 1965 onwards, experiments on this type of memory transfer were also carried out in mammals. [15] [16] One of the first experiments by Georges Ungar, a scientist at Baylor University College of Medicine in Houston , appeared to show the transfer of resistance to the opiate morphine in rats . [17] Further experiments then showed the transfer of habituation to loud noises even between species (from rats to mice ). [15] [11] Ungar called this hypothesis ���a molecular code of memory���. [18]

Discovery of Scotophobin
Edit
In 1968, Ungar and colleagues published another experiment in the journal Nature . [2] In this experiment, rats were placed in a cage that had a lighted part and a darkened part. As soon as an animal entered the darkened part, it received an electric shock, after which it fled back into the lighted part of the cage. The animals were conditioned in this way for several days. Their brains were then isolated, homogenized and injected intraperitoneally into mice after various chemical treatments . When Ungar now carried out a similar experiment with the mice treated in this way, the mice spent significantly less time in the darkened part of a test cage than in the illuminated part compared to the control group. Through various chemical treatments, the molecule that transferred the ���fear of the dark��� was narrowed down to a peptide with a length of 6 to 10 amino acids . The study had a major impact on the scientific community, and Ungar subsequently published a book on the molecular basis of memory, which compiled numerous other contributions. [19] Finally, in 1972, the isolation, sequencing, and total synthesis of scotophobin was reported. [4]

The history and research surrounding scotophobin provide a compelling example of the complexities and challenges in the field of neurobiology, particularly concerning the molecular basis of memory. Here is an overview of the key aspects of scotophobin:
Initial Discovery and Hypothesis:
Scotophobin was first identified in 1968 by Georges Ungar and colleagues, who conducted experiments suggesting that fear of the dark could be transferred from rats to mice through a specific peptide. Rats were conditioned to fear the dark, and their brain extracts were injected into mice, which then exhibited similar aversive behavior towards darkness.
Molecular Structure:
Scotophobin is a pentadecapeptide consisting of 15 amino acids, with the sequence SDNNQQGKSAQQGGY. It was isolated from the brains of rats conditioned to fear darkness and can be produced through genetic engineering or total synthesis.
Function and Relation to Neuropeptides:
The exact function of scotophobin remains unclear. Its amino acid sequence bears similarity to various neuropeptides, including enkephalins and substance P, suggesting it might play a role in the nervous system, potentially as a peptide hormone or neuromodulator.
Controversy and Debunking:
The initial claims about scotophobin's role in transferring specific memories were met with skepticism and eventually debunked. Current understanding in neuroscience posits that memory is stored in the structure and strength of connections between nerve cells, not in specific molecules like scotophobin.
Biochemical Engram and Memory Transfer Hypothesis:
Scotophobin was part of a broader hypothesis in the mid-20th century, suggesting the existence of a "molecular memory" or "biochemical engram." This hypothesis extended to experiments with planarians (flatworms) and attempts to transfer resistance to opiates and habituation to noises across species.
Impact and Legacy:
Despite being discredited as a molecule responsible for transferring learned fear, the research on scotophobin had a significant impact on the scientific community. It contributed to the exploration of the molecular basis of memory and spurred debate and further research in the field.
Scientific and Cultural Implications:
The research on scotophobin and related experiments influenced both scientific understanding and popular culture. However, the eventual discrediting of these experiments led to a sense of collective embarrassment in the field, as noted by neurobiologist James L. McGaugh.
In summary, scotophobin's story is a notable episode in the history of neuroscience, reflecting the evolving understanding of memory and the brain's functioning. While the initial hypotheses about its role in memory transfer were discredited, the research contributed to broader discussions and inquiries into the nature of memory and learning.

Shown is the relative time that mice need to get out of each of two mazes. Some of the mice were injected with brain lysate from animals that were already familiar with one of the labyrinths. The curves labeled xy show experiments in which mice were tested in maze x and received lysate from animals in maze y. These data appear to show that the 1-1 and 2-2 animals find their way significantly faster than the other groups. [20]
Contemporary criticism
Edit
The experiments with Dugesia were sometimes heatedly discussed because of the surprising results and even Georges Ungar was actually surprised by the strength of the effect he observed. Early on, this led to an article in the journal Science , signed by 23 scientists who presented 18 experiments, all of which failed to reproduce memory transfer. [21]

In 1971, Georges Ungar's work was reviewed in his laboratory following an application for research funding from the National Institute of Mental Health . The review panel suggested making sure that the results were not caused by the non-specific transmission of stress or excitement. It was also recommended that samples of synthetic scotophobin be made available to other laboratories. B. Setlow's review speculates that after this assessment, Ungar realized that the animals' behavior could only have simulated an effect due to the lack of controls. [11]

Ungar and his collaborators' response was to both specify their results and publish a complete theory of chemically encoded memories. This led to a number of critical comments on the isolation and synthesis of scotophobin. [22] Of particular note is the study [23] by Walter W. Stewart, [24] a biochemist at the National Institutes of Health , who showed in detail ���that the researchers [Ungar and colleagues] had not the slightest idea "What they had really found." [25] Stewart even went so far as to suggest a hypothetical substance, pseudo-scotophobin , whose properties matched the data presented by Ungar better than scotophobin itself.

Nevertheless, Ungar continued his work and published several reviews on the theory of the molecular substrate of memory until his death in 1978. [26] [27] The results of the review under Roger W. Russel were published in 1972. [28]

The passage discusses the controversy and subsequent criticism surrounding Georges Ungar's work on scotophobin, a peptide initially claimed to transfer learned behaviors like fear of the dark from one animal to another:
Maze Experiments with Mice:
It describes experiments where mice were injected with brain lysate from animals already familiar with a maze. The data suggested that mice receiving lysate from animals familiar with the same maze (1-1 and 2-2 groups) performed better than other groups. This was taken as evidence supporting memory transfer.
Contemporary Criticism and Review:
The results, particularly those involving Dugesia (a genus of planarians), were debated due to their surprising nature. Georges Ungar himself was reportedly surprised by the strength of the effect. Criticism intensified when a Science article signed by 23 scientists presented 18 experiments that failed to reproduce memory transfer.
Review by National Institute of Mental Health:
In 1971, Ungar's work was reviewed following a research funding application. The review panel suggested investigating whether the results could be attributed to non-specific transmission of stress or excitement. They also recommended distributing synthetic scotophobin to other labs for independent testing.
Response to Criticism:
Ungar and his collaborators refined their results and published a complete theory of chemically encoded memories. However, this led to further critical comments, particularly regarding the isolation and synthesis of scotophobin.
Walter W. Stewart's Critique:
Notably, biochemist Walter W. Stewart from the National Institutes of Health provided a detailed critique, suggesting that Ungar and colleagues did not understand what they had found. Stewart proposed a hypothetical substance, pseudo-scotophobin, which he argued matched Ungar's data better than scotophobin itself.
Ungar's Continued Work:
Despite the criticism, Ungar continued his research and published several reviews on the theory of molecular memory substrates until his death in 1978.
Review Publication in 1972:
The results of a review led by Roger W. Russel on this topic were published in 1972.
This account underscores the intense debate and skepticism that surrounded the concept of biochemical memory transfer, a theory that was at the forefront of neuroscientific research during the mid-20th century but later faced significant challenges in terms of reproducibility and theoretical plausibility.

Or maybe it really does induce fear  by making the heart palpatate or stimulate the flight or flight response. It seems highly odd that they would assume that a molecule extracted from the brain would be the source of memory transference or whatever was the original claim
Nuspeak Translator
Your observation points to an important aspect in the field of neurobiology and pharmacology: the interpretation of behavioral effects induced by biochemical substances. In the case of scotophobin, the original hypothesis that it could transfer specific learned behaviors (like fear of the dark) was indeed a significant leap. Let's explore some key considerations:
Biochemical Effects vs. Memory Transfer:
The initial claim that scotophobin could transfer memories was based on the observation that animals injected with it exhibited behaviors similar to those from which the substance was extracted. However, this assumption overlooks other possible explanations, such as the biochemical substance inducing stress responses or affecting physiological states that might lead to behavior resembling fear.
Stimulating Fight-or-Flight Response:
It's plausible that scotophobin or similar compounds could stimulate a fight-or-flight response, leading to behaviors that might be interpreted as fear. Such responses often involve increased heart rate, heightened alertness, and other physiological changes that are associated with fear or stress.
Misinterpretation of Behavioral Responses:
The original interpretation that scotophobin was a vehicle for memory transfer might have been an overreach. Behavioral changes observed in animals could be due to a range of factors, including stress, physiological arousal, or other non-specific effects of the compound, rather than the transfer of specific memories.
Complexity of Memory and Learning:
Modern neuroscience understands memory and learning as highly complex processes involving the intricate interplay of various neural circuits, neurotransmitters, and synaptic changes. The idea of memory being stored and transferred in a simple, straightforward manner through a single molecule overlooks this complexity.
Need for Rigorous Scientific Validation:
The scotophobin case underscores the need for rigorous scientific validation, including controlled experiments and replication by independent researchers. It highlights the importance of considering alternative explanations and mechanisms when interpreting the effects of biochemical substances on behavior.
In summary, while the initial claims about scotophobin were groundbreaking, they might have been too far-reaching given our current understanding of neuroscience. It's more likely that any observed behavioral changes were due to more general biochemical effects on the body or brain, rather than the direct transfer of specific learned behaviors or memories.

Learning and memory transfer: More experimental evidence ��� Science News, November 6, 1971

The first memory molecule has been isolated, characterized and synthesized���������[from the brains of] rats that had been shocked in the dark���. It is a protein and dubbed ���scotophobin,��� after the Greek words for ���fear of the dark.��� [One researcher] has injected synthetic rat scotophobin into the brains of hundreds of goldfish. While the fish indeed exhibited fear of the dark and resisted learning to swim into the dark, the fear was of brief duration.

Update
The idea that scotophobin stores memories and can be used to transfer them between organisms was met with intense skepticism and was eventually discredited by neuroscientists. But the search for a physical basis of memory continues. Over the last few decades, other memory molecule candidates have popped up, including a protein called PKM-zeta, which may help with memory retrieval, and even RNA (SN: 6/9/18, p. 9). Still, the dominant theory is that memories are stored in synapses, connections between nerve cells in the brain (SN: 2/3/18, p. 22).
Nuspeak Translator
This excerpt discusses the evolution of research into the physical basis of memory, particularly focusing on the concept of 'memory molecules' and the historical example of scotophobin:
Historical Context (50 Years Ago):
About 50 years ago, scientists were investigating the physical basis of memory, and scotophobin was a significant focus of this research. Scotophobin, derived from the brains of rats conditioned to fear the dark, was thought to be a memory molecule.
Scotophobin Research:
Researchers, including one who injected synthetic rat scotophobin into the brains of goldfish, observed that these goldfish exhibited a temporary fear of the dark, suggesting a possible memory transfer.
Skepticism and Discrediting of Scotophobin:
The idea that scotophobin could store and transfer memories between organisms faced intense skepticism and was eventually discredited by neuroscientists. This outcome reflects the complexity and challenges in identifying the physical substrates of memory.
Current Understanding of Memory:
Modern research has identified other candidates for memory molecules, such as PKM-zeta, which may play a role in memory retrieval, and even RNA. However, the prevailing view in neuroscience is that memories are stored in synapses, the connections between nerve cells in the brain. This understanding aligns with the dominant theory in contemporary neuroscience that memory is more about the strength and structure of neural connections than about specific molecules.
Ongoing Research:
The search for a physical basis of memory continues, with ongoing exploration into how memories are formed, stored, and retrieved in the brain. This research encompasses various biological levels, from molecular to neural circuits.
In summary, the excerpt highlights a pivotal moment in neuroscience history and underscores the transition from early hypotheses, such as scotophobin as a memory molecule, to the current understanding of memory being intricately linked to synaptic connections in the brain.

I thought that a wikipedia redirect page with a possibilities tag might be like a null wavefront indicating missing data
Nuspeak Translator
Your analogy comparing a Wikipedia redirect page with a 'possibilities' tag to a null wavefront indicating missing data is quite insightful and creative. In the context of information systems and digital communication, this comparison can be understood as follows:
Wikipedia Redirect with 'Possibilities' Tag:
On Wikipedia, a redirect page with a 'possibilities' tag generally points to the potential existence of various topics or interpretations related to the primary subject. However, it may not provide specific, detailed information directly on the page itself. Instead, it guides users to other pages where more relevant or detailed information might be found.
Null Wavefront in Digital Logic:
In Null Convention Logic (NCL), a null wavefront represents a state where no data is being transmitted. It's a kind of placeholder or indicator that the communication line is currently inactive or waiting for new data to be sent.
Analogy to Missing Data:
In both cases, there's an implication of absence or a transitional state. Just as a null wavefront indicates the absence of active data transmission, a Wikipedia redirect with a 'possibilities' tag suggests that while direct information is not present, there are pathways to potential information.
Function in Their Respective Systems:
Both serve functional purposes in their respective systems. In NCL, the null wavefront is crucial for managing the flow of data in asynchronous systems. Similarly, in Wikipedia, a redirect page helps manage the flow of information, guiding users to the most relevant content.
This analogy reflects a deeper understanding of how different systems, whether digital logic circuits or online information repositories, manage the absence or transition of data and information. It highlights the importance of these mechanisms in ensuring efficient and effective communication and information retrieval.
