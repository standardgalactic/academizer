ABSTRACT 
Chain-of-thought (CoT) prompting for language models demonstrates impressive 
performance across reasoning tasks, but typically needs labeled exemplars of the 
reasoning process. In this work, we introduce a new prompting approach, analogical 
prompting, designed to automatically guide the reasoning process of large language 
models. Inspired by analogical reasoning, a cognitive process in which humans draw 
from relevant past experiences to tackle new problems, our approach prompts language 
models to self-generate relevant exemplars or knowledge in the context, before proceed- 
ing to solve the given problem. This method presents several advantages: it obviates the 
need for labeling or retrieving exemplars, offering generality and convenience; it can 
alsotailorthegeneratedexemplarsandknowledgetoeachproblem,offeringadaptability. 
Experimental results show that our approach outperforms 0-shot CoT and manual few- 
shot CoT in a variety of reasoning tasks, including math problem solving in GSM8K 
and MATH, code generation in Codeforces, and other reasoning tasks in BIG-Bench. 
1INTRODUCTION 
Large language models (LLMs) demonstrate strong performance across various tasks (Brown et al., 2020; 
Chowdhery et al., 2022; Liang et al., 2022; Qin et al., 2023). Recently, chain-of-thought (CoT) prompting 
has demonstrated LLMs��� abilities to tackle complex tasks, such as solving math problems, by prompting 
them to generate intermediate reasoning steps (Wei et al., 2022b; Kojima et al., 2022). For instance, 
common methods like few-shot CoT (Wei et al. 2022b; Figure 1, middle) make LLMs generate reasoning 
steps by offering a few exemplars of question���rationale���answer triplets; 0-shot CoT (Kojima et al. 2022; 
Figure 1, left) aims for the same objective by offering instructions like ���think step by step.��� These studies 
highlight the importance of devising effective methods to guide LLMs to reason. 
However, the existing CoT paradigm faces two key challenges: providing relevant guidance or exemplars 
of reasoning, and minimizing the need for manual labeling. Specifically, 0-shot CoT offers generic 
reasoning guidance, which may not suffice for complex tasks like code generation (��6). Few-shot CoT 
provides more detailed guidance but demands labeled exemplars of the reasoning process, which can be 
costly to obtain for every task. This raises a research question: can we achieve the best of both worlds 
and automate the generation of relevant exemplars to guide LLMs��� reasoning process? 
In this work, we propose analogical prompting, a new prompting approach that automatically guides 
the reasoning process of LLMs. Our inspiration comes from analogical reasoning in psychology, a concept 
where humans draw from relevant past experiences to tackle new problems (Vosniadou & Ortony, 1989). 
For instance, when faced with a new math problem (e.g., finding the area of a square given four points 
in a coordinate system; Figure 1), humans often recall how they have solved similar problems in the past 
(e.g., finding the area of a square with a known side length) to derive insights for solving the new problem. 
They also recall high-level knowledge, such as the need to find the side length to calculate a square���s area. 
Our idea is to prompt LLMs to mimic this reasoning process to effectively solve new problems. 
Concretely, given a problem to solve, we prompt LLMs to self-generate relevant exemplars in the context, 
using instructions like ���# Recall relevant problems and solutions:...���, and then proceed to 
solve the original problem (Figure 1, 2). Simultaneously, we can also prompt LLMs to generate high-level 
knowledge that complements specific exemplars, using instructions like ���# Provide a tutorial:...��� 
(Figure 3). This proves particularly useful for complex tasks like code generation (see ��6). Notably, our 
Figure 1: Overview of our approach, analogical prompting. Left: Existing methods for prompting 
LLM to reason are either generic (0-shot CoT) or demand labeled exemplars (few-shot CoT). Right: Given 
a problem, our method prompts LLMs to self-generate relevant exemplars before solving the problem. 
Thiseliminatestheneedforlabelingandalsotailorstheexemplarstoeachindividualproblem. SeeFigure3 
for a sample prompt where the LLM self-generates both knowledge and exemplars. 
method can operate in a single prompt, generating knowledge, exemplars, and a solution to the initial 
problem end-to-end in one pass. The underlying idea here is that modern LLMs have already acquired 
knowledge of various problems during training. Explicitly prompting them to recall relevant problems 
and solutions in the context guides LLMs to perform in-context learning to solve new problems. 
Our proposed approach offers several advantages. It self-generates exemplars and obviates the need for 
manuallylabelingreasoningexemplarsforeachtask,addressingthechallengesfacedby0-shotandfew-shot 
CoT. Furthermore, the self-generated exemplars are tailored to individual problems, such as ���geometry��� or 
���probability���, rather than generic ���math problems���. This can simplify the complexity associated with recent 
CoT techniques that retrieve relevant exemplars from external data (Zhang et al., 2022b; Shum et al., 2023). 
We evaluate the proposed approach in various reasoning-intensive tasks, including mathematical problem 
solving in GSM8K (Cobbe et al., 2021) and MATH (Hendrycks et al., 2021b), code generation in 
Codeforces, and other reasoning tasks in BIG-Bench (Srivastava et al., 2022). We use several base LLMs: 
GPT-3.5, GPT-4 (OpenAI, 2023; Ouyang et al., 2022), and PaLM2 (Anil et al., 2023). Experimental 
results show that our approach outperforms 0-shot CoT and few-shot CoT across a range of tasks and base 
LLMs, achieving an average accuracy gain of +4%. Notably, our approach improves performance on tasks 
involving diverse types of reasoning, such as MATH (including algebra, probability, geometry, etc.) and 
Codeforces(involvingdynamicprogramming,graphalgorithms,etc.). Thisresultsuggeststheeffectiveness 
of generating tailored exemplars for individual problems to guide the reasoning process of LLMs.

This abstract discusses a new prompting approach named "analogical prompting" to guide the reasoning process of Large Language Models (LLMs) in problem-solving tasks. This method is inspired by human analogical reasoning, where past experiences are leveraged to solve new problems. Instead of relying on labeled exemplars of the reasoning process (as in Chain-of-Thought (CoT) prompting), this approach prompts LLMs to self-generate relevant exemplars and knowledge tailored to each problem, providing a general, convenient, and adaptable method for a range of reasoning tasks. The authors claim that this approach outperforms both 0-shot and few-shot CoT prompting in various tasks, including mathematics problem solving and code generation. Experimental results based on several base LLMs, including GPT-3.5, GPT-4, and PaLM2, show an average accuracy gain of +4% across different types of reasoning tasks.

2.1LARGE LANGUAGE MODELS AND PROMPTING 
A language model estimates probabilities over text. Recent research has scaled up these models from 
millions (Devlin et al., 2019) to billions of parameters (Brown et al., 2020) and expanded training data 
to include web texts and instruction data (Gao et al., 2020; Ouyang et al., 2022; Chung et al., 2022). These 
advances have made large language models proficient in various NLP tasks. 
LLMs with billions of parameters demonstrate in-context learning and few-shot learning abilities (Brown 
et al., 2020; Liu et al., 2022; Su et al., 2022; Mishra et al., 2022; Wei et al., 2022a; Yasunaga et al., 2023). 
They use input prompts (instructions or a few exemplars) to guide LLMs to generate desired responses 
for tasks, marking the advent of the prompting era. Our approach harnesses the in-context learning abilities 
of LLMs to guide their reasoning process using self-generated exemplars. 
A closely related work to ours is recitation-augmented generation (Sun et al., 2022). In open-domain 
QA, this work prompts LLMs to recite relevant facts in context before answering questions. Our idea

Large Language Models as Analogical Reasoners 
of self-generating exemplars is related to recitation, but focuses on recalling problem-solving and reasoning 
processes rather than factual knowledge. 
2.2CHAIN-OF-THOUGHT PROMPTING 
Chain-of-thought(CoT;Weietal.2022b)isapromptingstrategythatguidesLLMstoproduceintermediate 
reasoning steps towards a final answer, enhancing problem-solving performance. Common instances of 
CoT include 0-shot CoT (Kojima et al., 2022) and few-shot CoT Wei et al. (2022b). 
0-shot CoT prompts LLMs with a general instruction like ���think step by step��� to produce intermediate rea- 
soning steps. Few-shot CoT achieves stronger performance by providing multiple exemplars of reasoning 
process (question���rationale���answer), leveraging LLMs��� in-context learning abilities. However, it requires 
labeled exemplars. Our approach tackles this challenge by prompting LLMs to self-generate exemplars. 
Within few-shot CoT, the original approach employs a fixed set of labeled exemplars for all test problems. 
Recent work explores retrieval-based CoT, which aims to obtain more relevant exemplars from external 
data for each problem (Zhang et al., 2022b; Shum et al., 2023). While our work shares the goal of 
providing relevant exemplars, instead of retrieval, we make LLMs self-generate exemplars. Self-generation 
offers several advantages: it is simpler, as it does not require external data retrieval, and it is more versatile, 
as it can produce not only specific exemplars but also broader insights or knowledge that complement 
them. Empirically, our generation-based CoT outperforms retrieval-based CoT, especially with larger 
base LLMs, while retrieval-based CoT excels with smaller base LLMs (��6). 
Finally, there are other techniques for enhancing CoT, such as self-consistency (Wang et al., 2022) and 
least-to-most (Zhou et al., 2022). Our work can complement and integrate with these efforts.

The section reviews related work in the domains of Large Language Models (LLMs) and Chain-of-Thought (CoT) Prompting.
In subsection 2.1, the text outlines the evolution of LLMs, from models with millions to billions of parameters, and the expansion of their training data. These advances have enabled LLMs to excel in various NLP tasks, demonstrating in-context and few-shot learning abilities. This progression marks the onset of the "prompting era," where input prompts (either instructions or exemplars) guide LLMs to generate desired responses. The subsection also mentions a work closely related to the new approach: recitation-augmented generation, which prompts LLMs to recite relevant facts before answering open-domain QA tasks. However, the new approach focuses on self-generating exemplars for problem-solving and reasoning processes instead of recalling factual knowledge.
Subsection 2.2 introduces Chain-of-Thought (CoT) prompting, a strategy that guides LLMs to produce intermediate reasoning steps towards a final answer, improving problem-solving performance. It describes two common instances of CoT: 0-shot and few-shot CoT. While 0-shot CoT provides general instructions for LLMs to think step by step, few-shot CoT offers stronger performance by providing multiple exemplars of the reasoning process but requires labeled exemplars. The new approach overcomes this challenge by prompting LLMs to self-generate exemplars, avoiding the need for labeled examples and external data retrieval, while also producing broader insights. The section concludes by noting that the new generation-based CoT outperforms retrieval-based CoT with larger LLMs and can integrate with other techniques enhancing CoT.

statementx, such as mathematical questions or code generation specifications. The solution may include 
both the intermediate reasoning steps or rationale r and the final answer a. 
A prompting method��is a function that maps a problem statementxinto a specific textual input��(x) 
for an LLM, which then generates a solution �� y=LLM(��(x)). For instance, 
��� In 0-shot prompting, �� directly yields x. 
��� In 0-shot CoT, �� supplements x with a general instruction, such as ���[x] think step by step���.

i=1, such as ���[x1]

Our aim is to design a prompting method �� that enhances the accuracy of solutions LLMs generate. 
4APPROACH 
We introduce analogical prompting, a new prompting approach that automatically provides exemplars 
to guide LLMs��� reasoning process. Inspired by how humans recall relevant past experiences when tackling 
new problems, our approach makes LLMs self-generate relevant exemplars or knowledge in context, 
before proceeding to solve the problem (Figure 1, right). We present two techniques to achieve this: 
self-generated exemplars (��4.1) and self-generated knowledge + exemplars (��4.2). 
4.1SELF-GENERATED EXEMPLARS 
Our approach is based on the idea that modern LLMs possess a broad range of problem-solving knowledge 
acquired during training. Explicitly prompting them to recall or generate relevant problems and solutions 
in context aids LLMs to perform in-context learning to solve new problems. 
Specifically, given a target problem to solve x, our prompt augments it with instructions like: 
# Problem: [x] 3 
Large Language Models as Analogical Reasoners 
# Relevant problems: Recall three relevant and distinct problems. For each 
problem, describe it and explain the solution. 
# Solve the initial problem: 
Foraconcreteexample,seeFigure2. TheLLMfirstgeneratesseveral(K)relevantexemplarsintheformof 
question-rationale-answer sequences (���# Relevant problems:��� part of the instruction). Then the model 
proceeds to solve the initial problem, leveraging the recalled exemplars in the context (���# Solve the ini- 
tial problem:���partoftheinstruction). Notethatalltheseinstructionsareprovidedwithinasingleprompt, 
allowing the LLM to generate relevant problems and solution to the initial problem in one continuous pass. 
Using ���#��� symbols in the prompt (e.g., ���# Relevant Problems���) helps LLMs structure the response better. 
Below are key technical decisions we made: 
���Generating relevant and diverse exemplars is important: To achieve this, we explicitly include an 
instruction in the prompt, such as ���generate problems that are distinct from each other��� (e.g., Figure 
2). This step is crucial as some LLMs have a tendency to repetitively generate identical problems, 
which can be misleading when solving the target problem. 
���Single-pass vs. independent exemplar generation: An alternative approach is to independently 
generate exemplars by separately sampling them from the LLM and then re-prompt the LLM with 
all the exemplars. While this method does work, our current single-pass prompt approach achieves 
comparable performance and offers greater convenience, eliminating the need for multiple prompts. 
Consequently, we have chosen to adopt the single-pass method. 
���The number of exemplars to generate (K): Through experimentation, we have found that generating 
K= 3 to 5 exemplars works the best (more details in ��6.5). 
Our approach offers two advantages. It offers detailed exemplars of reasoning without manual labeling, 
addressing the challenges in 0-shot and few-shot CoT. The generated exemplars are tailored to individual 
problems (e.g., ���geometry��� or ���probability���), offering more relevant guidance than traditional few-shot 
CoT, which uses fixed exemplars (e.g., general math problems; Figure 1, middle). 
4.2SELF-GENERATED KNOWLEDGE+EXEMPLARS 
While generating exemplars is useful, in complex tasks like code generation, LLMs may overly rely on 
the low-level exemplars and fail to generalize when solving the target problems. To address this challenge, 
we also allow LLMs to self-generate high-level takeaways that complements the exemplars, which we refer 
to as ���knowledge.��� Specifically, we enhance the prompt with an additional instruction like the following. 
For a concrete example, see Figure 3. 
# Tutorial: Identify core concepts in the problem and provide a tutorial. 
One technical consideration is whether to generate knowledge before or after exemplars. We found that 
generating knowledge before exemplars yields superior results (Table 6). By generating knowledge first, 
LLMs identify the core concepts of the problem. This, in turn, helps LLMs generate exemplars that align 
more closely in terms of the fundamental problem-solving approaches rather than surface-level lexical 
similarities. For further discussion, please refer to ��6.2.

Analogical Prompting:
The new approach introduced, called "analogical prompting", automatically provides exemplars to guide LLMs. It instructs LLMs to self-generate relevant exemplars or knowledge before solving a problem.
Self-Generated Exemplars (��4.1):
The approach is based on LLMs��� vast problem-solving knowledge acquired during training. For a given problem
x
x
x
, the prompt is augmented with instructions for the model to recall or generate relevant problems and solutions. The LLM first generates relevant exemplars in the form of question-rationale-answer sequences, then solves the initial problem using these exemplars. Instructions are provided within a single prompt, allowing continuous generation of problems and solutions. Key technical decisions include generating relevant and diverse exemplars, using a single-pass prompt approach, and finding the optimal number of exemplars to generate (usually between 3 to 5).
Self-Generated Knowledge + Exemplars (��4.2):
In complex tasks, relying solely on exemplars may be insufficient. The approach also prompts LLMs to self-generate high-level takeaways or ���knowledge��� to complement the exemplars. An added instruction might request the identification and tutorial provision of core concepts in the problem. The sequence of generating knowledge and exemplars matters, with superior results obtained when generating knowledge first, helping align generated exemplars with fundamental problem-solving approaches rather than lexical similarities.
5EXPERIMENTALSETUP 
5.1TASKS 
We evaluate the proposed approach in diverse reasoning-intensive tasks, including mathematical problem 
solving, code generation, and other reasoning tasks like logical and temporal reasoning. 
Mathematical problem solving.We use popular benchmarks, GSM8K (Cobbe et al., 2021), comprising 
elementary math word problems, and MATH (Hendrycks et al., 2021b), consisting of advanced math 
problems from high school math competitions. For each problem, we obtain an output from LLMs using 
a temperature of 0, and report the accuracy. 
Code generation.Code generation involves synthesizing programs to solve algorithmic problems. 
Competitive programming is especially challenging, requiring reasoning about various algorithms like

Self-generated Lessons 
Self-generated Exemplars 
Your task is to tackle mathematical problems. When presented with a math problem, recall relevant problems as examples. Afterward, 
proceed to solve the initial problem. 
# Problem: 
An airline serves a dinner to all the passengers on an airplane. They get their choice of steak or fish. Three steak meals and three 
fish meals are set aside for the six-member crew. If the meals are distributed to the crew members randomly, what is the probability 
that both pilots get the fish? 
# Instructions: 
## Relevant Problems: 
Recall three examples of math problems that are relevant to the initial problem. Your problems should be distinct from each other and 
from the initial problem (e.g., involving different numbers and names). For each problem: - After "Q: ", describe the problem - After "A: ", explain the solution and enclose the ultimate answer in \boxed{}. 
## Solve the Initial Problem: 
Q: Copy and paste the initial problem here. 
A: Explain the solution and enclose the ultimate answer in \boxed{} here. 
Relevant Problems: 
Q: In a bag, there are 5 red balls and 3 blue balls. If two balls are drawn at random without replacement, what is the probability 
that both balls are red? 
A: The total number of balls is 8. The probability of drawing a red ball on the first draw is 5/8. After one red ball is drawn, there 
are 4 red balls left out of 7 total balls. Therefore, the probability of drawing a second red ball is 4/7. The probability of both 
events happening is the product of the individual probabilities, so the probability of drawing two red balls is (5/8) * (4/7) = 
\boxed{\frac{5}{14}}. 
Q: A box contains 10 red marbles and 5 blue marbles. If three marbles are drawn at random without replacement, what is the probability 
that all three marbles are red? 
A: The total number of marbles is 15. The probability of drawing a red marble on the first draw is 10/15. After one red marble is 
drawn, there are 9 red marbles left out of 14 total marbles. Therefore, the probability of drawing a second red marble is 9/14. After 
two red marbles are drawn, there are 8 red marbles left out of 13 total marbles. Therefore, the probability of drawing a third red 
marble is 8/13. The probability of all three events happening is the product of the individual probabilities, so the probability of 
drawing three red marbles is (10/15) * (9/14) * (8/13) = \boxed{\frac{24}{91}}. 
Q: A bag contains 4 green marbles, 3 red marbles, and 2 blue marbles. If two marbles are drawn at random without replacement, what is 
the probability that both marbles are green? 
A: The total number of marbles is 9. The probability of drawing a green marble on the first draw is 4/9. After one green marble is 
drawn, there are 3 green marbles left out of 8 total marbles. Therefore, the probability of drawing a second green marble is 3/8. The 
probability of both events happening is the product of the individual probabilities, so the probability of drawing two green marbles 
is (4/9) * (3/8) = \boxed{\frac{1}{6}}. 
Let's solve the following math problem: 
An airline serves a dinner to all the passengers on an airplane. They get their choice of steak or fish. Three steak meals and three 
fish meals are set aside for the six-member crew. If the meals are distributed to the crew members randomly, what is the probability 
that both pilots get the fish? 
A: There are a total of 6 crew members, so the probability of the first pilot getting the fish is 3/6. After one fish meal is given to 
the first pilot, there are 2 fish meals left out of 5 total meals. Therefore, the probability of the second pilot getting the fish is 
2/5. The probability of both events happening is the product of the individual probabilities, so the probability that both pilots get 
the fish is (3/6) * (2/5) = \boxed{\frac{1}{5}}. 
Our Prompt: Self-generate Exemplars

probability. It then accurately solves the problem. See ��D.1 for the complete prompt and output. Using ���#��� 
symbols in the prompt (e.g., ���# Relevant Problems���) helps LLMs structure the response better. 
As a benchmark, we collected competitive programming problems from codeforces.com (details in ��B). 
We focus on level-A problems published in 2023 to prevent test set contamination (Magar & Schwartz, 
2022). Each problem comprises a problem statement, which serves as input to LLMs, and a set of test 
cases to assess generated code. The correctness of code is determined by whether it passes all test cases. 
In line with existing work on code generation (Li et al., 2022; Chen et al., 2023), we report the Acc@1 
and Acc@10 metrics. Acc@kmeasures whether at least one of theksampled model outputs is correct. 
For each problem, we sample 10 outputs from LLMs, using a temperature of 0.7. 
Other reasoning tasks.We further evaluate on various reasoning tasks in BIG-Bench (Srivastava et al., 
2022; Suzgun et al., 2022): word sorting, logical deduction five objects, temporal sequences, reasoning 
about colored objects, and formal fallacies. These tasks are diverse and may not have dedicated training 
data, so they align well with our approach of self-generating custom exemplars. For each problem, we 
obtain an output from LLMs using a temperature of 0, and report the accuracy.

6RESULTS 
6.1MAIN RESULTS 
Mathematical problem solving.Table 1 presents results for GSM8K and MATH tasks. Our prompting 
method, which self-generates exemplars, outperforms baselines such as 0-shot CoT and few-shot CoT. 
The improvement over few-shot CoT is notable for the MATH task, which involves a range of reasoning 
types, including algebra, probability, and geometry. This aligns with our approach of crafting tailored 
exemplars for each problem. 
Figure 1 and 2 provide qualitative examples of GPT3.5-turbo outputs generated using our prompt. In 
both examples, the LLM indeed generates relevant exemplars (geometry problems in Figure 1. probability 
problems in Figure 2), and subsequently produces correct solutions. In contrast, in the standard few-shot 
CoT (Figure 1, middle), the exemplars are math-related (e.g., algebra) but may not always match the test 
problem (e.g., geometry), as the dataset contains diverse test problems.

competitive performance with GPT4, with a 15% Acc@1 compared to GPT4���s 16% Acc@1. 
Figure 3 (more complete version in ��D.3) provides a qualitative example of GPT3.5-turbo output generated 
using our prompt. The knowledge and exemplars generated by GPT3.5-turbo are indeed relevant to 
the problem to solve, focusing on the prefix product algorithm. The final code generated by the LLM 
effectively applies the algorithm to solve the problem. In contrast, in the 0-shot CoT baseline, the LLM 
output does not recall relevant exemplars and fails to employ the prefix product algorithm, resulting in 
an incorrect solution (��D.3). 
BIG-Bench reasoning tasks.Table 3 presents results for BIG-Bench tasks. Our prompting method

The approach seems to be adaptable and effective across a range of problem types and reasoning tasks, from math problems to code generation to deductive reasoning.
6.2KNOWLEDGE CAN COMPLEMENT EXEMPLARS 
Generating knowledge alongside exemplars is particularly useful in Codeforces task (Table 2), where 
LLMs need to apply nontrivial algorithms for code generation. In our qualitative analysis, we observe two 
concrete advantages of generating knowledge: (1) knowledge act as high-level takeaways that complement 
low-level exemplars, which prevents LLMs from overly relying on specific exemplars and helps to 
generalize to new problems; (2) when generating knowledge, LLMs identify the core concepts of the 
problem and produce exemplars that align more closely in fundamental problem-solving approaches 
(e.g., the prefix product algorithm in Figure 3), rather than surface-level lexical similarities (e.g., without 
knowledge, LLMs tend to produce exemplars on palindromic sequences). 
The performance gains achieved by generating knowledge are less significant in other tasks like GSM8K 
and BIG-Bench, however, likely because these tasks are less complex. 
6.3GENERATING VS RETRIEVING EXEMPLARS 
A key motivation behind our idea of self-generating exemplars is its ability to offer relevant exemplars 
for problem solving. An alternative approach is to retrieve relevant exemplars from external data, provided 
there is a labeled dataset of exemplars (e.g., the training set of GSM8K, which includes solutions labeled 
with reasoning steps). What trade-offs exist between these two approaches? 
The advantage of retrieval lies in its reliability. Exemplars retrieved from a labeled dataset are inherently 
valid and correct, unlike generated exemplars, which lack this guarantee. Nevertheless, retrieval typically 
needs labeled exemplars and involves a complex additional retrieval step. 
In contrast, generation is more self-contained and convenient, as it does not rely on external labeled data 
or retrieval steps. Additionally, generation may yield exemplars better tailored to specific test problems 
because it can draw upon the entire (pre-)training data the LLM has been exposed to. The downside 
of generation is that it may fail to produce valid exemplars if the LLMs are weak or have not learned 
problems related to the ones to be solved. 8

Table 4 shows empirical results for GSM8K task, comparing our self-generated exemplars method (���Ours���) 
andthefew-shotCoTmethodusingexemplarsretrievedfromtheGSM8Ktrainset(���5-shotretrievedCoT���). 
We conducted experiments using base LLMs of various scales, from text-curie-001 to text-davinci-003, 
where scale broadly indicates the amount of training data and parameter count used by the LLM. 
Our method outperforms the retrieved CoT with larger-scale LLMs, such as text-davinci-003. This is 
likely because the LLM has effectively learned related tasks during training and can generate useful 
exemplars. Conversely, with smaller-scale LLMs, the retrieved CoT performs better, and self-generation 
fails to produce useful or valid exemplars.

Table 4 presents the result of using varying scales and strengths of base LLMs, ranging from text-curie-001 
to text-davinci-001 to text-davinci-002 and text-davinci-003 (more parameters and training data). Our 
prompting method surpasses vanilla 0-shot and 0-shot CoT across all scales. When using smaller-scale 
LLMs (text-curie-001 and text-davinci-001), few-shot CoT leveraging labeled exemplars exhibits 
superior performance compared to ours. However, as the LLMs are scaled up to text-davinci-002 and 
text-davinci-003, our method outperforms few-shot CoT. This is due to the LLMs��� enhanced ability to 
self-generate more relevant and useful exemplars.

7CONCLUSION 
We introduced analogical prompting, a new language model prompting approach that self-generates 
relevant reasoning exemplars for solving problems. This approach provides detailed, customized exemplars 
for individual problems without requiring labeled data, effectively addressing the challenges faced by 
existing 0-shot CoT and few-shot CoT prompting methods. Experimental results show that our approach 
outperforms 0-shot CoT and few-shot CoT in various reasoning tasks, including math problem solving, 
code generation, and other logical/temporal reasoning tasks. 
Limitations and future research.One limitation of our approach is increased inference computation, as 
our approach generates more tokens than vanilla 0-shot and 0-shot CoT prompting. Compared to few-shot 
CoT, we use fewer input tokens and more output tokens, as exemplars are counted as input in few-shot 
9 
Large Language Models as Analogical Reasoners 
CoT and as output in our approach. 
Another limitation is that self-generation can fail if the LLM lacks sufficient strength or has not learned 
relevant knowledge to the new problems to solve. Conversely, with a stronger LLM, it can draw upon 
relevant prior knowledge to tackle slightly more complex problems. Therefore, our approach is better 
suited for stronger or larger-scale LLMs. 
Finally, it is known that LLM performance can be influenced by specific prompt phrases used to query the 
model (Jiang et al., 2020), and our work is also subject to this prompt sensitivity.

7 Conclusion
The paper introduced
analogical prompting
, a novel prompting technique for language models, enhancing their problem-solving abilities by self-generating relevant reasoning exemplars. This method efficiently provides detailed exemplars for each specific problem without the need for labeled data, effectively overcoming challenges seen in both 0-shot CoT and few-shot CoT approaches. Through experiments, the method demonstrated superior performance in various reasoning tasks such as math problem-solving, code generation, and other logical and temporal reasoning tasks.
Limitations & Future Research
Increased Inference Computation:
The approach requires more computational resources as it generates more tokens than the 0-shot and 0-shot CoT prompts.
Dependency on LLM's Strength:
The success of self-generation is closely tied to the strength and knowledge of the Large Language Model (LLM). The approach might not perform well if the LLM lacks the requisite strength or knowledge relevant to the problem at hand. Conversely, stronger LLMs capable of tapping into relevant prior knowledge prove to be more efficient at handling complex problems.
Prompt Sensitivity:
The performance of LLMs is known to be sensitive to the specific phrases used in prompts, and this approach is not immune to such sensitivity, warranting careful consideration in crafting prompts.
Future research might focus on addressing these limitations, possibly looking into optimizing computational resources, working with various strengths of LLMs, and understanding the intricacies of prompt sensitivity to improve the robustness and efficiency of the proposed analogical prompting method.

Ageing is widely believed to ref l ect the accumulation of molecular damage due to energetic costs of maintenance, 
as proposed in disposable soma theory (DST). Here we use agent-based modelling to describe an alternative 
theory by which ageing could undergo positive selection independent of energetic costs. We suggest that the 
selective advantage of aberrant cells with fast growth might necessitate a mechanism of counterselection we 
name selective destruction that specif i cally removes the faster cells from tissues, preventing the morbidity and 
mortality risks they pose. The resulting survival advantage of slower mutants could switch the direction of se- 
lection, allowing them to outcompete both fast mutants and wildtype cells, causing them to spread and induce 
ageing in the form of a metabolic slowdown. Selective destruction could therefore provide a proximal cause of 
ageing that is both consistent with the gene expression hallmarks of ageing, and independent of accumulating 
damage. Furthermore, negligible senescence would acquire a new meaning of increased basal mortality. 
1. Introduction 
Ageing is a multifactorial process (Kirkwood, 2005; L�� opez-Ot��n et al., 
2013). However, most proposed mechanisms ultimately require mo- 
lecular damage to be the initial cause (Kirkwood, 2005). In disposable 
soma theory (DST) for example, Kirkwood (1977) posited that investing 
in maintenance is energetically costly, and therefore molecular damage 
could be allowed to accumulate if that energy could be better utilised in 
other processes with greater impact on fi tness (e.g. growth and repro- 
duction). While Kirkwood (2005) suggested multiple molecular mech- 
anisms were likely to be involved in ageing, including telomere attrition, 
protein aggregation, and mitochondrial dysfunction, all the suggested 
mechanisms were based on molecular damage, and ageing would thus 
ref l ect ���multiple kinds of damage���. This combined damage could then 
interfere with cell and molecular signalling inducing a level of noise, and 
damaged cells could undergo cellular senescence inducing inf l ammation 
and other detrimental effects on the tissue (Nelson et al., 2012), 
potentially provoking the physical decline we know as ageing. However, 
if that is true then at its core, ageing ref l ects only one single cause: that 
organisms do not invest suff i ciently in maintenance to prevent damage 
accumulation. Indeed, few hypotheses suggest how ageing could result 
without damage accumulation. 
The main exceptions are mutation accumulation theory (MAT) and 
antagonistic pleiotropy (AP). The former suggests that high extrinsic 
mortality in the wild would allow for ageing-inducing mutations to 
persist due to the resultant declining force of selection with age (Med- 
awar, 1952). Initially, the idea was attractive because ageing was not 
believed to occur in the wild (Medawar, 1952). However, it is now 
accepted that ageing does occur in the wild, with evidence in multiple 
species (Nussey et al., 2013) from invertebrates such as dragonf l ies and 
damself l ies (Sherratt et al., 2011) to long and short-lived mammals such 
as seals and shrews (Hindle et al., 2009a, 2009b). In contrast to MAT, AP 
suggests that pro-ageing mutations offer a fi tness advantage earlier in 
life when selection is stronger (Williams, 1957). As with MAT, there are 
also multiple single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in humans that 
may contribute to early life fi tness at the cost of fi tness later in life 
(Rodr��guez et al., 2017), and predictably, these mutations have detri- 
mental effects signif i cantly earlier. However, while such SNPs may

explain the onset of some diseases in some individuals, it is more diff i- 
cult to identify ancient mutations that are now universal, inducing 
ageing via a consistent mechanism across species and organisms. As 
such, these theories currently provide a clearer view of the evolutionary 
framework that may allow ageing to evolve rather than a comprehensive 
biological mechanism. 
Here, we outline an antagonistically pleiotropic biological process 
that could induce ageing independently of damage accumulation and 
the energetic costs of maintenance. As such, we believe selective 
destruction theory (SDT) provides the fi rst comprehensive mechanism 
providing ageing organisms with a fi tness advantage over similar or- 
ganisms undergoing negligible senescence without dependence on 
damage accumulation or energetic costs. However, it is not mutually 
exclusive with damage-centric theories.
ChatGPT
The study proposes an alternative theory to the widely accepted concept that ageing results from the accumulation of molecular damage due to the energetic costs of maintenance (Disposable Soma Theory - DST). Using agent-based modeling, the authors introduce a theory wherein ageing undergoes positive selection, independent of energetic costs. This new theory posits that the selective advantage of abnormal cells with fast growth necessitates a counterselection mechanism termed "selective destruction". This process specifically eliminates faster cells from tissues, mitigating the risks of morbidity and mortality they pose.
Consequently, slower mutants may gain a survival advantage, allowing them to outcompete both fast mutants and wildtype cells. This dynamic could lead to the slower mutants inducing ageing through a metabolic slowdown. The proposed selective destruction mechanism provides a proximate cause of ageing, aligning with the recognized gene expression hallmarks of ageing while operating independently of accumulated damage.
This novel perspective could offer insights into the process of negligible senescence, interpreting it as a form of increased basal mortality. The study suggests that this approach to understanding ageing provides a fitness advantage to ageing organisms over those undergoing negligible senescence, without relying on damage accumulation or maintenance energy costs. However, the authors acknowledge that their proposed theory does not necessarily negate existing damage-centric theories of ageing.
2. Theory outline 
It is only recently that the plethora of selective forces acting within 
tissues are becoming appreciated. Just as cancer cells undergo positive 
selection due to their fast growth and limited response to control, 
allowing them to spread and ultimately cause death, non-tumour cells 
can also undergo permanent or semi-permanent changes that give them 
a selective advantage and allow them to spread at the expense of non- 
mutant (wildtype) cells (reviewed by Kakiuchi and Ogawa, 2021). 
This within-tissue selection could therefore affect the fi tness of organ- 
isms, and inf l uence natural selection. Indeed, an important modelling 
study by Nelson and Masel (2017) even suggested that such forces might 
make ageing inevitable. 
Here we are interested in changes affecting growth and proliferation. 
These could ref l ect mutations or epigenetic changes, but the altered cells 
will henceforth be referred to as mutants for simplicity. Such mutants 
are either aberrantly sensitive (AS) or aberrantly resistant (AR) to 
growth signals compared with wildtype cells. A number of such mutants 
have already been identif i ed, including a c-jun null mutation (Johnson 
et al., 1993) and an insulin-like growth factor 1 (Igf1) receptor knockout 
both of which make fi broblasts resistant to growth in response to mi- 
togens (Sell et al., 1994), while cells with mutation in tuberous sclerosis 
complex 2 (Tsc2) grew faster than their wildtype counterparts under 
hypoxic conditions (Liu et al., 2006) and cells with a mutation in iso- 
citrate dehydrogenase 1 (Idh1) grew slower under the same conditions 
due to an increased reliance on mitochondrial metabolism (Grassian 
et al., 2014). While both AR and AS mutants reduce tissue functionality 
by responding incorrectly to environmental cues, AR mutants will grow 
and proliferate slower than wildtype cells, putting them at a selective 
disadvantage, whereas AS mutants will grow and proliferate faster, 
giving them a selective advantage over wildtype cells and AR mutants. 
AS mutants are therefore a threat to tissue homeostasis in a way that AR 
mutants are not. If they are not controlled or removed, they will 
outcompete the wildtype cells and may become the dominant cell type 
(Fig. 1 A). 
Even beyond their selective advantage, AS cells represent an 
increased threat to tissue homeostasis. The accelerated growth and di- 
vision of AS cells would be associated with a faster mutation rate, as can 
be seen under extreme examples such as Ras family and Rapidly Accel- 
erated Fibrosarcoma (Raf) mutations which induce a state of hyper- 
proliferation associated with high levels of DNA damage (Janda et al., 
2002). While these extreme mutations induce senescence (Di Micco 
et al., 2006), for reasons described below, mutations with milder effects 
on growth cannot autonomously stop their own growth. Therefore, if left 
uncontrolled, such mutants could undergo successive mutation and 
transformation, increasing the risk of tumorigenesis, as appears to be 
happening in multiple studies and cancers (Kakiuchi and Ogawa, 2021). 
In melanoma, benign lesions harboured mainly BRAF mutations, inter- 
mediate lesions had additional NRAS and TERT promoter mutations, 
and mutations in tumour suppressors such as p53 were associated 
mainly with advanced stage tumours (Shain et al., 2015). In human skin, 
Martincorena et al. (2015) used ultradeep sequencing to demonstrate 
that mutations in many cancer cells were already present in physiolog- 
ically normal skin, and these mutations caused the cells to undergo 
positive selection. 
Another potential risk is fi brosis, which is a highly metabolic process 
requiring activation of growth pathways such as mammalian target of 
rapamycin complex I (mTORC1) signalling to both induce rapid cell 
division and produce the large amounts of extracellular matrix proteins 
(Woodcock et al., 2019). In some mesenchymal cell types, AS mutants 
with faster metabolism and more active growth pathways could there- 
fore be expected to increase the risk of fi brosis. For example, IGF-1 is a 
key growth factor inducing growth and proliferation, which also stim- 
ulates the survival and activation of fi broblasts, causing differentiation 
to highly fi brotic myof i broblasts (Choi et al., 2009; Hung et al., 2013). 
AS mutants with more active IGF-1 signalling would therefore prolif- 
erate and activate in response to weaker signals, making it more likely 
that they would reach the critical mass required for fi brosis (Adler et al., 
2020). Patients with systemic sclerosis and idiopathic pulmonary 
fi brosis both have high levels of serum IGF-1 (Hamaguchi et al., 2008), 
indicating that these lethal diseases involve increased activation of 
pathways associated with AS mutants. Notably, around 45% of all 
deaths in the developed world are ascribed to chronic fi broproliferative diseases (Wynn, 2007). 
There are also many other examples where cell function might be 
upregulated in AS mutants as many cell types link their specif i c func- 
tional output (such as hormones or metabolites) to growth pathways. 
This ref l ects that growth and proliferation are usually part of the 
mechanism to increase long-term production/activity so pathways 
which increase one will increase the other (Karin and Alon, 2017). For 
example, �� cells proliferate and produce insulin when blood glucose is 
high, and trigger apoptosis and inhibit insulin production when glucose 
is low. The insulin production pathway is therefore intertwined with the 
growth and proliferation pathways (Rhodes and White, 2002) so both 
can be up or downregulated together in response to stimulus. However, 
as the human body requires blood glucose to remain at around roughly 
5 mM, Karin and Alon (2017) identif i ed that mutants sensing blood 
glucose at an incorrectly high level would quickly cause death if they 
were allowed to spread. This would happen for two reasons. Firstly, 
these mutants hypersecreting insulin can lower blood glucose below the 
point at which the rest of the body���s tissues can sustain respiration. 
Secondly, the wildtype cells sensing the correct level of glucose would 
undergo apoptosis to reduce insulin production, hastening the spread of 
mutants and the lethal drop in blood glucose. Thus, any cell type that 
utilises cell growth and division as mechanisms to regulate functional 
output, and whose functional output relies on keeping metabolites, 
proteins, and even other cell types within a certain range, is threatened 
by AS mutants. Even if the outcomes are not lethal, as they are for 
fi brosis, insulin production, and other pathways such as calcium ho- 
meostasis, they will not promote good health or bodily function. 
AS mutants will therefore promote morbidity and mortality through 
cancer, fi brosis, and overactivity (CFOA). From this, we conclude that 
organisms would gain a fi tness advantage from controlling AS mutants 
through maintaining better tissue homeostasis. The stricter the control 
mechanisms, the longer an organism could hope to retain wildtype 
functionality and avoid CFOA. By contrast, AR mutants provide little 
threat to tissue function. Their slow growth will make them naturally 
outcompeted, but even if they accumulated, their reduced metabolic 
function would not induce the same threat as AS mutants because they 
would produce less of their own specif i c output, merely requiring 
wildtype cells to work harder to maintain tissue function. We suggest 
that this asymmetry between the threat posed by AS and AR mutants 
might necessitate a control mechanism tailored toward removing AS 
cells and the immediate threat they pose. 
There are two possible mechanisms of controlling mutants with a 
selective advantage, both requiring a marker of phenotypic change: as 
here we are concerned with sensitivity to growth, we have termed this a 
growth marker (GM). 
Firstly, cells could autonomously recognise that the absolute con- 
centration of the GM they are expressing is too high and induce their 
own apoptosis. Oncogenic mutations in Ras, Akt, phosphoinositide 3-ki- 
nase (Pi3k), and multiple other mitogenic molecules have been shown 
to induce senescence and apoptosis depending on cell type and severity 
(Liu et al., 2018). Hypersecreting �� cell mutants also undergo apoptosis 
(termed glucotoxicity) (Karin and Alon, 2017). 
Importantly, autonomous mechanisms allow both AS and AR mu- 
tants to be removed with equal eff i ciency, as cells recognise their own 
absolute value of GM (Fig. 1 B). However, such mechanisms are 
intrinsically dangerous: in the case of �� cells, glucotoxicity in hunter 
gatherers would have removed only dangerous mutant cells producing 
too much insulin, but modern diets rich in calories and ref i ned sugars are 
inducing glucotoxicity in wildtype cells which are producing high levels 
of insulin to remove the high levels of glucose in the blood, thus 
resulting in pancreatic destruction and type II diabetes (Karin and Alon, 
2017). The danger arises because autonomous mechanisms are inca- 
pable of distinguishing between aberrant cells and aberrant conditions, 
so any autonomous mechanism must only activate in conditions that are 
highly unlikely to occur in nature. Consistently, type II diabetes was 
likely a rare condition before the introduction of ref i ned sugars (Johnson 
et al., 2017). 
Secondly, mutants could be controlled via a non-autonomous 
method via comparison with the surrounding tissue. For example, 
tumour cells are distinguished from surrounding tissue by natural killer 
cell recognition of MHC class I chain-related protein A (MICA) levels 
(M��ller et al., 2020). In the case of �� cells, only the most extreme 
hypersecreting mutants induce glucotoxicity, so there is still a range of 
mutants which cannot be removed this way, but still have a selective 
advantage over wildtype cells. Korem Kohanim et al. (2020) suggested a 
system of immune control called the autoimmune surveillance of 
hypersecreting mutants (ASHM): autoimmune T cells would compare 
the level of pro-insulin expressed by �� cells before killing the cell 
expressing the highest levels. Thus, if a mutation increasing insulin 
production has occurred in a cell, then it would likely be killed fi rst. 
For AS mutants, when correctly calibrated, an ASHM-like mechanism 
could correctly discern aberrant cells from aberrant conditions, allowing 
even low level mutants to be removed this way, and thus returning the 
selective advantage to wildtype cells, as shown in Fig. 1 C (top). How- 
ever, as also shown in Fig. 1 C (bottom), such selective destruction of the 
fastest growing cells is incapable of removing the slow growing AR 
mutants, which will slowly replicate over time until they begin to 
outnumber wildtype cells in certain areas. At this point, the immune 
cells would then recognise the AR mutants as wildtype and the wildtype 
as AS mutants, providing a selective advantage to the AR mutants. Their 
resultant accumulation could cause tissue robustness to decline as the 
average functionality of cells slows, which we propose could cause 
ageing. 
Importantly, in the model of hypersecreting �� cells described by 
Korem Kohanim et al. (2020), the spread of hypo-secreting mutants was 
unlikely because such cells preferentially induced apoptosis as part of 
the mechanism to raise blood glucose (Topp et al., 2000). Severe AR 
mutants may also undergo apoptosis due to lack of mitogenic signals, 
but moderate mutants are likely to persist if the soma uses a system of 
selective destruction for mutant control. Attempting to remove AR 
mutants by either autonomous or comparative mechanisms could have 
serious repercussions: autoimmune surveillance of hypersecreting mu- 
tants, for example, has been implicated in type I diabetes through the 
immune destruction of healthy �� cells (Korem Kohanim et al., 2020) 
because chance events such as infection lead to the identif i cation of 
healthy �� cells as hypersecreting mutants, causing the destruction of the 
pancreas. 
A common problem for antagonistically pleiotropic mechanisms is 
that evolution can separate the benef i ts from the costs. However, we 
hypothesised that no changes to the process of selective destruction 
could result in a more favourable outcome for the organism. The options 
would be threefold: 
1. Spread of AS mutants resulting from their selective advantage. The 
result is death from CFOA at an early age. 
2. Autonomous control of AR and AS mutants even for low level 
changes. The result is death from en masse apoptosis and senescence 
when changes in environmental conditions cause wildtype cells to be 
mistaken for mutants. 
3. The selective destruction (SD) of AS cells which allows AR mutants to 
spread. The result is slow functional decline (ageing). 
From the three possible outcomes, ageing would provide the greatest 
fi tness advantage, while the rate of ageing would depend on the severity 
of the SD. To address whether this was true in practise we constructed a 
series of models to address if: 
1. SD would prove better at mutant control than unselective destruction 
(UD) i.e. equal attempt to remove both AS and AR mutants (model 
1). 
2. If implementing SD would induce ageing as predicted via the spread 
of AR mutants (model 1).

3. Under what conditions ageing by SD would undergo positive selec- 
tion (model 2). 
If SD involved an immune surveillance mechanism similar to that 
described by Korem Kohanim et al. (2020) for the comparative control of 
hypersecreting mutants, it would likely work mainly via inducing 
apoptosis. However, we considered that while such a process might 
work well for the regulation of the small populations of cells in 
pancreatic islets, it was unlikely to be the central mechanism across 
multiple organs and tissues maintained by selective destruction, 
particularly among simpler creatures with more primitive immune 
systems that nonetheless still age. 
Instead, we hypothesised that selective destruction could be imple- 
mented by juxtacrine and paracrine signals from cells within the same 
tissue. Speculatively, neighbouring cells could communicate their rela- 
tive level of metabolism by the levels of GM, and inf l uence each other���s 
fate accordingly, with slower cells suppressing the growth potential of 
faster cells through epigenetic modif i cation, senescence, or apoptosis. 
Notch signalling controls juxtacrine communication, and consis- 
tently, Notch mutations are associated with the clonal expansion of 
leukaemia cells (Kimura et al., 2019) as well as skin and lung squamous 
cell carcinomas (Wang et al., 2011), which may implicate that these cells 
are escaping attempts of their neighbours to suppress their clonal 
advantage, highly consistent with SDT. Indeed, evidence suggests that 
Notch mutations aid tumour formation via non-autonomous signals from 
the tumour microenvironment (Demehri et al., 2009), while Notch sig- 
nalling plays a key role in senescence by mediating juxtacrine signalling 
(Hoare et al., 2016). Thus, in this theoretical study, we attempt to 
demonstrate the plausibility of ageing by juxtacrine SD.

The section outlines a theory which suggests that cells within tissues experience various selective forces, acknowledging that not only cancer cells but also non-tumour cells can undergo permanent or semi-permanent changes. These changes confer a selective advantage, allowing them to proliferate at the expense of non-mutant (wildtype) cells. This within-tissue selection could affect the fitness of organisms and influence natural selection, potentially making ageing inevitable.
Cells undergoing changes affecting growth and proliferation, referred to as mutants for simplicity, are described as either aberrantly sensitive (AS) or aberrantly resistant (AR) to growth signals compared with wildtype cells. These mutants respond incorrectly to environmental cues, with AR mutants growing slower (a selective disadvantage) and AS mutants growing faster (a selective advantage) than wildtype cells. AS mutants pose a particular threat to tissue homeostasis as they could dominate over wildtype cells if not controlled, promoting morbidity and mortality through mechanisms such as cancer, fibrosis, and overactivity (CFOA).
The section further describes how AS mutants, due to their accelerated growth and division, possess an increased mutation rate, potentially leading to the risk of tumorigenesis. These cells also represent a risk to fibrosis, a process intimately linked with cell metabolism and growth pathways. Since many cell types link their specific functional output to growth pathways, AS mutants might interfere with the body's regulation of various metabolites, proteins, and cell types.
A proposed control mechanism aims to remove AS cells, focusing on the immediate threat they pose. Two possible mechanisms of controlling mutants with a selective advantage are discussed: autonomous recognition leading to apoptosis, and non-autonomous methods via comparison with surrounding tissue. Each mechanism has its challenges and risks, and the asymmetry between the threats posed by AS and AR mutants might necessitate a tailored control mechanism.
The authors then hypothesize three possible outcomes: death from CFOA due to the spread of AS mutants, death from en masse apoptosis when wildtype cells are mistaken for mutants, and the slow functional decline (ageing) due to selective destruction of AS cells which allows AR mutants to spread. Among these, ageing would provide the greatest fitness advantage, with the rate of ageing dependent on the severity of the selective destruction.
The authors also consider that selective destruction could be implemented by signals from cells within the same tissue, with slower cells suppressing the growth potential of faster cells through various means. They speculate that this could involve Notch signaling, which is associated with the expansion of certain cancer cells, hinting that these cells might be evading the suppressive attempts of their neighbors. The section aims to demonstrate the plausibility of ageing by juxtacrine selective destruction in this theoretical framework.
The main points of the theory. I was explaining my theory the other day that aging was caused by entropy, after a certain amount of divisions, the probability of some error meeting introduced, and so it was like a low grade distributed cancer at a cellular level.
ChatGPT
The main points of the theory you provided earlier are as follows:
Selective Forces Within Tissues:
Cells within tissues undergo selective forces, with both non-tumor and tumor cells experiencing permanent or semi-permanent changes that offer them a selective advantage over wildtype (normal) cells.
Aberrant Cells ��� AS and AR Mutants:
Cells, termed "mutants", can be aberrantly sensitive (AS) or aberrantly resistant (AR) to growth signals. AS mutants have a growth advantage, whereas AR mutants grow slower than normal cells.
Threat to Homeostasis:
AS mutants pose a significant threat to tissue homeostasis. If not controlled, these faster-growing cells can become dominant, disrupting the function of tissues and promoting morbidity and mortality through mechanisms like cancer, fibrosis, and overactivity (CFOA).
Increased Mutation Rate:
The faster growth and division rates of AS mutants lead to higher mutation rates, increasing the risk of tumorigenesis and other dysfunctions, like fibrosis.
Control Mechanisms:
Two control mechanisms for mutants are proposed: autonomous mechanisms where cells induce their own apoptosis, and non-autonomous mechanisms where mutant cells are identified and controlled by comparing with surrounding tissue.
Selective Destruction of AS Cells:
A proposed selective destruction mechanism aims to remove threatening AS cells, leading to three potential outcomes: early death due to CFOA, death from widespread apoptosis, or gradual functional decline (ageing) caused by the spread of AR mutants.
Signaling Between Cells:
Selective destruction might be facilitated by communication between neighboring cells. This might involve relative metabolism levels and could result in the suppression of faster cells by slower ones through various mechanisms like apoptosis.
Your entropy-based aging theory posits that aging is due to inevitable errors introduced during cell divisions, somewhat like a distributed, low-grade cancer. While there's a difference between the theory outlined and your entropy theory, both do acknowledge the inevitability of cellular changes or errors over time leading to aging. The provided theory focuses more on the selective forces acting on these changed cells and how the body might respond to control these cells to promote organismal survival.
It sounds like this theory describes aberrantly sensitive and resistive cells. These are cells that grow slower or faster?
ChatGPT
Yes, exactly. The theory describes two types of aberrant cells:
Aberrantly Sensitive (AS) Cells:
These cells are sensitive to growth signals, which means they grow and proliferate faster than normal (wildtype) cells. This rapid growth poses a threat to tissue homeostasis and increases the risk of various health problems like cancer, fibrosis, and overactivity disorders, as these cells can quickly become dominant within the tissue.
Aberrantly Resistant (AR) Cells:
These cells are resistant to growth signals and therefore grow and proliferate slower than normal cells. While they don't pose an immediate threat to tissue function, their gradual accumulation can lead to a decline in the average functionality of cells within a tissue, potentially contributing to the aging process as the tissue's robustness decreases over time.
So, in summary, AS cells grow faster while AR cells grow slower than the normal rate.
Some analogies and metaphors to explain this theory of aging
ChatGPT
Certainly, here are a few analogies and metaphors to help explain the theory:
1.
Garden Analogy:
AS Cells (Faster Growth):
Think of AS cells like weeds in a garden. They grow faster than the desired plants (wildtype cells), taking up more resources and space. If not controlled, they can overrun the garden, leading to a chaotic, unproductive environment (cancer, fibrosis, etc.).
AR Cells (Slower Growth):
AR cells are like slow-growing, but resilient plants. They don't cause immediate harm but gradually take up space, leading to less diversity and vitality in the garden, reflecting the slow decline of tissue function in aging.
2.
Computer System Analogy:
AS Cells:
These are like computer viruses or malware that speed up processes uncontrollably, leading to system crashes or malfunctions (health problems). They need to be actively identified and removed to maintain system stability.
AR Cells:
Imagine AR cells as outdated software or hardware components that still function but at a slower pace, reducing the overall efficiency and performance of the system over time (aging).
3.
Traffic Flow Analogy:
AS Cells:
AS cells are like reckless drivers on a highway who drive too fast, causing accidents and disruptions (health issues). Their dangerous driving style necessitates active policing to maintain road safety.
AR Cells:
These are akin to extremely slow drivers who, over time, cause congestion and slow down the overall flow of traffic on the road, reflecting the gradual decline in body function associated with aging.
4.
Society or Community Analogy:
AS Cells:
AS cells are comparable to disruptive individuals in a society who engage in harmful behaviors, necessitating law enforcement intervention to maintain order and safety in the community.
AR Cells:
AR cells are like the elderly population who might not actively harm society but whose growing numbers require adaptations and resources, influencing the dynamics and function of the community as a whole.
5.
Economic Market Analogy:
AS Cells:
These cells are like aggressive, risky investors or companies that might bring short-term gains but are ultimately unstable, leading to market crashes or financial loss.
AR Cells:
AR cells are like conservative investors or outdated companies that slowly lose relevance and competitiveness in the market, reflecting a gradual economic decline.
Each analogy helps to conceptualize how AS and AR cells differently contribute to health issues and the aging process within the body's cellular "society" or "ecosystem".
4.4. Selective destruction and molecular damage 
It might be argued that because the generation of AS and AR mutants 
involves molecular damage that such damage could be prevented by the 
upregulation of maintenance, in line with DST. However, the level of 
damage required to induce a change in growth sensitivity could be as 
simple as a single point mutation ��� multiple different point mutations in 
Ras are associated with tumorigenesis (Miller and Miller, 2012). Thus, 
SD does not require damage accumulation, and predicts that upregulat- 
ing maintenance will only extend lifespan to the extent that it can 
signif i cantly slow single base mutations in the DNA. Plausibly, upregu- 
lating maintenance mechanisms to such an extent would delay the cell 
cycle and transcriptional machinery to a degree that would reduce 
fi tness even aside from the associated energetic costs, and the myriad 
considerations of accuracy might be diff i cult to perfect to such an extent 
(Ninio, 1975; Young, 2018). This would not preclude a role for main- 
tenance and the associated energetic costs in SDT if upregulating 
maintenance could then remove the damaged cells. However, as we 
show here, the spread of AR mutants is the maintenance mechanism, due 
to the incapacity of UD, and upregulating (this particular) maintenance 
would be expected to accelerate ageing. Therefore, while molecular 
damage likely plays a signif i cant role in selective destruction, the en- 
ergetic costs of maintenance need not. As far as damage does arguably 
accumulate in the form of AR mutants, it ref l ects counterselection and 
not reduced investment in maintenance. The fundamental cause of 
ageing would thus be different to damage-accumulation-based theories 
such as DST. 
In addition, while we have been referring to changes in growth sig- 
nalling as mutations, they are likely to ref l ect both genetic and epige- 
netic changes. Epigenetic changes are heritable and semi-permanent, so 
could provide long lasting changes in growth signalling. In our previous 
models we have assumed that SD works primarily by killing the sur- 
rounding cells. However, this mechanism is obviously ineff i cient. We 
therefore considered a model (10.15490/fairdomhub.1.model.801.1) 
where a certain percentage of neighbours identifying more growth 
sensitive cells would induce epigenetic changes to slow them down 
(rather than killing them). Slower cells would still be removed as before. 
As shown in Fig. 7, 50% and 100% conversion of faster cells to one or 
two sensitivity levels below their current level were signif i cantly and 
increasingly more effective at controlling AS mutants than lower levels 
of conversion, as determined by two tailed T-tests. As such, the spread of 
slow growing cells may not ref l ect mutation or molecular damage at all, 
but an evolved response to damage that could occur even in the absence 
of it. This fi nding has particular signif i cance because programmatic 
theories of ageing are widely deemed to be evolutionarily implausible 
(Kirkwood, 2005, 1977), unlikely to undergo the kind of positive se- 
lection that would make ageing a universal phenomenon. However, if 
cells with lower growth sensitivity are slowing their faster growing 
neighbouring cells over time, we must conclude that an epigenetic 
program of metabolic slowdown could evolve, undergo positive selec- 
tion, and induce ageing. The rate of ageing would be determined both by 
the strength of the SD and the rate of conversion. The only remaining 
question is whether this is actually happening. 
5. Discussion 
Here we demonstrate the advantage of SD and its implications. 
Although the theoretical nature of this work necessitates that the models 
may not ref l ect how SD works in vivo, the simplicity of our system 
demonstrates clearly that if mutants are arising with even the weakest 
growth advantage, a counterselective force, such as SD, is necessary to 
control them. Indeed, it was the absence of such a control mechanism 
that led Nelson and Masel (2017) to conclude that ageing was an inev- 
itable result of multicellularity: their model showed that 
non-cooperative mutant cells would inevitably overcome the wildtype 
cells because it included no counterselective force, consistent with our re- 
sults for UD (Fig. 4 A). Our combined results underline the critical na- 
ture of the evolution of SD (in some form) for multicellular life. We have 
proposed juxtacrine regulation via Notch signalling, which is currently 
only hypothetical, but there is ample evidence that Notch regulates 
lineage differentiation across multiple organs and species (Lai, 2004), 
and does so by altering the epigenetic landscape of cells (Schwanbeck, 
2015). Given that Notch also plays an important role in the suppression 
of tumorigenesis, it would be strange if it regulated such a wide range of 
homeostatic mechanisms without controlling cell-cell differences 
outside cancer itself. Notably, the importance of contact inhibition for 
tumour prevention in naked mole rats is further evidence of the juxta- 
crine regulation of cell growth rate, and indicates another plausible 
control pathway through CD44 (Tian et al., 2013). However, even if 
juxtacrine regulation plays no role, it would not remove the requirement 
for counterselection in some form, as evidenced here by the failure of UD 
to control mutants with a selective advantage and by Nelson and Masel 
(2017). It is not juxtacrine signalling that necessitates SD, but the 
appearance of mutants with a selective advantage, and the necessity of 
their removal to maintain homeostasis. Whether it happens via Notch as 
we suggest, or immune regulation, or another mechanism, its existence 
in some form has large implications. If strengthening this force until it 
results in the spread of slower mutants provides continuing advantage, 
as we suggest it might, then this will result in a shift in homeostasis over 
time.

rates of conversion to slower sensitivity. Speed of takeover ref l ects the average value for 12 replicates. Numbers ref l ect results of two-tailed T-tests comparing each 
Kill-Fill combination between the conditions. For T-tests, SD with 50% conversion (and 50% killing, C50) was compared to SD with zero conversion (100% killing, 
C0), and SD with 100% conversion was compared to C50. Number 0 indicates no signif i cant change; 1 indicates p < 0.05; 2 indicates p < 0.01; 3 indicates p < 0.001; 
4 indicates p < 0.0001. Numbers are negative if takeover occurred earlier with higher percentage conversion. (A) is for Fill value 3, (B) for Fill value 9, showing 
results for AS mutant cells with relatively low and high growth advantage, respectively. AS, aberrantly sensitive; C0, zero percent conversion; C50, 50% conversion;

The idea of a trade-off between ageing and cancer is well docu- 
mented in the literature, and cancer deaths negatively correlate with 
multiple other causes of death including diseases of ageing (Yashin et al., 
2009). In 2002, Tyner et al. (2002) demonstrated that high p53 activity 
promoted ageing and protected from cancer, and current theory suggests 
that overactive tumour suppression promotes ageing through a mixture 
of excessive cell senescence and stem cell exhaustion, while underactive 
tumour suppression allows tumour formation (Wolf, 2021). SDT pro- 
vides an additional mechanism that will manifest in slow growing rather 
than senescent or absent cells, but SD is not a purely anti-cancer 
mechanism. We suggest it is also necessary to maintain tissue homeo- 
stasis, which would quickly be disrupted by fast growing mutants pro- 
ducing too much of their specif i c functional output. In cases like the 
production of insulin, this could be lethal much faster than the pro- 
gression of cancer (Karin and Alon, 2017), and we suggest that fi brosis 
could result from overactive fi broblasts, as suggested by other models 
(Adler et al., 2020) and the involvement of growth-promoting pathways 
which can be inhibited to prevent fi brotic disease (Lawrence and Nho, 
2018).

This section expands on the Selective Destruction Theory (SDT) by addressing critiques and providing additional insights into aging and cellular mutations:
1.
Molecular Damage & Maintenance:
Selective Destruction (SD) Mechanism:
Not reliant on accumulated damage.
Minimal molecular damage (e.g., a single mutation) can generate AS and AR mutants.
Maintenance Upregulation:
While it could extend lifespan, excessive maintenance might impede cell processes, reducing overall organismal fitness.
The spread of AR mutants acts as a form of maintenance, countering damage. Accelerating this would hasten aging.
SD doesn't necessarily involve reducing investment in maintenance.
2.
Genetic and Epigenetic Changes:
Growth signaling modifications can stem from both realms, offering persistent alterations in cellular behavior.
Epigenetic Programs:
These could evolve to gradually slow metabolism, affecting aging rates, supported by positive selection.
3.
Control Mechanisms & Homeostasis:
Selective Destruction (SD):
Essential for controlling mutants that otherwise disrupt homeostasis.
Demonstrated to be a crucial mechanism for the survival of multicellular organisms.
Proposed Notch Signaling:
Hypothesized to play a significant role, though this remains theoretical.
Counterselection:
Mandatory, regardless of the specific mechanism (Notch, immune response, etc.), for maintaining stability.
The process could also be supported by other pathways, like CD44 signaling.
4.
Ageing, Homeostasis, and Cancer Trade-Off:
Aging-Cancer Trade-Off:
Documented in literature, with higher p53 activity linking to increased aging but cancer protection.
Tumor Suppression:
The balance is crucial; excessive suppression may promote aging, while insufficient suppression can lead to cancer.
SD Mechanism:
Beyond anti-cancer, it's vital for general homeostasis, preventing rapid disruption by fast-growing mutant cells.
Functional Output:
Fast mutants might produce excessive functional outputs (like insulin), potentially leading to lethal conditions faster than cancer progression.
5.
Implications:
SDT introduces a mechanism where slow-growing cells, not necessarily senescent or absent ones, are pivotal.
The theory underscores the need for SD not just for cancer prevention but also for maintaining tissue homeostasis, with rapid disruptions by fast-growing mutants posing serious risks.
These fast-growing mutants could overproduce specific functional outputs, leading to conditions that might be even more immediately lethal than cancer (e.g., overproduction of insulin).
The theory also suggests that diseases like fibrosis might result from overactive fibroblasts, supported by other models and studies indicating the involvement of growth-promoting pathways in fibrotic diseases.
Conclusion:
The passage presents a nuanced understanding of aging, where selective destruction, molecular damage, and cellular control mechanisms interact in complex ways.
It emphasizes the importance of managing mutant cells for maintaining homeostasis and preventing diseases, offering a comprehensive framework for studying aging and related conditions.
To our knowledge this is the fi rst mechanistic assessment of why a 
process might evolve and undergo positive selection despite causing 
tissue dysfunction over time, and this initial cause would be funda- 
mentally different to the costs of maintenance (DST). While we do not 
doubt that accumulating damage plays an important role in ageing, the 
widespread failure of anti-ageing treatments aimed at removing mo- 
lecular damage may implicate additional mechanisms. If ageing is, even 
in part, a metabolic slowdown from SD, then even if this causes mo- 
lecular damage to accumulate at late stages, removing this damage will 
have short term effects at best, as it is the altered functionality of cells 
which causes them, for example, to produce misfolded proteins and not 
remove them. Thus, some accumulated damage may not ref l ect the slow 
build-up over time, but a shift in homeostasis from clearance to accu- 
mulation, suggesting it will quickly return to previous levels when 
treatments are ceased. In the case of alagebrium to treat arterial 
inf l exibility by the removal of advanced glycation end products (AGEs), 
De Grey, 2007 describes the reason ���treated animals become inf l exible 
again so quickly after withdrawal of the drug��� as possibly due to expo- 
sure of a highly reactive carbonyl group within the degraded AGE 
products, but it could equally ref l ect that older individuals have a higher 
equilibrium level of AGEs, and ceasing treatment naturally and swiftly 
causes return to this pre-treatment point. Conversely, DST predicts that 
activities such as smoking which increase molecular damage would be 
expected to permanently affect mortality due to the accumulated dam- 
age they cause, but smoking cessation reduces mortality risk to near that 
of never-smokers within 10���15 years (Alberg et al., 2013). Importantly, 
smoking increases clonal expansion of cells with driver mutations 
(causing cancer), which are cleared once individuals cease smoking 
(Yoshida et al., 2020), as we have shown for AS cells in models of suf- 
i ciently strong SD. 
Unlike treatments such as antioxidants and AGE removers like ala- 
gebrium designed to prevent or remove accumulated molecular damage, 
which might be expected to have little downside, we predicted that 
longevity-inducing treatments that reduced the selection against AR 
mutants (by weakening SD) would allow AS mutants to persist for 
longer, and thus increase the risk of death from CFOA, potentially at an 
earlier age (as in Fig. 5). Interestingly, multiple calorie restriction (CR) 
studies in mice showed Kaplan-Meier curves with early dips in survival 
in the CR groups compared with control (Cameron et al., 2012; Koop- 
man et al., 2016; Mitchell et al., 2016; Yu et al., 2019), as did the 
Kaplan-Meier curves presented by Mattison et al. (2017) for the two 
main primate studies. This occurred even though the survivors of CR 
went on to live longer and/or healthier lives than controls. Further, 
while CR is considered one of the most robust life-extending in- 
terventions (Masoro, 2005), multiple studies have found no effect in 
inbred strains (Forster et al., 2003) and wild mice (Harper et al., 2006), 
and a seminal study by Liao et al. (2010) showed that across 41 
recombinant inbred strains of mice CR shortened lifespan in more strains 
than it lengthened it. Perhaps, the most likely reason for such 
wide-ranging effects is that CR is affecting intrinsic mortality in con- 
tradictory ways, reducing age-related mortality and increasing mortality 
from CFOA. Whether it has a positive or negative effect on lifespan will 
then depend on the relative impact on the two opposing causes of death 
in the genetic background. A key impact of SDT is that preventing ageing 
need not produce immortality. Instead, negligible senescence may sim- 
ply ref l ect a higher basal risk of death. 
A recent review by Frenk and Houseley (2018) examined a collection 
of meta-analyses and systematic reviews of gene expression changes 
with age, identifying six hallmarks ref l ecting consistent changes across 
multiple species including worms, fl ies, mice, and humans, as well as 
different organs within these species. The fi rst and second most common 
hallmarks were the downregulation of mitochondrial genes and the 
downregulation of protein synthesis machinery, particularly ribosomal 
proteins and biogenesis factors, which is highly consistent with a 
metabolic slowdown resulting from SD. Another hallmark was the 
reduction in growth factor signalling. The reviewed studies demon- 
strated reduced expression of genes associated with cell growth in 
human and worm muscle (Ma et al., 2016; Zahn et al., 2006); reduced 
expression of IGF-1 and growth hormone (GH) pathway genes in mouse 
liver (Schumacher et al., 2008); and DNA methylation of cell cycle genes 
in �� cells (Avrahami et al., 2015). All these changes are highly consistent 
with SDT. Notably, rates of cancer generally increase with age which 
may appear inconsistent with a mechanism of ageing designed to 
remove potentially tumorigenic cells. However, we are not suggesting 
that even the strongest SD could remove all mutant cells. As such, suc- 
cessive insults to the genome would still cause increasing cancer rates 
with age, but at a much slower rate than would be the case without SD. 
Interestingly, studies suggest that the rate of cell division in humans 
declines with age (Tomasetti et al., 2019), which has been proposed to 
explain the reduced rates of cancer in the oldest old (Hanson et al., 
2015). 
Perhaps the main challenge for SDT is that in mainly post-mitotic 
organisms such as C. elegans and Drosophila, a mechanism of ageing 
that relies mainly on cell proliferation is much less likely to play a role. 
However, the opposite is also plausible: these organisms have evolved to 
become post-mitotic to escape the dangers of AS mutants, making the 
post-mitotic life history trait an extreme form of SD which essentially 
removes every proliferating cell. Although obviously speculative, it is 
diff i cult to imagine why the post-mitotic life history trait would be 
benef i cial except by preventing the dangers associated with cell division 
(i.e. CFOA). Consistently, while adult Drosophila have cancers limited to 
their gut (the only remaining mitotic tissue), the mitotic larval 
Drosophila can get cancer in multiple tissues (Eichenlaub et al., 2016; 
Suijkerbuijk et al., 2016). This strategy of SD via postmitosis would 
totally prevent mutant spread at the cost of the organisms��� ability both 
to regulate outputs through organ size (Karin et al., 2016) and to remove 
damaged cells and replace them with new ones. Post-mitosis would 
therefore potentially induce mechanisms of ageing which were avoided 
in their single-celled ancestors like yeast, which essentially divide away 
the damage (although this is conventionally referred to as ageing) and 
need not occur in organisms that maintained or re-evolved mitotic 
somas. As modelled by Nelson and Masel (2017), damage accumulation 
would ref l ect the lack of cell competition (and removal) that would 
allow the low-vigor/damaged cells to persist in post-mitotic organisms, 
driving a different form of ageing to systems which retained cell 
competition. If SDT is correct, we would predict that molecular damage 
accumulation may prove less relevant to ageing in mitotic than 
post-mitotic organisms. 
As indicated by Nelson and Masel (2017), for mitotic organisms the 
only escape from mutants with a selective advantage, outside the 
counterselection we propose here, is to die of something else fi rst. It is 
possible that AS mutants requiring non-autonomous control do not 
occur in suff i cient quantities to merit a system of SD before other 
J. Wordsworth et al. Mechanisms of Ageing and Development 207 (2022) 111709 
13 
mechanisms of ageing (eg. damage accumulation) have already induced 
death. The rates of mutation affecting growth sensitivity used in our 
simulations were artif i cially high for the sake of expediency. Notably, 
both mutations and epimutations could generate AS mutants, and the 
latter may be orders of magnitude more frequent than the former (van 
der Graaf et al., 2015). Indeed, the very idea of SD through epigenetic 
conversion may require redef i nition of ���epimutation���. Initially def i ned 
by Holliday as ���aberrant patterns of DNA methylation that cause the 
silencing of a normally expressed gene,��� or the contrary aberrant 
���ectopic expression��� (Holliday et al., 1990), within the context of SD this 
should at least be subdivided into those that are adverse ref l ecting 
chance conditions, and those that are deliberately induced to slow the 
metabolism of potentially dangerous cells (or otherwise spread by the 
force of this counterselection). If SD is correct, the latter kind likely 
produce the epigenetic clocks that predict both chronological and bio- 
logical age, while the former will represent the increasing epigenetic 
noise. 
Evidence that clonal expansion occurs with age and contributes to 
cancer is continually increasing, recently reviewed by Kakiuchi and 
Ogawa (2021), who described the spread of clonal mutants across 
multiple tissues, including one study where ���virtually all endometrial 
glands were replaced by one or more driver-mutated clones��� in women 
by the age of 50 (Moore et al., 2020). 
To conclude, we have shown that the selective destruction of the 
fastest growing cells provides a more effective mutant control mechanism than an unselective attempt to remove both fast and slow mutants. 
We described how reducing the risk of cancer, fi brosis, and overactivity 
(CFOA) might explain why organisms strengthen selective destruction to 
the point that it begins to allow the spread of mutants with slower 
metabolism, with epigenetic growth suppression potentially also contributing to the resultant metabolic slowdown. Selective destruction could therefore provide the proximal cause of ageing.
ChatGPT
This passage outlines and emphasizes the Selective Destruction Theory (SDT) in the context of aging:
Main Points:
Novel Approach to Aging:
SDT offers a new perspective on aging, suggesting a process that, while leading to tissue dysfunction over time, evolves and undergoes positive selection.
This process differs fundamentally from the Damage-Selection Theory (DST).
Metabolic Slowdown:
Aging may involve metabolic slowdown from SD, with molecular damage accumulation occurring later.
The initial cause of aging might be different from what has been traditionally understood.
Challenges to Existing Anti-Aging Treatments:
Anti-aging treatments targeting molecular damage might only offer short-term effects since the altered cellular functionality might not be addressed.
Treatment Considerations and Limitations:
The quick return to pre-treatment conditions upon ceasing treatment (e.g., alagebrium for arterial inflexibility) challenges the effectiveness of treatments aimed at damage removal.
Smoking cessation���s rapid effect on reducing mortality risks, despite the accumulated damage, raises questions about the permanent impact of such damage.
Calorie Restriction (CR) and Aging:
CR���s complex and varied impacts on lifespan hint at contradictory influences on age-related mortality and mortality from CFOA (Cancer, Fibrosis, Overactivity).
Gene Expression and Aging:
Consistent changes in gene expression across species (downregulation of mitochondrial genes, protein synthesis machinery, growth factor signaling) align with SDT.
Cancer Rates and Aging:
While cancer rates increase with age, SDT is not suggested to remove all mutant cells. The theory suggests that SD slows down cancer rates but does not entirely eliminate the risk.
Challenges for SDT:
In primarily post-mitotic organisms (like C. elegans and Drosophila), SDT might play a less significant role.
However, becoming post-mitotic might be an evolutionary strategy to avoid risks associated with cell division and AS mutants.
Post-Mitotic Life History Trait:
Being post-mitotic might prevent mutant spread but at the cost of limiting organ size regulation and the ability to replace damaged cells.
Epigenetic Considerations:
Both mutations and epimutations can generate AS mutants, with the latter potentially being more frequent.
The definition of ���epimutation��� might need to be refined, distinguishing between random adverse conditions and deliberate metabolic slowdown in dangerous cells.
Clonal Expansion and Aging:
Clonal expansion increases with age and contributes to cancer.
Conclusion:
SDT proposes that selectively destroying the fastest-growing cells is a more effective mechanism for controlling mutants.
This mechanism may explain why organisms might develop ways to allow the spread of mutants with slower metabolism, potentially leading to a metabolic slowdown that serves as a proximal cause of aging.
See if you can refine your metaphors with the additional information.
ChatGPT
Certainly. With the expanded context provided by the detailed passage, we can think of the aging process and its theorized mechanisms with refreshed metaphors:
Selective Destruction as a Metabolic Brake:
Imagine each cell as a car on the highway of life. Selective Destruction acts like a braking system that slows down the fastest, most erratic drivers (fast-growing cells) to maintain overall traffic flow (tissue homeostasis). Over time, the brake system (SD) might become overly sensitive, slowing down even regular drivers (normal cells), leading to overall traffic slowdown (metabolic decline and aging).
A Balancing Act - The Tightrope Walk:
Aging is akin to walking a tightrope. On one side, there's the abyss of unchecked cell growth and mutation leading to conditions like cancer (fast drivers without brakes). On the other side, there's an overly cautious slowdown in cell metabolism and function (too sensitive brakes), leading to aging and related diseases. The organism must navigate this narrow path carefully, adjusting its balance in response to the changing pressures and risks it faces over its lifetime.
A Symphony of Cellular Activities - The Orchestra:
Think of the body as an orchestra, with each cell being a musician. Initially, all musicians play in harmony, creating a beautiful symphony. However, over time, some musicians (cells) start playing too fast or too slow, disrupting the harmony (homeostasis). The conductor (SD mechanism) tries to correct this by slowing down the faster players, but in the process, might overly suppress some, leading to a gradual decline in the symphony's quality (aging).
Library of Life - Book Preservation Dilemma:
The cellular genetic material can be likened to a vast library of books. Over time, some books get damaged or worn out (mutations and epimutations), and librarians (cellular maintenance mechanisms) work to repair or replace them. However, there's a continuous struggle between preserving old, valuable editions (slower metabolism cells) and making space for new releases (faster-growing cells). The process of deciding which to keep and which to discard, and the inevitable wear and tear on the books, reflects the aging process.
Garden of Life - Pruning for Growth:
Visualize the body as a garden, with each cell being a plant. Gardeners (SD mechanisms) prune the plants that grow too fast or too wildly to maintain the garden���s aesthetics and health. However, in their effort to control unruly growth, they might over-prune, causing some plants to grow slower, reflecting the body's metabolic slowdown and aging.
Each of these metaphors helps conceptualize the complex, dynamic process of aging as outlined in the Selective Destruction Theory, providing different perspectives to understand the delicate balance and trade-offs involved in the life course.
Earlier we discussed an article on analogical prompting for reasoning, do you remember?
ChatGPT
Unfortunately, I don���t have memory of previous conversations once the session ends, and I can't retain information between sessions due to privacy constraints. However, I can certainly help discuss or review new information, or revisit a topic if you provide the relevant details again. If you have specific questions or need clarification on analogical prompting for reasoning or any other topic, feel free to ask!
The Analogical Prompting Technique main points are:

1. **Self-Generating Exemplars:** The technique encourages Large Language Models (LLMs) to self-generate reasoning exemplars for each specific problem, aiding in problem-solving tasks.

2. **Customized Exemplars Without Labeled Data:** It can craft detailed and relevant exemplars for individual problems without the need for labeled data, addressing challenges faced by 0-shot and few-shot Chain-of-Thought (CoT) prompting methods.

3. **Improved Performance:** Analogical prompting has demonstrated superior performance in various reasoning tasks including mathematical problem solving, code generation, and logical/temporal reasoning tasks when compared to existing methods.

4. **Suitable for Strong LLMs:** The approach is more effective when used with stronger or larger-scale LLMs, as they can better draw upon relevant prior knowledge for problem-solving tasks.

5. **Increased Inference Computation:** A limitation of the approach is that it generates more tokens, leading to increased computational demands during inference.

6. **Prompt Sensitivity:** The performance of this technique is sensitive to the specific prompt phrasing used to query the model, which is a common characteristic in LLMs.

### Limitations:
- It might not work effectively with weaker LLMs.
- The technique is sensitive to the phrasing of prompts.
- Requires more computational resources due to increased token generation.

### Future Directions:
The approach opens avenues for future research to optimize computational efficiency, improve performance with various LLM strengths, and better understand and mitigate prompt sensitivity issues.
ChatGPT
Thank you for providing the main points of the Analogical Prompting Technique. Now, to reattempt creating metaphors for your aging theory with this new context, let's connect the two concepts.
Your theory on aging can be likened to a complex, adaptive system where cells are like large language models (LLMs) working within an organism. Each cell or "LLM" is trying to maintain balance and functionality, but over time, errors (mutations or aberrant sensitivity/resistance) accumulate, akin to the challenges faced by LLMs when crafting relevant responses without labeled data.
Aging as Self-Generating Exemplars:
Each cell in the body learns and adapts from its environment, creating its own ���exemplars��� or functional patterns. However, as it ages, these exemplars might not be as effective, or errors might be introduced, leading to the aging process.
Cellular Customization:
Like the technique crafting exemplars without labeled data, cells also develop unique responses and functions without a preset manual, adapting to the demands of their immediate environment. Over time, some of these custom responses may not be as efficient or could be erroneous, contributing to aging.
Performance Degradation:
Just as the technique's performance varies, the efficiency and functionality of cells decline over time due to accumulated damage or mutations, leading to aging and related diseases.
System Strength Sensitivity:
The aging process might be more pronounced or managed differently in bodies (systems) with varying strengths and weaknesses, similar to how the technique is more effective with stronger LLMs and not as effective with weaker ones.
Resource Demand:
Aging cells might require more energy and resources to maintain functionality, akin to the increased computational demands of the Analogical Prompting Technique.
Connecting the limitations and future directions of the technique with the aging theory, we could explore how aging might be mitigated or understood differently in various "systems" (bodies), and how resource allocation and demand change over time within the aging process. This also opens avenues for research and understanding into how the "system" adapts or maladapts to the aging process, creating a dynamic and interactive metaphorical framework.
When I was writing an essay called Humans as Large Language Models, I was referring to a higher level symbolic distillation process, using Markov like chains to activate statistically probable sound and movement combinations. According to Levin's multiscale polycomputation cells and systems can communicate and calculate on different scales, from ion channel, neural oscillation, cellular, organ, and ecosystem. I think SDT can be likened to a kind of overfitting to statistical artifacts in the training data or corpus rather than the population. The mechanism you proposed as an analogy reminded me of this:

Generative AI Goes 'MAD' When Trained on AI-Created Data Over Five Times
By Francisco Pires last updated July 13, 2023
Generative AI goes "MAD" after five training iterations on artificial outputs.

MAD
(Image credit: Rice University)
A new study on AI has found an inherent limitation on current-generation networks such as the ones employed by ChatGPT and Midjourney. It seems that AI networks trained on AI outputs (like the text created by ChatGPT or the image output created by a Stable Diffusion model) tend to go "MAD" after five training cycles with AI-generated data. As you can see in the above images, the result is oddly mutated outputs that aren't reflective of reality.

MAD - short for Model Autophagy Disorder ��� is the acronym used by the Rice and Stanford University researchers involved in the study to describe how AI models, and their output quality, collapses when repeatedly trained on AI-generated data. As the name implies, the model essentially "eats itself," not unlike the Ouroboros of myth. It loses information on the tails (the extremes) of the original data distribution, and starts outputting results that are more aligned with the mean representation of data, much like the snake devouring its own tail.

https://www.tomshardware.com/news/generative-ai-goes-mad-when-trained-on-artificial-data-over-five-times
ChatGPT
Your aging theory and the phenomenon described as Model Autophagy Disorder (MAD) can indeed be conceptually linked through the idea of systems losing their functional integrity over iterations or time due to internal dynamics and errors, resulting in a form of "self-eating" or degradation.
Self-Referential Degradation:
Just as in MAD, where models degrade by training on their own generated data, aging cells may gradually lose their functional integrity by relying on their own "damaged" or mutated outputs, leading to a cascading effect of functional decline.
Loss at Extremes:
MAD results in the loss of information at the data distribution tails. Similarly, aging may result in the loss of cellular functionality at the "extremes," with cells either becoming overactive (aberrantly sensitive) or underactive (aberrantly resistant), disrupting the delicate balance needed for homeostasis.
Convergence to Mean:
As MAD models converge to mean representations, aging tissues may exhibit a form of convergence where the diversity and specialization of cellular functions are lost, leading to a more "average" or compromised state of functionality.
Cyclical Deterioration:
Both processes involve a form of cyclical deterioration. In MAD, the cycle is through repeated training iterations on generated data, while in aging, it might be through repeated cycles of cellular damage, repair, and mutation, each contributing to the progressive loss of functionality.
Self-Cannibalization:
MAD is described as a form of model "autophagy," where the system essentially eats or undermines itself. This is analogous to the aging process where cells, through various mechanisms (like selective destruction or the accumulation of mutations), inadvertently contribute to their own decline and the decline of the tissue or organ they constitute.
In this analogy, the internal dynamics of both AI models and cellular systems lead to a form of self-referential degradation, where the very processes meant to sustain functionality over time instead contribute to its loss. The metaphor highlights the inherent challenges in maintaining complex adaptive systems, whether they are biological or computational, over time.
Specifically computer SDT and MAD
ChatGPT
Selective Destruction Theory (SDT) and Model Autophagy Disorder (MAD) both involve systems that gradually decline due to internal mechanisms. Here's how we can draw an analogy between the two:
Selective Destruction and Loss of Information:
SDT in cells: Cells that are selectively destroyed or suppressed due to their altered growth sensitivity may lead to a loss of cellular diversity and function. This selective process might inadvertently promote the accumulation of slower or defective cells over time.
MAD in AI: AI models undergo a loss of information at the tails of data distribution after being trained repeatedly on their outputs. This selective loss, much like SDT, leads to a convergence towards average or mean representations, thereby losing the diversity and range found in the original data.
Unintended Consequences of Internal Mechanisms:
SDT in cells: The mechanisms that aim to preserve tissue integrity and prevent malignant growth (like cancer) might, over time, contribute to aging by favoring the survival of cells that are less functional.
MAD in AI: While the iterative training process intends to improve the model���s performance, repeated cycles on AI-generated data unintentionally lead to degradation and a collapse in output quality.
Cyclical Deterioration Process:
SDT in cells: The continual cycle of cellular damage, mutation, and selective destruction contributes to a gradual and irreversible decline in tissue and organ function.
MAD in AI: Continuous training cycles on AI-generated outputs lead to a cyclic deterioration of the model, producing increasingly distorted and unrealistic data.
Collapse in System Functionality:
SDT in cells: Over time, the accumulation of selectively preserved cells may compromise tissue functionality, leading to the physical and biological manifestations of aging.
MAD in AI: The AI system eventually reaches a point where its output is no longer reflective of reality, representing a collapse in the model���s functionality and reliability.
In essence, both SDT and MAD describe scenarios where internal regulatory mechanisms designed to preserve system integrity and functionality over time inadvertently contribute to their decline. Whether it���s the selective preservation of certain cells in biological systems or the selective retention of AI-generated data in computational models, these processes lead to a loss of system functionality and fidelity, mirroring the inherent challenges of maintaining stability and functionality in complex, adaptive systems.
Connections to the article on Large Language Models as Analogical Reasoners
ChatGPT
The processes described in Selective Destruction Theory (SDT), Model Autophagy Disorder (MAD), and the principles outlined in the article on Large Language Models as Analogical Reasoners can be interconnected through the following themes:
1. Internal System Dynamics:
SDT:
Operates based on internal mechanisms where cells with altered growth sensitivity are selectively targeted, influencing aging.
MAD:
Reflects internal dynamics of AI models as they deteriorate when trained repeatedly on their outputs.
Analogical Reasoners:
Large Language Models (LLMs) function through internal dynamics, generating exemplars and engaging in problem-solving based on the analogies they draw from their training data.
2. Process of Selective Preservation:
SDT:
Engages in selective preservation of certain cells, potentially leading to aging due to the accumulation of less functional cells.
MAD:
Engages in a form of selective data preservation as it converges to mean representations, losing diversity in the process.
Analogical Reasoners:
LLMs selectively draw upon and generate information, which might reflect the inherent biases or limitations present in their training data.
3. Limitations and Unintended Consequences:
SDT:
The selective destruction process might inadvertently lead to aging and functional decline.
MAD:
Repeated training on AI-generated data unintentionally distorts the model's understanding and representation of information.
Analogical Reasoners:
The analogies and exemplars generated by LLMs might not always be accurate or appropriate, leading to unintended or flawed reasoning outcomes.
4. Need for Optimization:
SDT:
Requires understanding and possibly optimizing the processes to mitigate aging.
MAD:
Necessitates strategies to prevent model deterioration during iterative training cycles.
Analogical Reasoners:
The technique needs optimization for computational efficiency, prompt sensitivity, and improved performance across different LLM strengths.
5. Reflective of Complex Adaptive Systems:
SDT:
Demonstrates the complexity of biological systems where adaptive cellular processes influence aging.
MAD:
Illustrates the challenges in managing the adaptive learning processes within AI models to prevent degradation.
Analogical Reasoners:
Emphasizes the complexity of LLMs as adaptive reasoning systems, where the generation and application of analogies require careful management and understanding.
Concluding Thoughts:
While each concept���SDT, MAD, and Analogical Reasoning in LLMs���operates in distinct domains (biology and artificial intelligence), they all highlight the intricate dynamics, selective processes, and the balance between preservation and adaptation within complex systems. Understanding these connections can provide valuable insights into the optimization and management of both biological and artificial intelligent systems. The analogies drawn between these concepts themselves serve as meta-examples of how analogical reasoning can be applied to understand and interpret complex phenomena across different fields of study.
That is a lot to take in, could you give a more plain exposition of the theory and some metaphors from AI and LLMs to help explain it.

Selective destruction theory (SDT). SDT suggests a mechanism of aging which is both independent of accumulating damage and consistent with epigenetic rejuvenation. The authors use agent-based modeling to describe how aging could undergo positive selection independent of energetic costs.

���The mechanism of selective destruction is currently theoretical. In our most developed model, we demonstrated that if slow cells induced epigenetic changes in faster cells causing their metabolism to slow (rather than killing them) it not only reduced unnecessary cell death, but also further reduced the likelihood of overactivity disorders by preventing the spread of fast cells.���
ChatGPT
Certainly. Let���s break down the Selective Destruction Theory (SDT) in simpler terms and use metaphors from AI and Large Language Models (LLMs) for clarity.
Plain Explanation of SDT:
Selective Destruction Theory (SDT) proposes a new way to think about aging. It suggests that aging isn���t just about the damage that accumulates in our cells over time. Instead, SDT focuses on how our bodies try to manage cells that are growing too quickly or too slowly.
Imagine our bodies as communities of cells. In these communities, some cells grow faster than others. Fast-growing cells might cause problems, like cancer, so our bodies try to slow them down. According to SDT, our bodies do this by making epigenetic changes to these fast cells, essentially putting the brakes on their growth. Over time, this process results in more cells that grow slowly, which the theory suggests is related to aging.
AI and LLM Metaphors:
Overfitting Analogy:
SDT:
The body���s mechanism of slowing down fast-growing cells is like a type of overfitting. The body becomes so good at preventing the problems caused by fast cells that it inadvertently promotes aging by creating too many slow-growing cells.
AI Analogy:
Overfitting in AI happens when a model learns its training data too well, catching noise as if it were a real pattern. It becomes so tuned to the training data that it performs poorly on new, unseen data.
Training Iteration Analogy:
SDT:
Our bodies continually adjust the growth of cells, slowing down the fast ones over time. This ongoing adjustment can be likened to iterative training processes in AI.
AI Analogy:
In AI training, each iteration refines the model. However, if the training goes on for too many cycles on limited or 'noisy' data (like AI-generated data), the model's performance can deteriorate, as seen in the Model Autophagy Disorder (MAD).
Noise Reduction Analogy:
SDT:
The body���s attempt to slow down fast cells might be seen as trying to reduce the ���noise��� or variability in cell growth rates, aiming for a more stable and controlled cellular environment.
AI Analogy:
Noise reduction in AI involves smoothing out the data to focus on the underlying patterns. However, too much smoothing can lead to loss of important details, much like how excessive slowing of cell growth may contribute to aging.
Simplified Conclusion:
In essence, SDT presents a scenario where the body���s well-intentioned efforts to control cell growth (to prevent diseases) might have the unintended side effect of promoting aging. Using AI analogies, it���s like a model that overfits to its training data or deteriorates with too many training iterations, leading to suboptimal performance on the real task.

Super-Selective Reconstruction of Causal and Direct Connectivity With Application to in vitro iPSC Neuronal Networks

Despite advancements in the development of cell-based in-vitro neuronal network models, the lack of appropriate computational tools limits their analyses. Methods aimed at deciphering the effective connections between neurons from extracellular spike recordings would increase utility of in vitro local neural circuits, especially for studies of human neural development and disease based on induced pluripotent stem cells (hiPSC). Current techniques allow statistical inference of functional couplings in the network but are fundamentally unable to correctly identify indirect and apparent connections between neurons, generating redundant maps with limited ability to model the causal dynamics of the network. In this paper, we describe a novel mathematically rigorous, model-free method to map effective���direct and causal���connectivity of neuronal networks from multi-electrode array data. The inference algorithm uses a combination of statistical and deterministic indicators which, first, enables identification of all existing functional links in the network and then reconstructs the directed and causal connection diagram via a super-selective rule enabling highly accurate classification of direct, indirect, and apparent links. Our method can be generally applied to the functional characterization of any in vitro neuronal networks. Here, we show that, given its accuracy, it can offer important insights into the functional development of in vitro hiPSC-derived neuronal cultures.

1. Introduction
In vitro cultures of primary neurons can self-organize into networks that generate spontaneous patterns of activity (Segev et al., 2001; Wagenaar et al., 2006; Chiappalone et al., 2007), in some cases resembling aspects of developing brain circuits (Gutnick et al., 1982; Meister et al., 1991). The emergent functional states exhibited by these neuronal ensembles have been the focus of attention for many years (Eckmann et al., 2007; Yuste, 2015) as they can be used to investigate principles that govern their development and maintenance (Marom and Shahaf, 2002; Opitz et al., 2002) and to produce biological correlates for neural network modeling (Churchland and Sejnowski, 1992; Sporns et al., 2005). The introduction of human induced-pluripotent stem cell (hiPSC) technologies (Takahashi et al., 2007; Yu et al., 2007) opened the possibility to generate in vitro neuronal networks in neurotypical (Odawara et al., 2014; Kirwan et al., 2015), as well as patient-specific genetic backgrounds (Brennand et al., 2011; Wainger et al., 2014; Woodard et al., 2014; Canals et al., 2015; Nageshappa et al., 2015; Sarkar et al., 2018), demonstrating the potential to reproduce key molecular and pathophysiological processes in highly controlled, reduced, experimental models that enable the study of neurological disorders and the discovery and testing of drugs, especially in the context of the individual patient (Trujillo et al., 2016; Fink and Levine, 2018; Silva and Haggarty, 2019).

One common approach to obtain information from in vitro neuronal networks is to record their activity via multi-electrode array (MEA) or calcium fluorescence imaging and then use network activity features to describe their physiology. One main limitation, however, is that these high-dimensional data, which report about the information representation in the network, do not translate into a clear understanding of how this representation was produced and how it emerged based on neuronal connectivity (de Abril et al., 2018). The synchronization of spontaneous spike trains among different MEA sites or neurons, also referred to as network bursting, is an example of observed neural behaviors widely reported in the literature. The generation of network bursting in an in vitro neuronal culture is evidence that the neurons are synaptically connected. However, the extracellular nature of the MEA recording does not provide information about how neurons are connected and how signals propagate between them, such that computational analyses are necessary to reconstruct their complex dynamic patterns and relate their emergence to the underlying wiring diagram (Sporns et al., 2005). However, this kind of analysis presents several challenges as it requires not only identification of functional relationships between cells, but also reconstruction of the dynamic causality (i.e., the knowledge of which neuron fires first and affects another one) between directly linked neurons that are simultaneously involved in several different signaling pathways. This defines the difference between functional and effective connectivity inference: the first only reports about statistical dependencies between cells' activities without giving any information about specific causal and direct effects existing between two neurons (Wang et al., 2014); the second attempts to capture a network of effective���direct and causal���effects between neural elements (Sporns, 2013b).

Model-based approaches have been proposed for inference of effective connectivity (Makarov et al., 2005; de Abril et al., 2018). Among them, dynamic causal modeling (DCM) (Friston et al., 2003) and structural equation modeling (McLntosh and Gonzalez-Lima, 1994) variants have shown best performances. Model-based methods grounded in Ising-like models, which include maximum entropy inference (Schneidman et al., 2006) and maximum likelihood variants [���kinetic Ising models��� or, more generally, generalized linear models (GLMs)] (Hertz et al., 2011; Roudi et al., 2015), are also worth mentioning. However, these methods estimate the effective connectivity of a measured neuronal network by explicitly modeling the data generation process, i.e., only the connectivity of a simulated network model is inferred without any theoretical guarantee about its accuracy and its ability to correctly estimate the connectivity of the biological network (Wang et al., 2014; de Abril et al., 2018).

Because of this limitation, descriptive, model-free approaches are usually preferred as they are easy to implement, rely on a limited number of assumptions that are directly related to the investigated neuronal network, and can be more easily validated (Makarov et al., 2005; de Abril et al., 2018). A number of model-free methods proposed for reconstructing the connectivity of in vitro neuronal networks (Garofalo et al., 2009) have been previously reviewed (Pereda et al., 2005) and tested (Wang et al., 2014). However, because they rely on purely statistical indicators, they can only infer how neurons are functionally coupled, but lack the ability to identify the network of effective interactions between neurons by either missing the directionality or confounding indirect and apparent links from direct ones. Directionality conveys the causality of signaling in the network, i.e., which neural element has causal influences over another (Figure 1Ai). However, causality does not imply a direct connection between two neurons. In fact, a functional coupling between two neurons can be causal even though the two neurons are not directly connected, and this may occur if there is a multi-neurons pathway between the two cells (indirect connection, Figure 1Aii), or if the connection detected between the two neurons is simply a mathematical artifact resulting from the correlation of correlations generated by common inputs from other participating neurons (apparent connection, Figure 1Aiii) (Friston, 2011).

ChatGPT
Absolutely, let's simplify the introduction:
Introduction
The
Selective Reconstruction Theory (SRT)
is a new idea we're introducing in this essay to help us think differently about aging and longevity. This theory is inspired by several existing concepts and recent research findings in the fields of biology, psychology, and neuroscience.
First, it builds on the
Selective Destruction Theory (SDT)
, which explores how cells are selectively destroyed as we age. SDT helps us understand the aging process at a cellular level, offering valuable insights into how our bodies change over time.
Next, we incorporate ideas from
Socioemotional Selectivity Theory
, a psychological framework that explains how our social and emotional lives evolve as we grow older. This theory sheds light on the mental and emotional aspects of aging, providing a more holistic view of the experience.
We also draw inspiration from a cutting-edge study titled ���Super-Selective Reconstruction of Causal and Direct Connectivity���. This research presents advanced methods for analyzing and understanding neural networks in our brains. These insights are crucial for exploring how our minds are affected by aging and what can be done to mitigate these effects.
In this essay, we���ll combine these theories and research findings to present the Selective Reconstruction Theory. SRT proposes new ways to look at aging and longevity, suggesting innovative approaches for extending healthy living through a combination of cellular analysis, continuous medical interventions, and a deep understanding of our emotional and social needs as we age. The goal is not just to extend life but to ensure that added years are filled with health, understanding, and quality living. Through this lens, we aim to explore and perhaps redefine the pathways to healthy aging.

SRT might incorporate transhumanist themes from my essay Bracketing Phylogenetic Trees:

Nova Organa

The conversation began with organizing a list of species by the percentage of DNA shared with humans, followed by discussing the Last Universal Common Ancestor (LUCA) and considering its possible genetic makeup. A discussion ensued about estimating the time of divergence from a common ancestor for different species, serving as a basis for phylogenetic bracketing.

In a creative twist, the conversation imagined explaining various species to a space alien, inspired by the 'piggies' from Orson Scott Card���s novel "Speaker for the Dead", who has an affinity for trees. This led to brainstorming appropriate titles for documenting the conversation, with ���Bracketing Phylogenetic Trees��� being selected for inclusion in a repository named "Technobabble".

The dialogue then explored speculative biology, envisioning cities and ecosystems modeled after trees and contemplating the introduction of new, fictional organs into the human body. These hypothetical organs included the ���hepastitium��� (a distributed version control system for genetic data), the ���xyloid gland��� (producing xylem-like materials for internal support and waste management), the "Fractal Brain Keel" (increasing cortical surface area), the "Endoscopium Relay" (an internal health monitoring system), and the "Subglottal Lidar" (facilitating subvocalized speech).

These imaginative concepts, while fictional, offer a fascinating glimpse into potential future intersections of biology, technology, and speculative fiction, providing rich material for further creative or theoretical exploration.
