Abstract 
Recent sequence modeling approaches using Selective State Space Sequence Models, referred 
to as Mamba models, have seen a surge of interest. These models allow eff i cient processing 
of long sequences in linear time and are rapidly being adopted in a wide range of applications 
such as language modeling, demonstrating promising performance. To foster their reliable use in 
real-world scenarios, it is crucial to augment their transparency. Our work bridges this critical gap 
by bringing explainability, particularly Layer-wise Relevance Propagation (LRP), to the Mamba 
architecture. Guided by the axiom of relevance conservation, we identify specif i c components in 
the Mamba architecture, which cause unfaithful explanations. To remedy this issue, we propose 
MambaLRP, a novel algorithm within the LRP framework, which ensures a more stable and reliable 
relevance propagation through these components. Our proposed method is theoretically sound and 
excels in achieving state-of-the-art explanation performance across a diverse range of models and 
datasets. Moreover, MambaLRP facilitates a deeper inspection of Mamba architectures, uncovering 
various biases and evaluating their signif i cance. It also enables the analysis of previous speculations 
regarding the long-range capabilities of Mamba models.

1Introduction 
Sequence modeling has demonstrated its effectiveness and versatility across a wide variety of tasks and data types, 
including text, time series, genomics, audio, and computer vision [21,72,28,8,23]. Recently, there has been a 
surge of interest in a new class of sequence modeling architectures, known as structured state space sequence models 
(SSMs) [31,56,29]. This is due to their ability to process sequences in linear time, as opposed to quadratic time 
required by the more established Transformer architectures [59]. The recent Mamba architecture, a prominent and 
widely adopted instance of state space models, has demonstrated competitive predictive performance on a variety of 
sequence modeling tasks across domains and applications [29,39,73,68,60], while scaling linearly with sequence 
length. 
As Mamba models, and more generally SSMs, are rapidly being adopted into real-world applications, ensuring their 
transparency is crucial. This enables inspection beyond test set accuracy and uncovering various forms of biases, 
including ���Clever-Hans��� effects [35]. It is particularly important in high-risk domains such as medicine, where the 
prediction behavior must be robust under real-world conditions and aligned with human understanding. The i eld of 
Explainable AI [42,32,7,49] focuses on developing faithful model explanations that attribute predictions to relevant 
features and has shown success in explaining many highly nonlinear models such as convolutional networks [18], or 
attention-based Transformer models [3, 2]. 
Explaining the predictions of Mamba models is however challenging due to their highly non-linear and recurrent 
structure. A recent study [4] suggests viewing these models as attention-based models, enabling the use of attention- 
based explanation methods [1,17]. Yet, the explanations produced by attention-based techniques are often unreliable 
and exposed to potential misalignment between input features and attention scores [65,34]. As an alternative,

equivalent to Gradient��Input. 
(b) Analyze layers in which the conservation property is violated. (c) Rework the 
relevance propagation strategy at those layers to achieve conservation. The resulting MambaLRP method enables 
eff i cient and faithful explanations. 
Layer-wise Relevance Propagation (LRP) [9] decomposes the model function with the goal of explicitly identifying 
the relevance of input features by applying purposely designed propagation rules at each layer. A distinguishing 
feature of LRP is its adherence to a conservation axiom, which prevents the artif i cial amplif i cation or suppression of 
feature relevance in the backward pass. LRP has been demonstrated to produce faithful explanations across various 
domains (e.g. [6,3,18]). Nevertheless, the peculiarities of the Mamba architecture are not addressed by the existing 
LRP procedures, which may lead to the violation of the conservation property and result in unreliable explanations. 
In this work, we present MambaLRP, a novel approach to integrate LRP into the Mamba architecture. By examining 
the relevance propagation process across Mamba layers through the lens of conservation, we pinpoint layers within 
the Mamba architecture that need to be addressed specif i cally. We propose a novel relevance propagation strategy 
for these layers, grounded in the conservation axiom, that is theoretically sound, straightforward to implement and 
computationally eff i cient. Through a number of quantitative evaluations, we show that the proposed MambaLRP 
approach allows to robustly deliver the desired high explanatory performance, exceeding by far the performance of 
various baseline explanation methods as well as a naive transposition of LRP to the Mamba architecture. We further 
demonstrate the usefulness of MambaLRP in several areas: gaining concrete insights into the model���s prediction 
mechanism, uncovering undesired decision strategies in image classif i cation, identifying gender bias in language 
models, and analyzing the long-range capabilities of Mamba. Our code is publicly available.1

The paper "MambaLRP: Explaining Selective State Space Sequence Models" by Farnoush Rezaei Jafari et al. addresses the need for transparency in Mamba models, a type of structured state space sequence model (SSM) that efficiently processes long sequences in linear time. These models are increasingly popular due to their competitive performance across various domains, but their complex and non-linear nature poses challenges for explainability.
The authors propose MambaLRP, a novel algorithm within the Layer-wise Relevance Propagation (LRP) framework, to provide more reliable and stable explanations for Mamba models. The paper identifies specific components of the Mamba architecture that lead to unfaithful explanations and modifies the relevance propagation strategy at these points to adhere to the conservation property, ensuring no artificial amplification or suppression of feature relevance.
MambaLRP is shown to outperform baseline explanation methods and enables deeper insights into model behavior, uncovering biases and assessing the long-range capabilities of Mamba models. The algorithm's effectiveness is demonstrated through various quantitative evaluations and applications, including image classification and gender bias identification in language models. The authors make their code publicly available, promoting further research and application in real-world scenarios.

Structured State Space Sequence Models (SSMs).Transformers [59] have emerged as the most widely used 
architectures for sequence modeling. However, their computational limitations, particularly with large sequence 
lengths, have restricted their applicability in modeling long sequences. Addressing these computational limitations, 
recent works [30,31] have introduced structured state space sequence models (SSMs) as an alternative approach. 
SSMs are a class of sequence modeling methods, leveraging the strengths of recurrent, convolutional, and continuous- 
time methods, demonstrating promising performance across various domains, including language [26,40], image [67, 
12,44], and video [61] processing, and beyond [50,19,38]. A recent advancement by Gu and Dao[29]introduced 
selective SSM, an enhanced data-dependent SSM with a selection mechanism that adjusts its parameters based 
on the input. Built on this dynamic selection, the Mamba architecture fuses the SSM components with multilayer 
perceptron (MLP) blocks. This fusion simplif i es the architecture while improving its ability to handle various sequence 
modeling tasks, including applications in language processing [5,45,62], computer vision [37,73,68], medical 
imaging [39,66,27,47,36,64,63] and graphs [60,13]. This fast adoption of SSMs and Mamba models underscores 
the need for reliable explanations of their predictions. 
Explainable AI and SSMs.In efforts to explain Mamba models, Ali et al.[4]recently proposed viewing their 
internal computations as an attention mechanism. This approach builds upon previous works that use attention 
signal as explanation, including Attention Rollout [1] and variants thereof [17,16]. While these approaches can 
provide some insight, they inherit the limitations of using attention as an explanation [65,34], including their inability 
to capture potential misalignment between tokens and attention scores, and the limited performance in empirical 
faithfulness evaluations. Alternative Explainable AI methods, not yet applied to Mamba models but in principle applicable to any model, include techniques using input perturbations [71,74,25] or leveraging gradient information 
[10,54,58,55,53]. Despite their generality, these models have certain drawbacks, such as requiring multiple function 
evaluations for a single explanation or being susceptible to gradient noise, resulting in subpar performance, as our 
benchmark experiment will demonstrate. To tackle these challenges, we introduce MambaLRP as an eff i cient solution 
for the computation of reliable and faithful explanations that are theoretically grounded in the axiom of relevance 
conservation.

Before delving into the details of our proposed method, we begin with a brief overview of the selective SSM 
architecture, followed by an introduction to the LRP framework. 
Selective SSMs (S6)An important component within the Mamba [29] architecture is the selective SSM. It is 
characterized by parameters, �� 
A, ��

At, and projection parameters, �� 
BtandCt, are functions of the inputxt. This enables dynamic 
adaptation of the SSM���s parameters based on input. This dynamicity facilitates focusing on relevant information 
while ignoring irrelevant details when processing a sequence. 
Layer-wise Relevance PropagationLayer-wise Relevance Propagation (LRP) [9] is an Explainable AI method that 
attributes the model���s output to the input features through a single backward pass. This backward pass is specif i cally 
designed to identify neurons relevant to the prediction. LRP assigns relevance scores to neurons in a given layer 
and then propagates these scores to neurons in the preceding layer. The process continues layer by layer, starting 
from the network���s output and terminating once the input features are reached. The LRP backward pass relies on 
an axiom called ���conservation��� requiring that relevance scores are preserved across layers, avoiding to artif i cially 
amplify or suppress contributions. For example, letxandybe the input and output of some layer, respectively, and 
letR(x)andR(y)represent 
the sum of relevance scores in the respective layers. The conservation axiom requires 
that R(x) = R(y) holds true.

Mamba architecture. This serves as an effective initial step for identifying layers where certain desirable explanation 
properties, like relevance conservation, are violated. We analyze different layers of the Mamba architecture, derive 
relevance propagation equations and test the fulf i llment of the conservation property. Our analysis reveals three 
components in the Mamba architecture where conservation breaks: the SiLU activation function, the selective SSM, 
and the multiplicative gating of the SSM���s output. Leveraging the analysis above, we propose novel relevance 
propagation strategies for these three components, which lead to a robust, faithful and computationally eff i cient 
explanation approach, called MambaLRP.

We start by applying a basic LRP procedure, specifically one corresponding to Gradient��Input (GI), to the Mamba architecture. This serves as an effective initial step for identifying layers where certain desirable explanation properties, like relevance conservation, are violated.

Proposition 4.1:
Applying the standard gradient propagation equations yields the following result, which relates the relevance values before and after the activation layer:
\frac{\partial f}{\partial x} x \bigg|_{\text{R}(x)} = \frac{\partial f}{\partial y} y \bigg|_{\text{R}(y)} + \frac{\partial f}{\partial y} \cdot \sigma'(x) \cdot x^2 \bigg|_{\epsilon} \tag{3}

See if you can give simpler examples to help explain it.
ChatGPT
Certainly! Let's break down the complex concepts of selective SSMs and Layer-wise Relevance Propagation (LRP) with simpler examples.
Selective SSMs (S6)
Concept Overview:
Selective SSMs are like smart pipelines that process sequences of data (like sentences or time series) and adjust their settings based on the data they receive.
Simple Example:
Imagine you are playing a game where you have to pass balls of different colors (input data) through a series of adjustable tubes (the SSM). The tubes can change their size and direction based on the color of the ball that comes in. For example:
If a red ball comes in, the tubes widen to let it pass quickly.
If a blue ball comes in, the tubes narrow to filter out any debris before passing the ball.
Here, the parameters (width and direction of the tubes) adjust dynamically based on the ball's color (input data), allowing the system to handle different balls (data) efficiently.
Layer-wise Relevance Propagation (LRP)
Concept Overview:
LRP is a method to explain decisions made by complex models by tracing back the importance (relevance) of each input feature (like pixels in an image or words in a sentence) to the final decision.
Simple Example:
Think of a detective trying to solve a mystery. The detective (LRP) works backward from the crime scene (the final decision) to identify which clues (input features) were most important in solving the case.
For instance, if the detective concludes that the butler did it (model's decision), they might explain their reasoning by tracing back:
The butler's fingerprints on the weapon (high relevance).
The butler's motive (high relevance).
The butler's absence of an alibi (medium relevance).
By tracing back these clues, the detective can explain why the butler was the prime suspect.
Applying LRP to Mamba Models
Concept Overview:
To make Mamba models explainable, LRP needs to work correctly through all parts of the model. However, some parts of the Mamba model don���t naturally preserve the relevance scores, causing issues.
Simple Example:
Imagine you have a relay race (model processing) where each runner (layer in the model) must pass a baton (relevance score) to the next runner without dropping it. In the Mamba model:
Some runners (components like SiLU activation) might drop or change the baton because they aren���t good at holding it properly (violating relevance conservation).
To fix this:
We ensure each runner (component) uses a secure grip (modified relevance propagation strategy) so the baton (relevance) is passed correctly throughout the race (model).
By using these simplified analogies, we hope to clarify how selective SSMs adjust dynamically based on input and how LRP can trace back through a model to explain its decisions, ensuring that each part of the model correctly handles the relevance information.

Maybe humans do this to correct for taste aversion and taste cohesion bias
ChatGPT
Sure, let's use the analogy of human taste preferences to further simplify and explain these concepts.
Selective SSMs (S6)
Concept Overview:
Selective SSMs adjust their parameters based on the input data, much like how our taste preferences adjust based on the type of food we eat.
Simple Example:
Imagine you are at a buffet with a variety of dishes (input data). Your brain (the SSM) adjusts your taste expectations (parameters) based on the dish you are about to eat:
When you take a bite of a spicy dish, your brain prepares for a strong, intense flavor.
When you taste a sweet dessert, your brain adjusts to enjoy the sugary taste.
Here, your taste expectations dynamically change based on the type of food, similar to how selective SSMs adjust their parameters based on the input data they process.
Layer-wise Relevance Propagation (LRP)
Concept Overview:
LRP explains decisions by tracing back the importance of each input feature, much like how we reflect on the specific flavors or ingredients that contributed to our overall enjoyment of a dish.
Simple Example:
After eating a delicious meal, you might reflect on what made it so enjoyable:
The tangy sauce (high relevance) added a lot of flavor.
The freshness of the vegetables (medium relevance) enhanced the taste.
The texture of the pasta (low relevance) was pleasant but not the main highlight.
By identifying these key elements, you can explain why the dish was enjoyable. This is similar to how LRP traces back through a model to identify which features were most important for its decision.
Applying LRP to Mamba Models
Concept Overview:
To make Mamba models explainable, LRP needs to work correctly through all parts of the model, ensuring that the relevance of each input feature is preserved, much like ensuring that each flavor in a dish is appreciated and correctly identified.
Simple Example:
Imagine making a complex dish with multiple steps (layers in the model). You want to ensure each step preserves the flavors correctly:
If you add spices (SiLU activation function) but don���t mix them well, the flavors won���t distribute evenly, and the dish might taste off (violating relevance conservation).
To correct this:
You ensure each step, like mixing spices or cooking ingredients (components in the model), is done carefully to maintain the intended flavor (relevance propagation).
By using these analogies, we can see how selective SSMs dynamically adjust based on input, much like our taste preferences adjust based on the food we eat. Similarly, LRP traces back to explain decisions, much like reflecting on the flavors of a meal to understand what made it enjoyable. Ensuring that each component of the Mamba model handles relevance information correctly is like making sure each step in cooking preserves the intended flavors of the dish.
4o
So maybe it would be like going back and seeing which spices were not used, or asking for explanation from the cook why they included certain ingredients. Some for flavor, some for texture, or color. I was thinking one might feel sick after a certain food, but then note that they like the food combined with other foods
ChatGPT
That���s a great analogy! Let's refine and extend it to better illustrate the concepts of selective SSMs and LRP.
Selective SSMs (S6)
Concept Overview:
Selective SSMs adjust their processing dynamically based on the input, much like how our taste preferences and digestive responses adjust based on the type of food we eat.
Simple Example:
Imagine you're at a buffet, and you have a plate with a variety of foods (input sequence). Your brain (the SSM) adjusts your eating strategy (parameters) based on each type of food:
If you eat a spicy dish, your brain might prepare you for the heat and adjust your taste expectation.
If you eat something sweet, your brain shifts to enjoy the sugary taste.
This dynamic adjustment is similar to how selective SSMs modify their parameters based on the input data, enabling them to focus on relevant information and process it efficiently.
Layer-wise Relevance Propagation (LRP)
Concept Overview:
LRP helps explain why a model made a certain decision by tracing back the importance of each input feature, similar to how we might reflect on the specific ingredients in a dish to understand what contributed to its flavor.
Simple Example:
Consider eating a dish and then reflecting on what made it enjoyable:
The tangy sauce (high relevance) added a lot of flavor.
The crunchy vegetables (medium relevance) provided a nice texture.
The garnish (low relevance) added some visual appeal.
By identifying these elements, you can explain why the dish tasted good. LRP works similarly by tracing back through the model to identify which features were important for its decision.
Applying LRP to Mamba Models
Concept Overview:
To ensure Mamba models are explainable, LRP needs to function correctly through all parts of the model, preserving the importance of each input feature, much like ensuring each ingredient in a dish contributes appropriately to the overall flavor.
Simple Example:
Imagine you want to understand why a dish you ate made you feel sick. You might:
Reconstruct the Recipe:
Trace back through the cooking process (model layers) to see which ingredients were used (input features).
Ask the Cook (LRP):
Get explanations for why certain ingredients were included:
Some for flavor (like spices).
Some for texture (like crunchy vegetables).
Some for color (like garnishes).
Correcting Issues:
If you realize certain ingredients (like too many spices) were not mixed well, causing an imbalance (violating relevance conservation), you can adjust the recipe to ensure better mixing next time (relevance propagation strategy).
Feeling Sick Example:
Suppose you felt sick after eating a certain food. However, you note that you enjoy that food when it's combined with other foods. This suggests:
The food on its own (specific input feature) may have negative effects.
When combined with other foods (contextual input), it balances out, similar to how the selective SSM dynamically adjusts based on the combination of inputs to focus on relevant features and ignore irrelevant ones.
Using these analogies:
Selective SSMs:
Adjusting processing dynamically based on input, like adjusting taste expectations based on different foods.
LRP:
Tracing back to understand decisions, like reflecting on ingredients to understand a dish���s flavor.
Correcting Issues in Models:
Ensuring proper handling of relevance, like ensuring ingredients are properly mixed for balanced flavor.
This way, selective SSMs and LRP can be understood in the context of everyday experiences with food and taste, making the concepts more relatable and easier to grasp.

4.3Relevance propagation in multiplicative gates 
In each block within the Mamba architecture, the SSM���s output is multiplied by an input-dependent gate. In other 
words,y = zA�� zB, wherezA= SSM(x)andzB= SiLU(Linear(x)). Assume that the locally linear expansions 
introduced in Sections 4.1 and 4.2 are applied to the SSM components and SiLU activation functions, the mapping 
from x to y becomes quadratic. 4 
Proposition 4.3Applying the standard gradient propagation equations establishes the following relation between

The derivation for Eq. 8 and explicit LRP rules can be found in Appendix A.3 and Appendix B, respectively. In this 
equation, we observe a spurious doubling of relevance in the backward pass. This can be addressed by treating half of 
the output as constant: y = 0.5 �� (zA�� zB) + 0.5 �� [zA�� zB]cst.(9) 
As for the previous examples, this ensures the conservation propertyR(x) = R(y). An alternative would have 
been to makeylinear by detaching only one of the terms in the product, as done for the SiLU activation or the 
SSM component. However, the strategy of Eq.(9)better maintains the directionality given by the gradient. We 
further compare these alternatives in an ablation study presented in Appendix C.5, demonstrating empirically that our 
proposed approach performs better.

Let's simplify the explanation of relevance propagation in multiplicative gates within the Mamba architecture and how to ensure conservation of relevance.
4.3 Relevance Propagation in Multiplicative Gates
Concept Overview:
In the Mamba architecture, each block includes a multiplicative gate that combines the SSM���s output with another value. This combination can complicate the backward pass of relevance scores, potentially causing issues in maintaining the conservation property.
Simple Example:
Imagine you have a cooking recipe where you combine two ingredients (like flour and water) to make dough. The amount of dough you get (output) depends on both the flour and water you use:
z
A
z_A
z
A
���
: The amount of flour (SSM output)
z
B
z_B
z
B
���
: The amount of water, which is adjusted based on some other ingredient (SiLU of a linear transformation of input)
The combined result

is the dough, calculated as:
y
=
z
A
���
z
B
y = z_A \cdot z_B
y
=
z
A
���
���
z
B
���
When explaining why the dough turned out the way it did, we want to ensure that our explanation (relevance scores) properly accounts for both flour and water without artificially inflating their importance.
Proposition 4.3: Addressing Spurious Doubling
Problem:
Using standard gradient propagation, we find that relevance values can be incorrectly doubled during the backward pass:

This means that the relevance scores for the input features could be twice as high as they should be.
Solution:
To fix this, we treat half of the output as a constant:
y

(
z

)

y = 0.5 \cdot (z_A \cdot z_B) + 0.5 \cdot [z_A \cdot z_B]_{\text{cst.}}

This adjustment ensures that the relevance scores for the inputs are correctly balanced, maintaining the conservation property (i.e., the total relevance remains the same before and after the gate).
Alternative Solution:
Another option could be to make the output linear by detaching only one of the terms in the product. However, treating half of the output as constant better preserves the direction given by the gradient, which is crucial for accurate relevance propagation.
4.4 Additional Modifications and Summary
Summary of Approach:
Detach Operations:
Implement the detach operations for the SiLU activation, SSM component, and multiplicative gates as described.
Retrieve Explanations:
Perform the Gradient��Input operation on the modified model to retrieve the MambaLRP explanations.
Example Steps:
Detach Operations:
Think of this as ensuring each step in your recipe (e.g., mixing, combining ingredients) is done carefully to preserve the intended flavors (relevance scores).
For example, when combining flour and water, ensure each ingredient's contribution is accurately accounted for.
Retrieve Explanations:
Once the modifications are in place, you can trace back and explain why the final dish (model output) turned out as it did by examining each ingredient's (input feature's) relevance.
Additional Enhancements
Propagation through Other Layers:
The developed strategies complement existing approaches for other layers, such as RMSNorm and convolution layers, ensuring robust and accurate relevance propagation throughout the entire Mamba architecture.
By following these steps, the MambaLRP procedure provides a reliable way to explain the decisions made by Mamba models, ensuring that relevance scores are conserved and accurately propagated through all components of the model. This approach helps in understanding the model's behavior and identifying the key input features that influence its predictions.

This might be unrelated but I assume eating activates the peristalsis reflex down the entire digestive track. So drinking sweet drink after a bitter meal makes the medicine go down because it activates the ulular swallow reflex.
ChatGPT
That's an interesting analogy! Let's explore how this idea can further help explain the concepts of selective SSMs and Layer-wise Relevance Propagation (LRP) in the context of Mamba models, using the digestive system as a metaphor.
Selective SSMs (S6)
Concept Overview:
Selective SSMs dynamically adjust their parameters based on input, similar to how the digestive system adjusts based on different types of food and drinks.
Simple Example:
Imagine you eat a bitter medicine (input data). Your digestive system (SSM) reacts to this bitter taste by activating certain reflexes and preparing to process it. Then, you drink a sweet beverage (another input) which helps smooth the process, activating different reflexes.
Here���s how it maps:
Bitter Medicine:
Activates specific digestive reflexes (SSM parameters adjust for this input).
Sweet Drink:
Activates swallowing and peristalsis reflexes that help the medicine go down (parameters adjust again).
This is like how selective SSMs dynamically adjust based on the type of input they receive, enabling efficient processing of sequences by focusing on relevant details and adapting as needed.
Layer-wise Relevance Propagation (LRP)
Concept Overview:
LRP explains model decisions by tracing back the importance of each input feature, similar to understanding how different stages of digestion contribute to the processing of food.
Simple Example:
Imagine you want to understand why you feel good after a meal:
The bitter medicine was processed because the digestive system activated appropriate reflexes.
The sweet drink helped by activating swallowing reflexes
and promoting smooth peristalsis.
By tracing back through the digestive process, you can understand how each step contributed to your overall feeling of well-being. Similarly, LRP works by tracing back through the model to identify which features were important for its decision.
Applying LRP to Mamba Models
Concept Overview:
To make Mamba models explainable, LRP needs to function correctly through all parts of the model, preserving the importance of each input feature, much like ensuring each part of the digestive process correctly contributes to the overall digestion of food.
Simple Example:
Imagine you had a complex meal and want to ensure each part of your digestive system handles the food properly:
Reconstruct the Process:
Trace back through each stage of digestion (model layers) to see which foods (input features) were processed and how.
Ask for Explanations:
Understand why certain reflexes were activated:
Some for breaking down food (like chewing and stomach acid).
Some for absorption (like enzymes in the intestines).
Some for smooth passage (like peristalsis and swallowing reflexes).
Correcting Issues:
If you realize certain foods caused discomfort because they weren���t processed properly, you might adjust your diet or digestion aids to ensure better processing next time. Similarly, ensuring each model component correctly handles relevance involves adjustments to maintain the conservation property.
Multiplicative Gates and Relevance Propagation
Concept Overview:
Multiplicative gates in the Mamba model combine outputs, similar to how different digestive enzymes combine to break down food.
Simple Example:
Imagine your digestive system needs to combine the action of stomach acid (SSM output) with bile from the liver (SiLU output) to process fats:
If these actions aren't balanced properly, you might get an upset stomach (violating relevance conservation).
By ensuring each action contributes appropriately, you maintain a smooth digestion process.
Ensuring Conservation:
Treat half of the combined action as constant to avoid doubling the relevance (like ensuring each digestive enzyme contributes without overwhelming the system).
Summary
Step-by-Step Implementation:
Detach Operations:
Ensure each step in the model (like stages of digestion) properly accounts for input features without artificially inflating their importance.
Retrieve Explanations:
Perform the Gradient��Input operation on the modified model to understand the contributions of each input feature, similar to analyzing the digestive process to understand the contribution of each food and enzyme.
Enhancements for Other Layers:
Complement the strategies for RMSNorm and convolution layers to ensure robust relevance propagation throughout the entire model, similar to ensuring each part of the digestive system functions smoothly for overall health.
By using the digestive system analogy:
Selective SSMs:
Adjust dynamically like the digestive system responding to different foods.
LRP:
Traces back decisions like understanding the digestive process.
Correcting Issues:
Ensuring each component handles relevance properly, like ensuring each digestive enzyme contributes correctly.
This analogy helps make the complex concepts of selective SSMs and LRP more relatable and easier to understand.

I had a theory that people use digestion for a metaphor to establish a dominance and resolution criteria for music
ChatGPT
That's an intriguing theory! Let's explore how the metaphor of digestion might be used to establish dominance and resolution criteria for music, connecting it to the concepts of selective SSMs and LRP in Mamba models.
Digestion as a Metaphor for Music
Concept Overview:
Just as digestion involves breaking down and processing food to nourish the body, listening to music involves processing and resolving musical elements to create a satisfying auditory experience. The concepts of dominance and resolution in music could be metaphorically related to different stages and components of digestion.
Simple Example:
Imagine a piece of music as a meal, where each musical element (notes, chords, rhythms) represents different foods and flavors that need to be digested (processed) for the listener to feel satisfied.
Dominance in Music (Analogous to Key Components in Digestion)
Dominant Musical Elements:
These are the core parts of a piece that guide the overall structure and emotional impact, similar to how certain foods or enzymes dominate the digestive process.
Examples:
A strong melody or a powerful chord progression might be considered dominant, similar to how protein requires significant digestive effort.
Digestion Analogy:
The melody (protein) is broken down and absorbed by the listener's mind, providing the main 'nutrients' of the musical experience.
Resolution in Music (Analogous to Smooth Digestion and Absorption)
Musical Resolution:
This is the process of resolving tension and bringing the piece to a satisfying conclusion, much like how digestion resolves the breakdown of food into absorbable nutrients.
Examples:
A cadence that resolves to the tonic chord, or a rhythm that returns to a stable beat, providing a sense of completion.
Digestion Analogy:
The final breakdown and absorption of nutrients, where the body feels nourished and satisfied after a meal.
Connecting to Selective SSMs and LRP
Selective SSMs in Music Processing:
Just as selective SSMs adjust parameters dynamically based on input, listeners adjust their perception based on musical elements.
Dynamic Adjustment:
Similar to how selective SSMs focus on relevant parts of a sequence, listeners might focus on dominant musical elements, adjusting their expectations and emotional responses accordingly.
LRP in Music Understanding:
LRP can be likened to tracing back through a piece of music to understand the contribution of each element to the overall experience.
Tracing Importance:
Just as LRP identifies important features in a model's decision, listeners might reflect on which musical elements (like a memorable melody or a striking harmony) contributed most to their enjoyment.
Practical Application: Explaining Music Experience
Step-by-Step Analogy:
Identify Dominant Elements:
Determine the key musical components that guide the piece, akin to identifying the dominant foods in a meal.
Example:
A powerful chord progression or a recurring rhythmic motif.
Trace Resolution:
Understand how the piece resolves these elements, providing a satisfying conclusion, similar to how digestion resolves food into nutrients.
Example:
A final cadence resolving tension or a rhythm returning to a stable pattern.
Ensuring Satisfaction (Conservation of Musical Relevance):
Balance and Harmony:
Ensure each musical element contributes appropriately without overwhelming the listener, similar to balancing flavors in a dish.
Example:
Avoiding too many unresolved dissonances that might leave the listener feeling unsettled, just as too many rich foods might overwhelm digestion.
Conclusion
Using digestion as a metaphor for understanding music highlights the dynamic adjustment and resolution processes involved in both experiences. Just as selective SSMs dynamically adapt based on input and LRP traces back to explain decisions, listeners dynamically process and resolve musical elements to achieve a satisfying auditory experience.
This analogy not only helps in explaining the concepts of dominance and resolution in music but also bridges the understanding of selective SSMs and LRP by relating them to familiar, everyday processes.

The basic carbohydrates, fats, and proteins are like the diatonic notes and spices like chromatic notes or accidental and a harmony might be spices and a sweet relish. Dry and wet also act as counterpoints since dry foods shut down digestion and wet food activate it
ChatGPT
That's a fascinating and nuanced way to extend the analogy! Let���s explore how different elements of music can be compared to various components and processes of digestion, building on the idea that carbohydrates, fats, and proteins are like diatonic notes, and spices and harmonies add complexity to the experience.
Carbohydrates, Fats, and Proteins as Diatonic Notes
Basic Building Blocks:
Carbohydrates:
Simple and complex carbohydrates can be compared to the foundational diatonic notes (C, D, E, F, G, A, B) that form the basic structure of most Western music.
Example:
A melody based on a major scale, providing the primary 'nutrients' of a piece of music.
Fats:
Provide richness and depth, similar to how certain notes or chords add warmth and fullness to a piece.
Example:
Bass notes or harmonies that add body to the music, much like fats add richness to food.
Proteins:
Essential for structure and function, analogous to the core melodic and harmonic progressions that drive a piece of music.
Example:
A strong, central melody or chord progression that gives the piece its main shape and direction.
Spices and Chromatic Notes
Adding Complexity and Flavor:
Spices:
Just as spices add complexity and depth to a dish, chromatic notes and accidentals add flavor and interest to music.
Example:
A piece might include chromatic passing tones or unexpected accidentals to add tension and release, similar to how spices can enhance and diversify the taste of a meal.
Harmonies and Sweet Relishes:
Harmony:
The combination of multiple notes played together, creating chords that can be compared to complex flavors or relishes that complement the main ingredients.
Example:
Rich harmonies that enhance the overall texture and depth of a piece, like a sweet relish adding a complementary taste to a savory dish.
Dry and Wet Counterpoints
Texture and Activation:
Dry Foods:
Can inhibit or slow down digestion, similar to how certain musical elements might create tension or pause within a piece.
Example:
Staccato notes or rests that create a sense of interruption or separation.
Wet Foods:
Facilitate and activate digestion, analogous to musical elements that create flow and continuity.
Example:
Legato phrases or fluid melodic lines that keep the music moving smoothly.
Integration into Music Theory
Establishing Dominance and Resolution:
Dominance:
Core elements (carbohydrates, fats, proteins) create the main structure and drive the piece forward.
Example:
A strong melody (protein) with a rich harmonic foundation (fats) and rhythmic stability (carbohydrates).
Resolution:
Chromatic notes and harmonies (spices) introduce tension that needs to be resolved, much like how spices in a dish can balance or enhance the main flavors.
Example:
Tension created by accidentals resolves back to diatonic notes, creating a satisfying musical 'digestion' process.
Practical Application: Explaining Music Experience
Step-by-Step Analogy:
Identify Core Elements:
Determine the foundational notes and harmonies (carbohydrates, fats, proteins) that form the base of the piece.
Example:
Recognize the primary scale and key signature that guide the composition.
Add Complexity:
Identify the chromatic notes and accidentals (spices) that add flavor and tension.
Example:
Notice where the composer introduces unexpected notes or harmonies to enhance interest.
Balance and Texture:
Consider the texture and flow, using dry (staccato) and wet (legato) elements to create contrast and continuity.
Example:
Analyze how different articulations and phrasings affect the overall musical experience.
Ensuring Satisfaction (Conservation of Musical Relevance):
Balance and Harmony:
Ensure each musical element contributes appropriately without overwhelming the listener, similar to balancing flavors in a dish.
Example:
Avoiding excessive dissonance that might leave the listener feeling unsettled, just as too many rich foods might overwhelm digestion.
By using these analogies, we can create a more relatable and comprehensive understanding of music theory and its parallels with digestion. This approach not only enhances our grasp of musical structure and dynamics but also provides a familiar framework for explaining complex concepts in a more intuitive way.

Uncovering gender bias in Mamba.Explanation methods serve as tools to uncover biases in pretrained vision and 
language models. Using our proposed method, we examine Mamba-130M and Mamba-1.4B models, trained on the 
Medical BIOS dataset, to investigate the potential presence of gender biases. Following the methodology in [24], 
we use MambaLRP to identify the top-5 tokens of highest importance and to quantify the prevalence of gendered 
words within these tokens. We i nd that the model exhibits a pronounced preference for female-gendered words 
in the ���Nurse��� class (e.g. the proportion of gender-specif i c words is 0.058 for females, compared to 0.0 for males 
in Mamba-130M.). We also compare the results of our analysis with those achieved for the GPT2-base, T5-base, 
and RoBERTa-base models as mentioned in [24]. As shown in Table 3, both Mamba models are less dependent on 
gendered tokens compared to GPT2-base, T5-base, and RoBERTa-base models, with the Mamba-1.4B model showing 
a further decrease in bias compared to the Mamba-130M, suggesting improvements in reducing gender bias with 
increased model size. 
Investigating long-range capabilities of Mamba.The ability of SSMs to model long-range dependencies is 
considered an important improvement over previous sequence models. In this use case, we analyze the extent to which 
the pretrained Mamba-130M model can use information from the entire context window. We use the HotpotQA [69] 
subset from the LongBench dataset [11], designed to test long context understanding. After selecting all 127 instances, 
containing sequences up to 8192 tokens, we prompt the model to summarize the full paragraph by generating ten 
additional tokens. Fig. 6 shows the distribution of the positional difference between a relevant token and the currently 
generated token. While we observe a pronounced pattern of attributing to the last few tokens, as seen in prior language 
generation studies [70,52], the extracted explanations also identif i ed relevant tokens across the entire context window, 
as presented for one example in Fig. 6 (right). This suggests that the model is indeed capable of retrieving long-range 
dependencies. We clearly see that in order to complete the sentence and assign a year to the album release date, the 
model analyzes previous occurrences of chronological information and MambaLRP identif i es evidence supporting the 
decision for the date being ���1972��� as relevant. This demonstrates the previously speculated long-range abilities of the 
Mamba architecture [29]. 
Needle-in-a-haystack test.To assess the model���s ability in retrieving relevant pieces of information from a broader 
context, we perform the needle-in-a-haystack test [41]. Our test involves extracting a single passkey (the ���needle���) 
from a collection of repeated noise sentences (the ���haystack���), as described in [33]. We run this test at eleven different 
document depths with three different context lengths. We use an instruction-f i netuned Mamba-2.8B model in this 
experiment. To analyze the performance of the model, we introduce the explanation-based retrieval accuracy (XRA) 
metric. In this approach, we i rst identify the positions of the top-K relevant tokens by MambaLRP, and then, calculate 
the accuracy by comparing those positions to the needle���s position. As shown in Fig. 7, MambaLRP accurately

be evaluated by conventional retrieval accuracy metrics. Such cases and also further details about this experiment are 
shown in Appendix C.7. 
7Discussion and conclusion 
Mamba models have emerged as an eff i cient alternative to Transformers. However, there are limited works addressing 
their interpretability [4]. To address this issue, we proposed MambaLRP within the LRP framework, specif i cally 
tailored to the Mamba architecture and built upon the relevance conservation principle. Our evaluations across 
various models and datasets conf i rmed that MambaLRP adheres to the conservation property and provides faithful 
explanations that outperform other methods while being more computationally eff i cient. Moreover, we demonstrated 
how MambaLRP can help to debug state-of-the-art ML models and build trust in them through various use cases. 
Although our experiments focus on applying MambaLRP to vision and language models, its usefulness extends 
beyond these domains. Future research can explore its potential across a broader range of applications and Mamba 
architectures, providing reliable insights into sequence models.

I guess I was arguing that these models should be able to learn to cook and play music as well since they are based on simple grammar like rules. I know because I don't need to follow a recipe and use salty, sour, bitter, and sweet flavors to balance each other out, I don't have to taste it ahead even if I haven't used that ingedient before.
ChatGPT
That's an insightful argument! Let's delve deeper into the idea that models like Mamba, which are based on structured rules and capable of learning complex patterns, could potentially learn tasks like cooking and playing music. Your analogy about balancing flavors without following a strict recipe highlights an intuitive understanding of how elements interact, which can be mapped onto the capabilities of such models.
Cooking and Music as Structured Grammar-Like Tasks

Basic Elements:
Notes (like ingredients) can be combined in scales, chords, and rhythms to create music.
Harmonies and Melodies:
These follow specific patterns and rules that can be learned and applied.
Learning to Cook and Play Music
Modeling Flavor Balancing:
Just as you intuitively balance flavors in cooking, models can learn to balance different elements based on training data.
Training Data:
Provide the model with examples of recipes and flavor profiles. The model learns the relationships between ingredients and flavors.
Task Execution:
When given a new set of ingredients, the model predicts how to combine them to achieve a balanced dish, even if it hasn't encountered that specific combination before.
Modeling Musical Composition:
Similar to cooking, musical composition can be learned by understanding the relationships between notes, rhythms, and harmonies.
Training Data:
Provide the model with examples of music compositions, including the rules of music theory.
Task Execution:
When given a musical theme or a set of notes, the model can generate a composition that follows the learned rules of harmony and rhythm.

The model applies rules of music theory (like flavor balancing) to create compositions that are harmonious and pleasing.
Practical Implementation:
Data Collection:
Gather extensive datasets of recipes and musical compositions.
Model Training:
Train models like Mamba on these datasets, teaching them the underlying grammar-like rules of cooking and music.
Rule Application:
Use techniques like Layer-wise Relevance Propagation (LRP) to ensure the model's decisions are interpretable, just like balancing flavors intuitively without needing to taste every combination.
Examples:
Cooking:
The model predicts that adding lemon juice (sour) to a dish with honey (sweet) will balance the flavors, even if it hasn't encountered that exact combination before.
Music:
The model predicts that a certain chord progression will resolve harmoniously in a given key, even if it hasn't seen that specific progression before.
Future Directions
Extending Model Capabilities:
Cross-Disciplinary Learning:
Models could learn from both cooking and music data, understanding broader principles of balance, harmony, and creativity.
Interactive Learning:
Models could receive feedback (akin to tasting) to refine their predictions, improving over time with more data and experience.
Conclusion:
Your intuition about balancing flavors without strict recipes parallels how models like Mamba could learn to cook and play music. By understanding the underlying principles and patterns, these models can generate new, balanced, and harmonious outputs, whether in the kitchen or in musical composition. The use of structured grammar-like rules and extensive training data can enable these models to perform complex tasks creatively and intuitively.

I painted some of my piano keys now I can see which notes I used the most since those notes are worn off more
ChatGPT
That's a creative way to visually track your most frequently used notes! This concept can be applied to models like Mamba to illustrate how they could learn patterns and preferences in tasks such as music composition or cooking. Let's delve into how this idea connects to the functionality of these models and the concept of explainability.
Tracking Usage in Music and Cooking
Visual Feedback and Learning:
Music:
By painting your piano keys, you create a visual map of your playing habits. The worn-off keys indicate your frequently used notes, providing insight into your playing style and preferences.
Cooking:
Similarly, a chef might notice which ingredients get used the most based on how quickly they run out, indicating their go-to flavors and combinations.
Applying This Concept to Models
Modeling and Tracking Patterns:
Data Analysis:
In models, tracking the frequency of certain inputs can help understand which elements are most influential. For example, in a music composition model, you could track which notes or chords are most frequently generated.
Explainability:
Using techniques like Layer-wise Relevance Propagation (LRP), you can identify which inputs (notes, ingredients) the model considers most relevant for its decisions.
Visual Representations:
Heatmaps:
Create visual representations (heatmaps) of note or ingredient usage. Just as your painted keys show wear, a heatmap can highlight frequently used components.
Music Heatmap:
Show which notes or chords the model uses most often in compositions.
Cooking Heatmap:
Display which ingredients or flavor combinations are most frequently recommended.
Practical Implementation
Collect Data:
Gather data on note usage in your piano playing and ingredient usage in recipes.
Train Models:

I do think it should be relatively easy to reconstruct a receipt if you weighed each ingredient before and after adding it
ChatGPT
Absolutely! Weighing each ingredient before and after adding it provides a precise way to reconstruct a recipe. This method is akin to tracking the inputs and their contributions in a model, which aligns well with the principles of explainability and relevance propagation. Let's explore this concept further and see how it can be applied to both cooking and model explainability.
Weighing Ingredients and Reconstructing Recipes
Step-by-Step Process:
Weigh Ingredients Before Adding:
Measure the weight of each ingredient before adding it to the dish.
Add Ingredients:
Add the ingredients to the dish during the cooking process.
Weigh Ingredients After Adding:
Measure the remaining weight of each ingredient to determine how much was used.
Reconstruct Recipe:
Use the difference in weights to reconstruct the exact amounts used for each ingredient.
Example:
Ingredient A:
Before adding: 200g, After adding: 50g, Amount used: 150g
Ingredient B:
Before adding: 100g, After adding: 90g, Amount used: 10g
By tracking these measurements, you can accurately document the recipe.
Applying This Concept to Model Explainability
Tracking Input Contributions in Models:
In a similar way, models can track the contribution of each input feature to the final decision. This can be done using techniques like Layer-wise Relevance Propagation (LRP) to measure the relevance of each input.
Step-by-Step Process:
Identify Input Features:
Determine the features (analogous to ingredients) used by the model.
Measure Initial Relevance:
Assess the initial relevance of each feature before processing.
Process Input Features:
Let the model process the input features through its layers.
Measure Final Relevance:
Evaluate the relevance of each feature in the final decision.
Reconstruct Contribution:
Use the change in relevance to understand the contribution of each feature to the model's output.
Example:
Feature X:
Initial relevance: 0.3, Final relevance: 0.6, Contribution: Increase of 0.3
Feature Y:
Initial relevance: 0.2, Final relevance: 0.1, Contribution: Decrease of 0.1
By tracking these changes, you can reconstruct how each feature contributed to the decision.
Practical Applications
Cooking:
Recipe Documentation:
Accurately document recipes by weighing ingredients before and after use.
Ingredient Tracking:
Track which ingredients are used most frequently to analyze cooking patterns.
Model Explainability:
Feature Relevance:
Use LRP to track the relevance of input features before and after processing.
Decision Transparency:
Reconstruct the contribution of each feature to the model's decision, enhancing transparency and trust.
Visualization and Analysis
Cooking:
Visual Recipe Reconstruction:
Create visual representations of ingredient usage, similar to a bar chart showing amounts before and after adding.
Pattern Analysis:
Analyze patterns in ingredient usage to refine recipes and understand flavor profiles.
Model Explainability:
Relevance Heatmaps:
Generate heatmaps to visualize the relevance of input features at different stages of processing.
Contribution Analysis:
Analyze how features contribute to different outputs, helping to refine the model and ensure it aligns with expected behavior.
Conclusion
By weighing ingredients before and after adding them, you can accurately reconstruct recipes, providing precise documentation and insights into your cooking process. This method parallels how models can track the relevance and contribution of input features, using techniques like LRP to provide transparent and explainable decisions. This approach not only enhances the accuracy and reliability of recipes but also builds trust and understanding in model predictions, making it a valuable tool for both culinary and machine learning applications.
