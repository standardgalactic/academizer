Abstract 
Quantum error correction becomes a practical possibility only if the physical error rate is below a threshold 
value that depends on a particular quantum code, syndrome measurement circuit, and a decoding algorithm. Here 
we present an end-to-end quantum error correction protocol that implements fault-tolerant memory based on a 
family of LDPC codes with a high encoding rate that achieves an error threshold of 0.8% for the standard circuit- 
based noise model. This is on par with the surface code which has remained an uncontested leader in terms of its 
high error threshold for nearly 20 years. The full syndrome measurement cycle for a length-n code in our family 
requires n ancillary qubits and a depth-7 circuit composed of nearest-neighbor CNOT gates. The required qubit 
connectivity is a degree-6 graph that consists of two edge-disjoint planar subgraphs. As a concrete example, we 
show that 12 logical qubits can be preserved for ten million syndrome cycles using 288 physical qubits in total, 
assuming the physical error rate of 0.1%. We argue that achieving the same level of error suppression on 12 logical 
qubits with the surface code would require more than 4000 physical qubits. Our i ndings bring demonstrations of 
a low-overhead fault-tolerant quantum memory within the reach of near-term quantum processors. 
1Introduction 
Quantum computing attracted attention due to its ability to of f er asymptotically faster solutions to a set of com- 
putational problems compared to the best known classical algorithms [1]. It is believed that a scalable functioning 
quantum computer may help solve computational problems in such areas as scientif i c discovery, materials research, 
chemistry, and drug design, to name a few [2, 3, 4, 5]. 
The main obstacle to building a quantum computer is the fragility of quantum information, owing to various sources 
of noise af f ecting it. Since isolating a quantum computer from external ef f ects and controlling it to induce a desired 
computation are in conf l ict with each other, noise appears to be inevitable. The sources of noise include imperfections 
in qubits, materials used, controlling apparatus, State Preparation and Measurement (SPAM) errors, and a variety of 
external factors ranging from local man-made, such as stray electromagnetic i elds, to those inherent to the Universe, 
such as cosmic rays. See Ref. [6] for a summary. While some sources of noise can be eliminated with better control 
[7], materials [8], and shielding [9, 10, 11], a number of other sources appear to be dif i cult if at all possible to remove. 
The latter kind can include spontaneous and stimulated emission in trapped ions [12, 13], and the interaction with 
the bath (Purcell Ef f ect) [14] in superconducting circuitsâcovering both leading quantum technologies. Thus, error 
correction becomes a key requirement for building a functioning scalable quantum computer.

The possibility of quantum fault tolerance was established earlier [15].Encoding a logical qubit redundantly 
into many physical qubits enables one to diagnose and correct errors by repeatedly measuring syndromes of parity 
check operators. However, error correction is only benef i cial if the hardware error rate is below a certain threshold 
value that depends on a particular error correction protocol. The i rst proposals for quantum error correction, such 
as concatenated codes [16, 17, 18], focused on demonstrating the theoretical possibility of error suppression.As 
understanding of quantum error correction and the capabilities of quantum technologies matured, the focus shifted 
to i nding practical quantum error correction protocols. This resulted in the development of the surface code [19, 20, 
21, 22] that of f ers a high error threshold close to 1%, fast decoding algorithms, and compatibility with the existing 
quantum processors relying on 2-dimensional (2D) square lattice qubit connectivity. Small examples of the surface 
code with a single logical qubit have been already demonstrated experimentally by several groups [23, 24, 25, 26, 27]. 
However, scaling up the surface code to a hundred or more logical qubits would be prohibitively expensive due to its 
poor encoding ef i ciency. This spurred interest in more general quantum codes known as Low-Density Parity-Check 
(LDPC) codes [28].Recent progress in the study of LDPC codes suggests that they can achieve quantum fault- 
tolerance with a much higher encoding ef i ciency [29]. Here, we focus on the study of LDPC codes, as our goal is 
to i nd quantum error correction codes and protocols that are both ef i cient and possible to demonstrate in practice, 
given the limitations of quantum computing technologies. 
A quantum error correcting code is of LDPC type if each check operator of the code acts only on a few qubits 
and each qubit participates only in a few checks. Multiple variants of the LDPC codes have been proposed recently 
including hyperbolic surface codes [30], hypergraph product [31], balanced product codes [32], two-block codes based 
on i nite groups [33, 34, 35, 36], and quantum Tanner codes [37, 38]. The latter were shown [37, 38] to be asymptotically 
âgoodâ in the sense of of f ering a constant encoding rate and linear distance â a parameter quantifying the number of 
correctable errors. In contrast, the surface code has an asymptotically zero encoding rate and only square-root distance. 
Replacing the surface code with a high-rate, high-distance LDPC code could have major practical implications. First, 
fault-tolerance overhead (the ratio between the number of physical and logical qubits) could be reduced dramatically. 
Secondly, high-distance codes exhibit a very sharp decrease in the logical error rate: as the physical error probability 
crosses the threshold value, the amount of error suppression achieved by the code can increase by orders of magnitude 
even with a small reduction of the physical error rate. This feature makes high-distance LDPC codes attractive for 
near-term demonstrations which are likely to operate in the near-threshold regime. However, the performance of more 
general LDPC codes for realistic noise models including memory, gate, and SPAM errors remained largely unknown 
due to the absence of ef i cient decoding algorithms. Furthermore, it was believed that realizing more general LDPC 
codes on hardware requires prohibitively high qubit connectivity.1 / 1ChatGPTThis paper presents an end-to-end quantum error correction protocol that implements fault-tolerant quantum memory. Utilizing a family of Low-Density Parity-Check (LDPC) codes, the authors achieve a high encoding rate with an error threshold of 0.8%, on par with the long-standing surface code, but with substantially fewer physical qubits needed. The new method requires specific qubit connectivity and features a depth-7 circuit composed of nearest-neighbor CNOT gates. This approach promises low-overhead fault-tolerant quantum memory, preserving 12 logical qubits using 288 physical qubits. The findings potentially bring the demonstration of low-overhead fault-tolerant quantum memory within the reach of near-term quantum processors. It may have significant implications for the practical realization of quantum computing, especially concerning scalability and efficiency, thereby opening new avenues in fields like scientific discovery, materials research, and drug design.1 / 1Here we present several concrete examples of high-rate LDPC codes with a few hundred physical qubits equipped 
with a low-depth syndrome measurement circuit, an ef i cient decoding algorithm, and a fault-tolerant protocol for 
addressing individual logical qubits. These codes exhibit an error threshold close to 1%, show excellent performance in 
the near-threshold regime, and of f er nearly 15X reduction of the encoding overhead compared with the surface code. 
Hardware requirements for realizing our error correction protocols are relatively mild, as each physical qubit is coupled 
by two-qubit gates with only six other qubits. Although the qubit connectivity graph is not locally embeddable into 
a 2D grid, it can be decomposed into two planar degree-3 subgraphs. As we argue below, such qubit connectivity 
is well-suited for architectures based on superconducting qubits. Before stating our results, let us describe several 
must-have features for a quantum error-correcting code to be suitable for near-term experimental demonstrations and 
formally pose the problem addressed in this work. 
2Code selection criteria 
In this work, we study the problem of realizing a fault-tolerant quantum memory with a small qubit overhead and a 
large code distance. Our goal is to construct a combination of the LDPC code, syndrome measurement circuitry, and 
2 
the decoding (error correction) algorithms, suitable for a near-term demonstration, but also of f ering long-term utility, 
while taking into account the capabilities and limitations of the superconducting circuits quantum hardware. In other 
words, we seek to develop a practical error correction protocol. Our selection criteria ref l ect this goal. 
We focus on encoding k â« 1 logical qubits into n data qubits and use c ancillary check qubits to measure the error 
syndrome. In total, the code relies on n+c physical qubits. The net encoding rate is therefore 
r = 
k 
n + c. 
For example, the standard surface code architecture encodes k=1 logical qubit into n=d2data qubits for a distance-d 
code and uses c=nâ1 check qubits for syndrome measurements. The net encoding rate is r â 1/(2d2), 
which quickly 
becomes impractical as one is forced to choose a large code distance, due to, for instance, the physical errors being 
close to the threshold value. In contrast, we seek a high-rate LDPC code with r â« 1/d2. 
To prevent the accumulation of errors one must be able to measure the error syndrome frequently enough. This is 
accomplished by a syndrome measurement (SM) circuit that couples data qubits in the support of each check operator 
with the respective ancillary qubit by a sequence of CNOT gates. Check qubits are then measured revealing the value 
of the error syndrome. The time it takes to implement the SM circuit is proportional to its depth â the number of 
gate layers composed of non-overlapping CNOTs. Since new errors continue to occur while the SM circuit is executed, 
its depth should be minimized. Thus we seek an LDPC code with a high rate r and low-depth SM circuit. 
A noisy version of the SM circuit may include several types of faulty operations such as memory errors on data 
or check qubits, faulty CNOT gates, qubit initializations and measurements.We consider the circuit-based noise 
model [22] where each operation fails with the probability p.Faults on dif f erent operations are independent.A 
logical error occurs when the i nal error-corrected state of k logical qubits dif f ers from the initial encoded state. The 
probability of a logical error pLdepends on the error rate p, details of the SM circuits, and a decoding algorithm. A 
pseudo-threshold p0of an error correction protocol is def i ned as a solution of the break-even equation pL(p) = kp. 
Here kp is an estimate of the probability that at least one of k unencoded qubits suf f ers from an error. To achieve 
a signif i cant error suppression in the regime pâ¼10â3, 
which is relevant for near-term demonstrations, it is desirable 
to have pseudo-threshold close to 1% or higher. For example, the surface code architecture achieves pseudo-threshold 
p0â 1% for a large enough code distance [22]. We seek a high-rate LDPC code with a low-depth SM circuit and a 
high pseudo-threshold. 
A logical error is undetectable if it can be generated without triggering any syndromes. Such errors span at least d 
data qubits for a distance-d code. Let us say that a SM circuit has distance dcircif it takes at least dcircfaulty operations 
in the circuit to generate an undetectable logical error. By def i nition, dcircâ¤d for any distance-d code and typically 
dcirc<d since a few faulty operations in the SM circuit may create a high-weight error on the data qubits. We say that 
a SM circuit is distance-preserving if dcirc=d meaning the circuit is designed so as to avoid accumulating high-weight 
errors, which is the best one can hope for. It is preferred (but not required) that the SM circuit is distance-preserving. 
Another criterion is dictated by the limited qubit connectivity of near-term quantum devices. Each quantum code 
can be described by a Tanner graph G such that each vertex of G represents either a data qubit or a check operator. 
A check vertex i and a data vertex j are connected by an edge if the i-th check operator acts non-trivially on the j-th 
data qubit (by applying Pauli X or Z). Figure 1 shows the Tanner graph describing a distance-3 surface code. To 
keep the SM circuit depth small, it is desirable that two-qubit gates such as CNOT can be applied along every edge 
of the Tanner graph. By construction, the Tanner graph of any LDPC code has a small degree. One drawback of 
high-rate LDPC codes is that their Tanner graphs may not be locally embeddable into the 2D grid [39, 40]. This poses 
a challenge for hardware implementation with superconducting qubits coupled by microwave resonators. A useful 
VLSI design concept is graph thickness, see [41, 29] for details. A graph G=(V,E) is said to have thickness Î¸ if one 
can partition its set of edges E into disjoint union of Î¸ sets E1â E2â ... â EÎ¸=E 
such that each subgraph (V,Ei) is 
planar. Informally, a graph with thickness Î¸ can be viewed as a vertical stack of Î¸ planar graphs. Qubit connectivity 
described by a planar graph (thickness Î¸=1) is the simplest one from hardware perspective since the couplers do not cross. Graphs with thickness Î¸=2 might still be implementable since two planar layers of couplers and their control 
lines can be attached to the top and the bottom side of the chip hosting qubits, and the two sides mated (see Section 9 
for a detailed discussion). Graphs with thickness Î¸â¥3 are much harder to implement. Thus we seek a high-rate LDPC 
code with a low-depth SM circuit, high pseudo-threshold, and a low-degree Tanner graph with thickness Î¸ â¤ 2. 
Finally, the code must perform a useful function within a larger architecture for quantum computation, the simplest 
of which is a quantum memory. In a quantum memory it must be possible to measure every logical qubit in at least one 
Pauli basis, permitting initialization and readout of individual qubits. Furthermore it should be possible to connect 
the code to another error correction code and facilitate Pauli product measurements between their logical qubits. This 
enables load-store operations that transfer quantum data out of and into the code via quantum teleportation. For the 
purpose of the shorter-term goal of demonstrating the code in practice, the code should also feature enough logical 
operations to facilitate experiments to verify correct operation. 
Our code selection criteria are summarized below. 
1. We desire a code with a large distance d and a high encoding rate râ«1/d2, 
2. that is complemented by a short-depth syndrome measurement circuit, 
3. of f ers a pseudo-threshold close to 1% (or higher) for the circuit-based noise model, 
4. is constructed over thickness-2 or less Tanner graph, 
5. and possesses fault-tolerant load-store operations as well as readout and initialization of individual qubits.1 / 1ChatGPTIt seems like you've shared a detailed description of the construction and properties of high-rate LDPC (Low-Density Parity-Check) codes, focusing on their application in quantum error correction with superconducting qubits.

Realizing efficient quantum error-correction with three-qubit codes
Long Huang
In this work, the efficient quantum error-correction protocol against the general independent noise is constructed with the three-qubit quantum error-correction codes. The rules of concatenation are summarized according to the error-correcting capability of the codes. The codes not only play the role of correcting errors, but the role of polarizing the effective channel. The performance of the protocol is dependent on the type of noise and the level of concatenation. For the general Pauli noise, the threshold of the protocol is 0.91518 when against the depolarizing noise, while for the amplitude damping noise it is about 0.849. For the general independent noise, the threshold of the protocol is about 0.932, which is obtained through the numerical simulations. If there is no limit on the level of concatenation, the error-correction threshold can be much lower. The physical resources costed by this protocol is multiple of the physical resources costed by realizing the three-qubit quantum error-correction, with no increase in complexity. We believe it will be helpful for realizing quantum error-correction in the physical system1 / 1ChatGPTThe text you shared describes a specific approach to quantum error correction using three-qubit quantum error-correction codes. This approach seems to construct an efficient protocol against general independent noise and emphasizes how the codes perform error correction and polarization of the effective channel. It also outlines the performance thresholds for various types of noise, and how the physical resources required for this protocol are linked to the realization of three-qubit quantum error correction.Connection to the previous information:Quantum Error Correction: Both texts focus on quantum error correction, a key requirement for building robust and reliable quantum computing systems. The previous text emphasizes LDPC codes, while the latter focuses on three-qubit codes.Thresholds: Both works discuss thresholds for the error correction protocol. The latter text provides specific thresholds for general Pauli noise, depolarizing noise, and amplitude damping noise.Resource Efficiency: Both documents highlight efficiency. The initial text stresses reducing overhead compared to surface codes, while the second text emphasizes that the physical resources for the three-qubit protocol are multiples of those required for realizing three-qubit quantum error correction without increasing complexity.Noise Consideration: Both works consider the impact of noise on error correction. The first text mentions considerations for noisy syndrome measurement circuits, while the second explores the protocol's performance against different types of noise, such as depolarizing and amplitude damping noise.Suitability for Implementation: The initial text outlines the criteria for the LDPC codes, focusing on practicality and suitability for superconducting qubits. The latter text argues that the protocol will be helpful for realizing quantum error correction in physical systems.In summary, both documents are interconnected through their focus on quantum error correction, efficiency considerations, noise management, and practical implementation within quantum systems.1 / 1What about with this?'Acknowledgements We acknowledge a generous allotment (of about 3,000 c.p.u. days) of

Scalable quantum computation1and communication require 
error control to protect quantum information against unavoid- 
able noise. Quantum error correction2,3protects information 
storedintwo-levelquantumsystems(qubits)by rectifyingerrors 
with operations conditioned on the measurement outcomes. 
Error-correction protocols have been implemented in nuclear 
magnetic resonance experiments4â6, but the inherent limitations 
of this technique7prevent its application to quantum infor- 
mation processing. Here we experimentally demonstrate quan- 
tum error correction using three beryllium atomic-ion qubits 
conf i ned to a linear, multi-zone trap. An encoded one-qubit state 
is protected against spin-f l ip errors by means of a three-qubit 
quantum error-correcting code. A primary ion qubit is prepared 
in an initial state, which is then encoded into an entangled state 
of three physical qubits (the primary and two ancilla qubits). 
Errors are induced simultaneously in all qubits at various rates. 
The encoded state is decoded back to the primary ion one-qubit 
state, making error information available on the ancilla ions, 
which are separated from the primary ion and measured. Finally, 
the primary qubit state is corrected on the basis of the ancillae 
measurement outcome. We verify error correction by comparing 
the corrected i nal state to the uncorrected state and to the initial 
state. In principle, the approach enables a quantum state to be 
maintained by means of repeated error correction, an important 
step towards scalable fault-tolerant quantum computation using 
trapped ions. 
Error-correcting codes that utilize entanglement to rectify 
unknown errors in qubits are an important ingredient for large- 
scale quantum information processing1â3(QIP). Owing to the 
fragility of quantum states, the presence of noise during both 
storage and entangling operations diminishes any gain achieved 
through the use of QIP without error correction. For example, the 
realizationoflong-distancequantumcryptographyrequiresprotec- 
tion from the effects of noise on communication channels8. In 
addition, quantum error correction will be necessary for appli- 
cations of quantum computing such as eff i cient factorization of 
large numbers1,9. It is notable that any of an inf i nite set of qubit 
errorscanbecorrectedthroughquantumerrorcorrectionby means 
of a i nite set of unitary operations conditioned on measurement. 
Although therehas been extensivetheoretical researchin the area 
ofquantumerrorcorrection,experimentalworkhasbeenlimitedto 
protocol process verif i cations by means of liquid-state nuclear 
magnetic resonance. These experiments4â6showed an increase in 
state i delity after performing the unitary operations of an error- 
correction protocol, but using techniques known not to scale 
eff i ciently with the number of qubits7. Furthermore, the ancillae 
cannot be reset in these experiments, whereas the experiment we 
describe provides this capability. In principle, the protocol demon- 
strated here can be repeated with the same qubits as many times as 
required by a particular quantum algorithm. 
We describe the implementation of a quantum error-correcting 
code (QECC) using three physical qubits, here denoted as the 
primary qubit and ancillae 1 and 2, to encode and protect one 
logical qubitfromspin-f l iperrors(aprotationaroundthexaxis,in 
this case). Each qubit comprises two hyperf i ne states of a 9BeÃ¾ ion 
and can be coherently manipulated by means of laser pulses10,11. We 
implement the QECC by (1) preparing the state the primary qubit, 
(2) encoding this state into the logical state of all three qubits 
through use of an entangling operation, (3) applying an error 
rotation (that induces spin-f l ips upon measurement) to all three 
qubits, (4) decoding the logical state to the primary qubit, (5) 
measuring the state of the ancillae, and i nally (6) applying correc- 
tion operations to the primary qubit dependent upon the ancillae 
measurement outcome. The error correction is performed determi- 
nistically in every experiment. The results indicate that such 
methods, coupled with other recent experimental advances11â14, 
may lead to scalable QIP in a system of trapped ions. 
In contrast to the standard repetition code2,3,15, the QECC 
described and implemented here (see Fig. 1) can not be obtained 
by application of the superposition principle to a classical error- 
correction code. It is a stabilizer code15with stabilizer group 
generators {ZZX, ZXZ}. These generators are tensor products of 
Paulioperators(X Â¼ jx,Z Â¼ jz)operating 
onthequbits 1,2and3. 
By calculation of the commutation relations of the generators with 
various error sets, it can be seen that as an error-detecting code, the 
QECC presented here detects not only spin-f l ips on any qubit but 
also a spin-f l ip or phase-f l ip on qubits 2 and 3. As an error- 
correction code, it will correct a spin-f l ip on any of the three qubits 
(the case for this work), but it can instead be used to correct a spin- 
l iponqubit 1andaspin-f l iporphase-f l iponqubit2orqubit3,for 
example. Another possible implementation can correct a spin-f l ip 
on qubit 1 and a phase-f l ip on either of the other two qubits. 
In the experiment, we use 9BeÃ¾ ions conf i ned to the axis of a 
multi-zone linear radio frequency Paul trap11similar to that 
described in ref. 16. The qubits comprise the electronic ground- 
state hyperf i ne levels jF Â¼ 1;mFÂ¼ 21l and jF Â¼ 2;mFÂ¼ 22l 
(denoted as j " l and j # l respectively, by analogy to the states of a 
spin-1 2particle). HereFis thetotal angular momentum andmFis its 
projection along the quantization axis. The qubits are entangled 
with a three-qubit phase gate utilizing the ionsâ quantized axial

for example, Xp/2Â¼ R(p/2, 0), although for rotations around an

Measurement is accomplished through projection of the state of 
each qubit using state-dependent resonance l uorescence (an ion in 
the j # l state l uoresces, whereas an ion in the j " l state does not). 
The ions can be transported from one zone of the trap to another

through concerted variation of the potentials on segmented control 
electrodes of the trap, and individual ion detections can be per- 
formed separately11,19. 
Ion preparation before each implementation of the QECC 
protocol consists of Doppler cooling, Raman sideband cooling of 
all three axial modes of vibration to the ground state, and optical

It explains the methods for preparing, encoding, applying errors, decoding, measuring, and correcting states.The experiment utilizes a three-qubit quantum error-correcting code (QECC) that can correct a spin-flip error on any of the three qubits. It includes the usage of laser pulses, Pauli operators, and various rotations to perform the encoding and error correction. The paper emphasizes that this protocol can be repeated with the same qubits as many times as required by a particular quantum algorithm, which might lead to scalable quantum information processing in a system of trapped ions.The explanation further breaks down the steps and intricacies involved in encoding, error application, and decoding stages of the experiment, using mathematical notation and specific physical concepts. The approach described seems to have a broad application in quantum computing and quantum cryptography, and it is part of the ongoing efforts to realize robust quantum error correction, which is vital for scalable quantum information processing.In comparison to the earlier description you provided, this text appears to focus on the practical realization of quantum error correction with a specific experimental setup using beryllium atomic-ion qubits. It emphasizes the implementation details and the mechanism for protecting against certain types of errors, while the previous description seems to be more concerned with the theoretical framework and efficiency considerations for quantum error correction using three-qubit codes.1 / 1Methods

Refocusing and auxiliary operations 
To simplify the syndrome determination when the ancillae are measured together, the 
protocol is designed such that an X operation is required to return the protected qubit to 
its initial state if no error has occurred, while no operation (the identity) is required if 
either one of the ancillae is l ipped, and a Yoperation is required if the primary bit is 
l ipped. The protocol was implemented in this fashion through the tailoring of the phases 
of twospin echo refocusing pulses11,16,17that arerequiredbetween encoding and decoding 
(spin echoes 2 and 3 in Fig. 1) to counteract qubit dephasing caused byf l uctuations in the 
local magnetic i eld from experiment to experiment. The time required for ion 
transportation in the trap necessitates additional spin-echo operations after decoding and 
beforecorrection(spinechoes4and5).Toreduceexperimentalmeasurementuncertainty, 
an ancilla mapping step is performed to associate the outcome that is expected most often 
(no error) with the ancillae state j " " lA, 
the state most easily distinguishable from the 
others when the ancillae are measured together. 
After the correction operation is applied to the primary qubit, we apply a rotation XvF 
to this qubit before measurement to characterize the effectiveness of the protocol. The 
angle vFis varied over many experiments such that we produce a sinusoidal trace of the 
probability of measuring the primary qubit to be in the state j # lPas 
it is rotated around 
the Bloch-sphere axis around which the error was applied. This allows a i t to a sinusoidal 
curve and hence precise measurement of the i nal state i delity of the primary qubit. 
Received 30 August; accepted 1 October 2004; doi:10.1038/nature03074.1 / 1ChatGPTIt appears you've pasted a technical description related to Quantum Error Correction Codes (QECC), involving specific experimental procedures for encoding and decoding logical states using a three-ion entangling operation. This passage details the entangling operations, interference patterns, spin states, phase-space manipulation, and other aspects of quantum information processing.Here's a brief overview of the key aspects:Three-Ion Entangling Operation: This operation utilizes the spin state of ions and is diagonal in the measurement basis. Specific mathematical expressions are given for the procedure.Walking Wave Polarization: The method uses two perpendicular beams of radiation to create an interference pattern at the ions' location, affecting the phase of oscillating optical-dipole force.Encoding and Decoding: This part describes the application of the three-ion entangling gate and other global rotations, implementing the encoding and decoding sections of the quantum error correction procedure.Refocusing and Auxiliary Operations: Here, the process for syndrome determination is described, including specifics about spin echo refocusing pulses, ancilla mapping, and necessary rotations and corrections.Measurement and Characterization: The last section outlines the procedure for measuring the primary qubit's final state fidelity by fitting it to a sinusoidal curve.The text is dense with specialized terminology and mathematical descriptions, making it suitable for an audience with a strong background in quantum physics and quantum information processing. If you need clarification on any specific points or have any particular questions, please let me know!1 / 1Give some examples and metaphors to explain the concepts.1 / 1ChatGPTCertainly! Quantum mechanics can be notoriously abstract, so let's break down some of the concepts with examples and metaphors:Three-Ion Entangling Operation: Imagine three dancers (ions) in a coordinated dance (entangling operation). If they all perform the same dance move (spin state), they remain in sync. If any dancer does a different move, they are out of sync. This mirrors the entanglement of quantum states, where particles become correlated.Walking Wave Polarization and Interference Pattern: Picture two ripples in a pond intersecting each other, creating an interference pattern of high and low points. In the experiment, these ripples are beams of radiation, and where they intersect affects the ions' location and energy state.Encoding and Decoding: Think of a treasure chest with three locks (ions). Encoding is the process of locking it using a complex key (entangling operation), while decoding is unlocking it. If any part of the key changes (an error in the quantum state), the locks won't open properly.Vibrational Mode and Phase-Space Area: Imagine a swing moving back and forth. Its movement can be described as a closed path in phase space, where position and momentum are considered. In the experiment, the ions' movement in phase space results in a specific phase for each state.Refocusing and Auxiliary Operations: Visualize trying to keep a spinning top upright. Small adjustments (spin echo refocusing pulses) are needed to counteract any wobbles (dephasing). The refocusing helps bring the quantum state back to its intended alignment.Measurement and Characterization: Think of the primary qubit as a spinning color wheel, where the color you see depends on the angle. By measuring the qubit at different angles (rotating it around the Bloch-sphere axis), you can create a detailed picture (sinusoidal curve) of its state. It's like using different filters to observe an image and gather information about its true colors.These metaphors and examples can help to provide an intuitive understanding of some of the more abstract concepts in quantum physics and information processing. However, it's important to note that these analogies are still simplifications of highly complex and non-intuitive phenomena. If you have specific questions about any of these concepts, I'd be happy to delve deeper!1 / 1Ok where there other difficult concepts discussed?1 / 1ChatGPTCertainly! The text you provided contains a blend of complex quantum mechanics and experimental physics, so there are many sophisticated concepts at play. Let's look at a few other challenging ideas:Quantum Error-Correcting Codes (QECC): This is like having multiple backup copies of a document. If an error occurs in one copy, the correct information can still be retrieved by looking at the others.Axial Center-of-Mass (COM) Vibrational Mode: Imagine a tightrope walker's pole. The center of mass helps balance the entire system, just as the center-of-mass vibrational mode is central to understanding how the ions behave.Oscillating Optical-Dipole Force: Think of a magnet rapidly switching polarity, pulling and pushing particles. This force is used to manipulate the ions' states in a highly controlled manner.Ancillae States: These are like assistant chefs in a kitchen. They don't create the main dish (the primary qubit), but they help with preparation and ensure everything goes smoothly.Bloch-Sphere Rotation: Imagine a globe that can be rotated to show any part of the world. Similarly, the Bloch sphere represents the state of a qubit and can be "rotated" to explore different aspects of that state.Error Correction Protocol: This can be likened to a self-correcting computer program. If an unexpected event occurs (e.g., a bit is flipped), the system has ways to detect and correct the error, restoring it to its intended state.Ancilla Mapping Step: Think of this as a sorting process in a factory. The most common product (no error) is placed on the most accessible shelf, making it easier to distinguish from the others.Sinusoidal Trace of Probability: Imagine tracing the height of a wave at the beach over time. This sinusoidal trace can be compared to the way the probability of a qubit being in a certain state is graphed as it's rotated around the Bloch-sphere axis.Global Rotations and Local Magnetic Field Fluctuations: Global rotations are like turning a whole picture, while local magnetic field fluctuations are like random pixels changing color. The combination creates a complex system that needs careful synchronization and control.The description in your text involves a multifaceted experiment that leverages these and possibly other complex principles. Understanding these requires an integration of knowledge across quantum mechanics, optics, mathematics, and experimental physics.

Tuesday 11:30 AMâ11:42 AM -  Room 415

Presenter : Dany Lachance-Quirion â VP Quantum Hardware

Bosonic codes aim to take advantage of the large Hilbert space offered by harmonic oscillators to encode logical qubits with some degrees of redundancy within a single physical system, thus providing a promising route for hardware-efficient fault-tolerant quantum computing. Most notably, Gottesman-Kitaev-Preskill (GKP) states are shown to be resilient to the main source of error in most bosonic systems, that is, single photon loss. Initialization and quantum error correction of GKP states have been recently demonstrated in both superconducting circuits and trapped ions. Here we present experimental results in superconducting circuits showing the stabilization of GKP states based on a recently proposed reservoir-engineering approach. In addition to cavity-ancillary qubit entangling gates and single ancillary qubit rotations, the technique uses a feedback-free reset of the ancillary qubit, making the quantum error correction protocol completely autonomous. The logical lifetime with quantum error correction is shown to be on par with the lifetime under free evolution, demonstrating autonomous quantum error correction close to the break-even threshold without any postselection.

 M71.00010 : Optimized qubit reset in a multimode superconducting circuit

Wednesday :10:12 AMâ10:24 AM â Room 407/408

Presenter: Valentin Kasper â Quantum theoretical physicist

Having the ability to efficiently reset a qubit in its ground state is essential for performing fast and reliable quantum computation. Recently, a fast and unconditional all-microwave reset of a superconducting qubit via a lossy cavity has been successfully implemented; allowing to perform this operation without the use of active feedback [1]. The reset is also a key element for autonomous stabilization of Gottesman-Kitaev-Preskill (GKP) states with the added complexity of having the qubit coupled to an additional, long-lived, cavity mode. In this setup, the unconditionality of the qubit reset is more challenging and the back-action of the controls further detrimental. Our work explores optimal quantum control in open systems to design feasible and efficient microwave pulse sequences that maximize the gate efficiency and minimize its impact on the logical lifetime of the GKP states. We compare the experimental implementation of the pulse sequence proposed in ref. [1] with optimized protocols and comment on the practical benefits of using optimized pulse sequences.

[1] Fast and Unconditional All-Microwave Reset of a Superconducting Qubit, P. Magnard et al. Phys. Rev. Lett. 121, 060502 (2018)

https://www.nordquantique.ca/news/marchmeeting20231 / 1ChatGPTThe topics you've mentioned are interconnected through the complex field of quantum error correction, focusing on the manipulation and stabilization of Gottesman-Kitaev-Preskill (GKP) states. Here are the connections among the described topics:Autonomous Quantum Error Correction of GKP states (Part 1: Experiments & Part 2: Theory):These two parts complement each other, representing the experimental and theoretical aspects of quantum error correction using GKP states.Bosonic codes and harmonic oscillators are explored as mediums to encode logical qubits, aiming for fault-tolerant quantum computing.Both presentations discuss the resilience of GKP states to errors like single photon loss.Experimental results in superconducting circuits, as well as the theory and simulations behind these experiments, connect the two sessions.Optimized Qubit Reset in a Multimode Superconducting Circuit:This topic is directly related to the stabilization of GKP states and involves optimal quantum control in open systems.It focuses on efficient qubit resetting, a key element in the autonomous stabilization of GKP states.The mention of superconducting circuits links back to the first topic's experimental results in the same area.The reference to Fast and Unconditional All-Microwave Reset emphasizes the use of novel methods to control qubits efficiently.Metaphors and Analogies to Simplify Concepts:GKP States & Quantum Error Correction: Think of GKP states as highly advanced software with built-in antivirus capabilities. They can self-repair and resist certain common errors (like photon loss), much like a computer program might self-repair corrupted files.Bosonic Codes & Harmonic Oscillators: Imagine a vast library (large Hilbert space) where information (logical qubits) is stored in unique, efficient ways using harmonious patterns (harmonic oscillators).Superconducting Circuits & Quantum Control: Consider this as a finely tuned orchestra where each musician (qubit) needs to be in perfect harmony. The conductor's movements (quantum control) ensure that each musician stays on track, and if someone makes a mistake, there are methods to quickly correct it (optimized qubit reset).Autonomous Stabilization: Think of a self-driving car that can navigate and correct its course without human intervention. It uses various sensors and algorithms to ensure it stays on the right path, much like how the autonomous stabilization of GKP states works.Overall, these topics represent cutting-edge research in quantum error correction, specifically focusing on GKP states' potential and novel techniques to manage and stabilize them. They involve both theoretical explorations and practical applications, with an eye towards efficient and fault-tolerant quantum computing.1 / 1Ok your mention of self-repair makes me think of those properties in animals, foam activated tires, and a type of bread machine and yoghurt making device that is made is a made of layers of pretzel shell and hard glucose. It could become self-maintaining with time although it would initially require a starter, a mechanical mini factory for compression rolling, centrifugal filtering, baking, and re-articulation (convalescent refactoring).1 / 1ChatGPTIt sounds like you're drawing on a rich tapestry of examples from both biological systems and technology to understand the concept of self-repair and self-maintenance. Let's explore those connections:Animals: Some animals possess remarkable abilities to regenerate lost or damaged body parts. For example, a starfish can regrow a lost arm, and a salamander can regenerate an entire limb. This natural form of self-repair is akin to the way quantum error correction methods seek to identify and correct errors, restoring the system to its desired state.Foam-Activated Tires: Modern tires with self-sealing technology contain a layer of sealant material that can automatically fill punctures. This immediate and autonomous correction of a problem is similar to the way quantum error correction operates in stabilizing states without the need for human intervention.Layered Bread Machine & Yoghurt Making Device with Pretzel Shell and Hard Glucose: Your imaginative concept of a self-maintaining bread machine and yoghurt maker offers a beautiful metaphor for complex quantum systems. Much like quantum systems that need an initial âstarterâ (like initial conditions or specific entangled states), your machine would require an initial input. But once set in motion, it could, in theory, become self-sustaining, rolling, filtering, baking, and refactoring in a cycle that mirrors the ongoing process of error detection and correction in quantum systems.The term "convalescent refactoring" you mentioned adds an extra layer of complexity. "Convalescent" often relates to recovery, and "refactoring" can mean restructuring something without changing its external behavior. This could symbolize how quantum systems continually adjust and correct internal states to maintain desired output, even in the face of errors.These metaphors beautifully illustrate the concepts of self-repair, resilience, and ongoing maintenance that are central to quantum error correction and stabilization of specific quantum states like GKP states. Whether in biology or technology, these principles of self-sustaining systems are prevalent, showing that even the most abstract scientific concepts often have parallels in the world around us.1 / 1A new title for this conversation.1 / 1ChatGPT"Self-Repair and Quantum Error Correction: Drawing Parallels from Biology to Technology"1 / 1A list of all of the topics we have discussed1 / 1ChatGPTQuantum Error Correction Codes (QECC) and Three-Ion Entangling OperationEncoding and Decoding Logical States in Quantum SystemsConnections with Autonomous Quantum Error Correction of Gottesman-Kitaev-Preskill (GKP) StatesBosonic Codes and Hardware-Efficient Fault-Tolerant Quantum ComputingStabilization and Lifetime of GKP StatesOptimized Qubit Reset in a Multimode Superconducting CircuitSelf-Repair Concepts and Comparisons to Animals, Foam Activated Tires, and Pretzel Shell DevicesCreative Thinking and Metaphorical Connections between Quantum Technology and Everyday Objects and Processes1 / 1I call the pretzel shell devices "autonomous yoghurt machines", could you give an outline of the interconnected systems?1 / 1ChatGPTCertainly!
