I always used to say that if vice is doing news, then the world is completely fucked.
Because when we first started, we just did the holy trinity of sex, drugs and rock and
roll because we were young and that's all we cared about.
And people always ask me, why did you get into news?
And the reality of it was, it was a long burn, but I can pinpoint the moment.
We were opening our bureau in China and we were in Beijing and there was a story that
everyone was covering of a two week traffic jam that stretched from Beijing to Mongolia
and they had micro economies there of porta potties and then they were cooking like meat
next to the porta potties and so we went out to shoot it and I remember seeing this
traffic jam that went all the way to the horizon and I was thinking, car companies have to
make 3% more cars every year just to break even and we have a two week traffic jam.
Where are all the adults?
Why isn't somebody saying something about this?
Somebody should be saying something about this and then I realized, oh, I have the largest
youth platform in the world.
So I'll say something about it and we began a progression then of changing our magazine
outlets into production bureaus so we could go out and shoot the stories and then put
them somewhere and we put them in news shows, we put them in shows like HBO, we have a news
show in France, a new show in Italy, television and then when we realized there was a bigger
audience for that, we launched Vice News and we actually came out of beta early because
we were on the ground in Crimea as events there blew up, we embedded with ISIS, we
were there in Liberia during the ongoing Ebola crisis.
I think we actually have a reel of some of the stories so we can see some of the stories
that we've been doing at Vice News last.
Vice News is the fastest growing digital news channel in the world bringing an immersive
global perspective to a young connected audience.
