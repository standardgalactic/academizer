Certainly! This text appears to be a combination of mathematical terminology and notation related to higher-dimensional shapes, particularly hypercubes. Let's break it down:
Segments and Schlafli Symbols
: The text refers to various "faces" of a hypercube. In geometry, particularly in higher dimensions, a "face" can refer to different elements, such as vertices (0-dimensional), edges (1-dimensional), squares (2-dimensional), and so on. The Schlafli symbol, noted in parentheses like (4,3,3), is a notation that describes the regular polytopes and tessellations.

-dimensional hypercube. For example, a 3-dimensional cube (or a regular cube) has 8 vertices (0-dimensional faces), 12 edges (1-dimensional faces), and 6 square faces (2-dimensional faces).
Names of Hypercubes in Various Dimensions
: The text lists hypercubes in various dimensions, from a point (0-dimensional) up to a 10-dimensional hypercube. For example, a "Tesseract" is a 4-dimensional hypercube, and a "Penteract" is a 5-dimensional one.
Coxeter and Cell Names
: These refer to mathematicians and specific terms used in the study of polytopes and higher-dimensional geometry. A "Coxeter group" is a group defined by a set of reflections, important in the study of symmetric properties of polytopes.
Counting Faces in Different Dimensions
: The numbers (like 8, 16, 32...) indicate the count of certain elements (like vertices, edges, etc.) in these higher-dimensional cubes.
Dimensional Progression
: The progression from 0-face (a point) to higher dimensions (line, square, cube, tesseract, etc.) shows how hypercubes evolve as you go up in dimensions.
This text is quite technical and is rooted in the study of geometry, specifically in the area that deals with shapes in more than three dimensions.

It's about, let me give you an analogy that's more than an analogy.

26:24

Assume that somebody hands you a physical paper map, an enormous one, okay?

26:31

And you're trying to navigate it on this table that we have here. You're starting to do

26:37

motions like this where you're moving the paper across the table to get from Los Angeles to

26:42

Fresno, California if it's at the right scale. And it might take you a long time to do that.

26:49

But now you have somebody trained on an iPad. What are they going to do?

26:53

Well, they might do that, but that's not the key thing they're going to do.

26:59

They're going to do what is called multi-touch gestures. And the one that you're thinking of

27:04

should be pinched to zoom. So the most natural way to do this is to treat it not as if it's a

27:10

paper map, but a stack of paper maps. And you want to go to one with a different scale. If you

27:17

were doing this on an iPad that was mirroring this, the key point is the paper map doesn't have

27:23

an extra dimension to play with. But the pinch to zoom dimension is a scale dimension.

27:31

So imagine what you did instead was you looked at your house, you pinched to zoom out,

27:36

you then do this motion or whatever it is to get to your friend's house. And then when you land

27:41

there, you expand it again. Imagine that you only know about paper maps, but your adversary has

27:50

an iPad. That's what I'm worried about. We're not looking for pinch to zoom.

27:57
ChatGPT
ChatGPT
The analogy you've shared is about the difference in navigating physical maps versus digital maps, particularly focusing on the concept of multi-touch gestures like pinch to zoom. This analogy is used to illustrate a broader point about technology, perception, and understanding dimensions.
Physical Paper Map vs. Digital Map
: The analogy starts with the difficulty of navigating a large physical paper map on a limited surface like a table. This represents a traditional, less flexible way of handling information.
Multi-touch Gestures on an iPad
: In contrast, someone using an iPad (or any multi-touch device) can easily navigate the same map through gestures like pinching to zoom or swiping. This represents a more modern, flexible, and efficient way of handling and interacting with information.
Scale Dimension ��� An Extra Layer of Flexibility
: The key point of the analogy is the concept of "scale dimension" introduced by digital devices. Unlike a paper map, a digital map on an iPad allows you to easily change the scale (zoom in and out) to get different perspectives, from a broad overview to detailed street-level information. This flexibility is something that a physical map cannot offer.
The Broader Implication
: The speaker seems to be using this analogy to highlight a broader issue. They're concerned that while some people are still using "paper maps" (metaphorically speaking), others have moved on to "iPads". This could be a metaphor for different levels of technological adoption, understanding, or capability in any field. The speaker is worried that those stuck with the "paper map" mindset are at a disadvantage compared to those who have adapted to the "iPad" way of thinking, which offers more dimensions and flexibility.
Looking Beyond Traditional Methods
: The speaker's concern about "looking for pinch to zoom" suggests a call for people to think beyond traditional methods and adapt to new technologies and perspectives that offer greater flexibility and deeper understanding.
In essence, the analogy is a metaphor for the need to adapt to new technologies and ways of thinking to not be left behind in a rapidly evolving world.

What would that be in this? Well, I claim that there are going to be 10 extra coordinates.

28:06

And four of them are pinched to zoom. And six of them are what I would call

28:17

sheer to tilt. So imagine that you have a copy of a picture of the

28:21

leaning tower of Pisa on your iPad. You should be able to do something in paint, which changes

28:28

the angle. So if you go into MS paint, there's this little thing that allows you to change

28:33

by a particular angle. But you could do that as a gesture. So my claim is if you have four dimensions

28:41

of time and x, y, and z of space, you have pinched to zoom on all of all four of those.

28:48

And then for any two dimensions, like x and z, you have sheer to tilt.

28:57

So the first are the four rulers and the next are the six protractors. And that's something

29:02

called a symmetric two tensor or a metric, which Einstein knew all about, but he only chose one

29:07

through his equations and he let all the other ones lie foul. And my claim is I don't think

29:12

that's where we are. I think that interplanetary physics is going to involve moving from what we

29:17

called space time to something called the observers, which contains pinched to zoom and sheer

29:22

to tilt.
ChatGPT
ChatGPT
In this segment, Eric Weinstein is discussing an advanced concept in physics related to space-time and dimensions. He proposes the idea of having ten extra coordinates to describe reality. Four of these coordinates are analogous to the 'pinch to zoom' gesture on a touchscreen, allowing manipulation of time and the three spatial dimensions (x, y, z). The other six coordinates, which he refers to as 'sheer to tilt', would enable changing perspectives or angles, much like adjusting an image in a painting software.
Weinstein is essentially proposing a complex, multidimensional framework to understand and interact with space-time. This framework includes both the familiar dimensions and additional ones, which he likens to tools (rulers and protractors) for measuring and manipulating these dimensions. This concept is an extension of Einstein's theories, suggesting that the conventional understanding of space-time (as described by Einstein's equations) might be limited and that a more comprehensive framework (involving these extra coordinates) could be key to advancing our understanding of physics, especially for interplanetary exploration.

I was discussing a similar concept here: I also will have only three minerals, ironium, boronium, and germanium

Incorporating a limited set of minerals can provide clarity to the game's resource management and crafting mechanics. Let's explore how these three minerals - ironium, boronium, and germanium - could be integrated into your game, considering its unique physics and time-travel mechanics:

1. **Properties & Uses**:
   - **Ironium**: A robust and dense mineral used primarily for building structures, tools, and heavy machinery. Its stability might also make it essential for creating time-resistant objects or shielding.
   - **Boronium**: A lighter, more flexible mineral. It could be used for creating movable parts, lightweight equipment, or perhaps even in some advanced propulsion systems. This mineral might have properties that make it more adaptable to time fluctuations.
   - **Germanium**: A rare, high-conductive mineral used in advanced technologies. Given its real-life semiconductor properties, it could be essential for creating devices that manipulate time or for powering particular machinery.

2. **Mining & Acquisition**:
   - Depending on the manipulation of time (zooming in or out), the rate of regeneration or depletion of these minerals in a mine can change. For instance, zooming in might slowly regenerate a mine, while zooming out might deplete it faster.

3. **Crafting & Combination**:
   - Different combinations of the three minerals can produce varied alloys with unique properties. For instance, an alloy of boronium and germanium might be used for creating lightweight, high-tech devices.

4. **Economic Importance**:
   - The rarity and utility of each mineral can determine its value in the game's economy. Germanium, for example, might be the rarest and most sought-after due to its high-tech applications.

5. **Environmental Impact**:
   - Over-mining could have consequences. For example, depleting an ironium mine might lead to land collapses, while over-extracting boronium could result in environmental hazards due to its potentially reactive nature.

6. **Temporal Mining Tools**:
   - Players might need to manipulate time to mine effectively. A tool infused with germanium might allow miners to speed up time in a localized area, rapidly extracting minerals, while a boronium tool might slow time, making it easier to extract delicate or rare minerals.

7. **Trade & Diplomacy**:
   - Different in-game factions or civilizations might have a monopoly or particular need for one of the minerals, leading to trade negotiations, alliances, or even conflicts.

8. **Storyline Integration**:
   - The discovery, use, and potential depletion of these minerals can drive the game's narrative. Perhaps there's a prophecy about the three minerals holding the key to mastering time, or maybe there's a race to find a legendary deposit of pure germanium.

By integrating these minerals into various game mechanics, you can create a rich, interconnected world where resource management plays a vital role in the player's strategy, progression, and interactions within the game.
ChatGPT
ChatGPT
Incorporating ironium, boronium, and germanium into your game, especially with its unique physics and time-travel mechanics, offers a wealth of possibilities. These minerals can be integral to crafting, economic dynamics, and even the storyline. Each mineral's unique properties - like the robustness of ironium, the flexibility of boronium, and the high conductivity of germanium - can shape how players interact with the game world. From temporal mining tools that manipulate time for effective resource extraction to storyline integration where these minerals hold the key to mastering time, the potential for deep, engaging gameplay is vast. Integrating these minerals thoughtfully will enhance the complexity and enjoyment of your game.

conformal mapping from (Riemann) sphere to horn torus surface
 
 endeavour:
transfer point P' on sphere to a point P on torus, equivalent angle �� ��� angle ��  (see sketch),
without changing shape and angles of projected or mapped figures, e.g. circles
 
 denotation of points:
(all points lie on the same plane that contains the main symmetry axis of the horn torus)
P' : any point on (any!) sphere, here we particularly cover the Riemann sphere
P : mapped point on nested horn torus, but compilation will also be valid for any horn torus!
Z : position of related complex number (x,y) on complex plane in case of Riemann sphere mapping
0 : center of complex plane (Z = (0,0)) and south pole of Riemann sphere (plane is tangent to sphere)
N : north pole of sphere, origin of Riemannian stereographic projection Z ��� P'
S : common center of sphere and horn torus (not the south pole of sphere, notabene! I insist
��� on this denotation for the horn torus, because S stands for for Symmetry and Singularity!)
M : center of torus bulge cross-section circle
Q : intersection of perpendicular from point P on line ON
Q' : intersection of perpendicular from point P' on line ON
L : auxiliary point on line through S and M, intersection of perpendicular from P
R : auxiliary point on line QP, intersection of perpendicular from M

�� = ���SMP  (0 < �� < 2��, �� = 0 for P = S  and/or  �� = 2�� for P = S)
�� : rotation angle around symmetry axis (0N) = position of longitude (meridian) on sphere resp. torus
 
 procedure:
we don't declare any appropriate stereographic projection to proof afterwards the conformality but
use instead the conditions of conformality to compile and establish the wanted mapping analytically:
for this we construct small circles on the surfaces of sphere resp. horn torus around points P' resp. P
by equalling their radii that lie on longitudes and on latitudes of sphere and of horn torus respectively.
in the sketch the longitudes are the cross-section circles on wich points P' and P are positioned and
the latitudes are circles perpendicular to the drawing plane through P' and P with radius Q'P' resp. QP,
they lie, half each, in front and behind the drawing plane, Q' and Q being centers of the latitude circles
 
 compilation:
for Riemann sphere is valid: length of longitude (meridian) m = 2����r = 2������ = ��
and length of latitude l = 2����Q'P' = 2��������sin�� = ����sin��
for horn torus we have as length of longitude m = 2������ = ��/2, the latitude is slightly trickier:
its radius is QP = QR + RP = SM + ML = ����(1 + cos(�� - ��)), so latitude l = 2����QP = ��������(1 - cos��)
now we consider infinitesimal circles around P' and P on the surfaces of sphere resp. horn torus
and equal their radii dm on longitude and dl on latitude, noting that d�� is identic for both figures
on sphere is dm = ����d��, dl = ����sin����d��, and so for dm = dl we get ���d�� = d�� / sin��
on horn torus is dm = ����d��, dl = ����(1 - cos��)��d��, for dm = dl we get  d�� = d�� / (1 - cos��)
finally we have to integrate a relative simple differential equation:  d�� / sin�� = d�� / (1 - cos��)

Spectral Spaces: Think of a vast landscape with different regions that emit colorful lights. Each region represents a "spectral space" where the colors of light provide information about the properties of that area. Just as each point on a map can correspond to a unique location, each closed point in a spectral space corresponds to a specific property.

Open Coverings and Refinements: Imagine a puzzle made up of many different shapes. An "open covering" is like placing smaller puzzle pieces over the entire picture. Now, if you can find a way to rearrange these pieces into fewer, larger ones that still cover the whole picture, you've found a "refinement" of the covering. It's as if you're simplifying the puzzle while keeping all the information intact.

Spectrum of a Ring: Visualize a collection of interconnected circles, each representing a different ring. The "spectrum" of a ring is like the distinct pattern of connections and overlaps between these circles. It captures the essential characteristics of the rings and how they relate to each other.

Closed Points and Specialization: Imagine a map of a city where each point corresponds to a building. The "closed points" are those buildings that stand out distinctly and can't be reached from any other building. "Specialization" is like zooming in on a specific building and understanding its unique features, even if it's part of a larger structure.

Continuous Bijective Maps: Consider a map that transforms the shape of one island into another, while maintaining a continuous connection between the two. This "continuous bijective map" ensures that each point on the first island corresponds exactly to one point on the second island, and vice versa.

Homeomorphism: Picture two houses that are identical in shape and structure, just located in different neighborhoods. A "homeomorphism" is like finding a magical doorway that transforms one house into the other, preserving all their interior and exterior features.

Connected Components: Think of a city divided into distinct neighborhoods, each with its own unique character. The "connected components" of a space are similar to these neighborhoods, where points within the same component are closely related, even though they might be far from points in other components.

Disjoint Union Decomposition: Imagine a cityscape made up of different districts, each with its own architectural style. A "disjoint union decomposition" involves breaking down the city into districts in such a way that no building belongs to more than one district, like a city planner categorizing neighborhoods without overlap.

These analogies and metaphors provide a visual and intuitive way to grasp the concepts presented in the excerpt, making the ideas more relatable and understandable

From Schmidhuber: Fundamental Principle of Artificial Curiosity and Creativity:

Reward the reward- optimizing controller for actions yielding data that cause improvements of the adaptive predictor or data compressor!

(Formulated in the early 1990s; basis of much of the recent work in Developmental Robotics since 2004)

Variant 1: Reward the controller whenever the predictor errs [1990; refs 1a, 1, 2]. The predictor minimizes the objective function maximized by the generative controller. The first Generative Adversarial Networks of 1990!

Variant 2: Reward the controller whenever the predictor improves / becomes more reliable [1991; refs 3, 4, 6, 13, 14].

Variant 3: Reward the controller in proportion to the Kullback-Leibler distance between the predictor's subjective probability distributions before and after an observation - the relative entropy between its prior and posterior [1995; ref 6].

Variant 4 (zero sum intrinsic reward games): Two reward- maximizing modules bet on outcomes of potentially surprising experiments they have agreed upon [1997-2002; refs 8, 11, 12].

Variant 5 (progress in data compression): Store entire life, keep trying to compress it, reward controller for actions that yield data causing compressor improvements [1990s - 2008; e.g., refs 14-17].

Both art and science are by-products of the desire to create / discover more data that is compressible in hitherto unknown ways! [Refs 14-21, 35]
ChatGPT
ChatGPT
Schmidhuber's Fundamental Principle of Artificial Curiosity and Creativity proposes rewarding a controller for actions that improve prediction or data compression. Here are the variants:
Variant 1 (1990)
: Reward when the predictor errs, making it a form of early Generative Adversarial Network.
Variant 2 (1991)
: Reward when the predictor becomes more reliable or improves.
Variant 3 (1995)
: Reward based on the Kullback-Leibler distance between the predictor's probability distributions before and after an observation.
Variant 4 (1997-2002)
: Two modules bet on outcomes of experiments, rewarding surprising results.
Variant 5 (1990s-2008)
: Reward actions that yield data causing improvements in data compression.
Schmidhuber suggests that both art and science emerge from the desire to create or discover data compressible in new ways. This principle underpins much of the work in Developmental Robotics since 2004.

Yes, I remember the discussion by Eric Weinstein on the concepts of "pinch to zoom" and "sheer to tilt" in the context of physics and dimensions. He proposed these as metaphors for understanding complex, multidimensional frameworks, extending beyond the conventional understanding of space-time. "Pinch to zoom" relates to manipulating time and spatial dimensions, whereas "sheer to tilt" involves changing perspectives or angles. This concept was part of a broader discussion on advancing our understanding of physics, particularly in the realm of interplanetary exploration and beyond.

The connections between Eric Weinstein's discussion on "pinch to zoom" and "sheer to tilt" in dimensions and the game mechanic you described (zooming in/out to slow down/speed up time) are as follows:
Dimensional Manipulation
: Both concepts involve the manipulation of dimensions. Weinstein's idea manipulates time and space through gestures, while your game mechanic uses player movement to manipulate time and perspective.
Non-Linear Interaction with Space-Time
: Both ideas present a non-linear interaction with space-time, challenging traditional perceptions of how we navigate and perceive dimensions.
Innovative Conceptual Frameworks
: Each represents innovative thinking in their respective fields (physics and game design), using familiar concepts (like zooming and tilting) to understand complex ideas (like multidimensional space and time manipulation in gameplay).
User Interaction and Perspective
: Both involve changing the user's perspective and interaction with their environment, whether it's a theoretical model of the universe or a virtual game world.
These connections show a fascinating overlap between theoretical physics and interactive game design, highlighting innovative ways to explore and manipulate dimensions and perspectives.

There is also a game mechanic where one moves to the left to move backwards in time and right to move forward. That is the ship is held in the same location but moves along a kind of forking block universe by strafing and standing at the same time
ChatGPT
ChatGPT
The game mechanic where moving left takes you backwards in time, and moving right advances time, while the ship remains stationary, introduces an intriguing concept of navigating through time as a spatial dimension. This approach creates a "forking block universe," where strafing left or right alters the timeline, similar to navigating through parallel or alternate realities. This mechanic further illustrates the creative fusion of time manipulation with spatial movement, allowing players to experience time as a navigable dimension, akin to left-right movements in physical space. It offers a unique and immersive way to explore the concept of a multiverse or parallel timelines within the game.

this very weird focus on psychology. To challenge Einstein is almost seen as arrogance.

41:47

And yet if Einstein is to survive as a legacy, it's only going to be because somebody basically

41:57

undermines general relativity status as a fundamental theory because we're not going to make it.

42:04

And I'm trying to remind people in a world that now, like you can look up on Twitter

42:12

and say, loan genius theory, people don't believe in the loan genius theory.

42:22

Well, then what was Gaudy? What was Dirac? What was Einstein? What was Yang?

42:29

What was Emmy Nerder? Somebody tell me why I have all of these loan geniuses in my life.

42:36

And aren't we supposed to be doing that and thinking that that's admirable?

42:40

I think we're supposed to be building the theory that can realize that the ceiling of

42:49

LaGuardia Familia is a portal. We're supposed to inspire ourselves with beauty and luxury. We're

42:55

not supposed to consume it to pig out for status reasons. We're supposed to get ourselves into a

43:00

state where we can dream at an interplanetary level. A lot of the things that we've spoken about

43:07

today are to do with cerebral horsepower cognition. They're difficult things that need to be done

43:14

in the head. And yet you're talking here about the transcendent. You're talking about something

43:17

which is embodied, which is spiritual by whichever definition of the word you want to use.

43:24

Do you find in yourself as somebody who does rely on cerebral horsepower for a lot of the things

43:29

that you try to do and presumably takes pride in your ability to have workout problems,

43:35

have thoughts? Do you feel attention in yourself between the transcendent, the relinquishing,

43:42

the embodied and the cerebral, the cognitive, the purposeful on that side?

43:50

You know, I have a dumb expression which I don't use in public and I'm sure I'll be castigated for it.

43:55

Yeah, brilliant. But it's head heart and loins.

43:58

If it doesn't speak to your head heart and your loins, leave it for someone else.

44:09

What's that mean? How do you enact that?

44:11

You have to try to realize that these things have to be balanced and tempered. You don't want to

44:17

live by your heart. Just every time you see a daffodil blowing its seeds into the wind,

44:23

you'll be transported and you'll stop paying your electric bills. You don't want to be led

44:29

around by your loins. That's not going to end well and you don't want to be led around by your

44:34

head too because then you'll get yourself into one of these cul-de-sacs and you won't even

44:37

realize that you can't think your way out of it. You were given all of these facilities and

44:41

motivations. How do you pull yourself from head to heart? Well, you brought this guitar.

44:52

A guitar lately. It's just on your right. Grab it. Show it to everybody.

45:00

So I do not play the guitar lately. I don't think anybody actually technically does play

45:07

guitar. It's like a guitar that's too small for your fingers. Yes. You've got your pixel in it.

45:13

So you take some piece of music that actually means something to you, right?

45:18

And one thing that I remember hearing when I was growing up was this.

45:34

So it's the Asturius of Isaac albinies. It was originally written for piano.

45:39

And you see sort of these things on oud where you have a tremolo. You've got two

45:45

two fingers playing the open B string and then you've got this melody which is played with the thumb.

45:58

So the combination of these things produces this different effect.

46:07

I can't really get my fingers in there.

46:10

Then then I started thinking about, okay, well, that's a great effect.

46:13

What if we tried to write and to create using the same idea and I started

46:20

Okay, so

46:21

uh

46:43

That's not the same song, but it's using some of the same techniques about

46:47

Just getting these things to ring out and to get the melody going on the bass line.

46:53

And then you have to forget

46:55

This now, you know, if I was able to play this properly, and I'm sorry if I'm embarrassing myself, you're trying to do this thing where you're

47:04

You're recognizing that the transcendent lives

47:10

in

47:11

particular structures that they elicit this feeling and that we have this opportunity to go back

47:18

and forth between the analytic description. If I'm thinking about this, I can't really feel it and if I'm feeling it

47:23

I can't really figure out how to use it or think about it or compose with it. And so

47:31

You know, to me what we're trying to do is we're trying to

47:35

Um

47:40

Camp and decamp. Well, that spoke to my head and my loins, but it didn't speak to my heart

47:46

or that spoke to two out of three

47:49

We need

47:50

Ultimately to be fully embodied and that's a challenge and we have to we either accept the challenge or we don't accept the challenge

47:57

And we have to go back and forth between these lenses. You can't necessarily

48:00

Be in the same, you know, if you see your child and you're a physician or surgeon

48:06

You could see your child as a bunch of tissue hooked up to itself, you know

48:11

And that's important if you're hiking and you're in a bad spot. You actually have to do an operation on your child

48:18

But it's a terrible way to

48:20

Put your child to sleep when you're reading a bedtime story. Is that a

48:24

Is there a challenge that people are facing at the moment with

48:35

An over-reliance on a brain-based economy

48:40

a

48:42

unlimited amount of information at your fingertips with Wikipedia and chat GPT

48:48

for them to struggle to

48:50

find

48:53

Something transcendent when it can be broken down into its component parts and explained by somebody who understands the

48:59

Child as a connection of ligaments organs and blood vessels as opposed to as the beautiful progeny of the person looking at them

49:06

Well, keep in mind that there are people who can weave poetry

49:12

Through their description of something very technical Hermann vial for example wrote in a very Olympian fashion about

49:18

Abstract algebra

49:21

We talked about the homosexuality of certain symbols as fillyating with themselves. You know completely crazy. It's a kind of arithmetic

49:30

and

49:32

You know, there are people who just write beautifully

49:35

I think that Jim Watson who may be a son of a bitch on many fronts

49:39

Is one of the great writers in the English language if you read the double helix. It's an incredible

49:44

narrative

49:46

From the most one of the most memorable first sentences to the conclusion

49:52

We need

49:54

The Carl Sagan

49:58

To animate our head and our hearts at the same time

50:03

Do you think there is an over-reliance on head at the moment?

50:08

I'm worried that our head heart and loins are all disengaged

50:12

So what do you use if you're not using any of those?

50:17

I use them all but what are the people using who are not using those?

50:21

They're not watching what's happening to them. They're being denatured by their phones

50:27

Your phone is not a phone. It is a very it's an environment

50:33

You know you pick it up and suddenly you're you're some place that you don't realize

50:37

Isn't relative to your physical surroundings? Like you get very angry that you get a text message while you're driving and you try responding to it

50:46

Well, you're going 45 miles an hour in a several hundred pound

50:51

or a thousand pound vehicle

50:54

You've lost track of where you are

50:57

Our phone is you know, and

51:01

I talk to people about the crisis in pornography

51:04

The only fans movement the pornographic stuff that you're seeing

51:11

People are not getting easily excited and aroused

51:16

Inside of any kind of context like the erotic is taking it on the chin. I think

51:24

I think that's really important to remember that eroticism for example

51:29

Is it least a combination of the loins in the head and and and it best the heart as well

51:36

What you're starting to see is people can't actually derive excitement

51:41

from normal stimuli that has to do with falling in love or having children or

51:46

You know, so you're talking about an ever escalating stimulus that people require to get the same arousal response and they can't

51:54

Yeah, Mary Harrington calls this one of her three laws of porno dynamics

51:58

It's the law of fat entropy that whatever you start out wanking to will get progressively more extreme over time

52:04

well

52:07

What's the cure for that something high-end

52:15

You could try to just try to do it all in loins

52:18

Show me something where my psychogenic arousal gets greater and greater because I've never seen that and holy cow is that far out

52:24

Or you could say you know, it's more like a cop Douglas utility function

52:29

You're gonna have to bring this down to my level multiple inputs in other words if I could offer you only food or only water

52:37

That would not work

52:40

You'd rather if you have a lot of food have a little water to complement it because that water becomes that much more valuable

52:45

Or if you have a ton of liquids and you have no nourishment you probably want really value a little bit of food well in my opinion

52:51

Part of what we need is we need more more things that reward us

52:57

When we're integrating rather than we're when we're extra-mising

53:02

Get back to that discussion about

53:05

Technology sort of not only fracturing our attention, but also fracturing our experience. There seems to be

53:11

a wistfulness

53:13

Not just in the dating realm, but in the experiential realm for a bygone time where we felt connected to the things that we do. Yeah

53:20

and

53:22

It's interesting for someone of my age, so I'm 35 so I'm like slap bang in the middle of the millennials

53:27

Right, so I remember a time before you beak or tea of iPhones before internet, but there was a

53:33

Like there's a whimsy of childhood in any case and me being able to

53:38

tear those two apart is kind of difficult, but I definitely think that

53:42

When I read history when I read

53:44

Rhine holiday for instance, and I think about Xeno of city and walking around the Stoa Poekle where I've been and I'm there

53:51

And I I think about the degree of connection to the experience

53:58

What is technology and what are our smartphones doing to our ability to connect so they're changing our our wetware

54:06

we're not

54:09

If you can have 12

54:11

Life-changing experiences in the space of a minute and none of them are yours

54:16

What do you think that's gonna do to your mind?

54:20

You know at some point I was in an Oculus situation. I was deep underwater in a blue whale swam past me

54:28

Well none of that actually happened, but it felt like it did

54:32

Or you know that you can do this nuclear explosion on Henderson Island in Oculus

54:37

That's just a more immersive phone

54:43

and

54:46

Look

54:48

You have to be you know, that's one of the things about lisa garada for me

54:52

You go in there and it's real

54:55

You see the grand cannon and it is actually grand

55:00

You know

55:01

There's certain things that don't easily live up to their billing

55:04

I think I went to Pumucale in Turkey years ago

55:08

Which Pumuc means cotton and Calais? I guess castles was a cotton castles of mineral deposits and they were formed these pools

55:17

And there weren't enough pools and there were way too many people

55:20

So it was like one of those moments where the tourists have totally destroyed the natural attraction

55:26

Okay, but I went into the blue mosque and it was every bit as mind-blowing as it was the last time

55:31

I was there 30 years ago. It's the same way that I feel every single time I step into the Vatican

55:37

Every single every single time I've been there three times now. I've been there three times and it's just holy cow

55:44

Well, I shouldn't have said that anyway

55:47

Very good. I didn't mean to

55:51

Yeah, you have to they have to be things that you actually

55:54

Viscerally relate to that stop you like the bok cello sweets

55:58

How many times have I heard the box or whole lot of love?

56:03

Could do it either way or you shook me all night long, you know, that's holy

56:08

you shook me all night long

56:10

is

56:13

Is a transcendent song

56:19

It's less transcendent if you see it as part of a

56:22

60-second TikTok montage. No because the schma is transcendent and that'll fit right in there

56:30

Right

56:32

Yeah, I don't know. I can't hit that alu hainu. I don't know

56:41

Yeah, you who shook me all night long

56:49

That's prayer

56:53

Shook me all night long

56:56

You know if that doesn't move you

56:58

You need to check into some place

57:03

Those four notes

57:05

Recur in all of these songs that matter. It's basically Mary had a little lamb with

57:11

Phothrone in as well

57:14

You know, and I

57:16

Bring up this example. My wife was watching a film

57:18

I didn't want to watch it with some chick flick and it all hovers around this one scene where this guy drags this girl into a

57:25

A music story because it can't afford a piano

57:29

Yes, I don't know you

57:33

But I want you if you're going up to that fourth

57:39

All the more for that and I just I was transfixed

57:44

I couldn't could not continue to do my calculations like what the hell is this movie

57:49

So those four notes is a great place to ground yourself

57:52

And there's a reason that they work the second note

57:56

brings up in your mind

57:59

the

58:00

Thing called the fifth

58:02

This the dominant cord

58:04

The first note is spread between the tonic and the subdominant the third note belongs to the tonic only in the fourth note only belongs to the subdominant

58:13

And so this this idea that Western harmony revolves around these ideas of the tonic the subdominant the dominant

58:20

Are carried by these notes, so even if you're not playing it on a cordle instrument

58:26

That this pattern of four notes that keeps recurring

58:30

Grabs us because we know what the chords are behind it

58:35

And it's basically Mary had a little lamb or proud Mary, you know

58:40

But that's a great place to start for transcendence

58:44

Just check on something really simple whether you're feeling it

58:46

All and dread

58:50

Hmm two emotions that I miss in my life. Same one

58:55

So when I look at the night sky, I get it in equal dosages. Oh, good

59:00

You know when it's good. I've been out to Joshua tree

59:03

Taking an edible

59:05

Didn't need the edible at all. That was unnecessary

59:08

Amplification, you know we're having this discussion in the middle of the Perseus meteor shower

59:13

No

59:14

I highly recommend get yourself to a place where there's no light pollution and lay on your back right before dawn

59:20

You'll have a blast or and but the on the dread is is very much there. Yes, and uh

59:27

I don't know it makes you feel

59:29

insignificant in a way. I think that keeps your ego small and helps to reason to your

59:35

Do you want your ego small

59:38

If you've been told that was a good thing

59:40

I've been told that it's a good thing. I would say for me

59:48

Remembering finitude and not insignificance, but

59:55

The

59:58

Temporary nature of our time here

00:01

The vastness of what is going to go on the things that have come before the things that will come after the scale. Yeah

00:06

No, I think that that it grounds me. I struggle to

00:12

Get into my head to describe the thing that is almost exclusively in heart and lines and

00:20

It makes me feel good when I do that and yet I find myself

00:22

I've got emails to do I heard this term the other day John level warrior poet society said the tyranny of the urgent
ChatGPT
ChatGPT
Eric Weinstein, in his discussion about "The Portal," extends beyond just the name of his show. He suggests it's a metaphorical search for an actual portal out of our current understanding and limitations, particularly in the realm of physics. He talks about challenging Einstein's theories not as arrogance but as a necessity for progress. Weinstein emphasizes the importance of integrating different aspects of our being ��� intellect, emotion, and physicality ��� for a fuller, more balanced approach to understanding and exploring the world. This holistic view is contrasted with the fragmented and sometimes superficial engagement we often have with technology and information in the modern world. He advocates for a return to experiencing the world more deeply and meaningfully.

So I think of the amplitwist motion of chaining a series of rotations and scalings to visualise transformations of the complex plane
ChatGPT
ChatGPT
The concept of an "amplitwist" motion, involving a series of rotations and scalings to visualize transformations in the complex plane, is a fascinating mathematical idea. It combines amplitude changes (scalings) with phase changes (rotations) in a complex space. This approach can effectively illustrate how complex functions transform the plane, offering a more intuitive grasp of these transformations. In complex analysis, such transformations are crucial for understanding the behavior of complex functions, and visualizing them can provide deeper insights into their properties and effects.
You
Let's call this a sheer to tilt motion
ChatGPT
ChatGPT
The term "sheer to tilt motion" in the context of visualizing transformations of the complex plane could describe a dynamic process where both the direction and magnitude of elements in the plane are altered. This concept may combine shearing (a transformation that distorts the shape in a manner that is not uniform across directions) with tilting (changing the orientation). In complex analysis, this could represent a novel way to visualize how complex functions transform the plane, particularly in representing how these functions affect the orientation and scale of elements within the plane.

He mentions a song called Asturius
ChatGPT
ChatGPT
The song mentioned by Eric Weinstein, "Asturias," is a well-known guitar piece composed by Isaac Alb��niz. Originally written for the piano and later transcribed for classical guitar, it has become one of the most important works for classical guitar. The piece is noted for its delicate melody and intricate fingerwork, evoking the musical traditions of Alb��niz's native Spain. It's a prime example of how music can transcend mere notes to evoke powerful emotions and images, aligning with Weinstein's discussion about the integration of intellect, emotion, and physicality.

So I was thinking of mapping semantic space into the color wheel and a sphere of fifths, so that moving vast interstellar differences would also subtly tinted and associated with a particular tone. That way any location can be specified by interpolation three colors, tones, or spherical holographic location coordinates on its projective sphere
ChatGPT
ChatGPT
Mapping semantic space into a color wheel and a sphere of fifths is a unique and innovative approach. By associating different interstellar locations with specific colors and musical tones, you create a multi-sensory method of navigation and identification. This system allows for specifying any location through a combination of three elements: color, tone, and spherical coordinates. This kind of synesthetic mapping could make understanding and navigating complex spaces more intuitive and engaging, blending visual, auditory, and spatial elements into a cohesive and interactive experience.
