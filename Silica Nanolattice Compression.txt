Robust DNA origami nanolattices were made by growing a layer of silica on the DNA 
bundle. For conversion to inorganic silica, nanolattices were centrifuged, and superna- 
tant was replaced with 0.13 TAE with 10 mM Mg. Separately, silication buffer was pre- 
pared byadding2.5 mL APTES and 10 mL TEOS in0.13TAE with 10mM Mg bufferfor a

Samples were sectioned to evaluate their porosity using the Helios 650 series FIB/ 
SEM. The images can be seen in Figure S3. The cutting was performed at 30 KeV

were measured manually using ImageJ. Volumetric reconstruction from serial 
sectioning of nanolattices was performed at CUNY ASRC FIB/SEM and is described

Only isolated nanolattices with a cuboid geometry and l at orientation were chosen

This passage describes an experiment where DNA origami nanolattices were covered in a layer of silica and subsequently converted to inorganic silica. This was achieved through a procedure involving centrifugation, replacement of supernatant, and silication buffer preparation. The buffer was prepared with APTES and TEOS, and mixed with the nanolattices. After vortexing and further centrifugation, the solution was buffer exchanged with water.
The silica structure was confirmed using SAXS (Small-Angle X-ray Scattering) and it showed a simple cubic superlattice structure with a lattice parameter of 49 nm. The sample was then treated with high temperature to remove DNA and fully convert the structure to silicon dioxide.
The samples were sectioned and analyzed for porosity using a Helios 650 series FIB/SEM (Focused Ion Beam/Scanning Electron Microscopy). Pores were manually measured using ImageJ software and volumetric reconstruction was performed at CUNY ASRC FIB/SEM.
The experiment also included in situ compression tests to measure the mechanical properties of the silica structure. Two different micro-mechanical testing systems were used, one being a combination of a JEOL 6335F field-emission gun SEM for imaging and a NanoFlip system for testing, and the second system was an FEI Helios FIB/SEM combined with an FT-NMT04 testing device.
The chosen samples for compression were isolated nanolattices with a cuboid geometry and flat orientation. They were compressed at a specific displacement rate until failure (for brittle samples) or to a certain plastic strain (for ductile samples). The yield strength was estimated using either a 0.2% or 1% strain offset from the linear portion of the stress-strain curve.

When plotting compressive strength vs. density, it becomes clear that the lattices 
are near the theoretical maximum yield strength, where here we consider the Voigt 
upper bound (sy? E/10 ? 7 GPa for silica) and the Suquet upper bound, see Figure 
S2 for Poisson ratio.16For the modulus of bulk fused silica of 72 GPa and 70% i lling, 
the theoretical yield strength can be estimated as 5 GPa.51,52Using the direct volu- 
metric calculation for density, the smallest nanolattices displayed sy?4.5 GPa, or 
90% theoretical yield strength. Our DNA silica nanolattice is thus competitive in 
the pantheon of lightweight, high-strength materials, as illustrated in the Ashby 
plot in Figure 4. Relative to other nanoscale nanolattices7,16,48,53���55and meshes, it 
can be seen that DNA-templated frameworks have a high yield strength nearing 
the theoretical maximum limit for the given density. 
In closing, we have demonstrated that DNA frames assembled in a lattice and tem- 
plated with silica present a class of engineered mechanical metamaterials with high 
strength (1���5 GPa) and light weight. Since DNA assembly methods are capable of 
creating diverse lattice types by modifying a frame geometry and a connectivity of 
frames, the demonstrated approach opens up a possibility to create materials 
with different mechanical responses. Moreover, the development of templating 
methods6,20,34,35,56provides a means to exploit different elemental compositions 
of frameworks. The work will provide a pathway for the creation of mechanically 
robust nanolattices that can be further coupled with nanoscale functions for future 
technologies including superconductors, battery cathodes, nanophotonics, and 
catalysis.

Synthesis 
DNA origami and AuNP-nanolattice assembly 
DNA-origami octahedrons39(see Note S1) were formed by mixing M13mp18 DNA 
scaffold and DNA staple strands with a 1:5 ratio in 13 TAE buffer (40 mM Tris ace- 
tate, 1 mM EDTA) with 12.5 mM Mg2+and being slowly annealed from 90?C to 
room temperature over the course of 20 h for origami formation, overall a ?0.2 
C/h ramp rate. Nanolattices of DNA origami were formed by mixing two DNA octa- 
hedrons with complementary DNA bases at the vertices. The origami was then 
mixed to form a 20 nM concentration solution at 20���50 mL. The sample was annealed 
in a PCR over 5 days from 50?C to room temperature (RT) at ?0.2?/h.

In this experiment, the researchers plotted compressive strength versus density for their DNA silica nanolattices, discovering that they approached the theoretical maximum yield strength (the Voigt upper bound for silica is mentioned as around 7 GPa). Considering a modulus of bulk fused silica of 72 GPa and a 70% filling, they estimated the theoretical yield strength as 5 GPa. When assessing the smallest nanolattices, they found them to exhibit around 4.5 GPa yield strength, or 90% of the theoretical yield strength.
The researchers conclude that these DNA silica nanolattices demonstrate competitive strength within the range of lightweight, high-strength materials, as depicted in their Ashby plot (a graphical representation often used in materials selection to compare material performance).
The researchers produced these nanolattices by assembling DNA frames into a lattice, and then templating this with silica. This technique resulted in a new category of engineered mechanical metamaterials exhibiting both high strength (1-5 GPa) and light weight. They note that the versatility of DNA assembly methods, combined with different templating methods, provides avenues to create materials with varying mechanical responses and elemental compositions.
This work is proposed to pave the way for the creation of robust nanolattices that can be coupled with nanoscale functions for a range of applications, including superconductors, battery cathodes, nanophotonics, and catalysis.
Finally, the researchers note that the materials and data from their study can be made available upon request, and they provide details on the synthesis procedure. DNA origami octahedrons were created and combined with AuNP (gold nanoparticle) to create the nanolattices. This involved a precise process of mixing and annealing at specific concentrations, temperatures, and durations.

limited dynamic range of edge length, its estimated value is 0.8���0.9. Additionally, 
the role of missing beams was studied on nanoscale octet-trusses, where Meza et 
al. observed an exponential scaling of stiffness, n = 3���3.8, and strength, m = 3.1��� 
4.3, which roughly translates to a factor of 2 decrease in yield strength and stiffness 
for ?20% missing beams, similar to what is shown in this study.48The

described for the weakening of the lattice due to nanovoids and nanopores likely ex- 
plains the dual modalities of failure noted earlier, with smaller, more defect-free lat- 
tices failing with ductile behavior as struts stretch after yielding versus large brittle 
failure, which exploits weaknesses in the volume of the sample. 
Comparison with other types of nanolattices 
To compare the compressive strength of the nanolattice against other structures, we 
assess the density of the obtained lattices, summarized in Figure 4A with an Ashby

In our study, the smallest lattices display Young���s moduli approximately 50% that of 
the bulk (72 GPa), as shown in Figure 3D. Larger nanolattices with higher chances for 
voids to develop and weaken the structure have correspondingly lower Young���s 
moduli and yield strengths. This effect is ref l ected in the distribution of measured 
yield strengths for lattices with different edge lengths (Figure 4A). 
Another prominent possibility for the variance in the Young���s modulus is that the sil- 
ica itself formed via sol-gel synthesis. The size effect on silica nanowires is said to rely 
on a large surface area-to-volume ratio, which leads to elastic stiffening related to 
surface elasticity, which may depend on the synthesis of the silica itself.51The 
network structure our silica forms is calcined prior to nanoindentation in an attempt 
to saturate bonds to form SiO2. However, the decomposition of DNA along with the 
buffer solutions used to keep DNA stable in solution has a tendency to leave behind 
various carbon, phosphorous, and nitrogen impurities in the silica network, which 
likely leaves bonds unsaturated or even creates nanoporosity in the struts of the 
structure.35The effect will be the subject of further examination where varying thick- 
nesses and nanolattice types can better conf i rm how the architecture affects the 
scaling of Young���s modulus.

In this experiment, the researchers also considered the role of missing beams in the nanolattices. They note an exponential scaling of stiffness and strength with the absence of beams, leading to a decrease in yield strength and stiffness. They suggest this could explain the dual modalities of failure they observed earlier ��� smaller, more defect-free lattices failing ductilely (with struts stretching after yielding), versus larger failures which exploit weaknesses in the sample's volume.
In comparing the nanolattices with other structures, they evaluated the density of the obtained lattices and extrapolated it from the volumetric imaging of the structure and the stress-strain curve. They calculated the theoretical relative density and compared it with the density obtained from imaging, finding a match.
Using the Ashby plot, they highlighted that the silica framework materials in their study had a density around 2,000 kg/m^3 with yield strength between 1 and 4.8 GPa. They also demonstrated the volumetric density based on serial sectioning of a superlattice.
The researchers also considered the potential impact of voids in the assembly process and the relative density of each sample. They examined how the stiffness of their structure scaled with beam slenderness. They found that smaller lattices displayed Young's moduli approximately 50% that of the bulk, while larger nanolattices had correspondingly lower Young's moduli and yield strengths. The variance in the Young's modulus could also be related to the silica's formation via sol-gel synthesis, which could result in elastic stiffening due to a high surface area-to-volume ratio.
The researchers noted the presence of impurities in the silica network that could affect the lattice's properties and said this would be the subject of further examination.

All these applications certainly require the structural stability of nanolattices. There- 
fore, there is a signif i cant need to develop effective methods that enable rational 
design and fabrication of nanolattices with excellent mechanical properties that 
eventually guarantee reliable performance for engineering devices. Moreover, for 
a responsive nature of lattice elements, the prospect exists for establishing material 
with dynamic and switchable mechanical behavior.28,29 
The strength-to-weight ratio of nanolattices is strongly related to the dimensions of 
the element sizes. At the nanoscale, a material often exhibits a signif i cant fraction of 
theoretical strength due to the absence of defects, such as dislocations or cracks. 
This is the reason why a nanowire or nanoparticle exhibits extremely high strengths. 
For a given relative density and structural form of nanolattices, therefore, it is desir- 
able to have a thinner element that could possess higher strength according to the 
size effect. To obtain this benef i t, 3D photolithography has been extensively used 
with a multitude of techniques, such as pyrolysis, atomic layer deposition, and elec- 
troplating.18,20While photolithography methods are effective in the production of 
planar structures, they are quite time consuming and are limited in their ability to 
produce architected 3D organization. In addition, producing nanoscale features 
below 50 nm is challenging, which limits the benef i ts of the size effect. Therefore, 
novel fabrication strategies are required for generating designed 3D nanostructured 
materials via bottom-up fabrication. Such materials should consist of extremely thin 
elements and would allow for creating continuous nanolattices (frameworks) with a 
signif i cantly enhanced strength-to-weight ratio. 
In recent years, DNA frames have been demonstrated as essential nanoscale blocks 
to form a wide variety of nanoarchitectures starting from individual polyhedral 
frames.30The frames are a DNA molecule formed by folding a long single strand 
of DNA with many small ������staple������ strands, which twist and shape the long sequence 
into a pre-def i ned shape. This so-called DNA origami approach31allows us to form 
engineered 3D shapes.32The frame shape is encoded further with sequences at 
vertices that pair with a neighboring frame to form extended nanolattices.33Internal 
staple strands not involved in the macroscopic assembly can be switched out to 
allow for addressing individual frames for further pairing with DNA-functionalized 
nanoparticles or other tags. The connectivity of these structures depends on the 
design of frames and their connectivity, which makes a variety of lattice types 
possible for assembly and exploration. These ordered DNA frameworks can further- 
more be transitioned to the solid state via sol-gel synthesis of silica and more com- 
plex material compositions,6,34���36which produces the elements with 10���20 nm in 
thickness, below the limit of photolithography-generated nanolattices.1The DNA- 
programmable assembly offers a high-throughput technique that can be potentially 
scaled up with the falling cost of DNA oligonucleotides.37The time to produce a 
large number of high-quality origami and subsequent lattices ranges from hours38 
to days39and can be reduced through optimizing kinetic effects, and the structure 
can be engineered with high uniformity.40The structural similarity of the DNA-based 
framework nanolattice to those proposed by these models positions it uniquely to 
potentially achieve lightweight and high-strength materials. 
In this study, we investigated self-assembled cuboid DNA silica frameworks with the 
octahedron coordination of 4- to 20-nm-thick elements, and their mechanical prop- 
erties were investigated using in situ micro-compression in a scanning electron mi- 
croscope (SEM). This lattice has an average coordination of struts of 8, which is 
above that required for rigidity of Maxwell lattices, which typically have coordination 
z, twice the dimensionality of the strut design.41We found a strong effect of lattice

In this passage, the authors discuss the importance of developing effective methods for designing and fabricating nanolattices with exceptional mechanical properties. These would not only ensure reliable performance in engineering devices but could also potentially offer dynamic and switchable mechanical behavior.
The strength-to-weight ratio of nanolattices is highly related to the size of the elements, and at the nanoscale, materials can exhibit a significant fraction of theoretical strength due to the absence of defects, such as dislocations or cracks. Therefore, it's desirable to create nanolattices with thinner elements that could possess higher strength. 3D photolithography has been used extensively for this purpose, though it does have limitations, including the challenge of producing nanoscale features below 50 nm.
The authors mention DNA frames as a promising avenue for generating designed 3D nanostructured materials. DNA origami allows the creation of engineered 3D shapes at the nanoscale by folding a long single strand of DNA with many small "staple" strands. This can then be used to form extended nanolattices. These DNA frameworks can then be transitioned to the solid state via sol-gel synthesis of silica, which can produce elements with thicknesses of 10-20 nm, below the limit of photolithography-generated nanolattices.
In their study, they investigated self-assembled cuboid DNA silica frameworks with the octahedron coordination of 4- to 20-nm-thick elements. They used in situ micro-compression in a scanning electron microscope (SEM) to investigate the mechanical properties of these structures. This approach could potentially lead to the creation of lightweight and high-strength materials.

INTRODUCTION 
One of the longest-held pursuits of materials science and engineering has been the 
production of lightweight, mechanically robust materials. In recent years, the ad- 
vancements in top-down and bottom-up fabrications have allowed for the construc- 
tion of 3D meso- and nanoscale periodic architected structures, which are often 
referred to as meso-nano-lattices.1���6Because a lattice consists of repeating motifs 
of individual unit cells, the strength of these materials is determined by a complex 
combination of the structure���s constituent materials, the unit cell structure, and 
the length and width of the individual elements, or struts, of the lattice.3,7���10In addi- 
tion to lattice effects, nanoscale lattices typically possess high strength-to-weight ra- 
tios because their nanosized elements exhibit ultrahigh strength due to the mechan- 
ical size effect, or so-called ������smaller is stronger������ behavior.11���18Sometimes, it is even 
possible to obtain a yield strength higher than their corresponding fully dense bulk 
solids when the size effect is stronger than the density effect.19 
Due to the superior strength-to-weight ratio, nanolattices can provide a mechani- 
cally robust open framework for several potential applications. Self-assembled 
nanolattices as a sputtering template have allowed for the creation of a 3D super- 
conducting architected structure as well as nanoengineered oxide structures for bat- 
tery materials.20,21Moreover, incorporation of functional nanoparticles into a lattice 
enables nanostructured catalysis platforms.22Self-assembly of nanoparticles using 
such platforms has yielded applications toward broadband absorption surfaces,23 
memory devices,24and sensors.25The possibility to generate nanostructures for 
creating robust materials, as inspired by biomineralization, allows for extending ap- 
plications as a biomaterial for bone or scaffolded tissue growth.26,27

In this scientific paper, the authors, Aaron Michelson, Tyler J. Flanagan, Seok-Woo Lee, and Oleg Gang, report on their findings related to the creation of continuous nanolattices - a class of mechanical metamaterials that are prized for their high strength-to-weight ratios. This ratio is derived from their intricate spatial architectures and their small, nanoscale-sized elements that come close to theoretical strength.
Due to limitations in current methodologies, it is challenging to design such frameworks with dimensions below 50 nm. However, the authors of the paper have managed to fabricate silica frameworks with elements ranging from 4- to 20-nm-thick. They used DNA origami nanolattices for self-assembly and silica templating. The mechanical properties of these frameworks were then tested using in situ micro-compression.
The results indicated that the lattice dimensions had a substantial impact on yield strength and failure mode. The silica nanolattices displayed higher yield strengths than any known engineering materials with a similar mass density. This was attributed to the robust coordination of the nanothin and strong silica elements.
Nanolattices are of significant interest due to their potential applications in numerous fields. For instance, they could serve as robust open frameworks for battery materials, provide platforms for nanostructured catalysis, or be used to create nanostructures inspired by biomineralization for applications in biomaterials, such as bone or scaffolded tissue growth.
The high strength-to-weight ratio of these nanolattices, combined with their unique properties at the nanoscale, make them a promising avenue of research in the quest to develop lightweight, mechanically robust materials.

A nanolattice is a synthetic porous material consisting of nanometer-size members patterned into an ordered lattice structure, like a space frame. The nanolattice is a newly emerged material class that has been rapidly developed over the last decade. Nanolattices redefine the limits of the material property space. Despite being composed of 50-99% of air, nanolattices are very mechanically robust because they take advantage of size-dependent properties that we generally see in nanoparticles, nanowires, and thin films. The most typical mechanical properties of nanolattices include ultrahigh strength, damage tolerance, and high stiffness. Thus, nanolattices have a wide range of applications.

You're absolutely correct!
Nanolattices are indeed these ultra-lightweight structures built from nanometer-scale components arranged in an orderly pattern. Because of their unique architecture, these structures are able to take advantage of certain physical properties at the nanoscale, which allows them to be incredibly strong and durable despite being comprised mostly of air.
These material properties, such as the unusually high strength-to-weight ratio, potential for damage tolerance, and high stiffness, make nanolattices extremely promising for various applications. These could include use in the aerospace industry, energy absorption and storage, thermal insulation, chemical catalysis, biological scaffolds, and many other fields.
Furthermore, the concept of utilizing DNA origami to guide the construction of nanolattices offers an innovative approach to overcome challenges in fabricating these tiny structures. This technique could pave the way for more efficient and precise fabrication of nanolattices, opening the door to even more potential applications in the future.

Synthesis
To produce nanolattice materials, polymer templates are manufactured by high-resolution 3D printing processes, such as multiphoton lithography, self-assembly, self-propagating photopolymer waveguides, and direct laser writing techniques. Those methods can synthesize the structure with a unit cell size down to the order of 50 nanometers. Genetic engineering also has the potential in synthesizing nanolattice. Ceramic, metal or composite material nanolattices are formed by post-treatment of the polymer templates with techniques including pyrolysis, atomic layer deposition, electroplating and electroless plating.[5] Pyrolysis, which additionally shrinks the lattices by up to 90%, creates the smallest-size structures, whereby the polymeric template material transforms into carbon,[1] or other ceramics[7] and metals,[8] through thermal decomposition in inert atmosphere or vacuum.

Yes, that's a great synthesis of the techniques used to fabricate nanolattices!
In short, the creation of nanolattice materials typically starts with the production of polymer templates through high-precision 3D printing methods. These methods could include multiphoton lithography, self-assembly, self-propagating photopolymer waveguides, and direct laser writing techniques. Such methods can create structures with unit cells as small as around 50 nanometers.
After the polymer templates are created, they undergo post-processing techniques to convert them into the desired material for the nanolattice. This could be a ceramic, metal, or composite material, which can be achieved through various methods such as pyrolysis, atomic layer deposition, electroplating, and electroless plating.
Pyrolysis, in particular, can also significantly shrink the lattice, reducing its size by up to 90%. This process involves the thermal decomposition of the polymeric template material in an inert atmosphere or vacuum, which can transform the polymer into carbon or other ceramics and metals.
DNA origami is another technique for nanolattice production that utilizes biological processes. It allows the production of complex 3D nanostructures by using strands of DNA as building blocks. These DNA strands are designed to self-assemble into the desired shape, making it possible to build intricate nanolattices at a scale that was previously challenging to achieve.
These fabrication techniques open the door to the design of new materials with properties that can be precisely controlled at the nanoscale. Such advanced materials have the potential to revolutionize a variety of fields, from materials science to biomedical engineering.
