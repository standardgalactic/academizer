It is almost always easier to i nd an accurate-but-complex model than an accurate-yet-simple model. 
Finding optimal, sparse, accurate models of various forms (linear models with integer coef i cients, decision 
sets, rule lists, decision trees) is generally NP-hard. We often do not know whether the search for a simpler 
model will be worthwhile, and thus we do not go to the trouble of searching for one. In this work, we ask 
an important practical question: can accurate-yet-simple models be proven to exist, or shown likely to exist, 
before explicitly searching for them? We hypothesize that there is an important reason that simple-yet- 
accurate models often do exist. This hypothesis is that the size of the Rashomon set is often large, where 
the Rashomon set is the set of almost-equally-accurate models from a function class. If the Rashomon set is 
large, it contains numerous accurate models, and perhaps at least one of them is the simple model we desire. 
In this work, we formally present the Rashomon ratio as a new gauge of simplicity for a learning problem, 
depending on a function class and a data set. The Rashomon ratio is the ratio of the volume of the set of 
accurate models to the volume of the hypothesis space, and it is dif f erent from standard complexity measures 
from statistical learning theory. Insight from studying the Rashomon ratio provides an easy way to check 
whether a simpler model might exist for a problem before i nding it, namely whether several dif f erent machine 
learning methods achieve similar performance on the data. In that sense, the Rashomon ratio is a powerful 
tool for understanding why and when an accurate-yet-simple model might exist. If, as we hypothesize in 
this work, many real-world data sets admit large Rashomon sets, the implications are vast: it means that 
simple or interpretable models may often be used for high-stakes decisions without losing accuracy. 
1Introduction 
Following the principle of Occam’s Razor, one should use the simplest model that explains the data well. 
However, i nding the simplest model, let alone any simple-yet-accurate model, is hard. As soon as simplicity 
constraints such as sparsity are introduced, the optimization problem for i nding a simpler model typically 
becomes NP-hard. Thus, practitioners – who have no assurance of i nding a simpler model that achieves the 
performance level of a black box – may not see a reason to attempt such potentially dif i cult optimization 
problems. Thus, sadly, what was once the holy grail of i nding simpler models, has been, for the most part, 
abandoned in modern machine learning. In this work, we ask a question that is essential, and potentially 
game-changing, for this discussion: what if we knew, before attempting a computationally expensive search 
for a simpler-yet-accurate model, that one was likely to exist? Perhaps knowing this would allow us to justify 
the time and expense of searching for such a model. If it is true that many data sets have large enough 
Rashomon sets to admit simple models, then there are important implications for society – it means we may 
be able to use simpler or interpretable models for many high-stakes problems without losing accuracy. 
Proving the existence of simpler models before aiming to i nd them dif f ers from the current approach 
to machine learning in practice. We generally do not think about going from more complicated spaces to 
simpler ones; in fact, the reverse is true, where typical statistical learning theory and algorithms allowed us 
to maintain generalization when handling more complicated model classes (e.g., large margins for support

vector machines with complex kernels or large margins for boosted trees) Cortes and Vapnik (1995); Schapire 
et al. (1998). We even build neural networks that are so complex that they can achieve zero training error, 
and try afterwards to determine why they generalize Belkin et al. (2019); Nakkiran et al. (2021). However, 
because simple models are essential for many high-stakes decisions (Rudin, 2019), perhaps we should return 
to the goal of aiming directly for simpler models. We will need new ideas in order to do this. 
Decades of study about generalization in machine learning have provided many dif f erent mathematical 
theories. Many of them measure the complexity of classes of functions without considering the data (e.g., VC 
theory, Vapnik, 1995), or measure properties of specif i c algorithms (e.g., algorithmic stability, see Bousquet 
and Elisseef f , 2002). However, none of these theories seems to capture directly a phenomenon that occurs 
throughout practical machine learning. In particular, there are a vast number of data sets for which many 
standard machine learning algorithms perform similarly. In these cases, the machine learning models tend 
to generalize well. Furthermore, in these same cases, there is often a simpler model that performs similarly 
and also generalizes well. 
We hypothesize that these three observations can all be explained by the same phenomenon:the 
“Rashomon ef f ect,” which is the existence of many almost-equally-accurate models (Breiman et al., 2001). 
Firstly, following a key argument in our work, if there is a large Rashomon set of almost-equally-accurate 
models, a simple model may also be contained in it. Secondly, if the Rashomon set is large, many dif f erent 
machine learning algorithms may i nd dif f erent but approximately-equally-well-performing models inside it. 
An experimenter could then observe similar performance for dif f erent types of algorithms that produce very 
dif f erent functions. Thirdly, if the Rashomon set is large enough to contain simpler models, those models are 
guaranteed to generalize well. As we will show in Section 5.2, there are mathematical assumptions that allow 
us to prove existence of simpler models within the Rashomon set. If the assumptions are satisf i ed, a model 
from a simpler class is approximately as accurate as the most accurate model within the hypothesis space, 
which consequently leads to better generalization guarantees. The assumptions are based in approximation 
theory, which models how one class of functions can approximate another.</div></div><div class="flex justify-between lg:block"><div class="text-xs flex items-center justify-center gap-1 self-center

to the complexity of the optimization problem. The authors introduce the Rashomon ratio as a measure of simplicity for a learning problem, which is the ratio of the volume of the set of accurate models to the volume of the hypothesis space. The Rashomon ratio is different from standard complexity measures from statistical learning theory, and its insights provide an easy way to check whether a simpler model might exist for a problem before finding it. If many real-world data sets admit large Rashomon sets, simple or interpretable models may often be used for high-stakes decisions without losing accuracy. The authors hypothesize that the Rashomon effect is responsible for the existence of many almost-equally-accurate models from a function class, and the size of the Rashomon set is often large, which means that there are numerous accurate models, including a simple model.</p></div></div></div><div class="flex justify-between lg:block"><div class="text-xs flex items-center justify-center gap-1 self-center pt-2 !invisible"><button disabled="" class="dark:text-white disabled:text-gray-300 dark:disabled:text-gray-400"><svg stroke="currentColor" fill="none" stroke-width="1.5" viewBox="0 0 24 24" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" class="h-3 w-3" height="1em" width="1em" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg"><polyline points="15 18 9 12 15 6"></polyline></svg></button><span class="flex-grow flex-shrink-0">1 / 1</span><button disabled="" class="dark:text-white disabled:text-gray-300 dark:disabled:text-gray-400"><svg stroke="currentColor" fill="none" stroke-width="1.5" viewBox="0 0 24 24" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" class="h-3 w-3" height="1em" width="1em" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg"><polyline points="9 18 15 12 9 6"></polyline></svg></button></div><div class="text-gray-400 flex self-end lg:self-center justify-center mt-2 gap-2 md:gap-3 lg:gap-1 lg:absolute lg:top-0 lg:translate-x-full lg:right-0 lg:mt-0 lg:pl-2 visible"><button class="flex ml-auto gap-2 h-full w-full rounded-md p-1 hover:bg-gray-100 hover:text-gray-700 dark:text-gray-400 dark:hover:bg-gray-700 dark:hover:text-gray-200 disabled:dark:hover:text-gray-400"><svg stroke="currentColor" fill="none" stroke-width="2" viewBox="0 0 24 24" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" class="h-4 w-4" height="1em" width="1em" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg"><path d="M16 4h2a2 2 0 0 1 2 2v14a2 2 0 0 1-2 2H6a2 2 0 0 1-2-2V6a2 2 0 0 1 2-2h2"></path><rect x="8" y="2" width="8" height="4" rx="1" ry="1"></rect></svg></button><button class="p-1 rounded-md hover:bg-gray-100 hover:text-gray-700 dark:text-gray-400 dark:hover:bg-gray-700 dark:hover:text-gray-200 disabled:dark:hover:text-gray-400"><svg stroke="currentColor" fill="none" stroke-width="2" viewBox="0 0 24 24" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" class="h-4 w-4" height="1em" width="1em" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg"><path d="M14 9V5a3 3 0 0 0-3-3l-4 9v11h11.28a2 2 0 0 0 2-1.7l1.38-9a2 2 0 0 0-2-2.3zM7 22H4a2 2 0 0 1-2-2v-7a2 2 0 0 1 2-2h3"></path></svg></button><button class="p-1 rounded-md hover:bg-gray-100 hover:text-gray-700 dark:text-gray-400 dark:hover:bg-gray-700 dark:hover:text-gray-200 disabled:dark:hover:text-gray-400"><svg stroke="currentColor" fill="none" stroke-width="2" viewBox="0 0 24 24" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" class="h-4 w-4" height="1em" width="1em" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg"><path d="M10 15v4a3 3 0 0 0 3 3l4-9V2H5.72a2 2 0 0 0-2 1.7l-1.38 9a2 2 0 0 0 2 2.3zm7-13h2.67A2.31 2.31 0 0 1 22 4v7a2.31 2.31 0 0 1-2.33 2H17"></path></svg></button></div></div></div></div></div><div class="group w-full text-gray-800 dark:text-gray-100 border-b border-black/10 dark:border-gray-900/50 dark:bg-gray-800"><div class="text-base gap-4 md:gap-6 md:max-w-2xl lg:max-w-xl xl:max-w-3xl p-4 md:py-6 flex lg:px-0 m-auto"><div class="w-[30px] flex flex-col relative items-end"><div class="relative flex"><span style="box-sizing: border-box; display: inline-block; overflow: hidden; width: initial; height: initial; background: none; opacity: 1; border: 0px; margin: 0px; padding: 0px; position: relative; max-width: 100%;"><span style="box-sizing: border-box; display: block; width: initial; height: initial; background: none; opacity: 1; border: 0px; margin: 0px; padding: 0px; max-width: 100%;"><img alt="" aria-hidden="true" src="data:image/svg+xml,%3csvg%20xmlns=%27http://www.w3.org/2000/svg%27%20version=%271.1%27%20width=%2738%27%20height=%2738%27/%3e" style="display: block; max-width: 100%; width: initial; height: initial; background: none; opacity: 1; border: 0px; margin: 0px; padding: 0px;"></span><img alt="User" src="https://chat.openai.com/_next/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Flh3.googleusercontent.com%2Fa%2FAGNmyxbfUJGaUXxADgtF19b5ZhmrVKp8-tY9hQf2Jfmp%3Ds96-c&amp;w=96&amp;q=75" decoding="async" data-nimg="intrinsic" class="rounded-sm" style="position: absolute; inset: 0px; box-sizing: border-box; padding: 0px; border: none; margin: auto; display: block; width: 0px; height: 0px; min-width: 100%; max-width: 100%; min-height: 100%; max-height: 100%;" width="30" height="30"></span></div></div><div class="relative flex w-[calc(100%-50px)] flex-col gap-1 md:gap-3 lg:w-[calc(100%-115px)]"><div class="flex flex-grow flex-col gap-3"><div class="min-h-[20px] flex flex-col items-start gap-4 whitespace-pre-wrap break-words">We quantify the magnitude of the Rashomon ef f ect through the Rashomon ratio, which is the ratio of 
the Rashomon set’s volume to the volume of the hypothesis space. An illustration of the Rashomon set is 
shown in Figure 1; it does not need to be a connected or convex set. The Rashomon ratio can serve as a 
gauge of simplicity for a learning problem.1As a property of both a data set and a hypothesis space, it 
dif f ers from the VC dimension (Vapnik and Chervonenkis, 1971) (because the Rashomon ratio is specif i c to 
a data set), it dif f ers from algorithmic stability (see Rogers and Wagner, 1978; Kearns and Ron, 1999) (as 
the Rashomon ratio does not rely on robustness of an algorithm with respect to changes in the data), it 
dif f ers from local Rademacher complexity (Bartlett et al., 2005) (as the Rashomon ratio does not measure 
the ability of the hypothesis space to handle random changes in targets and actually benef i ts from multiple 
similar models), and it dif f ers from geometric margins (Vapnik, 1995) (as the maximum margin classif i er can 
have a small minimum margin yet the Rashomon ratio can be large, and margins are measured with respect 
to one model, whereas the Rashomon ratio considers the existence of many). We provide theorems that show 
simple cases when the Rashomon ratio disagrees with these complexity measures in Section 3 and Appendix 
B. The Rashomon set is not just functions within a l at minimum; it could consist of functions from many 
non-f l at local minima as illustrated in Figure 4 in Appendix A, and it applies to discrete hypothesis spaces 
where gradients, and thus “sharpness” (Dinh et al., 2017) do not exist. For linear regression, we derive a 
closed form solution for the volume of the Rashomon set in parameter space in Theorem 10 in Appendix 
B.1. Our theory and empirical results have implications beyond cases where the size of the Rashomon set can 
be estimated in practice: they suggest computationally inexpensive ways to gauge whether the Rashomon set 
is large without directly measuring it. In particular, our results indicate that when many machine learning 
methods perform similarly on the same data set (without overf i tting), it could be because the Rashomon set 
of the functions these algorithms consider is large. Thus, after running dif f erent machine learning methods 
and observing similar performance, our results indicate that it may be worthwhile to optimize directly for 
simpler models within the Rashomon set. 
1Such measures are typically called “complexity” measures, but the Rashomon ratio measures simplicity, not complexity.

Figure 1: An illustration of a possible Rashomon set in two dimensional hypothesis space F. Models below 
the gray plane belong to the Rashomon set ˆ

Rashomon parameter θ def i ned in Section 3. 
We summarize the contributions of this work as follows: (i) We def i ne the Rashomon ratio as an important 
characteristic of the Rashomon set. (ii) We provide generalization bounds for models from the Rashomon set, 
and show that the size of the Rashomon set serves as a barometer for the existence of accurate-yet-simpler 
models that generalize well. These are dif f erent from standard learning theory bounds that consider the 
distance between the true and empirical risks for the same function. (iii) We provide several approaches for 
estimating the size of the Rashomon set. (iv) We show empirically that when a large Rashomon set occurs, 
most machine learning methods tend to perform similarly, and also in these cases, simple or sparse (yet</div></div><div class="flex justify-between lg:block"><div class="text-xs flex items-center

(v) We demonstrate that the Rashomon ratio, as a gauge of simplicity of a machine 
learning problem, is dif f erent from other known complexity measures such as VC-dimension, algorithmic

occur in the presence of label or feature noise. 
2Related Work 
There are several bodies of relevant literature as discussed below. 
Rashomon sets:Rashomon sets have been used for various purposes (Breiman et al., 2001; Srebro et al., 
2010; Fisher et al., 2019; Coker et al., 2021; Tulabandhula and Rudin, 2014b; Meinshausen and Bühlmann, 
2010; Letham et al., 2016; Nevo and Ritov, 2017). For instance, Srebro et al. (2010) consider a loss-restricted 
class of close-to-optimal models, and with an assumption of H-smoothness of a loss function, they obtain 
a tighter excess risk bound through local Rademacher complexity (Bartlett et al., 2005). Our bounds do 
not work the same way and aim to prove a dif f erent type of result. Other works aim to search through the 
Rashomon set to i nd the most extreme models within it, rather than looking at the size of the Rashomon 
set, as we do in this work. Fisher et al. (2019) leverages the Rashomon set in order to understand the 
spectrum of variable importance and other statistics across the set of good models. Our work considers the 
existence of models from simpler classes rather than exploring the Rashomon set to i nd a range of variable 
importance or other statistics. The work of Tulabandhula and Rudin (2013, 2014a,b) uses the Rashomon 
set to assist with decision making, by i nding the range of downstream operational costs associated with the 
Rashomon set. Rashomon sets are related to p-hacking and robustness of estimation, because the Rashomon 
set is a set over which one might conduct a sensitivity analysis to choices made by an analyst (Coker et al., 
2021). Large Rashomon sets can occur when the machine learning pipeline is underspecif i ed. D’Amour et al. 
(2020) provides multiple examples of underspecif i cation in computer vision, natural language processing, and</div></div><div class="flex justify-between lg:block"><div class="text-xs flex

The Rashomon ratio, as a property of a data set and a hypothesis space, serves as gauge of simplicity of the 
learning problem. If the Rashomon set is large, many dif f erent reasonable optimization procedures could lead 
to a model from the Rashomon set. Therefore, for large Rashomon sets, accurate models tend to be easier 
to i nd (since optimization procedures can i nd them). In other words, if the Rashomon ratio is large, the 
Rashomon set could contain many accurate and simple models, and the learning problem becomes simpler. 
On the other hand, smaller Rashomon ratios might imply a harder learning problem, especially in the case 
of few deep and narrow local minima. 5 
Table 1: Comparison of Rashomon ratio and other complexity measures. The Rashomon ratio considers the 
fact that there are multiple good models and is a property both of the hypothesis space and data.

The Rashomon ratio can give insight into the simplicity of a learning problem, though it was designed 
for a fundamentally dif f erent goal than well-known complexity measures from learning theory (see Table 1). 
While those complexity measures were designed to help us understand generalization, the Rashomon ratio 
(with additional assumptions) helps us understand whether simpler functions might exist with the same level 
of accuracy as complex functions. The Rashomon ratio depends on a loss function, the hypothesis space, 
and a data set, while the majority of other measures are either data-agnostic or focus on properties of a 
specif i c model in the space. 
The Rashomon ratio is dif f erent from VC dimension.The VC dimension (Vapnik and Chervonenkis, 
1971) shows the expressive power of a hypothesis space for any data set including an extreme arrangement 
of data points and labels. On the contrary, the Rashomon set depends on an empirical risk minimizer that 
we compute directly for a specif i c data set, which may not be extreme. 
The Rashomon ratio is dif f erent from algorithmic stability.Algorithmic stability (Bousquet and 
Elisseef f , 2002) (see Def i nition B.2) depends on a change to a data set, whereas Rashomon Ratio uses a i xed 
data set. As we will show in Theorem 10 in Appendix B.1, in the case of linear least squares regression, the 
Rashomon ratio depends on features (X) only, and does not depend on regression targets Y . In contrast, 
hypothesis stability depends heavily on Y . In fact, if we can control how we change the set of targets, 
hypothesis stability (a form of algorithmic stability) can be made to change by an arbitrarily large amount. 
This is formalized in Theorem 2 with proof in Appendix B.2. 
Theorem 2 (Rashomon ratio is not algorithmic stability). Consider a distribution PXover a discrete 
domain X = {x1,...xN} and a learning algorithm A that minimizes the sum of squares loss : kXω − Y k2 2. 
for a linear hypothesis space FΩ. For any λ &gt; 0, there exist joint distributions PX,Y1and PX,Y2where for X 
drawn i.i.d. from PX, Y1drawn from PY1|Xover Y |X, and Y2drawn from PY2|Xover Y |X, the expected 
Rashomon ratios are the same: 
EPX,Y1[ˆRratioS1(FΩ,θ)] = EPX,Y2[ˆRratioS2(FΩ,θ)], 
yet hypothesis stability constants are dif f erent by our arbitrarily chosen value of λ: ˜ 
β2− 
˜ β1≥ λ, where S1 
and S2denote data sets S1= [X,Y1] and S2= [X,Y2], ˜ 
β1is the hypothesis stability coef i cient of algorithm 
A for distribution PX,Y1and 
˜ 
β2is the hypothesis stability coef i cient for distribution PX,Y2.</div></div><div class="flex justify-between lg:block"><div class="text-xs flex items-center justify-center gap-1 self-center pt-2

given dataset. It depends on the hypothesis space, the data, and a loss function. A larger Rashomon ratio implies that there are many accurate and simple models, making the learning problem easier. In contrast, a smaller Rashomon ratio may imply a harder learning problem, especially when there are few deep and narrow local minima.</p><p>The Rashomon ratio is different from other complexity measures, such as VC dimension and algorithmic stability. The VC dimension measures the expressive power of a hypothesis space for any data set, while the Rashomon ratio depends on an empirical risk minimizer that is computed for a specific data set. Algorithmic stability measures how much a hypothesis changes when the training data is perturbed, while the Rashomon ratio uses a fixed data set. Additionally, the Rashomon ratio depends on features only in the case of linear least squares regression, whereas hypothesis stability depends heavily on the regression targets.</p><p>In conclusion, the Rashomon ratio provides valuable insights into the simplicity of a learning problem, but it is different from other complexity measures and serves a fundamentally different purpose. By considering the set of good models that fit a given dataset, it can help determine whether simpler models with the same level of accuracy as complex models exist.</p></div></div></div><div class="flex justify-between lg:block"><div class="text-xs flex items-center justify-center gap-1 self-center pt-2 !invisible"><button disabled="" class="dark:text-white disabled:text-gray-300 dark:disabled:text-gray-400"><svg stroke="currentColor" fill="none" stroke-width="1.5" viewBox="0 0 24 24" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" class="h-3 w-3" height="1em" width="1em" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg"><polyline points="15 18 9 12 15 6"></polyline></svg></button><span class="flex-grow flex-shrink-0">1 / 1</span><button disabled="" class="dark:text-white disabled:text-gray-300 dark:disabled:text-gray-400"><svg stroke="currentColor" fill="none" stroke-width="1.5" viewBox="0 0 24 24" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" class="h-3 w-3" height="1em" width="1em" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg"><polyline points="9 18 15 12 9 6"></polyline></svg></button></div><div class="text-gray-400 flex self-end lg:self-center justify-center mt-2 gap-2 md:gap-3 lg:gap-1 lg:absolute lg:top-0 lg:translate-x-full lg:right-0 lg:mt-0 lg:pl-2 visible"><button class="flex ml-auto gap-2 h-full w-full rounded-md p-1 hover:bg-gray-100 hover:text-gray-700 dark:text-gray-400 dark:hover:bg-gray-700 dark:hover:text-gray-200 disabled:dark:hover:text-gray-400"><svg stroke="currentColor" fill="none" stroke-width="2" viewBox="0 0 24 24" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" class="h-4 w-4" height="1em" width="1em" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg"><path d="M16 4h2a2 2 0 0 1 2 2v14a2 2 0 0 1-2 2H6a2 2 0 0 1-2-2V6a2 2 0 0 1 2-2h2"></path><rect x="8" y="2" width="8" height="4" rx="1" ry="1"></rect></svg></button><button class="p-1 rounded-md hover:bg-gray-100 hover:text-gray-700 dark:text-gray-400 dark:hover:bg-gray-700 dark:hover:text-gray-200 disabled:dark:hover:text-gray-400"><svg stroke="currentColor" fill="none" stroke-width="2" viewBox="0 0 24 24" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" class="h-4 w-4" height="1em" width="1em" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg"><path d="M14 9V5a3 3 0 0 0-3-3l-4 9v11h11.28a2 2 0 0 0 2-1.7l1.38-9a2 2 0 0 0-2-2.3zM7 22H4a2 2 0 0 1-2-2v-7a2 2 0 0 1 2-2h3"></path></svg></button><button class="p-1 rounded-md hover:bg-gray-100 hover:text-gray-700 dark:text-gray-400 dark:hover:bg-gray-700 dark:hover:text-gray-200 disabled:dark:hover:text-gray-400"><svg stroke="currentColor" fill="none" stroke-width="2" viewBox="0 0 24 24" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" class="h-4 w-4" height="1em" width="1em" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg"><path d="M10 15v4a3 3 0 0 0 3 3l4-9V2H5.72a2 2 0 0 0-2 1.7l-1.38 9a2 2 0 0 0 2 2.3zm7-13h2.67A2.31 2.31 0 0 1 22 4v7a2.31 2.31 0 0 1-2.33 2H17"></path></svg></button></div></div></div></div></div><div class="group w-full text-gray-800 dark:text-gray-100 border-b border-black/10 dark:border-gray-900/50 dark:bg-gray-800"><div class="text-base gap-4 md:gap-6 md:max-w-2xl lg:max-w-xl xl:max-w-3xl p-4 md:py-6 flex lg:px-0 m-auto"><div class="w-[30px] flex flex-col relative items-end"><div class="relative flex"><span style="box-sizing: border-box; display: inline-block; overflow: hidden; width: initial; height: initial; background: none; opacity: 1; border: 0px; margin: 0px; padding: 0px; position: relative; max-width: 100%;"><span style="box-sizing: border-box; display: block; width: initial; height: initial; background: none; opacity: 1; border: 0px; margin: 0px; padding: 0px; max-width: 100%;"><img alt="" aria-hidden="true" src="data:image/svg+xml,%3csvg%20xmlns=%27http://www.w3.org/2000/svg%27%20version=%271.1%27%20width=%2738%27%20height=%2738%27/%3e" style="display: block; max-width: 100%; width: initial; height: initial; background: none; opacity: 1; border: 0px; margin: 0px; padding: 0px;"></span><img alt="User" src="https://chat.openai.com/_next/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Flh3.googleusercontent.com%2Fa%2FAGNmyxbfUJGaUXxADgtF19b5ZhmrVKp8-tY9hQf2Jfmp%3Ds96-c&amp;w=96&amp;q=75" decoding="async" data-nimg="intrinsic" class="rounded-sm" style="position: absolute; inset: 0px; box-sizing: border-box; padding: 0px; border: none; margin: auto; display: block; width: 0px; height: 0px; min-width: 100%; max-width: 100%; min-height: 100%; max-height: 100%;" width="30" height="30"></span></div></div><div class="relative flex w-[calc(100%-50px)] flex-col gap-1 md:gap-3 lg:w-[calc(100%-115px)]"><div class="flex flex-grow flex-col gap-3"><div class="min-h-[20px] flex flex-col items-start gap-4 whitespace-pre-wrap break-words">The Rashomon ratio is dif f erent from geometric margins.The margin (i.e., the minimum margin of 
the maximum margin classif i er) (Schapire et al., 1998; Burges, 1998) depends on points closest to the decision 
6 
boundary (support vectors), while the Rashomon set does not necessarily rely on the support vectors and 
may depend on the full data set. Theorem 3 shows this with proof in Appendix B.3. 
Theorem 3 (Rashomon ratio is not the geometric margin). For any i xed 0 &lt; λ &lt; 1, there exists a i xed 
hypothesis space FΩ, 
a Rashomon parameter θ, and there exist two data sets S1and S2with the same 
empirical risk minimizer ˆ 
f ∈ FΩsuch 
that the geometric margin d is the same for both data sets, yet the 
Rashomon ratios are dif f erent: |ˆRratioS1(FΩ,θ) − 
ˆ 
RratioS2(FΩ,θ)| &gt; λ. 
The Rashomon ratio is dif f erent from empirical local Rademacher complexity.Empirical Rademacher 
complexity (Bartlett et al., 2005) (see Def i nitions B.4) measures how well the hypothesis space can i t ran- 
dom assignments of the labels. The Rashomon ratio uses i xed labels. It measures the number of models 
that are close to optimal. In other words, the Rashomon set benef i ts from having multiple similar models, 
while Rademacher complexity treats them as equivalent. Please see Theorem 4 with def i nition and proof in 
Appendix B.4. 
Theorem 4 (Rashomon ratio is not local Rademacher complexity). For 0 &lt; λ &lt; 1, there exist two data sets 
S1and S2, a hypothesis space FΩ, and a Rashomon parameter θ such that the local Rademacher complexities 
def i ned on the Rashomon sets for S1and S2are the same: ˆ 
RS1 
n ? 
ˆ 
Rset(FΩ,θ) ? 
= ˆ 
RS2 
n ? 
ˆ 
Rset(FΩ,θ) ? 
, yet the 
Rashomon ratios are dif f erent: ? ? ?ˆRratioS1(FΩ,θ) 
− 
ˆ 
RratioS2(FΩ,θ) ? ? ? &gt; λ. 
Now that we have established that the Rashomon ratio is not the same as other simplicity measures, we 
can now shift our focus to proving simplicity and generalization properties of models in the Rashomon set. 
This is critical to our thesis that simple-yet-accurate models exist.</div></div><div class="flex justify-between lg:block"><div class="text-xs flex items-center justify-center gap-1 self-center pt-2

It seems to be discussing the Rashomon set and its properties in relation to other simplicity measures such as geometric margins and empirical local Rademacher complexity. The Rashomon set refers to a set of models that are all near-optimal and have similar performance. The Rashomon ratio is a measure of the size of this set and can differ from other measures of simplicity such as geometric margins and Rademacher complexity. Theorems 3 and 4 provide examples of how the Rashomon ratio is not the same as these other measures. The authors then suggest that proving simplicity and generalization properties of models in the Rashomon set is critical to their thesis that simple-yet-accurate models exist.</p></div></div></div><div class="flex justify-between lg:block"><div class="text-xs flex items-center justify-center gap-1 self-center pt-2 !invisible"><button disabled="" class="dark:text-white disabled:text-gray-300 dark:disabled:text-gray-400"><svg stroke="currentColor" fill="none" stroke-width="1.5" viewBox="0 0 24 24" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" class="h-3 w-3" height="1em" width="1em" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg"><polyline points="15 18 9 12 15 6"></polyline></svg></button><span class="flex-grow flex-shrink-0">1 / 1</span><button disabled="" class="dark:text-white disabled:text-gray-300 dark:disabled:text-gray-400"><svg stroke="currentColor" fill="none" stroke-width="1.5" viewBox="0 0 24 24" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" class="h-3 w-3" height="1em" width="1em" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg"><polyline points="9 18 15 12 9 6"></polyline></svg></button></div><div class="text-gray-400 flex self-end lg:self-center justify-center mt-2 gap-2 md:gap-3 lg:gap-1 lg:absolute lg:top-0 lg:translate-x-full lg:right-0 lg:mt-0 lg:pl-2 visible"><button class="flex ml-auto gap-2 h-full w-full rounded-md p-1 hover:bg-gray-100 hover:text-gray-700 dark:text-gray-400 dark:hover:bg-gray-700 dark:hover:text-gray-200 disabled:dark:hover:text-gray-400"><svg stroke="currentColor" fill="none" stroke-width="2" viewBox="0 0 24 24" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" class="h-4 w-4" height="1em" width="1em" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg"><path d="M16 4h2a2 2 0 0 1 2 2v14a2 2 0 0 1-2 2H6a2 2 0 0 1-2-2V6a2 2 0 0 1 2-2h2"></path><rect x="8" y="2" width="8" height="4" rx="1" ry="1"></rect></svg></button><button class="p-1 rounded-md hover:bg-gray-100 hover:text-gray-700 dark:text-gray-400 dark:hover:bg-gray-700 dark:hover:text-gray-200 disabled:dark:hover:text-gray-400"><svg stroke="currentColor" fill="none" stroke-width="2" viewBox="0 0 24 24" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" class="h-4 w-4" height="1em" width="1em" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg"><path d="M14 9V5a3 3 0 0 0-3-3l-4 9v11h11.28a2 2 0 0 0 2-1.7l1.38-9a2 2 0 0 0-2-2.3zM7 22H4a2 2 0 0 1-2-2v-7a2 2 0 0 1 2-2h3"></path></svg></button><button class="p-1 rounded-md hover:bg-gray-100 hover:text-gray-700 dark:text-gray-400 dark:hover:bg-gray-700 dark:hover:text-gray-200 disabled:dark:hover:text-gray-400"><svg stroke="currentColor" fill="none" stroke-width="2" viewBox="0 0 24 24" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" class="h-4 w-4" height="1em" width="1em" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg"><path d="M10 15v4a3 3 0 0 0 3 3l4-9V2H5.72a2 2 0 0 0-2 1.7l-1.38 9a2 2 0 0 0 2 2.3zm7-13h2.67A2.31 2.31 0 0 1 22 4v7a2.31 2.31 0 0 1-2.33 2H17"></path></svg></button></div></div></div></div></div><div class="group w-full text-gray-800 dark:text-gray-100 border-b border-black/10 dark:border-gray-900/50 dark:bg-gray-800"><div class="text-base gap-4 md:gap-6 md:max-w-2xl lg:max-w-xl xl:max-w-3xl p-4 md:py-6 flex lg:px-0 m-auto"><div class="w-[30px] flex flex-col relative items-end"><div class="relative flex"><span style="box-sizing: border-box; display: inline-block; overflow: hidden; width: initial; height: initial; background: none; opacity: 1; border: 0px; margin: 0px; padding: 0px; position: relative; max-width: 100%;"><span style="box-sizing: border-box; display: block; width: initial; height: initial; background: none; opacity: 1; border: 0px; margin: 0px; padding: 0px; max-width: 100%;"><img alt="" aria-hidden="true" src="data:image/svg+xml,%3csvg%20xmlns=%27http://www.w3.org/2000/svg%27%20version=%271.1%27%20width=%2738%27%20height=%2738%27/%3e" style="display: block; max-width: 100%; width: initial; height: initial; background: none; opacity: 1; border: 0px; margin: 0px; padding: 0px;"></span><img alt="User" src="https://chat.openai.com/_next/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Flh3.googleusercontent.com%2Fa%2FAGNmyxbfUJGaUXxADgtF19b5ZhmrVKp8-tY9hQf2Jfmp%3Ds96-c&amp;w=96&amp;q=75" decoding="async" data-nimg="intrinsic" class="rounded-sm" style="position: absolute; inset: 0px; box-sizing: border-box; padding: 0px; border: none; margin: auto; display: block; width: 0px; height: 0px; min-width: 100%; max-width: 100%; min-height: 100%; max-height: 100%;" width="30" height="30"></span></div></div><div class="relative flex w-[calc(100%-50px)] flex-col gap-1 md:gap-3 lg:w-[calc(100%-115px)]"><div class="flex flex-grow flex-col gap-3"><div class="min-h-[20px] flex flex-col items-start gap-4 whitespace-pre-wrap break-words">This conjecture is not a theorem because there is no analytical solution to the minimizer of the volume 
of the Rashomon set; the calculations are quite complex, involving dif f erences of the CDF values of dif f erent 
Gaussians. However, all parts of the conjecture have been fully checked numerically. In part (II), we use an 
analytical derivation and exhaustive numerical computations to show that the derivatives of the left side of 
Eqn. (2) are either positive or negative sign. For part (III), we transpose the left Gaussian to N(0,1) to form 
a canonical problem in which all possible solutions can be computed numerically. We exhaustively search 
over the range of γ, i nding the optimal µ2and volume of the Rashomon set for each γ. We i nd that µ2is 
very close to 2 for all γ. We discuss this in Appendix I. 
This conjecture suggests that data that are approximately distributed according to two normal 
distributions, where the positive and negative normal distributions substantially overlap, will 
have a large Rashomon set. Figure 3(a) shows the dependence of the Rashomon set on the noise level 
σ for µ1= 1,µ2= 6 and σ ∈ [0.2,4]. Figure 3(b) plots maximum accuracy versus Rashomon ratio for 38 
data sets considered in Section 6. These i gures indicate that large Rashomon sets occur both in noisy and 
non-noisy data. 
There can be many data sets with characteristics as in Conjecture 9.For example, let us consider 
criminal recidivism data, whose Rashomon sets have been studied Fisher et al. (2019); Dong and Rudin 
(2020) and that admit simple-yet-accurate models Zeng et al. (2017); Rudin et al. (2020). Each data point 
is generated based on a set of random events happening in the world; whether someone enters a job training 
program, whether someone associates with criminal associates after release, and whether someone commits 
a crime each day are all random variables whose random ef f ects are cumulative over time, and thus could be 
modeled by Gaussians by the central limit theorem. By this logic, we would expect many criminal recidivism 
prediction problems to admit large Rashomon sets. Other high-stakes predictions such as loan defaults may 
have similar characteristics. 
In a sense, this full analysis paints a much clearer picture as to why such problems admit simple yet 
similarly accurate models: their distributions are approximately Gaussian with signif i cant overlap, such 
overlap leads to large Rashomon sets, and large Rashomon sets lead to the existence of simple yet similarly 
accurate models. 14 
8Conclusion and Implications 
We have proposed Rashomon sets and ratios as another perspective on the relationship between hypothesis 
spaces and data sets, and we have provided initial theoretical and experimental results showing that this is a 
unique perspective that may help explain some phenomena observed in practice. More specif i cally, the main 
conclusions include: (1) Large Rashomon sets can embed models from simpler hypothesis spaces (Section 
5); (2) Similar performance across dif f erent machine learning algorithms may correlate with large Rashomon 
sets (Section 6); (3) Large Rashomon sets correlate with existence of models that have good generalization 
performance (Section 6); (4) The Rashomon ratio is a measure of a learning problem’s complexity (Section 4), 
and that data that approximately arise from overlapping Gaussian distributions tend to have large Rashomon 
sets (Section 7). 
Consider a researcher conducting a standard set of machine learning experiments in which the performance 
of several dif f erent algorithms are compared, and generalization is assessed. In the possible scenario where all 
algorithms perform similarly, and when their models tend to generalize well on validation data, the learning 
problem is likely to have a large Rashomon set. Based on the result in Section 5, simpler models are likely to 
exist in a large Rashomon set. If the researcher is interested in simpler models, they can search the simpler 
function class F1, a subset of the larger class F2, to locate simpler models within it. While optimizing 
for simplicity or interpretability constraints is usually much more computationally expensive than running 
standard machine learning algorithms, our thesis is that this search would be likely to succeed in the presence 
of a large Rashomon set. In the converse case, if the researcher’s algorithms perform dif f erently from each 
other, the researcher might then select a more complex model class that achieves better performance yet 
does not overf i t. Further, if the researcher knows that the data are likely to have arisen from overlapping 
Gaussian distributions, the researcher could assume that it is worthwhile to search for a simple model that 
performs well.</div></div><div class="flex justify-between lg:block"><div class="text-xs flex items-center justify-center gap-1 self-center pt-2 !invisible"><button disabled="" class="dark:text-white

Abstract 
Missing values are a fundamental problem in 
data science. Many datasets have missing val- 
ues that must be properly handled because 
the way missing values are treated can have 
large impact on the resulting machine learn- 
ing model. In medical applications, the conse- 
quences may af f ect healthcare decisions. There 
are many methods in the literature for dealing 
with missing values, including state-of-the-art 
methods which often depend on black-box mod- 
els for imputation. In this work, we show how 
recent advances in interpretable machine learn- 
ing provide a new perspective for understand- 
ing and tackling the missing value problem. We 
propose methods based on high-accuracy glass- 
box Explainable Boosting Machines (EBMs) 
that can help users (1) gain new insights on 
missingness mechanisms and better understand 
the causes of missingness, and (2) detect – or 
even alleviate – potential risks introduced by 
imputation algorithms.Experiments on real- 
world medical datasets illustrate the ef f ective- 
ness of the proposed methods. 
Data and Code Availability:This paper uses 
two publicly available datasets:MIMIC-II (Saeed 
et al., 2002) and CDC Birth Cohort Linked Birth- In- 
fant Death Data Files (United States Department of 
Health and Human Services (US DHHS) et al.), and a 
proprietary pneumonia mortality prediction dataset 
(Cooper et al., 2005). The experiments leverage In- 
terpretML open source (Nori et al., 2019) software 
package, and experiment code is provided in the sup- 
plementary materials.

1. Introduction 
Missing values are ubiquitous in most datasets and 
have signif i cant impact on machine learning mod- 
els, as most machine learning models do not natu- 
rally handle missing values. While one could simply 
delete rows or columns as a preprocessing step, so 
the learning algorithm is only given observed, non- 
missing samples as inputs, such methods only work 
when the missingness ratio is small and the feature 
values are missing completely at random (MCAR). 
Deleting cases with non-MCAR missing values risks 
changing the data distribution, losing what might be 
valuable information contained in the missing cases. 
To avoid potential risks, systematic studies on un- 
derstanding and handling missing values have been 
conducted in statistics and machine learning. Mech- 
anisms of missingness have been studied and classif i ed 
into three main categories, missing completely at ran- 
dom (MCAR), missing at random (MAR), and miss- 
ing not at random (MNAR). Dif f erent types of miss- 
ingness have dif f erent solutions. For example, data 
cleaning and deletion methods like listwise and pair- 
wise deletion are often used for MCAR (Rubin, 1976). 
In the MAR scenario, numerous imputation meth- 
ods have been proposed. These include simple tech-

handling missing values in healthcare data, as it can impact the resulting machine learning model and ultimately affect healthcare decisions. They note that many datasets have missing values, and while there are many methods for dealing with missing values in the literature, state-of-the-art methods often rely on black-box models for imputation. The authors propose using interpretable machine learning methods, specifically high-accuracy glass-box Explainable Boosting Machines (EBMs), to gain new insights on missingness mechanisms and better understand the causes of missingness, as well as to detect and alleviate potential risks introduced by imputation algorithms.</p><ol start="3"><li>Methods</li></ol><p>The authors use two publicly available datasets and a proprietary pneumonia mortality prediction dataset to illustrate the effectiveness of their proposed methods.

Authors: Zhenyu Chen, Lijinzhi Lin, Xiaodie Lin, Zhaohui Wei, Penghui Yao

Abstract: Suppose two separated parties, Alice and Bob, share a bipartite quantum state or a classical correlation called a seed, and they try to generate a target classical correlation by performing local quantum or classical operations on the seed, i.e., any communications are not allowed. We consider the following fundamental problem about this setting: whether Alice and Bob can use a given seed to</div></div><div class="flex justify-between lg:block"><div class="text-xs flex

We investigate this problem and provide a framework for studying the generations of classical correlations via quantum schemes. We introduce a new concept called the generation hierarchy of classical correlations, which characterizes the minimum number of rounds of local operations required to generate a target classical correlation from a given seed. We show that this generation hierarchy can be related to the entanglement cost and the distillable entanglement of the seed. Our results provide insights into the interplay between quantum entanglement and classical correlations, and shed light on the power and limitations of quantum resources in generating classical correlations.</p></div></div></div><div class="flex justify-between lg:block"><div class="text-xs flex items-center justify-center gap-1 self-center pt-2 !invisible"><button disabled="" class="dark:text-white disabled:text-gray-300 dark:disabled:text-gray-400"><svg stroke="currentColor" fill="none" stroke-width="1.5" viewBox="0 0 24 24" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" class="h-3 w-3" height="1em" width="1em" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg"><polyline points="15 18 9 12 15 6"></polyline></svg></button><span class="flex-grow flex-shrink-0">1 / 1</span><button disabled="" class="dark:text-white disabled:text-gray-300 dark:disabled:text-gray-400"><svg stroke="currentColor" fill="none" stroke-width="1.5" viewBox="0 0 24 24" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" class="h-3 w-3" height="1em" width="1em" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg"><polyline points="9 18 15 12 9 6"></polyline></svg></button></div><div class="text-gray-400 flex self-end lg:self-center justify-center mt-2 gap-2 md:gap-3 lg:gap-1 lg:absolute lg:top-0 lg:translate-x-full lg:right-0 lg:mt-0 lg:pl-2 visible"><button class="flex ml-auto gap-2 h-full w-full rounded-md p-1 hover:bg-gray-100 hover:text-gray-700 dark:text-gray-400 dark:hover:bg-gray-700 dark:hover:text-gray-200 disabled:dark:hover:text-gray-400"><svg stroke="currentColor" fill="none" stroke-width="2" viewBox="0 0 24 24" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" class="h-4 w-4" height="1em" width="1em" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg"><path d="M16 4h2a2 2 0 0 1 2 2v14a2 2 0 0 1-2 2H6a2 2 0 0 1-2-2V6a2 2 0 0 1 2-2h2"></path><rect x="8" y="2" width="8" height="4" rx="1" ry="1"></rect></svg></button><button class="p-1 rounded-md hover:bg-gray-100 hover:text-gray-700 dark:text-gray-400 dark:hover:bg-gray-700 dark:hover:text-gray-200 disabled:dark:hover:text-gray-400"><svg stroke="currentColor" fill="none" stroke-width="2" viewBox="0 0 24 24" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" class="h-4 w-4" height="1em" width="1em" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg"><path d="M14 9V5a3 3 0 0 0-3-3l-4 9v11h11.28a2 2 0 0 0 2-1.7l1.38-9a2 2 0 0 0-2-2.3zM7 22H4a2 2 0 0 1-2-2v-7a2 2 0 0 1 2-2h3"></path></svg></button><button class="p-1 rounded-md hover:bg-gray-100 hover:text-gray-700 dark:text-gray-400 dark:hover:bg-gray-700 dark:hover:text-gray-200 disabled:dark:hover:text-gray-400"><svg stroke="currentColor" fill="none" stroke-width="2" viewBox="0 0 24 24" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" class="h-4 w-4" height="1em" width="1em" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg"><path d="M10 15v4a3 3 0 0 0 3 3l4-9V2H5.72a2 2 0 0 0-2 1.7l-1.38 9a2 2 0 0 0 2 2.3zm7-13h2.67A2.31 2.31 0 0 1 22 4v7a2.31 2.31 0 0 1-2.33 2H17"></path></svg></button></div></div></div></div></div><div class="group w-full text-gray-800 dark:text-gray-100 border-b border-black/10 dark:border-gray-900/50 dark:bg-gray-800"><div class="text-base gap-4 md:gap-6 md:max-w-2xl lg:max-w-xl xl:max-w-3xl p-4 md:py-6 flex lg:px-0 m-auto"><div class="w-[30px] flex flex-col relative items-end"><div class="relative flex"><span style="box-sizing: border-box; display: inline-block; overflow: hidden; width: initial; height: initial; background: none; opacity: 1; border: 0px; margin: 0px; padding: 0px; position: relative; max-width: 100%;"><span style="box-sizing: border-box; display: block; width: initial; height: initial; background: none; opacity: 1; border: 0px; margin: 0px; padding: 0px; max-width: 100%;"><img alt="" aria-hidden="true" src="data:image/svg+xml,%3csvg%20xmlns=%27http://www.w3.org/2000/svg%27%20version=%271.1%27%20width=%2738%27%20height=%2738%27/%3e" style="display: block; max-width: 100%; width: initial; height: initial; background: none; opacity: 1; border: 0px; margin: 0px; padding: 0px;"></span><img alt="User" src="https://chat.openai.com/_next/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Flh3.googleusercontent.com%2Fa%2FAGNmyxbfUJGaUXxADgtF19b5ZhmrVKp8-tY9hQf2Jfmp%3Ds96-c&amp;w=96&amp;q=75" decoding="async" data-nimg="intrinsic" class="rounded-sm" style="position: absolute; inset: 0px; box-sizing: border-box; padding: 0px; border: none; margin: auto; display: block; width: 0px; height: 0px; min-width: 100%; max-width: 100%; min-height: 100%; max-height: 100%;" width="30" height="30"></span></div></div><div class="relative flex w-[calc(100%-50px)] flex-col gap-1 md:gap-3 lg:w-[calc(100%-115px)]"><div class="flex flex-grow flex-col gap-3"><div class="min-h-[20px] flex flex-col items-start gap-4 whitespace-pre-wrap break-words">Literature Review 
Opinion Dynamics Models. Modeling and analyzing opin- 
ion dynamics in social networks have received research atten- 
tion from different disciplines. In the literature, there were two 
lines of works that modeled and analyzed opinion dynamics in 
social networks. The i rst studied the discrete-valued opinion 
scenario, A line of works built discrete opinion dynamics 
models and studied binary opinion scenario, for example, to 
support the Democrats or the Republicans. In the discrete 
models, users imitated their neighbors’ opinions to update their 
own. Popular imitation rules included random imitation rule 
in the voter model [3], the local majority rule [4], and the 
linear threshold rule [5], etc. The imitation in the discrete 
models resulted in users’ opinions to change to change from 
one extreme to the other. To model how users opinions 
were changed and formed in a gradual process, the other 
continuous-valued opinion dynamics models were proposed. 
In the continuous models, opinion values were in a certain 
range, with two endpoints representing two extreme opinions. 
One of the fundamental works of the continuous model was 
the DeGroot model [6], where users updated their opinions by 
averaging those of his/her neighbors. In the DeGroot model, 
it would reach the opinion consensus state where all agents 
held the same opinion. Hegselmann and Krause assumed that 
users would ignore opinions that were too far from theirs when 
updating opinions, and they found that users’ opinions would 
converge to different clusters at equilibrium [7]. The Friedkin- 
Johnsen (FJ) model incorporated users’ intrinsic beliefs and 
their stubbornness into the DeGroot model, and it was shown 
in [8], [9] that such stubbornness could cause opinion polar- 
ization where users held different opinions at the equilibrium. 
In addition, the FJ model was validated by small and medium 
group of social experiments [10]. 
Opinion Control. Based on the above opinion dynamics 
models, there were many works studying how to control public 
opinion. These works mainly focused on two objectives: the 
total opinion and the opinion polarization. The total opinion 
characterized the overall stance of the whole population. 
The work in [11] i rst studied the problem of maximizing 
total opinion in the discrete opinion dynamics models. They 
proposed a greedy algorithm to select a certain number of

“seed users” that can maximized the total opinion. The work 
in [12] further extended this algorithm to the continuous 
opinion dynamics models. The total opinion was optimized by 
controlling users’ stubbornness in [13] and by manipulating 
users’ intrinsic beliefs through persuasion in [14]. Opinion 
polarization quantif i ed the discrepancies among users’ opin- 
ions. The work in [15] minimized the opinion polarization by 
controlling users’ intrinsic believes. Furthermore, the works 
in [16] and [17] studied how network structure inf l uence the 
opinion polarization, respectively. Chen et al.. studied how 
to maximize the opinion polarization from the adversary’s 
perspective [18], [19]. Although the above algorithms could 
eff i ciently control the total opinion or the opinion polarization, 
they were developed based on the assumption that the network 
structure was static. That is, the connections and inf l uence 
strength among all users did not change during the opinion 
dynamics process. 
Dynamic Network Structure. In reality, the network struc- 
ture may change from time to time [20], [21]. The work 
in [22] proposed the preferential attachment algorithm that 
the newly added user were more likely to follow those with 
more followers. The preferential attachment could explain the 
power-law degree distribution of social networks in reality. 
Some works explored the data from social network platforms 
and analyzed how real social networks changed over time. 
The work in [23] showed that the recommending algorithms 
in social network platforms tended to connect users with 
similar interests together. This could further resulted in the filter bubble effect</div></div><div class="flex justify-between lg:block"><div class="text-xs flex items-center justify-center gap-1 self-center pt-2

Recently, there has been an increasing interest in studying opinion dynamics on dynamic networks. In the dynamic network scenario, the connections and influence strengths among users change over time, and users’ opinions may be affected by the changes. One line of work studied the opinion dynamics on temporal networks, where the network structure changes over time, and users’ opinions evolve along with the network structure [24], [25], [26]. Another line of work focused on the opinion dynamics on adaptive networks, where users can adaptively adjust their connections with their neighbors [27], [28]. The adaptive network models were shown to better capture the real-world dynamics of social networks. However, controlling the opinion dynamics on dynamic networks remains a challenging task, and more research is needed to develop effective opinion control strategies on dynamic networks.</p></div></div></div><div class="flex justify-between lg:block"><div class="text-xs flex items-center justify-center gap-1 self-center pt-2 !invisible"><button disabled="" class="dark:text-white disabled:text-gray-300 dark:disabled:text-gray-400"><svg stroke="currentColor" fill="none" stroke-width="1.5" viewBox="0 0 24 24" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" class="h-3 w-3" height="1em" width="1em" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg"><polyline points="15 18 9 12 15 6"></polyline></svg></button><span class="flex-grow flex-shrink-0">1 / 1</span><button disabled="" class="dark:text-white disabled:text-gray-300 dark:disabled:text-gray-400"><svg stroke="currentColor" fill="none" stroke-width="1.5" viewBox="0 0 24 24" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" class="h-3 w-3" height="1em" width="1em" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg"><polyline points="9 18 15 12 9 6"></polyline></svg></button></div><div class="text-gray-400 flex self-end lg:self-center justify-center mt-2 gap-2 md:gap-3 lg:gap-1 lg:absolute lg:top-0 lg:translate-x-full lg:right-0 lg:mt-0 lg:pl-2 visible"><button class="flex ml-auto gap-2 h-full w-full rounded-md p-1 hover:bg-gray-100 hover:text-gray-700 dark:text-gray-400 dark:hover:bg-gray-700 dark:hover:text-gray-200 disabled:dark:hover:text-gray-400"><svg stroke="currentColor" fill="none" stroke-width="2" viewBox="0 0 24 24" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" class="h-4 w-4" height="1em" width="1em" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg"><path d="M16 4h2a2 2 0 0 1 2 2v14a2 2 0 0 1-2 2H6a2 2 0 0 1-2-2V6a2 2 0 0 1 2-2h2"></path><rect x="8" y="2" width="8" height="4" rx="1" ry="1"></rect></svg></button><button class="p-1 rounded-md hover:bg-gray-100 hover:text-gray-700 dark:text-gray-400 dark:hover:bg-gray-700 dark:hover:text-gray-200 disabled:dark:hover:text-gray-400"><svg stroke="currentColor" fill="none" stroke-width="2" viewBox="0 0 24 24" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" class="h-4 w-4" height="1em" width="1em" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg"><path d="M14 9V5a3 3 0 0 0-3-3l-4 9v11h11.28a2 2 0 0 0 2-1.7l1.38-9a2 2 0 0 0-2-2.3zM7 22H4a2 2 0 0 1-2-2v-7a2 2 0 0 1 2-2h3"></path></svg></button><button class="p-1 rounded-md hover:bg-gray-100 hover:text-gray-700 dark:text-gray-400 dark:hover:bg-gray-700 dark:hover:text-gray-200 disabled:dark:hover:text-gray-400"><svg stroke="currentColor" fill="none" stroke-width="2" viewBox="0 0 24 24" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" class="h-4 w-4" height="1em" width="1em" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg"><path d="M10 15v4a3 3 0 0 0 3 3l4-9V2H5.72a2 2 0 0 0-2 1.7l-1.38 9a2 2 0 0 0 2 2.3zm7-13h2.67A2.31 2.31 0 0 1 22 4v7a2.31 2.31 0 0 1-2.33 2H17"></path></svg></button></div></div></div></div></div><div class="group w-full text-gray-800 dark:text-gray-100 border-b border-black/10 dark:border-gray-900/50 dark:bg-gray-800"><div class="text-base gap-4 md:gap-6 md:max-w-2xl lg:max-w-xl xl:max-w-3xl p-4 md:py-6 flex lg:px-0 m-auto"><div class="w-[30px] flex flex-col relative items-end"><div class="relative flex"><span style="box-sizing: border-box; display: inline-block; overflow: hidden; width: initial; height: initial; background: none; opacity: 1; border: 0px; margin: 0px; padding: 0px; position: relative; max-width: 100%;"><span style="box-sizing: border-box; display: block; width: initial; height: initial; background: none; opacity: 1; border: 0px; margin: 0px; padding: 0px; max-width: 100%;"><img alt="" aria-hidden="true" src="data:image/svg+xml,%3csvg%20xmlns=%27http://www.w3.org/2000/svg%27%20version=%271.1%27%20width=%2738%27%20height=%2738%27/%3e" style="display: block; max-width: 100%; width: initial; height: initial; background: none; opacity: 1; border: 0px; margin: 0px; padding: 0px;"></span><img alt="User" src="https://chat.openai.com/_next/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Flh3.googleusercontent.com%2Fa%2FAGNmyxbfUJGaUXxADgtF19b5ZhmrVKp8-tY9hQf2Jfmp%3Ds96-c&amp;w=96&amp;q=75" decoding="async" data-nimg="intrinsic" class="rounded-sm" style="position: absolute; inset: 0px; box-sizing: border-box; padding: 0px; border: none; margin: auto; display: block; width: 0px; height: 0px; min-width: 100%; max-width: 100%; min-height: 100%; max-height: 100%;" width="30" height="30"></span></div></div><div class="relative flex w-[calc(100%-50px)] flex-col gap-1 md:gap-3 lg:w-[calc(100%-115px)]"><div class="flex flex-grow flex-col gap-3"><div class="min-h-[20px] flex flex-col items-start gap-4 whitespace-pre-wrap break-words">VII. CONCLUSION 
In this work, we consider the adversarial network perturba- 
tion, where the adversary can let some attackers spread their 
extreme opinions to target users. We theoreticaly analyze such 
adversarial network perturbation’s inf l uence on the network’s 
total opinion. From the adversary’s perspective, we analyze the 
optimal strategy to choose the attackers and the target users, so 
that the total opinion is maximized. Then, from the network 
defender’s perspective, we formualte a Stackelberg game to 
minimize the total opinion under such adversarial network 
perturbation, and device an projected subgradient algorithm 
to solve the fromulated game. Simulations on real social 
networks validate our analysis of the network perturbation and 
the effectiveness of the proposed opinion control algorithm.</div></div><div class="flex justify-between lg:block"><div class="text-xs flex items-center justify-center gap-1 self-center pt-2

Abstract 
Variational auto-encoders (VAEs) are one of the most popular approaches to deep 
generative modeling. Despite their success, images generated by VAEs are known 
to suffer from blurriness, due to a highly unrealistic modeling assumption that the 
conditional data distributionp(x|z)can be approximated as an isotropic Gaussian. 
In this work we introduce a principled approach to modeling the conditional data 
distributionp(x|z)by 
incorporating a diffusion model. We show that it is possible 
to create a VAE-like deep latent variable model without making the Gaussian 
assumption onp(x|z)or 
even training a decoder network. A trained encoder and an 
unconditional diffusion model can be combined via Bayes’ rule for score functions 
to obtain an expressive model forp(x|z). 
Our approach avoids making strong 
assumptions on the parametric form ofp(x|z), 
and thus allows to signif i cantly 
improve the performance of VAEs. 
1Introduction 
Variational Autoencoders (VAEs) Kingma und Welling (2013) have proven to be a powerful tool 
for unsupervised learning, allowing for the eff i cient modeling and generation of complex data 
distributions. However, VAEs have important limitations, including diff i culty in capturing the 
underlying structure of high-dimensional data and generating blurry images Zhao u.a. (2017). These 
problems emerge due to an unrealistic modeling assumption that the conditional data distribution 
p(x|z)can 
be approximated as a Gaussian distribution. Moreover, instead of sampling fromp(x|z) 
the model simply outputs the mean of the distribution, which results in an undesirable smoothing 
effect. In this work we propose to relax this limiting assumption by modelingp(x|z)in 
a l exible way 
by leveraging the capabilities of diffusion models. We show that an encoder network modelingp(z|x) 
can be easily combined with an unconditional diffusion model trained onp(x)to yield a model for 
p(x|z). 
Diffusion models Sohl-Dickstein u.a. (2015); Ho u.a. (2020) have recently emerged as a promising 
technique for generative modeling, which uses the time reversal of a diffusion process, to estimate

the data distributionp(x). Diffusion models proved to be incredibly successful in capturing complex 
high-dimensional distributions achieving state-of-the-art performance in many tasks such as image 
synthesis Dhariwal und Nichol (2021) and audio generation Kong u.a. (2020). Recent works show 
that diffusion models can capture effectively complex conditional probability distributions and apply 
them to solve problems such as in-painting, super resolution or image-to-image translation Batzolis 
u.a. (2022); Saharia u.a. (2021). 
Motivated by the success of diffusion models in learning conditional distributions, recent works 
Preechakul u.a. (2022); Yang und Mandt (2023) have explored applications ofconditionaldiffusion 
models as a decoders in a VAE framework by training them to learnp(x|z). 
We improve upon this 
line of research by showing that the diffusion decoder is obsolete. Instead one can combine the 
encoder with anunconditionaldiffusion model via the Bayes’ rule for score functions to obtain a 
model for p(x|z). This approach has several important advantages 
1.It avoids making unrealistic Gaussian assumption onp(x|z). 
Therefore signif i cantly im- 
proves the performance compared to original VAE avoiding blurry samples. 
2.Since the diffusion model used in our approach isunconditional, i.e. it does not depend on 
the latent factor, our method can leverage existing powerful pre-trained diffusion models 
and combine them with any encoder network. Moreover the diffusion component can be 
always easily replaced for a better model without the need to retrain the encoder. This is 
in contrast to prior approaches which usedconditionaldiffusion models, which have to be 
trained specif i cally to a given encoder. 
3.By using the Bayes’ rule for score functions we can separate training the prior from train- 
ing the encoder and improve the training dynamics. This allows our method to achieve 
performance superior to approaches based on conditional diffusion models. 
Moreover we derive a novel lower-bound on the data likelihoodp(x), which can be used to optimise 
the encoder in this framework.</div></div><div class="flex justify-between lg:block"><div class="text-xs flex items-center justify-center gap-1 self-center pt-2 !invisible"><button disabled=""

LaMD: Latent Motion Diffusion for Video Generation
Yaosi Hu, Zhenzhong Chen, Chong Luo

Generating coherent and natural movement is the key challenge in video generation. This research proposes to condense video generation into a problem of motion generation, to improve the expressiveness of motion and make video generation more manageable. This can be achieved by breaking down the video generation process into latent motion generation and video reconstruction. We present a latent motion diffusion (LaMD) framework, which consists of a motion-decomposed video autoencoder and a diffusion-based motion generator, to implement this idea. Through careful design, the motion-decomposed video autoencoder can compress patterns in movement into a concise latent motion representation. Meanwhile, the diffusion-based motion generator is able to efficiently generate realistic motion on a continuous latent space under multi-modal conditions, at a cost that is similar to that of image diffusion models. Results show that LaMD generates high-quality videos with a wide range of motions, from stochastic dynamics to highly controllable movements. It achieves new state-of-the-art performance on benchmark datasets, including BAIR, Landscape and CATER-GENs, for Image-to-Video (I2V) and Text-Image-to-Video (TI2V) generation</div></div><div

Abstract 
Many applications can benef i t from personalized image 
generation models, including image enhancement, video 
conferences, just to name a few. Existing works achieved 
personalization by i ne-tuning one model for each person. 
While being successful, this approach incurs additional 
computation and storage overhead for each new identity. 
Furthermore, it usually expects tens or hundreds of exam- 
ples per identity to achieve the best performance. To over- 
come these challenges, we propose an encoder-based ap- 
proach for personalization. We learn an identity encoder 
which can extract an identity representation from a set of 
reference images of a subject, together with a diffusion gen- 
erator that can generate new images of the subject condi- 
tioned on the identity representation. Once being trained, 
the model can be used to generate images of arbitrary iden- 
tities given a few examples even if the model hasn’t been 
trained on the identity. Our approach greatly reduces the 
overhead for personalized image generation and is more 
applicable in many potential applications. Empirical re- 
sults show that our approach consistently outperforms ex- 
isting i ne-tuning based approach in both image generation 
and reconstruction, and the outputs is preferred by users 
more than 95% of the time compared with the best perform- 
ing baseline. 
1. Introduction 
Recent years have seen a tremendous success in the 
task of face generation.The emerge of VAEs [34, 7], 
GANs [4, 13, 15, 16, 14], and diffusion models [12, 29] has 
enabled unlimited possibility in synthesizing faces with var- 
ious content given different forms of conditions. However, 
models trained on generic facial images are often incapable 
of generating images of a specif i c identity, which is a highly 
desirable feature in practical uses. In order to achieve this, 
the model must understand the appearance of the desired 
identity, which are likely not included in the training set. 
Therefore, a prevalent approach [26, 9, 30, 24] is to i ne- 
tune a pre-trained synthesis model using multiple images 
capturing the corresponding face. The i ne-tuned models

Figure 1. Given reference images of a subject, our goal is to learn 
an identity encoder and a diffusion generator such that the iden- 
tity encoder can extract an identity representation from the refer- 
ences, and the diffusion generator can generate diverse images of 
the subject conditioning on the representation. The same model 
can be used to generate images of different subjects given differ- 
ent references, and the identity encoder can extracts a high-quality 
representation from just a few or even a single image. 
have been shown capable of synthesizing personalized im- 
ages with diverse content. 
Despite the simplicity and remarkable performance, the 
applicability of the aforementioned i ne-tuning paradigm is 
inevitably limited by the need of lengthy optimization pro- 
cess. Specif i cally, these methods require model i ne-tuning 
for each identity, which takes minutes to hours to complete. 
As a result, they are infeasible in cases that require fast re- 
sponse, such as interactive editing. More importantly, they 
often require up to hundreds of images for i ne-tuning due 
to the identity-agnostic nature of the pre-trained models. 
Furthermore, the storage cost increases with the number of 
identities, essentially prohibiting the methods to generalize 
to arbitrary identities. Therefore, a framework that does not 
require identity-specif i c i ne-tuning is necessary.

We take the i rst step to explore the possibility of de- 
veloping a feed-forward framework for personalized face 
generation.Contrary to existing methods that obtain an 
identity-specif i c embedding through prompt and model tun- 
ing, we employ a learnable encoder to generate identity 
embeddings from input images provided by the user. See 
Fig. 1. Our method, termed identity encoder, obtains an em- 
bedding without any optimization, achieving up to 29 times 
speedup over existing methods. 
While our method is conceptually simple, the acquisi- 
tion of an effective encoder remains formidable. Specif- 
ically, directly training the encoder and diffusion model 
jointly leads to degenerated outputs, resulting in images 
with no variations. In this work, we explore the keys in 
training to achieve balance between identity preservation 
and output diversity. First, during training, we impose an 
identity-preservation constraint on the learned embeddings, 
in which the convex hull formed by the embeddings from 
thesamepersonmustrepresentthesameidentity. Thisises- 
sential in forcing the model to learn an identity-specif i c em- 
bedding that preserve variations among outputs. Second, to 
further improve identity preservation, we introduce a soft- 
nearest neighbor identity loss, which localizes the embed- 
dings obtained from the same identity. Third, to alleviate 
the lack of identity-aware datasets, we propose an identity- 
agnostic joint training scheme. Specif i cally, in addition to 
the identity-preservation constraint, we embrace the con- 
ventional large-scale face datasets FFHQ [15] to guide the 
encoder to learn a meaningful embedding through recon- 
struction. In this case, the number of identities perceived by 
the model increases dramatically, signif i cantly boosting the 
output quality and the generalizability. With the aforemen- 
tioned components, our identity encoder is able to produce 
personalized embeddings with as few as one image, without 
any test-time optimization. 
In addition to generation, our solution enables the possi- 
bilityofmultipledownstreamtasksthatrequirepersonaliza- 
tion. In particular, we demonstrate through experiments our 
method can be extended to personalized super-resolution 
and inpainting, achieving enhanced identity preservation 
without harming output quality.Empirical results show 
that our method consistently outperforms prior i ne-tuning 
based approach in terms of image quality, identity preser- 
vation, and personalized reconstruction, and the outputs of 
our model is preferred by raters more than 95% of the time 
compared with the best performing baseline. 
As image synthesis becomes ubiquitous, the increasing 
demand of personalized synthesis is inevitable. There is an 
urge to develop a practical framework that eff i ciently gener- 
ates images with customized identities. We show that with 
proper designs, it is possible to obtain generalizable em- 
beddings without the needs of time-consuming optimiza- 
tion and storage of multiple models, signif i cantly reducing 
the burdens in the user end.

Face Generation and Editing. The emerge of high-quality 
datasets [13, 15, 17] and sophisticated generative models, 
such as VAEs [34, 7], GANs [4, 13, 15, 16, 14], and dif- 
fusion models [12, 29], has enabled unlimited possibility 
in the i elds of face generation and editing.In particu- 
lar, training on the high-quality FFHQ [15] dataset, Style- 
GANs [13, 15, 16, 14] obtain unprecedented performance 
with a novel style-based architecture, where a latent code 
is used to control the characteristics of the generated faces. 
Diffusion models [12, 29] synthesize faces through itera- 
tively denoise the intermediate outputs, starting from a stan- 
dard Gaussian noise.Instead of training with two com- 
peting objectives, diffusion models are trained with a sin- 
gle denoising objective, thus generally possessing better 
training stability. Editing is achieved usually by manipu- 
lating the latent space. For example, StyleGAN-based ap- 
proaches [1, 31, 19, 32, 20, 33, 28, 2, 10] edit the attributes 
of an image, such as smile and age, by obtaining an editing 
direction in the latent space. Analogous to the StyleGAN 
paradigm, Diffusion Autoencoder [27] learns an additional 
encoder to generate an embedding, which is conditioned by 
the diffusion model for generation. Similarly, editing can be 
achieved by manipulating the latent embeddings produced</div></div><div class="flex justify-between lg:block"><div class="text-xs flex items-center justify-center gap-1 self-center pt-2

training to achieve balance between identity preservation 
and output diversity. First, during training, we impose an 
identity-preservation constraint on the learned embeddings, 
in which the convex hull formed by the embeddings from 
thesamepersonmustrepresentthesameidentity. Thisises- 
sential in forcing the model to learn an identity-specif i c em- 
bedding that preserve variations among outputs. Second, to 
further improve identity preservation, we introduce a soft- 
nearest neighbor identity loss, which localizes the embed- 
dings obtained from the same identity. Third, to alleviate 
the lack of identity-aware datasets, we propose an identity- 
agnostic joint training scheme. Specif i cally, in addition to 
the identity-preservation constraint, we embrace the con- 
ventional large-scale face datasets FFHQ [15] to guide the 
encoder to learn a meaningful embedding through recon- 
struction. In this case, the number of identities perceived by 
the model increases dramatically, signif i cantly boosting the 
output quality and the generalizability.</div></div><div class="flex justify-between lg:block"><div class="text-xs flex items-center justify-center gap-1 self-center pt-2 !invisible"><button

This approach increases the number of identities perceived by the model, significantly boosting the output quality and generalizability.</p><p>Overall, these techniques aim to balance identity preservation and output diversity, which can improve the performance of the model in various applications, such as face recognition and generation.</p></div></div></div><div class="flex justify-between lg:block"><div class="text-xs flex items-center justify-center gap-1 self-center pt-2 !invisible"><button disabled="" class="dark:text-white disabled:text-gray-300 dark:disabled:text-gray-400"><svg stroke="currentColor" fill="none" stroke-width="1.5" viewBox="0 0 24 24" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" class="h-3 w-3" height="1em" width="1em" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg"><polyline points="15 18 9 12 15 6"></polyline></svg></button><span class="flex-grow flex-shrink-0">1 / 1</span><button disabled="" class="dark:text-white disabled:text-gray-300 dark:disabled:text-gray-400"><svg stroke="currentColor" fill="none" stroke-width="1.5" viewBox="0 0 24 24" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" class="h-3 w-3" height="1em" width="1em" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg"><polyline points="9 18 15 12 9 6"></polyline></svg></button></div><div class="text-gray-400 flex self-end lg:self-center justify-center mt-2 gap-2 md:gap-3 lg:gap-1 lg:absolute lg:top-0 lg:translate-x-full lg:right-0 lg:mt-0 lg:pl-2 visible"><button class="flex ml-auto gap-2 h-full w-full rounded-md p-1 hover:bg-gray-100 hover:text-gray-700 dark:text-gray-400 dark:hover:bg-gray-700 dark:hover:text-gray-200 disabled:dark:hover:text-gray-400"><svg stroke="currentColor" fill="none" stroke-width="2" viewBox="0 0 24 24" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" class="h-4 w-4" height="1em" width="1em" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg"><path d="M16 4h2a2 2 0 0 1 2 2v14a2 2 0 0 1-2 2H6a2 2 0 0 1-2-2V6a2 2 0 0 1 2-2h2"></path><rect x="8" y="2" width="8" height="4" rx="1" ry="1"></rect></svg></button><button class="p-1 rounded-md hover:bg-gray-100 hover:text-gray-700 dark:text-gray-400 dark:hover:bg-gray-700 dark:hover:text-gray-200 disabled:dark:hover:text-gray-400"><svg stroke="currentColor" fill="none" stroke-width="2" viewBox="0 0 24 24" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" class="h-4 w-4" height="1em" width="1em" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg"><path d="M14 9V5a3 3 0 0 0-3-3l-4 9v11h11.28a2 2 0 0 0 2-1.7l1.38-9a2 2 0 0 0-2-2.3zM7 22H4a2 2 0 0 1-2-2v-7a2 2 0 0 1 2-2h3"></path></svg></button><button class="p-1 rounded-md hover:bg-gray-100 hover:text-gray-700 dark:text-gray-400 dark:hover:bg-gray-700 dark:hover:text-gray-200 disabled:dark:hover:text-gray-400"><svg stroke="currentColor" fill="none" stroke-width="2" viewBox="0 0 24 24" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" class="h-4 w-4" height="1em" width="1em" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg"><path d="M10 15v4a3 3 0 0 0 3 3l4-9V2H5.72a2 2 0 0 0-2 1.7l-1.38 9a2 2 0 0 0 2 2.3zm7-13h2.67A2.31 2.31 0 0 1 22 4v7a2.31 2.31 0 0 1-2.33 2H17"></path></svg></button></div></div></div></div></div><div class="group w-full text-gray-800 dark:text-gray-100 border-b border-black/10 dark:border-gray-900/50 dark:bg-gray-800"><div class="text-base gap-4 md:gap-6 md:max-w-2xl lg:max-w-xl xl:max-w-3xl p-4 md:py-6 flex lg:px-0 m-auto"><div class="w-[30px] flex flex-col relative items-end"><div class="relative flex"><span style="box-sizing: border-box; display: inline-block; overflow: hidden; width: initial; height: initial; background: none; opacity: 1; border: 0px; margin: 0px; padding: 0px; position: relative; max-width: 100%;"><span style="box-sizing: border-box; display: block; width: initial; height: initial; background: none; opacity: 1; border: 0px; margin: 0px; padding: 0px; max-width: 100%;"><img alt="" aria-hidden="true" src="data:image/svg+xml,%3csvg%20xmlns=%27http://www.w3.org/2000/svg%27%20version=%271.1%27%20width=%2738%27%20height=%2738%27/%3e" style="display: block; max-width: 100%; width: initial; height: initial; background: none; opacity: 1; border: 0px; margin: 0px; padding: 0px;"></span><img alt="User" src="https://chat.openai.com/_next/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Flh3.googleusercontent.com%2Fa%2FAGNmyxbfUJGaUXxADgtF19b5ZhmrVKp8-tY9hQf2Jfmp%3Ds96-c&amp;w=96&amp;q=75" decoding="async" data-nimg="intrinsic" class="rounded-sm" style="position: absolute; inset: 0px; box-sizing: border-box; padding: 0px; border: none; margin: auto; display: block; width: 0px; height: 0px; min-width: 100%; max-width: 100%; min-height: 100%; max-height: 100%;" width="30" height="30"></span></div></div><div class="relative flex w-[calc(100%-50px)] flex-col gap-1 md:gap-3 lg:w-[calc(100%-115px)]"><div class="flex flex-grow flex-col gap-3"><div class="min-h-[20px] flex flex-col items-start gap-4 whitespace-pre-wrap break-words">Face Generation and Editing. The emerge of high-quality 
datasets [13, 15, 17] and sophisticated generative models, 
such as VAEs [34, 7], GANs [4, 13, 15, 16, 14], and dif- 
fusion models [12, 29], has enabled unlimited possibility 
in the i elds of face generation and editing.In particu- 
lar, training on the high-quality FFHQ [15] dataset, Style- 
GANs [13, 15, 16, 14] obtain unprecedented performance 
with a novel style-based architecture, where a latent code 
is used to control the characteristics of the generated faces. 
Diffusion models [12, 29] synthesize faces through itera- 
tively denoise the intermediate outputs, starting from a stan- 
dard Gaussian noise.Instead of training with two com- 
peting objectives, diffusion models are trained with a sin- 
gle denoising objective, thus generally possessing better 
training stability. Editing is achieved usually by manipu- 
lating the latent space. For example, StyleGAN-based ap- 
proaches [1, 31, 19, 32, 20, 33, 28, 2, 10] edit the attributes 
of an image, such as smile and age, by obtaining an editing 
direction in the latent space. Analogous to the StyleGAN 
paradigm, Diffusion Autoencoder [27] learns an additional 
encoder to generate an embedding, which is conditioned by 
the diffusion model for generation. Similarly, editing can be 
achieved by manipulating the latent embeddings produced 
by the encoder. In this work, instead of controlling the at- 
tributes of faces, we are interested in controlling the identity 
of the generated faces. Specif i cally, we follow the pipeline 
ofDiffusionAutoencoderandexploretheconstructionofan 
effective identity-specif i c latent code for personalized face 
generation. 
Personalized Face Generation. Personalized face genera- 
tion imposes an additional constraint that the model should 
generate faces of the same identity. This is usually achieved 
by i ne-tuning a pre-trained model with multiple images 
provided by the user.Specif i cally, MyStyle [26] adopts 
a pre-trained StyleGAN, and then optimizes the object la- 
tent code, followed by i ne-tuning the model with the la- 
tent codes. By using up to hundreds of images for test-time 
optimization, MyStyle produces promising outputs. In this 
work, we take one step further and consider methods that 
do not require test-time optimization and need as few as 
one image for personalized face generation. This is of great 
value as one can bypass the computation and storage over- 
head incurred from model i ne-tuning, enhancing the prac- 
ticality of personalalied face generation.

sonalized image generation using diffusion model.We

Finally, we describe the details of
our identity encoder and the training procedure.</p><p>Diffusion Models and Diffusion Autoencoder:
Diffusion models [12, 29] are a class of generative models
that synthesize data by iteratively denoising intermediate
outputs of a standard Gaussian noise through a sequence
of diffusion steps. In contrast to GANs, diffusion models
are trained with a single denoising objective and possess
better stability. Diffusion autoencoder [27] combines the
diffusion model with an additional encoder network to
generate an embedding conditioned on the diffusion pro-
cess. This embedding is then used to generate the final out-
put with the diffusion process.</p><p>Problem Definition and Overview:
Given a single image of a person, we aim to generate
a set of personalized images that preserve the identity of
the person. To achieve this, we propose an identity encoder
that encodes the identity information of the input image in-
to a latent code. This code is then used as the input to the
diffusion autoencoder for personalized image generation.
To ensure that the generated images belong to the same
identity, we enforce an identity-preservation constraint on
the learned embeddings during training.</p><p>Identity Encoder:
Our identity encoder is a simple yet effective network that
consists of several convolutional layers followed by a global
average pooling layer. The resulting feature map is then
fed into a fully connected layer that outputs a latent code.
During training, we impose an identity-preservation con-
straint on the learned embeddings by enforcing that the
convex hull formed by the embeddings from the same person
represents the same identity.</p><p>Training Procedure:
We train our model using the diffusion autoencoder with
the identity encoder. We use the FFHQ dataset [15] for
training the diffusion model and the identity encoder. We
follow the diffusion autoencoder training procedure de-
scribed in [27] and use the Adam optimizer with a learning
rate of 0.0002. We train our model for 1 million iterations
with a batch size of 16. During training, we use the soft-
nearest neighbor identity loss [2] to further improve identity
preservation. We also use the reconstruction loss to ensure
that the model learns a meaningful embedding.</p></div></div></div><div class="flex justify-between lg:block"><div class="text-xs flex items-center justify-center gap-1 self-center pt-2 !invisible"><button disabled="" class="dark:text-white disabled:text-gray-300 dark:disabled:text-gray-400"><svg stroke="currentColor" fill="none" stroke-width="1.5" viewBox="0 0 24 24" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" class="h-3 w-3" height="1em" width="1em" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg"><polyline points="15 18 9 12 15 6"></polyline></svg></button><span class="flex-grow flex-shrink-0">1 / 1</span><button disabled="" class="dark:text-white disabled:text-gray-300 dark:disabled:text-gray-400"><svg stroke="currentColor" fill="none" stroke-width="1.5" viewBox="0 0 24 24" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" class="h-3 w-3" height="1em" width="1em" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg"><polyline points="9 18 15 12 9 6"></polyline></svg></button></div><div class="text-gray-400 flex self-end lg:self-center justify-center mt-2 gap-2 md:gap-3 lg:gap-1 lg:absolute lg:top-0 lg:translate-x-full lg:right-0 lg:mt-0 lg:pl-2 visible"><button class="flex ml-auto gap-2 h-full w-full rounded-md p-1 hover:bg-gray-100 hover:text-gray-700 dark:text-gray-400 dark:hover:bg-gray-700 dark:hover:text-gray-200 disabled:dark:hover:text-gray-400"><svg stroke="currentColor" fill="none" stroke-width="2" viewBox="0 0 24 24" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" class="h-4 w-4" height="1em" width="1em" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg"><path d="M16 4h2a2 2 0 0 1 2 2v14a2 2 0 0 1-2 2H6a2 2 0 0 1-2-2V6a2 2 0 0 1 2-2h2"></path><rect x="8" y="2" width="8" height="4" rx="1" ry="1"></rect></svg></button><button class="p-1 rounded-md hover:bg-gray-100 hover:text-gray-700 dark:text-gray-400 dark:hover:bg-gray-700 dark:hover:text-gray-200 disabled:dark:hover:text-gray-400"><svg stroke="currentColor" fill="none" stroke-width="2" viewBox="0 0 24 24" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" class="h-4 w-4" height="1em" width="1em" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg"><path d="M14 9V5a3 3 0 0 0-3-3l-4 9v11h11.28a2 2 0 0 0 2-1.7l1.38-9a2 2 0 0 0-2-2.3zM7 22H4a2 2 0 0 1-2-2v-7a2 2 0 0 1 2-2h3"></path></svg></button><button class="p-1 rounded-md hover:bg-gray-100 hover:text-gray-700 dark:text-gray-400 dark:hover:bg-gray-700 dark:hover:text-gray-200 disabled:dark:hover:text-gray-400"><svg stroke="currentColor" fill="none" stroke-width="2" viewBox="0 0 24 24" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" class="h-4 w-4" height="1em" width="1em" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg"><path d="M10 15v4a3 3 0 0 0 3 3l4-9V2H5.72a2 2 0 0 0-2 1.7l-1.38 9a2 2 0 0 0 2 2.3zm7-13h2.67A2.31 2.31 0 0 1 22 4v7a2.31 2.31 0 0 1-2.33 2H17"></path></svg></button></div></div></div></div></div><div class="group w-full text-gray-800 dark:text-gray-100 border-b border-black/10 dark:border-gray-900/50 dark:bg-gray-800"><div class="text-base gap-4 md:gap-6 md:max-w-2xl lg:max-w-xl xl:max-w-3xl p-4 md:py-6 flex lg:px-0 m-auto"><div class="w-[30px] flex flex-col relative items-end"><div class="relative flex"><span style="box-sizing: border-box; display: inline-block; overflow: hidden; width: initial; height: initial; background: none; opacity: 1; border: 0px; margin: 0px; padding: 0px; position: relative; max-width: 100%;"><span style="box-sizing: border-box; display: block; width: initial; height: initial; background: none; opacity: 1; border: 0px; margin: 0px; padding: 0px; max-width: 100%;"><img alt="" aria-hidden="true" src="data:image/svg+xml,%3csvg%20xmlns=%27http://www.w3.org/2000/svg%27%20version=%271.1%27%20width=%2738%27%20height=%2738%27/%3e" style="display: block; max-width: 100%; width: initial; height: initial; background: none; opacity: 1; border: 0px; margin: 0px; padding: 0px;"></span><img alt="User" src="https://chat.openai.com/_next/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Flh3.googleusercontent.com%2Fa%2FAGNmyxbfUJGaUXxADgtF19b5ZhmrVKp8-tY9hQf2Jfmp%3Ds96-c&amp;w=96&amp;q=75" decoding="async" data-nimg="intrinsic" class="rounded-sm" style="position: absolute; inset: 0px; box-sizing: border-box; padding: 0px; border: none; margin: auto; display: block; width: 0px; height: 0px; min-width: 100%; max-width: 100%; min-height: 100%; max-height: 100%;" width="30" height="30"></span></div></div><div class="relative flex w-[calc(100%-50px)] flex-col gap-1 md:gap-3 lg:w-[calc(100%-115px)]"><div class="flex flex-grow flex-col gap-3"><div class="min-h-[20px] flex flex-col items-start gap-4 whitespace-pre-wrap break-words">tity encoder.

3.1. Preliminary 
Our method is built on top of diffusion model and diffu- 
sion autoencoder. This section provides the background of 
our approach. 
Diffusion ModelsDiffusion process is def i ned as a 
Markov chain of length T that gradually inserts Gaussian 
noise to the data with a variance schedule {βt}T 
t=1. Let xt 
be the latent at timestep t of the process, their distributions 
can be written as 
q(xt|xt−1) = N(xt; p 
1 − βtxt−1,βtI). 
In cases when βtis small, the distribution has the following 
closed-form solution [12]: 
q(xt|x0) = N(xt; √¯ α tx0,(1 − ¯ αt)I), 
where αt= 1−βtand 
¯ αt= Qt 
s=1αs. Here x0is the target 
data with distribution q(x0). To model the target distribu- 
tion, Ho et al. [12] propose to learn a mapping ?θ(·) that es- 
timates the noise ?tadded to x0to produce xt. Specif i cally, 
the mapping is optimized with the following loss function: 
L = ||?θ(xt,t) − ?t||, 
where ?θis instantiate by a dense prediction model such as 
a U-Net. During inference, samples in the target distribu- 
tion are obtained through reverse diffusion process that iter- 
atively removes the noise using the trained noise estimator, 
starting from a pure Gaussian noise xT∼ N(0,I). 
Diffusion AutoencoderMimicking the latent space ma- 
nipulation in StyleGAN [13, 16, 14], Diffusion Autoen- 
coder [27] employs an auxiliary encoder to discover a 
meaningful latent space for image editing in the diffusion 
model paradigm. Specif i cally, a learnable encoder is used 
to produce an embedding as a condition, and the diffusion 
model acts as a decoder to produce output images given the 
conditions. The entire autoencoder is jointly trained with 
the following loss: 
L = ||?θ(xt,t,zsem) − ?t||, 
where zsemrepresents the semantic embedding learned by 
the encoder. For unconditional sampling, an additional dif- 
fusion model ?ω(·) is trained to sample zsem.

Identity Embedding 
Figure 2.Instead of learning an one-to-one mapping between 
the embedding and image space (top panel), the identity encoder 
learns a set-to-set mapping. Different combinations of reference 
images all correspond to the identity representation of the same 
subject, and each identity embedding maps to all possible images 
of the subject (bottom panel). 
3.2. Overview 
We def i ne our problem as follows. Let Pibe the distribu- 
tion of all images of subject siand Yi= {yj 
i ∈ Pi}N 
j=1be 
a set of reference images of the subject. Our goal is to learn 
an encoder E together with an image generator G such that 
the generator is able to synthesize images of the same sub- 
ject conditioned on the identity representation extracted by 
the encoder from Yi: G(?,E(Yi)) ∼ Pi,(1) 
where ? is a random noise. Note that G and E do notdepend 
on the subject, meaning that the same encoder and genera- 
tor are used to generate images of an arbitrary subject given 
example images. We further impose two requirements on 
the model: 1) it should generalize to identities unseen dur- 
ing training, and 2) it should work with a small number of 
references for each identity (i.e., N &lt;10). 
In this work, we adopt a diffusion model as the gener- 
ator due to its promising results achieved in recent works. 
In particular, we build the generator and encoder based on 
Diffusion Autoencoder [27], which also learns a diffusion 
decoder jointly with an image encoder. 
Unlike Diffusion Autoencoder, which conditions only on 
a single image, our goal is to learn a model conditioned 
on a set of reference images to improve robustness and 
capture intra-identity variations. Moreover, the proposed 
method should</div></div><div class="flex justify-between lg:block"><div class="text-xs flex items-center justify-center gap-1 self-center pt-2 !invisible"><button disabled="" class="dark:text-white

Identity Encoder 
Given the proposed approach, we apply the follow- 
ing training strategies to strike a balance between identity 
preservation, output diversity, and image quality. 
Random average embeddingIn our approach, the map- 
ping between the identity embedding and the output image 
is essentially a many-to-many mapping, since 1) an identity 
embedding should correspond to multiple images of a sub- 
ject with different appearances, and 2) an image could con- 
tribute to different embeddings due to the average pooling 
of different references. See Fig. 2. Therefore, directly ap- 
plying Diffusion Autoencoder does not yield good results, 
as its training process intrinsically leads to a one-to-one 
mapping. Furthermore, without being trained on average 
embeddings, the model is unable to produce high-quality 
outputs when a subject’s average embedding changes from 
one set of reference images to another. 
To encourage such a many-to-many mapping, we adopt 
a random-weighted average embedding as the condition for 
the generator during training. Specif i cally, given N images 
of a person {yj i} 
N 
j=1, we use 
˜ zi= 
N X 
j=1 
wjEnc(yj i) (3) 
as the condition embedding for the diffusion model dur- 
ing training.Here wj∈[0.0,1.0] are randomly sampled 
weights with the constraint P 
wj=1. The model is trained 
to reconstruct each yj 
i using the same embedding ˜ zi. In 
other words, we require that each point within the convex 
hull of {Enc(yj i)} 
N 
j=1is a plausible identity embedding for 
subject i, and the diffusion generator should generate all im- 
ages of the person conditioned on an identity embedding in 
the convex hull. Hence, we relax the one-to-one constraint 
in Diffusion Autoencoder. 
Identity LossWhile training with mean embeddings pro- 
motes many-to-many mapping, it could lead to embedding 
degeneration blurring the boundaries between identities. To 
Figure 3. To encourage the identity representation to ignore intra- 
identity variations and focus on inter-identity variations, we im- 
pose an identity loss on the identity representation during training. 
It encourages / discourage the inter-identity / intra-identity repre- 
sentation distances and helps learn a representation that separates 
different identities. 
avoid this caveat, we encourage the encoder to separate dif- 
ferent identities in the embedding space as shown in Fig. 3. 
This is achieved by adding a soft nearest-neighbor loss [8] 
to the encoder output. Specif i cally, let {zk}K 
k=1 be the en- 
coder output within a batch, and skbe their corresponding 
identity labels, we minimize the following:

Multi-task LearningSince both the formation of average 
embedding and the identity require identity information, the 
model can only be trained on datasets with identity labels. 
This greatly limits the amount of available training data, 
which is amongst the most critical components towards the 
success of generative models. 
To overcome this problem, we apply multi-task learning 
during training. Specif i cally, we train the model on images 
both with and without identity labels. For images with iden- 
tity labels, the model is trained with average embeddings 
and the identity loss described above. For images without 
identity labels, we treat the model as a Diffusion Autoen- 
coder and reconstruct the image conditioned on the embed- 
ding of the target image. Our multi-task learning scheme 
effectively increases the training data size, boosting output 
quality. Therefore, the i nal training loss is 
L = Ldiff(Iid) + α1Lid(Iid) + α2Ldiff(Ig),(5) 
where Ldiffis the standard diffusion loss and Iidand Ig 
are images with and without identity information respec- 
tively. In practice, half of the images in a training batch are 
identity-agnostic, and we use α1= α2= 0.01. 
We hypothesize that reconstruction is an easier task than 
identity representation extraction, and curriculum learn- 
ing [3] could be applied to improve the effectiveness of the 
encoder. To instantiate this, we randomly drop the identity 
information with probability p, with p decreasing linearly 
from 1.0 to 0.05. In this case, the encoder learns meaningful 
representations through reconstruction, and gradually distill 
identity information through our delicate training designs. 
3.4. Personalized Conditional Generation 
Besides unconditional generation for a subject (i.e., con- 
ditioned only on the identity), many potential applications 
of generative models require conditional generation. For 
example, when using generative models for image enhance- 
ment like super-resolution, the low-resolution image should 
be taken as an additional condition. In this work, we in- 
troduce an extension of our framework for accommodating 
extra conditions. 
We start with a trained personalized generation model. A 
new condition encoder is used to extract a feature map from 
the conditional image (or other formats of conditions). The 
feature map is then injected to the generation model through 
an attention layer inserted into the diffusion generator. This 
layer computes the cross-attention between the intermedi- 
ate feature map of the diffusion generator and the feature 
map extracted from the conditional image. See Fig. 4 for an 
illustration. This is similar to the conditioning mechanism 
of Stable Diffusion [29]. We then train the condition en- 
coder and cross-attention layer while freezing the original 
personalized generation model. 
4. Experiments 
DatasetsTo train and evaluate our personalized genera- 
tion model, we compile a new dataset from existing datasets 
with identity information: 
• CelebA [21] consists 202,599 images from 10,177 
celebrities. Among them, 9,564 have more than one im- 
age, and the average number of images per identity is 21. 
• CelebRef-HQ [18] consists of 10,555 images from 1,005 
celebrities. Each identity has 3–21 images. 
• MyStyle [26] consists of 2,154 images from 14 celebri- 
ties. Each identity has more than 100 images. The dataset 
also provides a i xed training and test split, where the av- 
erage number of test images per identity is 9. 
We merge the three datasets with the following modif i ca- 
tions. First, we remove identities with less than four im- 
ages. Second, we manually removes identities in CelebA 
and CelebRef-HQ that overlap with MyStyle.We use 
CelebA, CelebRef-HQ, and the training split of MyStyle 
as the training set and the test split of MyStyle as the test 
set. This leads to the i nal dataset consisting of 213,487 
images from 10,568 identities in the training set and 126

is to build a personalized generation model that can gener- 
alize to identities not available during training. Therefore, 
we train our model with and without MyStyle training set 
to compare the generalizability to new identities. 
Besides the datasets with identity information, we also 
use the FFHQ [15] dataset for pre-training. It consists of 
70,000 face images without identity information.</div></div><div class="flex justify-between lg:block"><div class="text-xs flex items-center justify-center gap-1 self-center pt-2 !invisible"><button

paper describing a method for personalized image generation using diffusion models. The proposed method is designed to strike a balance between identity preservation, output diversity, and image quality.</p><p>The paper outlines a training strategy that adopts a random-weighted average embedding as the condition for the generator during training. This allows for a many-to-many mapping between the identity embedding and the output image, which is required because an identity embedding should correspond to multiple images of a subject with different appearances.</p><p>To avoid embedding degeneration, the paper proposes an identity loss function, which encourages the encoder to separate different identities in the embedding space. Additionally, multi-task learning is used to train the model on images both with and without identity labels, which effectively increases the training data size, boosting output quality.</p><p>The paper also introduces an extension of the framework for accommodating extra conditions, which uses a new condition encoder to extract a feature map from the conditional image. This feature map is then concatenated with the identity embedding to produce a personalized output image.</p></div></div></div><div class="flex justify-between lg:block"><div class="text-xs flex

"Symbiopsychotaxiplasm" is a term coined by filmmaker William Greaves in the 1960s. It refers to his experimental documentary film of the same name, which explores the relationship between a film crew and the subjects they are filming. The term itself combines four words: "symbiosis," which refers to a mutually beneficial relationship between two organisms; "psycho," which refers to the mind or psychology; "taxonomy," which refers to the classification of organisms; and "plasm," which refers to a fluid or substance. The term is meant to suggest a complex, interrelated system of elements that influence and shape each other. In the context of the film, "symbiopsychotaxiplasm" refers to the intertwined relationship between the filmmaker, the actors, and the crew, as well as the various psychological, social, and emotional factors that affect the production of the film.</p></div></div></div><div class="flex justify-between lg:block"><div class="text-xs flex items-center justify-center gap-1 self-center pt-2

practiced in ancient Persia, as described by the Greek historian Eunapius. The victim was placed inside two boats that were joined together, leaving only their head, hands, and feet outside. The boats were then set adrift on a body of water and the victim was left to die, either by being forced to eat or by being left to starve to death. The boats were often coated with honey and milk to attract insects, which would then lay their eggs on the victim's exposed skin. As the eggs hatched, the larvae would consume the victim's flesh. Scaphismus was said to last up to 40 days. The origin of the word "scaphismus" comes from the Greek word "skaphē" which means "a dug-out boat."</p><p>Scaphusia is a town in Switzerland located on the Rhine River, near the Black Forest, about 4 miles from Helveticum and 6 to 4 miles from Zurich in the north. The town is known for its abundance of fish, and is also the site of a natural wonder: the Rhine Falls, which are located about 3 miles from the town. The town is named after the scaphis, or boats, that were used to transport goods on the river. The town was founded in the 11th century as a Benedictine monastery or abbey by Eberhard, Count of Nellenburg, and was later given to the city of Zurich by the Holy Roman Emperor. The town was later pledged to the Duke of Austria and remained under Austrian rule for 85 years until the Council of Constance in the 15th century.</p></div></div></div><div class="flex justify-between lg:block"><div class="text-xs flex items-center justify-center gap-1 self-center pt-2 !invisible"><button disabled="" class="dark:text-white disabled:text-gray-300 dark:disabled:text-gray-400"><svg stroke="currentColor" fill="none" stroke-width="1.5" viewBox="0 0 24 24" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" class="h-3 w-3" height="1em" width="1em" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg"><polyline points="15 18 9 12 15 6"></polyline></svg></button><span class="flex-grow flex-shrink-0">1 / 1</span><button disabled="" class="dark:text-white disabled:text-gray-300 dark:disabled:text-gray-400"><svg stroke="currentColor" fill="none" stroke-width="1.5" viewBox="0 0 24 24" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" class="h-3 w-3" height="1em" width="1em" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg"><polyline points="9 18 15 12 9 6"></polyline></svg></button></div><div class="text-gray-400 flex self-end lg:self-center justify-center mt-2 gap-2 md:gap-3 lg:gap-1 lg:absolute lg:top-0 lg:translate-x-full lg:right-0 lg:mt-0 lg:pl-2 visible"><button class="flex ml-auto gap-2 h-full w-full rounded-md p-1 hover:bg-gray-100 hover:text-gray-700 dark:text-gray-400 dark:hover:bg-gray-700 dark:hover:text-gray-200 disabled:dark:hover:text-gray-400"><svg stroke="currentColor" fill="none" stroke-width="2" viewBox="0 0 24 24" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" class="h-4 w-4" height="1em" width="1em" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg"><path d="M16 4h2a2 2 0 0 1 2 2v14a2 2 0 0 1-2 2H6a2 2 0 0 1-2-2V6a2 2 0 0 1 2-2h2"></path><rect x="8" y="2" width="8" height="4" rx="1" ry="1"></rect></svg></button><button class="p-1 rounded-md hover:bg-gray-100 hover:text-gray-700 dark:text-gray-400 dark:hover:bg-gray-700 dark:hover:text-gray-200 disabled:dark:hover:text-gray-400"><svg stroke="currentColor" fill="none" stroke-width="2" viewBox="0 0 24 24" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" class="h-4 w-4" height="1em" width="1em" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg"><path d="M14 9V5a3 3 0 0 0-3-3l-4 9v11h11.28a2 2 0 0 0 2-1.7l1.38-9a2 2 0 0 0-2-2.3zM7 22H4a2 2 0 0 1-2-2v-7a2 2 0 0 1 2-2h3"></path></svg></button><button class="p-1 rounded-md hover:bg-gray-100 hover:text-gray-700 dark:text-gray-400 dark:hover:bg-gray-700 dark:hover:text-gray-200 disabled:dark:hover:text-gray-400"><svg stroke="currentColor" fill="none" stroke-width="2" viewBox="0 0 24 24" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" class="h-4 w-4" height="1em" width="1em" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg"><path d="M10 15v4a3 3 0 0 0 3 3l4-9V2H5.72a2 2 0 0 0-2 1.7l-1.38 9a2 2 0 0 0 2 2.3zm7-13h2.67A2.31 2.31 0 0 1 22 4v7a2.31 2.31 0 0 1-2.33 2H17"></path></svg></button></div></div></div></div></div><div class="group w-full text-gray-800 dark:text-gray-100 border-b border-black/10 dark:border-gray-900/50 dark:bg-gray-800"><div class="text-base gap-4 md:gap-6 md:max-w-2xl lg:max-w-xl xl:max-w-3xl p-4 md:py-6 flex lg:px-0 m-auto"><div class="w-[30px] flex flex-col relative items-end"><div class="relative flex"><span style="box-sizing: border-box; display: inline-block; overflow: hidden; width: initial; height: initial; background: none; opacity: 1; border: 0px; margin: 0px; padding: 0px; position: relative; max-width: 100%;"><span style="box-sizing: border-box; display: block; width: initial; height: initial; background: none; opacity: 1; border: 0px; margin: 0px; padding: 0px; max-width: 100%;"><img alt="" aria-hidden="true" src="data:image/svg+xml,%3csvg%20xmlns=%27http://www.w3.org/2000/svg%27%20version=%271.1%27%20width=%2738%27%20height=%2738%27/%3e" style="display: block; max-width: 100%; width: initial; height: initial; background: none; opacity: 1; border: 0px; margin: 0px; padding: 0px;"></span><img alt="User" src="https://chat.openai.com/_next/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Flh3.googleusercontent.com%2Fa%2FAGNmyxbfUJGaUXxADgtF19b5ZhmrVKp8-tY9hQf2Jfmp%3Ds96-c&amp;w=96&amp;q=75" decoding="async" data-nimg="intrinsic" class="rounded-sm" style="position: absolute; inset: 0px; box-sizing: border-box; padding: 0px; border: none; margin: auto; display: block; width: 0px; height: 0px; min-width: 100%; max-width: 100%; min-height: 100%; max-height: 100%;" width="30" height="30"></span></div></div><div class="relative flex w-[calc(100%-50px)] flex-col gap-1 md:gap-3 lg:w-[calc(100%-115px)]"><div class="flex flex-grow flex-col gap-3"><div class="min-h-[20px] flex flex-col items-start gap-4 whitespace-pre-wrap break-words">Yikes.

of Henri Glareanus to Helvetia on this distinguished city". Here is a rough translation:</p><p>Glareanus sings of your praises, Subtik, and of your ships
O Helvetia, faithful and worthy of praise
Glorious on the German shore in Teutonic Germany,
Useful in war, and useful in defeating the enemy.</p><p>The fast-flowing face of the Rhine
Which the vortex sees, reflecting the rapids
And the ravenous barking of Scylla.
Here, the wave rushes down from the top of the mountain
Precipitously, bringing with it a wild roar,
Flying up a cloud of dust, and seen to push against the sky.</p></div></div></div><div class="flex justify-between lg:block"><div class="text-xs flex items-center justify-center gap-1 self-center pt-2

Helvet. de egregia hac urbe" written by Henricus Glareanus in praise of a city called Helvetia (which could refer to Switzerland). The poem describes the city's virtues and usefulness in war, and includes imagery of a rushing river and a mountain. However, without a full translation or context, it is difficult to fully understand the poem's meaning.</p></div></div></div><div class="flex justify-between lg:block"><div class="text-xs flex items-center justify-center gap-1 self-center pt-2 !invisible"><button disabled="" class="dark:text-white disabled:text-gray-300 dark:disabled:text-gray-400"><svg stroke="currentColor" fill="none" stroke-width="1.5" viewBox="0 0 24 24" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" class="h-3 w-3" height="1em" width="1em" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg"><polyline points="15 18 9 12 15 6"></polyline></svg></button><span class="flex-grow flex-shrink-0">1 / 1</span><button disabled="" class="dark:text-white disabled:text-gray-300 dark:disabled:text-gray-400"><svg stroke="currentColor" fill="none" stroke-width="1.5" viewBox="0 0 24 24" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" class="h-3 w-3" height="1em" width="1em" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg"><polyline points="9 18 15 12 9 6"></polyline></svg></button></div><div class="text-gray-400 flex self-end lg:self-center justify-center mt-2 gap-2 md:gap-3 lg:gap-1 lg:absolute lg:top-0 lg:translate-x-full lg:right-0 lg:mt-0 lg:pl-2 visible"><button class="flex ml-auto gap-2 h-full w-full rounded-md p-1 hover:bg-gray-100 hover:text-gray-700 dark:text-gray-400 dark:hover:bg-gray-700 dark:hover:text-gray-200 disabled:dark:hover:text-gray-400"><svg stroke="currentColor" fill="none" stroke-width="2" viewBox="0 0 24 24" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" class="h-4 w-4" height="1em" width="1em" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg"><path d="M16 4h2a2 2 0 0 1 2 2v14a2 2 0 0 1-2 2H6a2 2 0 0 1-2-2V6a2 2 0 0 1 2-2h2"></path><rect x="8" y="2" width="8" height="4" rx="1" ry="1"></rect></svg></button><button class="p-1 rounded-md hover:bg-gray-100 hover:text-gray-700 dark:text-gray-400 dark:hover:bg-gray-700 dark:hover:text-gray-200 disabled:dark:hover:text-gray-400"><svg stroke="currentColor" fill="none" stroke-width="2" viewBox="0 0 24 24" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" class="h-4 w-4" height="1em" width="1em" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg"><path d="M14 9V5a3 3 0 0 0-3-3l-4 9v11h11.28a2 2 0 0 0 2-1.7l1.38-9a2 2 0 0 0-2-2.3zM7 22H4a2 2 0 0 1-2-2v-7a2 2 0 0 1 2-2h3"></path></svg></button><button class="p-1 rounded-md hover:bg-gray-100 hover:text-gray-700 dark:text-gray-400 dark:hover:bg-gray-700 dark:hover:text-gray-200 disabled:dark:hover:text-gray-400"><svg stroke="currentColor" fill="none" stroke-width="2" viewBox="0 0 24 24" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" class="h-4 w-4" height="1em" width="1em" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg"><path d="M10 15v4a3 3 0 0 0 3 3l4-9V2H5.72a2 2 0 0 0-2 1.7l-1.38 9a2 2 0 0 0 2 2.3zm7-13h2.67A2.31 2.31 0 0 1 22 4v7a2.31 2.31 0 0 1-2.33 2H17"></path></svg></button></div></div></div></div></div><div class="group w-full text-gray-800 dark:text-gray-100 border-b border-black/10 dark:border-gray-900/50 dark:bg-gray-800"><div class="text-base gap-4 md:gap-6 md:max-w-2xl lg:max-w-xl xl:max-w-3xl p-4 md:py-6 flex lg:px-0 m-auto"><div class="w-[30px] flex flex-col relative items-end"><div class="relative flex"><span style="box-sizing: border-box; display: inline-block; overflow: hidden; width: initial; height: initial; background: none; opacity: 1; border: 0px; margin: 0px; padding: 0px; position: relative; max-width: 100%;"><span style="box-sizing: border-box; display: block; width: initial; height: initial; background: none; opacity: 1; border: 0px; margin: 0px; padding: 0px; max-width: 100%;"><img alt="" aria-hidden="true" src="data:image/svg+xml,%3csvg%20xmlns=%27http://www.w3.org/2000/svg%27%20version=%271.1%27%20width=%2738%27%20height=%2738%27/%3e" style="display: block; max-width: 100%; width: initial; height: initial; background: none; opacity: 1; border: 0px; margin: 0px; padding: 0px;"></span><img alt="User" src="https://chat.openai.com/_next/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Flh3.googleusercontent.com%2Fa%2FAGNmyxbfUJGaUXxADgtF19b5ZhmrVKp8-tY9hQf2Jfmp%3Ds96-c&amp;w=96&amp;q=75" decoding="async" data-nimg="intrinsic" class="rounded-sm" style="position: absolute; inset: 0px; box-sizing: border-box; padding: 0px; border: none; margin: auto; display: block; width: 0px; height: 0px; min-width: 100%; max-width: 100%; min-height: 100%; max-height: 100%;" width="30" height="30"></span></div></div><div class="relative flex w-[calc(100%-50px)] flex-col gap-1 md:gap-3 lg:w-[calc(100%-115px)]"><div class="flex flex-grow flex-col gap-3"><div class="min-h-[20px] flex flex-col items-start gap-4 whitespace-pre-wrap break-words">It could be HENRICUS GLAREANUS (Heinrich Loriti), Panegyricon; De situ Helvetiae et vicinis gentibus; De quattuor Helvetiorum pagis; Pro iustissimo Helveticorum foedere panegyricon, with Commentary on the Descriptio Helvetiae and List of Extra-Helvetian Places in Latin, with German translation

Without more context, it is difficult to say for sure, but the Latin text does appear to be a panegyric or tribute to a city called Helyetia or Helvetia, which could refer to Switzerland. The text mentions the usefulness of the city in war and its victory over enemies, as well as describing a river or body of water that flows through the area. The text also includes some Greek and German words, which could be consistent with a work from the early 16th century that was written in Latin with translations into other languages.</p></div></div></div><div class="flex justify-between lg:block"><div class="text-xs flex items-center justify-center gap-1 self-center pt-2 !invisible"><button disabled=""

It also describes the river Rhine and its dangerous currents, as well as the mountains surrounding Basel. The marginal note you provided explains that the text is a collection of lesser-known geographical terms related to Switzerland, which Glareanus performed in public in Basel in 1515 and then later explained through diligent study.</p></div></div></div><div class="flex justify-between lg:block"><div class="text-xs flex items-center justify-center gap-1 self-center pt-2 !invisible"><button disabled="" class="dark:text-white disabled:text-gray-300 dark:disabled:text-gray-400"><svg stroke="currentColor" fill="none" stroke-width="1.5" viewBox="0 0 24 24" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" class="h-3 w-3" height="1em" width="1em" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg"><polyline points="15 18 9 12 15 6"></polyline></svg></button><span class="flex-grow flex-shrink-0">1 / 1</span><button disabled="" class="dark:text-white disabled:text-gray-300 dark:disabled:text-gray-400"><svg stroke="currentColor" fill="none" stroke-width="1.5" viewBox="0 0 24 24" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" class="h-3 w-3" height="1em" width="1em" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg"><polyline points="9 18 15 12 9 6"></polyline></svg></button></div><div class="text-gray-400 flex self-end lg:self-center justify-center mt-2 gap-2 md:gap-3 lg:gap-1 lg:absolute lg:top-0 lg:translate-x-full lg:right-0 lg:mt-0 lg:pl-2 visible"><button class="flex ml-auto gap-2 h-full w-full rounded-md p-1 hover:bg-gray-100 hover:text-gray-700 dark:text-gray-400 dark:hover:bg-gray-700 dark:hover:text-gray-200 disabled:dark:hover:text-gray-400"><svg stroke="currentColor" fill="none" stroke-width="2" viewBox="0 0 24 24" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" class="h-4 w-4" height="1em" width="1em" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg"><path d="M16 4h2a2 2 0 0 1 2 2v14a2 2 0 0 1-2 2H6a2 2 0 0 1-2-2V6a2 2 0 0 1 2-2h2"></path><rect x="8" y="2" width="8" height="4" rx="1" ry="1"></rect></svg></button><button class="p-1 rounded-md hover:bg-gray-100 hover:text-gray-700 dark:text-gray-400 dark:hover:bg-gray-700 dark:hover:text-gray-200 disabled:dark:hover:text-gray-400"><svg stroke="currentColor" fill="none" stroke-width="2" viewBox="0 0 24 24" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" class="h-4 w-4" height="1em" width="1em" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg"><path d="M14 9V5a3 3 0 0 0-3-3l-4 9v11h11.28a2 2 0 0 0 2-1.7l1.38-9a2 2 0 0 0-2-2.3zM7 22H4a2 2 0 0 1-2-2v-7a2 2 0 0 1 2-2h3"></path></svg></button><button class="p-1 rounded-md hover:bg-gray-100 hover:text-gray-700 dark:text-gray-400 dark:hover:bg-gray-700 dark:hover:text-gray-200 disabled:dark:hover:text-gray-400"><svg stroke="currentColor" fill="none" stroke-width="2" viewBox="0 0 24 24" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" class="h-4 w-4" height="1em" width="1em" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg"><path d="M10 15v4a3 3 0 0 0 3 3l4-9V2H5.72a2 2 0 0 0-2 1.7l-1.38 9a2 2 0 0 0 2 2.3zm7-13h2.67A2.31 2.31 0 0 1 22 4v7a2.31 2.31 0 0 1-2.33 2H17"></path></svg></button></div></div></div></div></div><div class="group w-full text-gray-800 dark:text-gray-100 border-b border-black/10 dark:border-gray-900/50 dark:bg-gray-800"><div class="text-base gap-4 md:gap-6 md:max-w-2xl lg:max-w-xl xl:max-w-3xl p-4 md:py-6 flex lg:px-0 m-auto"><div class="w-[30px] flex flex-col relative items-end"><div class="relative flex"><span style="box-sizing: border-box; display: inline-block; overflow: hidden; width: initial; height: initial; background: none; opacity: 1; border: 0px; margin: 0px; padding: 0px; position: relative; max-width: 100%;"><span style="box-sizing: border-box; display: block; width: initial; height: initial; background: none; opacity: 1; border: 0px; margin: 0px; padding: 0px; max-width: 100%;"><img alt="" aria-hidden="true" src="data:image/svg+xml,%3csvg%20xmlns=%27http://www.w3.org/2000/svg%27%20version=%271.1%27%20width=%2738%27%20height=%2738%27/%3e" style="display: block; max-width: 100%; width: initial; height: initial; background: none; opacity: 1; border: 0px; margin: 0px; padding: 0px;"></span><img alt="User" src="https://chat.openai.com/_next/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Flh3.googleusercontent.com%2Fa%2FAGNmyxbfUJGaUXxADgtF19b5ZhmrVKp8-tY9hQf2Jfmp%3Ds96-c&amp;w=96&amp;q=75" decoding="async" data-nimg="intrinsic" class="rounded-sm" style="position: absolute; inset: 0px; box-sizing: border-box; padding: 0px; border: none; margin: auto; display: block; width: 0px; height: 0px; min-width: 100%; max-width: 100%; min-height: 100%; max-height: 100%;" width="30" height="30"></span></div></div><div class="relative flex w-[calc(100%-50px)] flex-col gap-1 md:gap-3 lg:w-[calc(100%-115px)]"><div class="flex flex-grow flex-col gap-3"><div class="min-h-[20px] flex flex-col items-start gap-4 whitespace-pre-wrap break-words">The work is composed of three parts that follow the laudatory poem in honor of Emperor Maximilian. The first part, “De situ Helvetiae et vicinis gentibus,” in 92 verses provides a geographical description of the Swiss Confederacy (Helvetica), with bordering nations and rivers. The second part, “De quattuor Helvetiorum pagis,” offers an account of the four regions that compose the Swiss Confederacy. Finally the third part, “In Laudatissimum Helvetiorum foedus Panegyricon” [Panegyric in praise of the people of Helvetia], contains as its title suggest a praise of the people and the achievements of the sixteenth confederate cantons from Tigrum to the recently confederated Abbatiscella (Appenzell).</div></div><div class="flex justify-between lg:block"><div class="text-xs flex items-center

It also describes the four regions that compose the Swiss Confederacy and contains a praise of the people and the achievements of the confederate cantons.</p></div></div></div><div class="flex justify-between lg:block"><div class="text-xs flex items-center justify-center gap-1 self-center pt-2 !invisible"><button disabled="" class="dark:text-white disabled:text-gray-300 dark:disabled:text-gray-400"><svg stroke="currentColor" fill="none" stroke-width="1.5" viewBox="0 0 24 24" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" class="h-3 w-3" height="1em" width="1em" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg"><polyline points="15 18 9 12 15 6"></polyline></svg></button><span class="flex-grow flex-shrink-0">1 / 1</span><button disabled="" class="dark:text-white disabled:text-gray-300 dark:disabled:text-gray-400"><svg stroke="currentColor" fill="none" stroke-width="1.5" viewBox="0 0 24 24" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" class="h-3 w-3" height="1em" width="1em" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg"><polyline points="9 18 15 12 9 6"></polyline></svg></button></div><div class="text-gray-400 flex self-end lg:self-center justify-center mt-2 gap-2 md:gap-3 lg:gap-1 lg:absolute lg:top-0 lg:translate-x-full lg:right-0 lg:mt-0 lg:pl-2 visible"><button class="flex ml-auto gap-2 h-full w-full rounded-md p-1 hover:bg-gray-100 hover:text-gray-700 dark:text-gray-400 dark:hover:bg-gray-700 dark:hover:text-gray-200 disabled:dark:hover:text-gray-400"><svg stroke="currentColor" fill="none" stroke-width="2" viewBox="0 0 24 24" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" class="h-4 w-4" height="1em" width="1em" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg"><path d="M16 4h2a2 2 0 0 1 2 2v14a2 2 0 0 1-2 2H6a2 2 0 0 1-2-2V6a2 2 0 0 1 2-2h2"></path><rect x="8" y="2" width="8" height="4" rx="1" ry="1"></rect></svg></button><button class="p-1 rounded-md hover:bg-gray-100 hover:text-gray-700 dark:text-gray-400 dark:hover:bg-gray-700 dark:hover:text-gray-200 disabled:dark:hover:text-gray-400"><svg stroke="currentColor" fill="none" stroke-width="2" viewBox="0 0 24 24" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" class="h-4 w-4" height="1em" width="1em" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg"><path d="M14 9V5a3 3 0 0 0-3-3l-4 9v11h11.28a2 2 0 0 0 2-1.7l1.38-9a2 2 0 0 0-2-2.3zM7 22H4a2 2 0 0 1-2-2v-7a2 2 0 0 1 2-2h3"></path></svg></button><button class="p-1 rounded-md hover:bg-gray-100 hover:text-gray-700 dark:text-gray-400 dark:hover:bg-gray-700 dark:hover:text-gray-200 disabled:dark:hover:text-gray-400"><svg stroke="currentColor" fill="none" stroke-width="2" viewBox="0 0 24 24" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" class="h-4 w-4" height="1em" width="1em" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg"><path d="M10 15v4a3 3 0 0 0 3 3l4-9V2H5.72a2 2 0 0 0-2 1.7l-1.38 9a2 2 0 0 0 2 2.3zm7-13h2.67A2.31 2.31 0 0 1 22 4v7a2.31 2.31 0 0 1-2.33 2H17"></path></svg></button></div></div></div></div></div><div class="group w-full text-gray-800 dark:text-gray-100 border-b border-black/10 dark:border-gray-900/50 dark:bg-gray-800"><div class="text-base gap-4 md:gap-6 md:max-w-2xl lg:max-w-xl xl:max-w-3xl p-4 md:py-6 flex lg:px-0 m-auto"><div class="w-[30px] flex flex-col relative items-end"><div class="relative flex"><span style="box-sizing: border-box; display: inline-block; overflow: hidden; width: initial; height: initial; background: none; opacity: 1; border: 0px; margin: 0px; padding: 0px; position: relative; max-width: 100%;"><span style="box-sizing: border-box; display: block; width: initial; height: initial; background: none; opacity: 1; border: 0px; margin: 0px; padding: 0px; max-width: 100%;"><img alt="" aria-hidden="true" src="data:image/svg+xml,%3csvg%20xmlns=%27http://www.w3.org/2000/svg%27%20version=%271.1%27%20width=%2738%27%20height=%2738%27/%3e" style="display: block; max-width: 100%; width: initial; height: initial; background: none; opacity: 1; border: 0px; margin: 0px; padding: 0px;"></span><img alt="User" src="https://chat.openai.com/_next/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Flh3.googleusercontent.com%2Fa%2FAGNmyxbfUJGaUXxADgtF19b5ZhmrVKp8-tY9hQf2Jfmp%3Ds96-c&amp;w=96&amp;q=75" decoding="async" data-nimg="intrinsic" class="rounded-sm" style="position: absolute; inset: 0px; box-sizing: border-box; padding: 0px; border: none; margin: auto; display: block; width: 0px; height: 0px; min-width: 100%; max-width: 100%; min-height: 100%; max-height: 100%;" width="30" height="30"></span></div></div><div class="relative flex w-[calc(100%-50px)] flex-col gap-1 md:gap-3 lg:w-[calc(100%-115px)]"><div class="flex flex-grow flex-col gap-3"><div class="min-h-[20px] flex flex-col items-start gap-4 whitespace-pre-wrap break-words">Glarean was born as Heinrich Loriti in Mollis in Canton Glarus to a politician.[1] As a boy, he took care of cattle and received a good education.[1] After a thorough early training in music, Glarean enrolled in the University of Cologne, where he studied theology, philosophy, and mathematics as well as music. It was in Cologne where he held a poem as a tribute to Emperor Maximilian I.[2] Since 1514 he was a teacher for Greek and Latin in Basel,[2] where he met Erasmus and the two humanists became lifelong friends.[3] He shortly was a lecturer at the University of Pavia for a few months in 1515, but returned to Basel due to the Battle of Marignano[2] between Switzerland and France.

Glarean's first publication on music, a modest volume entitled Isagoge in musicen, was printed in 1515 by Johann Froben.[4] In it he discusses the basic elements of music; probably it was used for teaching. In late 1515 a treatise on latin poetry of him was printed by Adam Petri.[5] But his most famous book, and one of the most famous and influential works on music theory written during the Renaissance, was the Dodecachordon, which he published in Basle in 1547. This massive work includes writings on philosophy and biography in addition to music theory, and includes no less than 120 complete compositions by composers of the preceding generation (including Josquin, Ockeghem, Obrecht, Isaac and many others). In three parts, it begins with a study of Boethius, who wrote extensively on music in the sixth century; it traces the use of the musical modes in plainsong (e.g. Gregorian chant) and monophony; and it closes with an extended study of the use of modes in polyphony.[6]</div></div><div class="flex justify-between lg:block"><div class="text-xs flex items-center justify-center gap-1 self-center pt-2

The work studies Boethius, the use of musical modes in plainsong and monophony, and the use of modes in polyphony.</p></div></div></div><div class="flex justify-between lg:block"><div class="text-xs flex items-center justify-center gap-1 self-center pt-2 !invisible"><button disabled="" class="dark:text-white disabled:text-gray-300 dark:disabled:text-gray-400"><svg stroke="currentColor" fill="none" stroke-width="1.5" viewBox="0 0 24 24" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" class="h-3 w-3" height="1em" width="1em" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg"><polyline points="15 18 9 12 15 6"></polyline></svg></button><span class="flex-grow flex-shrink-0">1 / 1</span><button disabled="" class="dark:text-white disabled:text-gray-300 dark:disabled:text-gray-400"><svg stroke="currentColor" fill="none" stroke-width="1.5" viewBox="0 0 24 24" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" class="h-3 w-3" height="1em" width="1em" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg"><polyline points="9 18 15 12 9 6"></polyline></svg></button></div><div class="text-gray-400 flex self-end lg:self-center justify-center mt-2 gap-2 md:gap-3 lg:gap-1 lg:absolute lg:top-0 lg:translate-x-full lg:right-0 lg:mt-0 lg:pl-2 visible"><button class="flex ml-auto gap-2 h-full w-full rounded-md p-1 hover:bg-gray-100 hover:text-gray-700 dark:text-gray-400 dark:hover:bg-gray-700 dark:hover:text-gray-200 disabled:dark:hover:text-gray-400"><svg stroke="currentColor" fill="none" stroke-width="2" viewBox="0 0 24 24" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" class="h-4 w-4" height="1em" width="1em" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg"><path d="M16 4h2a2 2 0 0 1 2 2v14a2 2 0 0 1-2 2H6a2 2 0 0 1-2-2V6a2 2 0 0 1 2-2h2"></path><rect x="8" y="2" width="8" height="4" rx="1" ry="1"></rect></svg></button><button class="p-1 rounded-md hover:bg-gray-100 hover:text-gray-700 dark:text-gray-400 dark:hover:bg-gray-700 dark:hover:text-gray-200 disabled:dark:hover:text-gray-400"><svg stroke="currentColor" fill="none" stroke-width="2" viewBox="0 0 24 24" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" class="h-4 w-4" height="1em" width="1em" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg"><path d="M14 9V5a3 3 0 0 0-3-3l-4 9v11h11.28a2 2 0 0 0 2-1.7l1.38-9a2 2 0 0 0-2-2.3zM7 22H4a2 2 0 0 1-2-2v-7a2 2 0 0 1 2-2h3"></path></svg></button><button class="p-1 rounded-md hover:bg-gray-100 hover:text-gray-700 dark:text-gray-400 dark:hover:bg-gray-700 dark:hover:text-gray-200 disabled:dark:hover:text-gray-400"><svg stroke="currentColor" fill="none" stroke-width="2" viewBox="0 0 24 24" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" class="h-4 w-4" height="1em" width="1em" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg"><path d="M10 15v4a3 3 0 0 0 3 3l4-9V2H5.72a2 2 0 0 0-2 1.7l-1.38 9a2 2 0 0 0 2 2.3zm7-13h2.67A2.31 2.31 0 0 1 22 4v7a2.31 2.31 0 0 1-2.33 2H17"></path></svg></button></div></div></div></div></div><div class="group w-full text-gray-800 dark:text-gray-100 border-b border-black/10 dark:border-gray-900/50 dark:bg-gray-800"><div class="text-base gap-4 md:gap-6 md:max-w-2xl lg:max-w-xl xl:max-w-3xl p-4 md:py-6 flex lg:px-0 m-auto"><div class="w-[30px] flex flex-col relative items-end"><div class="relative flex"><span style="box-sizing: border-box; display: inline-block; overflow: hidden; width: initial; height: initial; background: none; opacity: 1; border: 0px; margin: 0px; padding: 0px; position: relative; max-width: 100%;"><span style="box-sizing: border-box; display: block; width: initial; height: initial; background: none; opacity: 1; border: 0px; margin: 0px; padding: 0px; max-width: 100%;"><img alt="" aria-hidden="true" src="data:image/svg+xml,%3csvg%20xmlns=%27http://www.w3.org/2000/svg%27%20version=%271.1%27%20width=%2738%27%20height=%2738%27/%3e" style="display: block; max-width: 100%; width: initial; height: initial; background: none; opacity: 1; border: 0px; margin: 0px; padding: 0px;"></span><img alt="User" src="https://chat.openai.com/_next/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Flh3.googleusercontent.com%2Fa%2FAGNmyxbfUJGaUXxADgtF19b5ZhmrVKp8-tY9hQf2Jfmp%3Ds96-c&amp;w=96&amp;q=75" decoding="async" data-nimg="intrinsic" class="rounded-sm" style="position: absolute; inset: 0px; box-sizing: border-box; padding: 0px; border: none; margin: auto; display: block; width: 0px; height: 0px; min-width: 100%; max-width: 100%; min-height: 100%; max-height: 100%;" width="30" height="30"></span></div></div><div class="relative flex w-[calc(100%-50px)] flex-col gap-1 md:gap-3 lg:w-[calc(100%-115px)]"><div class="flex flex-grow flex-col gap-3"><div class="min-h-[20px] flex flex-col items-start gap-4 whitespace-pre-wrap break-words">The most significant feature of the Dodecachordon (literally, "12-stringed instrument") is Glarean's proposal that there are actually twelve modes, not eight, as had long been assumed, for instance in the works of the contemporary theorist Pietro Aron. The additional four modes included authentic and plagal forms of Aeolian (modes 9 and 10) and Ionian (modes 11 and 12) — the modes equivalent to minor and major scales, respectively. Glarean went so far as to say that the Ionian mode was the one most frequently used by composers in his day.[7]

The influence of his work was immense. Many later theorists, including Zarlino, accepted the twelve modes,[7] and though the distinction between plagal and authentic forms of the modes is no longer of contemporary interest (reducing the number from twelve to six), Glarean's explanation of the musical modes remains current today.</div></div><div class="flex justify-between lg:block"><div class="text-xs flex items-center justify-center

While the distinction between plagal and authentic forms of the modes is no longer of contemporary interest, Glarean's explanation of the musical modes remains relevant today.</p></div></div></div><div class="flex justify-between lg:block"><div class="text-xs flex items-center justify-center gap-1 self-center pt-2 !invisible"><button disabled="" class="dark:text-white disabled:text-gray-300 dark:disabled:text-gray-400"><svg stroke="currentColor" fill="none" stroke-width="1.5" viewBox="0 0 24 24" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" class="h-3 w-3" height="1em" width="1em" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg"><polyline points="15 18 9 12 15 6"></polyline></svg></button><span class="flex-grow flex-shrink-0">1 / 1</span><button disabled="" class="dark:text-white disabled:text-gray-300 dark:disabled:text-gray-400"><svg stroke="currentColor" fill="none" stroke-width="1.5" viewBox="0 0 24 24" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" class="h-3 w-3" height="1em" width="1em" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg"><polyline points="9 18 15 12 9 6"></polyline></svg></button></div><div class="text-gray-400 flex self-end lg:self-center justify-center mt-2 gap-2 md:gap-3 lg:gap-1 lg:absolute lg:top-0 lg:translate-x-full lg:right-0 lg:mt-0 lg:pl-2 visible"><button class="flex ml-auto gap-2 h-full w-full rounded-md p-1 hover:bg-gray-100 hover:text-gray-700 dark:text-gray-400 dark:hover:bg-gray-700 dark:hover:text-gray-200 disabled:dark:hover:text-gray-400"><svg stroke="currentColor" fill="none" stroke-width="2" viewBox="0 0 24 24" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" class="h-4 w-4" height="1em" width="1em" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg"><path d="M16 4h2a2 2 0 0 1 2 2v14a2 2 0 0 1-2 2H6a2 2 0 0 1-2-2V6a2 2 0 0 1 2-2h2"></path><rect x="8" y="2" width="8" height="4" rx="1" ry="1"></rect></svg></button><button class="p-1 rounded-md hover:bg-gray-100 hover:text-gray-700 dark:text-gray-400 dark:hover:bg-gray-700 dark:hover:text-gray-200 disabled:dark:hover:text-gray-400"><svg stroke="currentColor" fill="none" stroke-width="2" viewBox="0 0 24 24" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" class="h-4 w-4" height="1em" width="1em" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg"><path d="M14 9V5a3 3 0 0 0-3-3l-4 9v11h11.28a2 2 0 0 0 2-1.7l1.38-9a2 2 0 0 0-2-2.3zM7 22H4a2 2 0 0 1-2-2v-7a2 2 0 0 1 2-2h3"></path></svg></button><button class="p-1 rounded-md hover:bg-gray-100 hover:text-gray-700 dark:text-gray-400 dark:hover:bg-gray-700 dark:hover:text-gray-200 disabled:dark:hover:text-gray-400"><svg stroke="currentColor" fill="none" stroke-width="2" viewBox="0 0 24 24" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" class="h-4 w-4" height="1em" width="1em" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg"><path d="M10 15v4a3 3 0 0 0 3 3l4-9V2H5.72a2 2 0 0 0-2 1.7l-1.38 9a2 2 0 0 0 2 2.3zm7-13h2.67A2.31 2.31 0 0 1 22 4v7a2.31 2.31 0 0 1-2.33 2H17"></path></svg></button></div></div></div></div></div><div class="group w-full text-gray-800 dark:text-gray-100 border-b border-black/10 dark:border-gray-900/50 dark:bg-gray-800"><div class="text-base gap-4 md:gap-6 md:max-w-2xl lg:max-w-xl xl:max-w-3xl p-4 md:py-6 flex lg:px-0 m-auto"><div class="w-[30px] flex flex-col relative items-end"><div class="relative flex"><span style="box-sizing: border-box; display: inline-block; overflow: hidden; width: initial; height: initial; background: none; opacity: 1; border: 0px; margin: 0px; padding: 0px; position: relative; max-width: 100%;"><span style="box-sizing: border-box; display: block; width: initial; height: initial; background: none; opacity: 1; border: 0px; margin: 0px; padding: 0px; max-width: 100%;"><img alt="" aria-hidden="true" src="data:image/svg+xml,%3csvg%20xmlns=%27http://www.w3.org/2000/svg%27%20version=%271.1%27%20width=%2738%27%20height=%2738%27/%3e" style="display: block; max-width: 100%; width: initial; height: initial; background: none; opacity: 1; border: 0px; margin: 0px; padding: 0px;"></span><img alt="User" src="https://chat.openai.com/_next/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Flh3.googleusercontent.com%2Fa%2FAGNmyxbfUJGaUXxADgtF19b5ZhmrVKp8-tY9hQf2Jfmp%3Ds96-c&amp;w=96&amp;q=75" decoding="async" data-nimg="intrinsic" class="rounded-sm" style="position: absolute; inset: 0px; box-sizing: border-box; padding: 0px; border: none; margin: auto; display: block; width: 0px; height: 0px; min-width: 100%; max-width: 100%; min-height: 100%; max-height: 100%;" width="30" height="30"></span></div></div><div class="relative flex w-[calc(100%-50px)] flex-col gap-1 md:gap-3 lg:w-[calc(100%-115px)]"><div class="flex flex-grow flex-col gap-3"><div class="min-h-[20px] flex flex-col items-start gap-4 whitespace-pre-wrap break-words">The most significant feature of the Dodecachordon (literally, "12-stringed instrument") is Glarean's proposal that there are actually twelve modes, not eight, as had long been assumed, for instance in the works of the contemporary theorist Pietro Aron. The additional four modes included authentic and plagal forms of Aeolian (modes 9 and 10) and Ionian (modes 11 and 12) — the modes equivalent to minor and major scales, respectively. Glarean went so far as to say that the Ionian mode was the one most frequently used by composers in his day.</div></div><div class="flex justify-between lg:block"><div class="text-xs flex items-center

Loriti Glareanus, a patriot of Claro in the Helvetic Republic, the Dodecachordon, Book 1, Chapter 1, "On the Definition of Modes"</p><p>In this chapter, Glareanus discusses the theoretical and practical aspects of music theory. He notes that there are three aspects of music theory according to Boethius: the Mundane, which concerns the harmony of the whole universe; the Human, which concerns the proportion of the body and soul; and the Practical, which concerns the execution of music. Glareanus focuses on the Practical aspect in this treatise, specifically on the rhythms found in music.</p><p>He distinguishes between two types of singing: the regular or plainchant singing, which is simple and uniform and commonly used in churches, and the varied and multiform singing, which is known as "figured" or "mensural" music. Glareanus notes that the latter was not found among the ancients, but rather developed as a tradition passed down through the ages.</p><p>Glareanus then goes on to define music theory as the use of different pitches and durations of sounds, without reference to their meaning. He notes that musical notes were originally represented by figures, which are now called "notes," and by syllables, which are still used today (e.g. do, re, mi, fa, sol, la). He also mentions that the modes of music are called "voices" and are identified by their names.</p><p>Overall, Glareanus argues that there are twelve modes in music, not eight as previously thought. These include four additional modes that correspond to minor and major scales, known as the authentic and plagal forms of the Aeolian and Ionian modes. He further states that the Ionian mode was the most commonly used mode by composers in his time.</p><p>This treatise had a significant impact on music theory, and many later theorists, including Zarlino, accepted Glareanus's proposal of twelve modes. Although the distinction between plagal and authentic forms of the modes is no longer as relevant today, Glareanus's explanation of the musical modes remains important in contemporary music theory.</p></div></div></div><div class="flex justify-between lg:block"><div class="text-xs flex items-center justify-center gap-1 self-center pt-2 !invisible"><button disabled="" class="dark:text-white disabled:text-gray-300 dark:disabled:text-gray-400"><svg stroke="currentColor" fill="none" stroke-width="1.5" viewBox="0 0 24 24" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" class="h-3 w-3" height="1em" width="1em" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg"><polyline points="15 18 9 12 15 6"></polyline></svg></button><span class="flex-grow flex-shrink-0">1 / 1</span><button disabled="" class="dark:text-white disabled:text-gray-300 dark:disabled:text-gray-400"><svg stroke="currentColor" fill="none" stroke-width="1.5" viewBox="0 0 24 24" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" class="h-3 w-3" height="1em" width="1em" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg"><polyline points="9 18 15 12 9 6"></polyline></svg></button></div><div class="text-gray-400 flex self-end lg:self-center justify-center mt-2 gap-2 md:gap-3 lg:gap-1 lg:absolute lg:top-0 lg:translate-x-full lg:right-0 lg:mt-0 lg:pl-2 visible"><button class="flex ml-auto gap-2 h-full w-full rounded-md p-1 hover:bg-gray-100 hover:text-gray-700 dark:text-gray-400 dark:hover:bg-gray-700 dark:hover:text-gray-200 disabled:dark:hover:text-gray-400"><svg stroke="currentColor" fill="none" stroke-width="2" viewBox="0 0 24 24" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" class="h-4 w-4" height="1em" width="1em" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg"><path d="M16 4h2a2 2 0 0 1 2 2v14a2 2 0 0 1-2 2H6a2 2 0 0 1-2-2V6a2 2 0 0 1 2-2h2"></path><rect x="8" y="2" width="8" height="4" rx="1" ry="1"></rect></svg></button><button class="p-1 rounded-md hover:bg-gray-100 hover:text-gray-700 dark:text-gray-400 dark:hover:bg-gray-700 dark:hover:text-gray-200 disabled:dark:hover:text-gray-400"><svg stroke="currentColor" fill="none" stroke-width="2" viewBox="0 0 24 24" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" class="h-4 w-4" height="1em" width="1em" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg"><path d="M14 9V5a3 3 0 0 0-3-3l-4 9v11h11.28a2 2 0 0 0 2-1.7l1.38-9a2 2 0 0 0-2-2.3zM7 22H4a2 2 0 0 1-2-2v-7a2 2 0 0 1 2-2h3"></path></svg></button><button class="p-1 rounded-md hover:bg-gray-100 hover:text-gray-700 dark:text-gray-400 dark:hover:bg-gray-700 dark:hover:text-gray-200 disabled:dark:hover:text-gray-400"><svg stroke="currentColor" fill="none" stroke-width="2" viewBox="0 0 24 24" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" class="h-4 w-4" height="1em" width="1em" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg"><path d="M10 15v4a3 3 0 0 0 3 3l4-9V2H5.72a2 2 0 0 0-2 1.7l-1.38 9a2 2 0 0 0 2 2.3zm7-13h2.67A2.31 2.31 0 0 1 22 4v7a2.31 2.31 0 0 1-2.33 2H17"></path></svg></button></div></div></div></div></div><div class="group w-full text-gray-800 dark:text-gray-100 border-b border-black/10 dark:border-gray-900/50 dark:bg-gray-800"><div class="text-base gap-4 md:gap-6 md:max-w-2xl lg:max-w-xl xl:max-w-3xl p-4 md:py-6 flex lg:px-0 m-auto"><div class="w-[30px] flex flex-col relative items-end"><div class="relative flex"><span style="box-sizing: border-box; display: inline-block; overflow: hidden; width: initial; height: initial; background: none; opacity: 1; border: 0px; margin: 0px; padding: 0px; position: relative; max-width: 100%;"><span style="box-sizing: border-box; display: block; width: initial; height: initial; background: none; opacity: 1; border: 0px; margin: 0px; padding: 0px; max-width: 100%;"><img alt="" aria-hidden="true" src="data:image/svg+xml,%3csvg%20xmlns=%27http://www.w3.org/2000/svg%27%20version=%271.1%27%20width=%2738%27%20height=%2738%27/%3e" style="display: block; max-width: 100%; width: initial; height: initial; background: none; opacity: 1; border: 0px; margin: 0px; padding: 0px;"></span><img alt="User" src="https://chat.openai.com/_next/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Flh3.googleusercontent.com%2Fa%2FAGNmyxbfUJGaUXxADgtF19b5ZhmrVKp8-tY9hQf2Jfmp%3Ds96-c&amp;w=96&amp;q=75" decoding="async" data-nimg="intrinsic" class="rounded-sm" style="position: absolute; inset: 0px; box-sizing: border-box; padding: 0px; border: none; margin: auto; display: block; width: 0px; height: 0px; min-width: 100%; max-width: 100%; min-height: 100%; max-height: 100%;" width="30" height="30"></span></div></div><div class="relative flex w-[calc(100%-50px)] flex-col gap-1 md:gap-3 lg:w-[calc(100%-115px)]"><div class="flex flex-grow flex-col gap-3"><div class="min-h-[20px] flex flex-col items-start gap-4 whitespace-pre-wrap break-words">neattctrachordum,hoceft,fain b caue.

errors. Here is a rough translation of the text:</p><p>Book I.
By Guido (or Odo?)
For beginners
On the necessary knowledge of this art</p><p>Book II.
On the staff (it is not to be omitted, since it is essential from the beginning to the definition of the nature of sound and its intervals, so that the letters may be placed in order, for it is very useful to add them. These are the eight causes that make up the scale, and they are distinguished in a way that is different from that used by painters, but similar to that used by mathematicians: first, the seven notes are arranged in a row, then the same seven are repeated, and finally the extremes are doubled. And we say that A is a large pitch and B is a small pitch, A is doubled, and the others are in the same way. Second, the distances between the keys must be considered. The second key is next to the first, the third is next to the second, and so on. And in general, any note that is eight keys away from another note must be connected in the same way, such as G, F, A, and E. This rule must be noted. It is also necessary to understand the nature of the voice and the melody. The same notes that are used in G can also be used in C, and the same notes that are used in A can also be used in B flat, and so on. The differences between the keys must also be considered. The first key is one distance from the second, the second is two distances from the third, and so on. This rule can be extended infinitely, as the rule indicates. However, there are some exceptions and limits. For example, if a note is placed below T, what should be done? It should be referred to the octave key. For example, if F is below G, it should be referred to the T octave key. Similarly, if a note is placed above la, it should be referred to the octave key. The human voice cannot exceed these limits. However, four voices and musical instruments can better exceed these limits. These notes should not be called high, but rather fixed, since they are contained by the same keys, where permission is granted. For example, F sharp, G, A sharp, B, etc. Finally, the keys must be learned carefully so that we do not have to think about them when we use them, and we must memorize which notes are associated with each key so that we can easily remember them.</p></div></div></div><div class="flex justify-between lg:block"><div class="text-xs flex items-center justify-center gap-1 self-center pt-2 !invisible"><button disabled="" class="dark:text-white disabled:text-gray-300 dark:disabled:text-gray-400"><svg stroke="currentColor" fill="none" stroke-width="1.5" viewBox="0 0 24 24" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" class="h-3 w-3" height="1em" width="1em" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg"><polyline points="15 18 9 12 15 6"></polyline></svg></button><span class="flex-grow flex-shrink-0">1 / 1</span><button disabled="" class="dark:text-white disabled:text-gray-300 dark:disabled:text-gray-400"><svg stroke="currentColor" fill="none" stroke-width="1.5" viewBox="0 0 24 24" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" class="h-3 w-3" height="1em" width="1em" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg"><polyline points="9 18 15 12 9 6"></polyline></svg></button></div><div class="text-gray-400 flex self-end lg:self-center justify-center mt-2 gap-2 md:gap-3 lg:gap-1 lg:absolute lg:top-0 lg:translate-x-full lg:right-0 lg:mt-0 lg:pl-2 visible"><button class="flex ml-auto gap-2 h-full w-full rounded-md p-1 hover:bg-gray-100 hover:text-gray-700 dark:text-gray-400 dark:hover:bg-gray-700 dark:hover:text-gray-200 disabled:dark:hover:text-gray-400"><svg stroke="currentColor" fill="none" stroke-width="2" viewBox="0 0 24 24" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" class="h-4 w-4" height="1em" width="1em" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg"><path d="M16 4h2a2 2 0 0 1 2 2v14a2 2 0 0 1-2 2H6a2 2 0 0 1-2-2V6a2 2 0 0 1 2-2h2"></path><rect x="8" y="2" width="8" height="4" rx="1" ry="1"></rect></svg></button><button class="p-1 rounded-md hover:bg-gray-100 hover:text-gray-700 dark:text-gray-400 dark:hover:bg-gray-700 dark:hover:text-gray-200 disabled:dark:hover:text-gray-400"><svg stroke="currentColor" fill="none" stroke-width="2" viewBox="0 0 24 24" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" class="h-4 w-4" height="1em" width="1em" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg"><path d="M14 9V5a3 3 0 0 0-3-3l-4 9v11h11.28a2 2 0 0 0 2-1.7l1.38-9a2 2 0 0 0-2-2.3zM7 22H4a2 2 0 0 1-2-2v-7a2 2 0 0 1 2-2h3"></path></svg></button><button class="p-1 rounded-md hover:bg-gray-100 hover:text-gray-700 dark:text-gray-400 dark:hover:bg-gray-700 dark:hover:text-gray-200 disabled:dark:hover:text-gray-400"><svg stroke="currentColor" fill="none" stroke-width="2" viewBox="0 0 24 24" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" class="h-4 w-4" height="1em" width="1em" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg"><path d="M10 15v4a3 3 0 0 0 3 3l4-9V2H5.72a2 2 0 0 0-2 1.7l-1.38 9a2 2 0 0 0 2 2.3zm7-13h2.67A2.31 2.31 0 0 1 22 4v7a2.31 2.31 0 0 1-2.33 2H17"></path></svg></button></div></div></div></div></div><div class="w-full h-32 md:h-48 flex-shrink-0"></div></div></div></div></div><div class="absolute bottom-0 left-0 w-full border-t md:border-t-0 dark:border-white/20 md:border-transparent md:dark:border-transparent md:bg-vert-light-gradient bg-white dark:bg-gray-800 md:!bg-transparent dark:md:bg-vert-dark-gradient pt-2"><form class="stretch mx-2 flex flex-row gap-3 last:mb-2 md:mx-4 md:last:mb-6 lg:mx-auto lg:max-w-2xl xl:max-w-3xl"><div class="relative flex h-full flex-1 items-stretch md:flex-col"><div class="flex flex-col w-full py-2 flex-grow md:py-3 md:pl-4 relative border border-black/10 bg-white dark:border-gray-900/50 dark:text-white dark:bg-gray-700 rounded-md shadow-[0_0_10px_rgba(0,0,0,0.10)] dark:shadow-[0_0_15px_rgba(0,0,0,0.10)]"><textarea tabindex="0" data-id="af6040e2-e6ef-4747-9cf7-44dbf44d373e" rows="1" placeholder="Send a message." class="m-0 w-full resize-none border-0 bg-transparent p-0 pr-7 focus:ring-0 focus-visible:ring-0 dark:bg-transparent pl-2 md:pl-0" style="max-height: 200px;
