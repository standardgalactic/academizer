Good afternoon everybody, bienvenue Ã  tous, my name is David Eidelman, I'm Vice-Principal
Health Affairs and Dean of the Faculty of Medicine and Health Sciences and it's my pleasure
to welcome you all to a session on Healthcare in Deep Space, Autonomous Medicine Practical
AI in Advanced Simulation. This is the session's part of McGill Space Week as you know and
it's a signature event of McGill's bicentennial celebrations. You know, we just heard about
AI, we heard about the application of existing technologies and we heard about complexity
and space missions obviously are the prototype of highly complex systems operating in an
environment in which you have to handle lots of heterogeneous data and information sets
and in order to be successful in space flight you have to figure out how to do this and to
do that you need to really know what you're talking about and now Professor Smith is going
to describe the foundational principles necessary to integrate all aspects of complex systems
including emission systems using biologic and other data and into an information architecture
that really supports the use of advanced modular algorithms and so Professor Smith, the floor
is yours, I'm going to transfer over, take it away.
So I'm not going to be able to do all of that but I will try and do at least some samples
which will give you an idea of how it could be done and I'll start with some background.
So I started life as a philosopher working on metaphysics. Recently I started a whole
new line of thinking. I'm about to publish a book with a German AI entrepreneur colleague
of mine on artificial intelligence which more or less agrees with everything that Gary
Marcus says in his book but takes it further so we try and document in great detail the
limits of AI when dealing specifically with complex systems such as organisms and missions
to Mars and so forth and if we've got time I may come back to show the relevance of that
to the main topic here so which goes back to 2002 when I was awarded a prize to establish
an institute in Germany to deal with the ontology of medicine and this prize was awarded because
people working in computational ontology already then had started to use some of my ideas from
philosophical ontology so I started the institute and the first thing I realized was that I was
probably going to be spending the rest of my life studying one single ontology which was
the gene ontology which John mentioned already. Gene ontology solved a very considerable problem
namely the problem of making human genome and mouse genome and fly genome data useful for medicine
and the idea was that the gene ontology provided a systematic semantically well-grounded common
consensus terminology across all organisms and all disciplines which could be used to tag sequences
whether they're gene sequences or protein sequences or any other kind of sequence
and this was a great success it was brought to my attention very early on in working in this new
institute and the first thing I realized about it was it was full of mistakes and mistakes of a
logical nature which a philosopher learns about in the first logic class at the beginning of their
studies and so I had money for the new institute I invited the leadership of the gene ontology to
come to the institute in Leipzig and I went through pointing out all the mistakes that they were
making so this is just one example a lytic vacuole within a protein storage vacuole is classified
by the gene ontology as a protein storage vacuole it was then this is a bit like saying that an
embryo within a uterus is a uterus it's an ontological mistake of a very simple logical
sort and in those days the gene ontology was full of such mistakes it was also doing the job of
providing semantic definitions useful to humans in a way which involves similar kinds of mistakes so
this is a circular definition it's not a good definition it doesn't and it cannot tell you
anything about the meaning of hemolysis because the word is used in the definition so I presented
a talk at the meeting in Leipzig entitled stop or smart terminology through ontological principles
and the the head of the gene ontology initiative Michael Ashburner at the end of who was in the
room on the front row smiling throughout he took me behind the curtain and he made a deal with me
he said Barry I will put you in charge of the logic of the gene ontology and in return you will
promise never to criticize the gene ontology in public and I sold my soul I said yes I'm not
criticizing the gene ontology today the gene ontology has improved in part I think because of
some of the things I did but more importantly I helped the gene ontology to marshal or heard
the many cats that is to say the many other ontologies which were being built in biomedicine
in its wake ontologies in areas like proteomics or anatomy or disease and some of the ontologies
mentioned by John earlier today were built precisely in this effervescence of ontology
creativity in medicine or in let's say biology to be careful which arose as a result of the
success of the gene ontology so the oboe foundry is a collection of ontologies which are built to
be interoperable from the very start so this is anticipating silos and deliberately taking
steps establishing principles to avoid the the appearance of those silos by ensuring that everybody
involved in the ontology building effort is aware of what everyone else who is involved
in the ontology building effort at the points where the ontologies overlap so that the overlap is
always such that the ontologies which do overlap are consistent in those areas so this is a picture
of the of the oboe foundry as it then was basic formal ontology is the very top level of the
gene ontology it's a reverse engineered generalization of the gene ontology which covers
everything in the universe but only at a very general metaphysical level and we'll see a bit
more about what that means later on so basic formal ontology is the key to the unifiability
of all the ontologies which are built in a way that descends from basic formal ontology it provides
the starting point for defining the terms in non-circular ways in principle in every other
ontology we've got now to 2005 now this this is a hub and spokes model of ontology development
you start with the top level and then you move to a slightly the most specific level and then
you move from there to a slightly more specific level all the while maintaining maximal consistency
in areas where ontologies overlap and this works it worked really well and the army heard about it
and in 2008 I was presenting a talk which was designed to help the army solve problems that
they had with silos in their data from Afghanistan at the time and it was the army eventually which
sponsored the proposal to make BFO an international standard ISO IEC 21838-2 I'll come back to that
well it's here actually there are two parts the first part standardizes what it means to be a top
level ontology so an ontology that can serve as a universal general hub for the spokes which are
created by domain ontologies and then part two shows that BFO is satisfying the requirements for
being a top level ontology set forth in part one and these standards are both in the public domain
you don't have to pay for them and BFO of course is also in the public domain it's used now by some
500 different initiatives and the number grows all the time so in 2010 my colleagues in Buffalo
received a very large IARPA grant to create a set of ontologies to deal with everything in the
universe these are called the common core ontologies they they were built to satisfy some needs of
the intelligence community which are not important here but what is important is that some of the
ontologies within that ecosystem were created for space and this is just a few examples so
this is the common core ontologies ecosystem the space ontologies are down here so we have
space event ontology space object ontology is space mission ontology and so and we deal with
things like residence space objects such as satellites missions functions components and
so forth these are the space objects and then we have object aggregates we have orbits so this
is the ontology of different kinds of orbits you thought the idea of orbit was simple and it is
not simple and then we have missions and maneuvers we have sensors and now we get back to medicine
so John made a number of points concerning what we would need to address if we wanted to have
useful medicine ontology and it's rather easy it's probably too easy to build ontologies the
problem is to build useful ontologies and useful ontologies should be interoperable with existing
useful ontologies and so there is a certain homesteading effect in the world of ontology if
you have ontologies which are already serving a purpose and doing it very well then you should
if you want to build an ontology in a related domain you should ensure that you build your
ontology by using what exists already as your starting point this very often doesn't happen
because you you get paid for doing something new and for reusing what already exists it's
hard to get paid and so there is a certain tendency to promote silo formation of the
sort which John described so how do we build a useful space medicine ontology that was in fact
part of what we were trying to do from the very beginning in the medical information science
although of course we had no idea that this would become particularly relevant in the in the space
context so what we want to do is to document medical knowledge especially as it's relevant to
space travel and then we want to find an optimal way in which relevant knowledge can be retrieved
on a mission and the idea would be that you have all the medical knowledge that there is
and you have some way of finding the medical knowledge that you need that can can find that
knowledge very quickly and very successfully and the problem is that all the medical knowledge that
you have is full of garbage and this is one of the reasons why foundation models as described by
Gary are so unhelpful when it comes to mission critical applications so why is the and totality
of medical knowledge that we have full of garbage well first of all doctors make mistakes
and medical science advances doctors don't always keep pace with medical advances some of them do
some of them don't and so doctors have conflicts they have inconsistent diagnoses sometimes for
the same patient and all of this gets added to the totality of medical knowledge all of the
emr's which exists and all of the problem lists which exist grow and get bigger and bigger and
get added to the totality of medical knowledge all records are still records when doctors make
diagnoses clinical coders have to document those diagnoses using clinical codes and those clinical
coders make errors in coding and they have certain tendencies and habits to code in certain ways and
different coders have different habits and then worst of all and that's what i'm going to talk
about next is that the coding systems change and this is good because medical science advances
but the coding systems should change gracefully and they should change in such a way that
changes then can be fed back to filter out the consequences of the older systems which have
been shown to be no longer scientifically coherent and even worse than coding systems themselves
ferment errors because some of the coding systems are to be honest badly built and and then coding
systems generate forking this is a problem that we will see in a minute all right now i could say
bad things about most medical coding systems i'm afraid i had a a long career in which i was
comparable to the little boy who says that the emperor does not have any clothes where the emperor
were was world leading medical coding systems communities it was an exciting time this is
a quote from gary so foundation models he says are more like parlor tricks than genuine intelligence
unfortunately the the problems in medicine don't even yield the parlor tricks they're not interesting
errors they're just errors of a very messy sort now let's look at snow med ct which john already
mentioned and he mentioned roger cotay i will mention a story about roger cotay which i'm not
sure is true but certainly there's some truth to it cotay visited the Vatican he wanted to present
the six volumes of snow med ct to the pope and so he was chatting with the pope and the pope was
looking at six volumes and then the pope raised his head and he said are you aware that this spells
demons backwards now whether that is a true story or not uh no one will ever know so this is a little
piece of snow med showing how it changed from 2016 to 2017 it's a very very trivial example but it
will show you how you get bloat so this is the opposite of silos bloat is when you get inconsistent
data because there isn't a silo in 2016 a test kit is classified as a substance which may or
may not be good in 2017 is classified as a physical object which also may or may not be good but the
fact that you have both of those classifications in your system is going to mean that data about
test kits which was entered into the record in 2016 will conflict with data about test kits
entered in 2017 and that's not good if it happens all the time now here we have 2015 2016 we see
that there is on the left a joint finding and disorder of musculoskeletal system these are both
parents of orthopathy which is a disorder now a disorder is something on the side of the patient
it's a broken leg or it's a disease a finding is something on the side of a physician it's what
the physician finds or discovers in the world one of the same thing should not be both on the side
of the patient and on the side of the clinician it's a very basic error snow med is full of that
error there are so many different ways in which that error is made in snow med that snow med
generates bloat and now this is just one term in snow med and two versions 2002 and 2010 so the term
is excision biopsy of vulva lesion this term is chosen at random you would get similar bloats for
the many terms so every single track through this monster can be found if you join snow med 2002
with 2010 and the clinical coders are coding at different levels within this monster they're
putting down data about one and the same medical phenomenon namely the process of biopsy from a
vulva lesion and they're each coding that with a different code for how it looks is this so this is
just this is from that diagram i've just zoomed a little bit procedure characterized by action
status is a navigational concept in snow med that means it tells you how you've got that concept or
something and then you have procedure carried out on subject which is what snow med calls a
situation we're also told that it's a procedure carried out which is another situation but at
the same time it's a procedure on a body system which is a procedure so we have four ontologically
different things namely navigational concept situations and procedures applied to one and the
same medical phenomenon and the reason is that snow med's top level is incoherent now it's
incoherent has been recognized for some years by what we might call the intellectual leaders of the
snow med community and each year they propose to the general snow med management assembly
that they should drop the snow med top level and re-architect snow med using bfo
there is now reason to be optimistic that they will finally achieve a majority vote
the fo does not allow that kind of forking it doesn't allow four different terms of the very
high ontological level to be applied to one and the same item it's built on good ontological
principles and it's much simpler to use than the snow med top level and it makes clear distinctions
between things like entities on the side of the patient and entities on the side of the clinician
so how do we get a useful space medicine ontology well nasa has a chief information officer and
they have a an information system which is an information system covering all of the astronauts
whoever existed in in the west and all the families of all the astronauts it's very high
level it uses unfortunately multiple coding systems but all of the coding systems could in
principle be unified and focused on a revised version of snow med which is what the nasa cio should
be calling for a revised version with a proper top level it should eliminate the errors basically
where they are easily identifiable and it's here i think that ai could play a role because
we already have a large amount of data which is relevant to space missions because the astronauts
are involved it's maintained and curated by top level clinicians and it's accessible already it
just needs to be filtered to remove inconsistencies and um well i just conclude so would therefore
be useful for space medicine as john explained it would be useful for everyone else because it
would serve as a kind of ground truth uh the equivalent of a foundation model but one which
would have been well built and uh i won't try and talk about a deep mind i will uh i will stop
and uh hope you're all still there
