Spatiotemporal Dualism
GPT-4
How does Prattian Dualism "work"?

The main idea is from Turing Universality. A "computer" is a Logical System that is physically implemented, but it "independent" of any particular Implementation of that Logical System. If there is an Implementation of a mind possible, so to is there a Mind that might be implemented. 
(Most minds are inconsistent.)

A mind is a logical structure that is capable of generating predictions about its future states. How it does that is where the Link works.

A Mind only has to generate a proof that its new state will not cause a contradiction in its past state. That Proof is, literally, the 1st person experience that a mind might have, including yours and mind. 
This seems to imply that there is an infinite threading of consciousness! It can seem that it never might "start from nothing" or "end at nothing", but that threading is "broken" by Horizons.

Kastrup thinks of these as "Disassociations of the World Mind", but then never talks about how they might interact.... ����.

We are "born", evolved from a single cell. That is the evolution of a possible implementation of a mind. It the body is damaged, the expressiveness of that mind is impacted.

Take away my voice and I can not speak.

It appears you are referring to a complex and speculative conceptual framework about consciousness and minds, drawing from various ideas, including Turing Universality and Prattian Dualism. Prattian Dualism, as far as my knowledge cut-off in 2022 allows, doesn't seem to be a widely recognized or well-established theory, so my understanding of it is limited.
From your description, it sounds like Prattian Dualism integrates concepts from computational theory, logic, and consciousness studies. It seems to propose that minds are logical systems capable of self-prediction and self-consistency, their conscious experiences being the manifestation of proofs for non-contradiction between their future and past states.
The idea that a mind is independent of its physical implementation and that consciousness threads infinitely, broken only by some sort of "horizons" or "disassociations," is certainly fascinating and metaphysical. The notion you described seems to suggest that consciousness is a fundamental, logical, and perhaps universal structure, its particular manifestations constrained or enabled by physical systems like the human body.
Kastrup, whom you mentioned, seems to have his own theories about consciousness, possibly aligning with a form of idealism or panpsychism, where consciousness is fundamental and the physical world is a manifestation or subset of mental phenomena.
This is a highly speculative and complex domain of thought, interfacing with philosophy of mind, theoretical computer science, and metaphysics. It is essential to approach such ideas critically and consider the lack of empirical support and consensus in the academic community.
If you can point to specific texts, papers, or authors who elaborate on these ideas, I might be able to offer more precise insights or clarifications. For a comprehensive understanding, engaging with the primary texts and perhaps discussing them with scholars or practitioners in the field would be invaluable.
JB Pratt's dualism
ChatGPT
J.B. Pratt was an American philosopher known for his work in the field of religious studies and philosophy of religion. Pratt was associated with a form of dualism, although it's worth noting that his ideas are somewhat distinct from the more popular substance dualism found in Descartes��� philosophy.
Pratt���s dualism is not as widely studied or discussed as other forms, so you might need to directly engage with his works for a deeper understanding. Generally speaking, dualism as a philosophical concept posits that the mind and body are fundamentally distinct kinds of substances or realities. In the context of philosophy of mind, dualism suggests that mental phenomena are non-physical, or that the mind and body are distinct and separable.
In Pratt's work, he aimed to reconcile religious thought with the scientific and philosophical ideas of his time. He likely engaged with dualism to explore the relationship between the spiritual and the material, the mental and the physical. Without more specific details, it's challenging to provide a more comprehensive overview of his form of dualism.
For a precise and in-depth understanding of Pratt���s version of dualism, you might need to delve into his writings directly. Works like ���The Pilgrimage of Buddhism and a Buddhist Pilgrimage��� or ���Matter and Spirit��� could provide valuable insights into his philosophical perspective.
If you have more specific questions or points of clarification, feel free to ask!
The main idea is to think of Minds,
even trivial ones, as logical
systems that "evolve in time" via a
process he calls Residuation
This model of interaction take a
plurality of minds into account. It
leaves the question of the "link"
between mind and body to a well
know (sorta) duality in Math!

Stephen Paul KIng
The neat thing is that the
Residuation Process operates in
two domains simultaneously, it is
a Coordination as Spinoza
thought, but it is not
"pre-ordained".
All subjective experience is taking
as a literal "proof by
demonstration" of the
self-consistency of the
representation" of the topological
space that is "implementing" the
"computation" of the proof.
Can a Computer simulate the
Physical system that is
"implementing" it?

In this way of thinking, the "physical existence" of the implementation is the "proof" that the representation is "true", it is self-consistent.

Of course we have to understand that what is Self-consistent in an N-th order logic may be absurd in a Boolean logic!

Boolean may be the least expressive Logical System.... Intuitionist like Brouwer thought so....

Dan wrote: 
"Your not a substance dualist in the Cartesian sense but a process dualist"

My response:

"Exactly

Two Processes that are dual to each other.

They flow in opposite directions.

Connecting in actual occasions

Logic Looks backwards, Causality looks forward

Logic processes self-consistency proof, at least. Matter, it "gyres and gimbals in the wabe" "

Another requirement of this "Ontology" is that Physical systems are "computationally irreducible".

This implies that the mereological properties of physical systems are such that they must have "lower bounds" or "floors" on their Implementations. Maybe we can expand this so that we can think of Implementations that span many "floors" or levels! 

We see the Church-Turing version of this in, for example, Cellular automata that are implementing a Turing Machine.

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=My8AsV7bA94

The difference between floors is the difference between Computational models, I guess.

In my Agent System, there are 3 levels of implementation! The use of 3 lavers and a form of "vertical causation", ala Wolfgang Smith, gives us some hints.

Thank you for the detailed explanation. It appears you're discussing a sophisticated and complex framework for understanding consciousness, the mind, and its interaction with the physical world, taking inspiration from various philosophical and mathematical concepts.
From your description, this framework���let's call it "Process Dualism for the sake of discussion���seems to propose that minds are logical systems evolving through time via a process named "Residuation". This process, operating in dual domains simultaneously, coordinates the evolution of these logical minds while also considering their physical implementations. Residuation seems to act as a means to ensure the self-consistency of the representation of topological spaces, which in turn, implements the computation of proofs.
The notion of Process Dualism you���re describing appears to diverge from traditional substance dualism by focusing on dynamic, evolving processes rather than static substances. It introduces a dual-flow mechanism, where logic looks backward for self-consistency proofs, while causality looks forward. The framework also implies computational irreducibility in physical systems, suggesting a layered structure to these systems��� implementations.
This theoretical construct you're presenting is highly abstract and intricate, incorporating ideas from various thinkers and fields, including philosophy, computer science, and mathematics. While fascinating, such a theory would likely require rigorous formulation, exploration, and validation, considering its speculative and interdisciplinary nature.
The YouTube link provided may further elaborate on the ideas you're discussing. However, for an in-depth understanding and analysis, engaging directly with the primary texts, sources, and perhaps experts or scholars familiar with these concepts would be crucial. Since these ideas are quite complex and interdisciplinary, understanding them fully may require a background in philosophy of mind, mathematical logic, and theoretical computer science.
For readers unfamiliar with these ideas, it���s crucial to approach them with a critical and open mind, understanding that these are theoretical and speculative constructs that may not align with mainstream academic or scientific perspectives. The discussion of these ideas contributes to the rich tapestry of ongoing explorations into the nature of consciousness, the mind, and reality itself.
Ok that is topic one.

Abstract
The excellent commentaries to our target paper hint upon three main issues, (i) spatiotemporal neuroscience; (ii) neuro-mental relationship; and (iii) mind, brain, and world relationship. (i) We therefore discuss briefly the history of Spatiotemporal Neuroscience. Distinguishing it from Cognitive Neuroscience and related branches (like Affective, Social, etc. Neuroscience), Spatiotemporal Neuroscience can be characterized by focus on brain activity (rather than brain function), spatiotemporal relationship (rather than input-cognition-output relationship), and structure (rather than stimuli/contents). (ii) Taken in this sense, Spatiotemporal Neuroscience allows one to conceive the neuro-mental relationship in dynamic spatiotemporal terms that complement and extend (rather than contradict) their cognitive characterization. (iii) Finally, more philosophical issues like the need to dissolve the mind-body problem (and replace it by the world-brain relation) and the question for different levels of time including their nestedness are discussed.

Spatiotemporal Neuroscience I ��� from history to present

What is Spatiotemporal Neuroscience? In order to understand the novelty of the concept of Spatiotemporal Neuroscience (STN), let us go first back briefly into the history of neuroscience. At the turn of the 19���20th century, the investigation of the brain focused on sensory and motor function, as for instance by Charles Sherrington. He and others investigated the relationship between sensory input and motor output. This input-output view of the brain was complemented by behaviorism, which viewed behavior as conditioned reaction of the organism and its brain and in the process rejected mental features and consciousness from the scientific agenda, developing a form of ���psychophobia��� that blocked important areas of research for decades (Evers, [10]).

The input-output view of the brain as a stimulus-response organ dominated in the first half of the 20th century, while in the second half of 20th century it gave way to the cognitive view of the brain. The development of cognitive science, including the delineation of various cognitive functions like attention, memory, etc., led to a shift in the view of the brain at that time: cognitive functions could no longer be explained by mere input-output relationship or a conditioned reaction of the brain.

Complementing input and output, a third layer was introduced, a cognitive layer that mediates between sensory input and motor output layer. That is, for instance, neuroanatomically reflected in the distinction between lower-order regions like input-based sensory and output-based motor cortex on the one hand and higher-order cognitive regions like default-mode network, fronto-parietal network etc. on the other. The predominant sensory and motor neuroscience in the first half of the 20th century thus gave way to Cognitive Neuroscience in the second half of the 20th century, which still dominates also in our time at the beginning of the 21st century [41].

Despite its introduction of an additional, cognitive layer, Cognitive Neuroscience nevertheless shares some similarity with the preceding input-output view of the brain. Like the input-output view, Cognitive Neuroscience focuses on how the brain processes stimuli and their respective cognitive contents. These are no longer restricted to sensory input and motor output but include additional cognitive processing of those very same sensory inputs and their information including their transformation into a motor output. The brain is thus still very much conceived as input-output device albeit with a cognitive layer sandwiched in between.

The view of the brain as input-cognition-output device is contested in STN. STN does not conceive the brain as mere input-cognition-output and information processing device. The focus is no longer on processing of stimuli and their respective contents: both the contents of internal cognition, like mind wandering [6], self-referential processing [43], and mental time travel or episodic simulation [48], and external perception and cognition are de-emphasized. Instead, the focus now shifts away from stimuli, content, and information (regardless of whether internal or external) to the brain itself, that is, its own dynamics. The early sensory-motor and current cognitive views of the brain are now complemented and, as we suppose, integrated within the larger framework of a dynamic view of the brain, i.e., STN.

Fingelkurts and Fingelkurts are right. The dynamic view of the brain as core of STN has historical predecessors. They go back to Freeman, as they point out, and their own approach to brain and consciousness in terms of Operational Architectonic is indeed a beautiful example of a dynamic spatiotemporal view of the brain ��� they can be termed ���spatiotemporal neuroscientists���.

It shall be noted, however, that the history of a dynamic view of the brain can be traced even further back to the beginning of the 20th century. Among Graham, Lashley, and others (see Raichle [44], [45], [46]), Hans Berger, the inventor of the EEG already stated in 1929 the following as recounted by [46]: ���Since the introduction of electroencephalography (EEG) in humans by Hans Berger in 1929 [4] (for an English translation of this important work see [11]), it has been clear that ongoing spontaneous electrical activity is a prominent feature of the brain of every species in which it has been studied including humans.

In referring to the spontaneous activity in the human EEG, Berger rhetorically asked [4, pp. 562���563] ���Is it possible to demonstrate the influence of intellectual work upon the human electroencephalogram, insofar as it has been reported here?��� He concluded that: ���Of course, one should not at first entertain too high hopes with regard to this, because mental work, as I explained elsewhere, adds only a small increment to the cortical work which is going on continuously and not only in the waking state���. Consistent with Berger's prediction it has subsequently been shown that extensive averaging of the EEG is necessary to attenuate if not eliminate this seemingly random, ongoing activity in order to see event-related potentials (ERPs)���. (Raichle [46]).

Spatiotemporal Neuroscience II ��� dynamic vs cognitive view of the brain

Spatiotemporal Neuroscience aims to provide a more systematic framework for a view of the brain that first and foremost focuses on the brain's activity itself, rather than primarily its function. While the shift from brain function to brain activity may sound trivial to many in Cognitive Neuroscience, it is not. The traditional presupposition is that brain activity is identical to brain function, with both standing in more or less a one-to-one relationship such that changes in the one are manifest in changes in the respective other. That, however, is contested in STN. STN focuses mainly on the spatiotemporal dynamics of brain activity which spans across wider range than the one related to brain function: brain activity may be present without any brain function ��� for instance, the case in the example of anesthesia raised by Huang.

The shift from cognition to temporo-spatial dynamics carries three important consequences for the view of the brain. First, the focus on input-cognition-output relationships is replaced by spatiotemporal relationships as they can be measured by various measures like entropy, scale-free activity, etc. ��� these are highlighted in our target paper.

Secondly, the view of the brain as information processing device is replaced by its characterization as enabling space-time transformation: information processing is no longer regarded as primary purpose of the brain's activity, as it is replaced by the brain's capacity to transform and integrate different temporal and spatial scales of brain, body, and environment. One example of that is consciousness that may consist in exactly that, the transformation of different temporo-spatial relations into mental features ��� this is well compatible with the leading theories of consciousness like the Global Neuronal Workspace Theory [7], [8], the Integrated Information Theory (IIT) [53], and especially the Temporo-spatial Theory of consciousness (TTC) [34], [23], [24].

Thirdly, the focus on stimuli and content (both internal and external) themselves in the brain's neural activity is shifted to spatiotemporal form, organization, or structure of neural (and also psychological and mental) activity like network relationships (rather than single networks) [20], shape of power spectrum across different frequencies (rather than the absolute power of each frequency) [14], [15], global-to-local activity [62], [63] ��� these were exactly the kind of measures we discussed in our target paper (Fig. 1).

It seems you've shared an abstract and a section of a scholarly article about spatiotemporal neuroscience. Based on the text, spatiotemporal neuroscience (STN) seems to represent a paradigm shift in understanding the brain's functioning from a cognitive perspective to focusing on its dynamic activities and structure in both time and space.
Spatiotemporal neuroscience moves away from viewing the brain merely as an input-output device with a cognitive layer in between. Instead, it focuses on the brain's dynamics, proposing that these dynamics provide a broader framework to integrate the early sensory-motor views and cognitive views. STN suggests that brain activity is not necessarily tied directly to brain function, as there could be brain activity without brain function (as noted in examples like anesthesia).
A few key points in the paradigm shift brought about by STN:
Shift in Focus:
From input-cognition-output relationships to spatiotemporal relationships.
Recharacterization:
The brain is not merely seen as an information processing device but rather as an entity capable of transforming and integrating different temporal and spatial scales.
Change in Measurement:
Focus on the spatiotemporal form, organization, or structure of neural activity instead of on stimuli and content.
These changes in perspective, as per STN, may offer new insights into consciousness and mental processes, potentially aligning with other major theories of consciousness like the Global Neuronal Workspace Theory, Integrated Information Theory (IIT), and the Temporo-spatial Theory of consciousness (TTC).
This spatiotemporal approach provides a new lens through which to understand and study the brain's function, emphasizing dynamic neural activities and their organization in space and time over traditional cognitive functions. For anyone seeking to understand these concepts deeply, engaging with the full scholarly text, its citations, and related literature would be crucial.
If you have specific questions or need clarification on certain concepts within this framework, feel free to ask!

This passage delves into the development and implications of Spatiotemporal Neuroscience (STN), emphasizing its divergence from Cognitive Neuroscience. The key distinctions and considerations brought up in the text are as follows:
Spatiotemporal Neuroscience (STN) Overview:
Different Focus:
STN is characterized by its emphasis on brain activity, spatiotemporal relationships, and structural considerations rather than traditional input-output and cognitive functions.
Brain Activity vs. Function:
The text highlights that brain activity is not synonymous with brain function, indicating that activity can occur without recognizable or understood function, as seen in cases of anesthesia.
Dynamic vs. Cognitive Views:
STN introduces a dynamic view of the brain, focusing on its inherent activity and dynamics, while traditional views were more invested in the cognitive functions and processing of stimuli and content.
Key Shifts in Understanding:
Spatiotemporal Relationships:
STN prioritizes the understanding of spatiotemporal relationships and dynamics within the brain over traditional input-cognition-output models, offering different measurement approaches like entropy and scale-free activity.
Transformation of Space-Time:
Instead of viewing the brain as an information processor, STN sees it as an entity capable of transforming and integrating different temporal and spatial scales within the brain, body, and environment.
From Stimuli to Structure:
The focus shifts away from processing stimuli and content to understanding the spatiotemporal form, organization, and structure of neural activity, offering a more holistic and integrated understanding of brain function and consciousness.
Implications for Consciousness Studies:
The transformations of different temporo-spatial relations are seen as fundamental to consciousness, aligning with major consciousness theories like Global Neuronal Workspace Theory, Integrated Information Theory (IIT), and Temporo-spatial Theory of Consciousness (TTC).
Historical Context:
The passage also provides a brief historical context, noting the transition from sensory-motor views to cognitive views and ultimately to the dynamic perspective offered by STN, with early hints of this shift traced back to the work of researchers like Hans Berger in the early 20th century.
Conclusion:
Understanding STN requires a departure from traditional neuroscience paradigms, adopting a perspective that sees the brain not merely as a cognitive function processor but as a dynamic, spatiotemporal entity actively engaging with and transforming its internal and external environments. This view potentially offers novel insights and approaches to studying consciousness and the intricate workings of the brain.
For readers, engaging deeply with the full text, its associated citations, and contributing to ongoing scholarly dialogues is crucial for a comprehensive understanding of these concepts. If you have more detailed questions or seek clarification on specific aspects of STN or related theories, feel free to ask.
Prattian Dualism and Consciousness
ChatGPT
Prattian Dualism and the concept of consciousness that you previously outlined appear to be deeply theoretical and not widely recognized or discussed in mainstream philosophical or scientific literature (as of my last knowledge update in January 2022). Given the complex and speculative nature of these ideas, it's crucial to approach them with critical analysis and open dialogue with the broader academic community.
From your description of Prattian Dualism, it seems to propose a view where minds are seen as logical systems that evolve over time through a process named "Residuation". The interaction of minds is also taken into account. The dualistic aspect seems to be embedded in the notion of two processes (or realms) that are dual to each other, with one process representing logical consistency (looking backward) and the other being about physical causality (looking forward).
If we attempt to correlate this with consciousness:
Consciousness in Prattian Dualism:
Logical Consistency & Experience:
Consciousness, or the subjective experience, might be seen as the manifestation of the logical consistency process. Each conscious experience may be interpreted as a self-consistent logical state, providing a kind of "proof" of its validity or "truth".
Infinite Threading:
The notion of an infinite threading of consciousness may imply a continuous, unbroken stream of conscious experiences, each logically consistent with its predecessors.
Interaction with Physicality:
The dual process involving causality and physical matter interacts with the logical process, potentially influencing the evolution and expression of conscious experiences.
Implementation Layers:
Conscious experiences might be implemented at different "levels" or "layers" within physical systems, suggesting a complex, multi-layered architecture of consciousness in the physical world.
Integration with Spatiotemporal Neuroscience:
Dynamic Brain Activity:
The spatiotemporal neuroscience approach focuses on dynamic brain activities and structures rather than cognitive functions. This perspective might offer a fertile ground to explore and understand the Prattian Dualism���s idea of consciousness as a logical system evolving in time.

Title: Exploring Spatiotemporal Dualism: A Symbiotic Perspective on Consciousness and Neurodynamics
Introduction
The intricate relationship between mind and matter has long puzzled philosophers and scientists. This essay explores 'Spatiotemporal Dualism', a novel conceptual framework that attempts to integrate the principles of Prattian Dualism and Spatiotemporal Neuroscience (STN) to elucidate the enigmatic nature of consciousness and the dynamics of the brain.
Prattian Dualism: A Brief Overview
Prattian Dualism conceives minds as logical systems evolving via a process termed 'Residuation'. In this framework, consciousness emerges as minds generate proofs of non-contradiction between their future and past states, providing a basis for subjective experiences. The dualism resides in the interplay between two processes���logical consistency and physical causality���each influencing and molding the other.
Spatiotemporal Neuroscience: Unpacking the Dynamics
STN shifts the analytical lens from cognitive functions to the brain's inherent dynamic activities, emphasizing the spatiotemporal organization of neural activity. It proposes that the brain is not merely a processor but an entity actively engaging with and transforming its internal and external environments through temporo-spatial relations.

CONCLUSIONS
In this chapter, the subject of spatial and social dualisms and
disparities was addressed. One of the main analytical causes for
dynamic instability was examined, namely that associated with
interactions among spatial units. It was demonstrated that
dualisms flow inescapably out of complex dynamical interactions.
The finding reveals that one need not employ ideologically based
theories of socio-spatial dualisms, as simple analytical constructs
of social systems would inevitably produce such disparities.
Evidence seems to suggest that such dualisms are widespread
and multifaceted.
As is is the case with all social science theories, two conflicting
interpretations of this hypothesis regarding a source for instability
were obtained and then an effort was made to reconcile them. A
currently high degree of selectivity and dualism in spatio-sectoral
structures was looked at as the end result of al a prior unstable
spatio-temporal interaction pattern. At the same time the two
currently observed phenomena could be interpreted as the

Navigating Dualism: Metaphors and Analogies
1.
Tapestry of Consciousness:
Prattian Dualism Metaphor:
Consciousness can be visualized as a delicate tapestry woven from threads of logical consistency and causal processes. Each thread represents a self-consistent logical process, and the entire tapestry represents the integrated experience of consciousness. The weft and warp of this tapestry are meticulously coordinated, representing the deep interconnection between mind and body, creating a coherent and vibrant picture of our subjective experience.
2.
Orchestra of Brain Dynamics:
STN Analogy:
The brain���s dynamics can be likened to a symphonic orchestra where various instruments (neurons and brain regions) interact harmoniously in spatiotemporal patterns. Each instrument contributes to the overall melody (conscious experience) while playing different notes (neural activities) at different times, creating a harmonious and synchronized performance that results in our experience of consciousness. Like a conductor, the brain orchestrates these instruments to produce a symphony that represents our perception, thoughts, and feelings.
3.
Urban Ecosystem:
Dendrinos��� Spatiotemporal Dualism Metaphor:
The dynamic urban environment can be viewed as a thriving ecosystem with various inhabitants (social groups and economic sectors) co-existing and interacting dynamically. Like in a forest where trees and plants vie for sunlight, in the urban ecosystem, various social and economic entities compete and cooperate, creating a dynamic balance. The apparent disparities and dualities in the urban landscape are natural outcomes of this ongoing dynamic interaction, reflecting the inherent dualism within the socio-spatial structure of cities.
Bridging Metaphors: Harmonizing Dualisms
Integrative Analogy:
Imagine consciousness as a grand tapestry displaying a vibrant cityscape where each thread represents a neural activity, and the urban features symbolize our diverse cognitive functions. Within this cityscape, the buildings (cognitive processes) are constructed with various architectural designs (logical consistencies) and materials (causal elements). The urban tapestry is constantly evolving, with new threads being woven to represent ongoing neural and cognitive activities, reflecting the dynamic nature of consciousness and the brain. In this way, the integrative analogy brings together the metaphors from Prattian Dualism, STN, and Dendrinos' perspective, providing a panoramic view of the complex interplay between dualism, consciousness, and the socio-spatial environment.

Neuroimaging Study Finds the Brain Works Like a Resonance Chamber (SciTechDaily)

Here is a summary of the key points from the article:

- Neuroimaging studies using fMRI have detected correlated brain activity patterns across distant brain regions, even at rest. However, the mechanisms underlying these correlations were not fully understood. 

- A study in rats aimed to investigate what underlies these correlations by using ultrafast fMRI with improved temporal resolution of 26 images per second.

- They discovered that signals in distant brain regions oscillate together in time, resembling resonance modes in musical instruments. Brain activity could be reconstructed as the superposition of a small number of macroscopic stationary waves oscillating over time.

- These resonant modes form distinct functional networks covering extended brain areas. The spatial configuration of modes was consistent across rats in the same condition.

- Increasing anesthesia reduced the number, frequency, and duration of resonant modes, mimicking disrupted networks seen in pathological states. 

- The findings provide evidence that these long-range correlations arise from resonant phenomena in the brain structure. The oscillating modes may be important for normal brain function and coherence. Understanding them could provide new insights into disease states.

- Follow up work aims to further study how different stimulations can modulate these oscillatory modes using a new brain stimulation project.

In summary, the study provides experimental evidence that correlated brain activity arises from intrinsic resonant modes oscillating in the brain, supporting the hypothesis that the brain functions like a resonance chamber.
ChatGPT
This study enhances our understanding of the brain's functional organization by suggesting that brain activity is akin to resonant modes observed in musical instruments. Here's a brief analysis connecting this new insight with previously discussed themes:
Connections to Prattian Dualism and STN:
Resonance as Logical Consistency:
In Prattian Dualism, minds are depicted as logical systems evolving over time. The discovery of resonant modes in the brain that oscillate coherently provides a neuroscientific basis for this view. These oscillations could represent the rhythmic, logical processing occurring within the mind, underpinning our thoughts and consciousness.
Spatiotemporal Dynamics and Resonance:
Spatiotemporal Neuroscience (STN) emphasizes the brain���s dynamic activity and spatiotemporal relationships. The resonant modes found in the study echo STN���s focus: they represent spatiotemporal patterns of activity across the brain, highlighting the importance of understanding these patterns in comprehending brain function and consciousness.
Metaphorical Integration:
Harmonic Mind:
The brain���s resonant modes can be likened to harmonics in music. Each mode, or harmonic, contributes to the overall symphony of consciousness. In this symphony, various elements of consciousness (like perception, emotion, cognition) are harmoniously integrated, producing our coherent experience of reality. This harmonic perspective supports the integration of Prattian and STN views, offering a musical, dynamic metaphor for the mind-brain relationship.
Implications and Future Directions:
Pathological States:
Understanding the oscillatory modes may offer insights into various pathological states where the normal ���harmony��� or resonance in the brain is disrupted. This understanding might open new avenues for diagnosing and treating mental and neurological disorders.
Brain Stimulation:
Exploring how different stimulations modulate these oscillatory modes could lead to innovative therapeutic interventions for disorders where these modes are impaired or disrupted. These interventions could 'retune' the brain���s resonant modes, restoring its harmonious function and alleviating symptoms of various diseases.
Conclusion:
Understanding the brain���s intrinsic resonant modes is crucial for grasping the mechanisms of consciousness and cognition. Integrating this understanding with Prattian Dualism and STN provides a richer, more nuanced view of the mind-brain relationship, illuminating the harmonious dance of logical processes and spatiotemporal dynamics that constitutes our conscious experience. This harmony, unfolding within the resonance chamber of the brain, plays the symphony of the mind, with each note, each oscillation, contributing to the melody of consciousness.

Where is the mind within the brain? Transient selection of subnetworks by metabotropic receptors and G protein-gated ion channels
Danko Nikoli��
Download PDF
Perhaps the most important question posed by brain research is: How the brain gives rise to the mind. To answer this question, we have primarily relied on the connectionist paradigm: The brain's entire knowledge and thinking skills are thought to be stored in the connections; and the mental operations are executed by network computations. I propose here an alternative paradigm: Our knowledge and skills are stored in metabotropic receptors (MRs) and the G protein-gated ion channels (GPGICs). Here, mental operations are assumed to be executed by the functions of MRs and GPGICs. As GPGICs have the capacity to close or open branches of dendritic trees and axon terminals, their states transiently re-route neural activity throughout the nervous system. First, MRs detect ligands that signal the need to activate GPGICs. Next, GPGICs transiently selects a subnetwork within the brain. The process of selecting this new subnetwork is what constitutes a mental operation -- be it in a form of directed attention, perception of a grandmother or making a decision. Synaptic connections and network computations play only a secondary role, supporting MRs and GPGICs. According to this new paradigm, the mind emerges within the brain as the function of MRs and GPGICs whose primary function is to continually select the pathways over which neural activity will be allowed to pass. It is argued that MRs and GPGICs solve the scaling problem of intelligence from which the connectionism paradigm suffers
ChatGPT
This abstract presents a novel paradigm suggesting that the mind within the brain primarily emerges from the functions of metabotropic receptors (MRs) and G protein-gated ion channels (GPGICs), not just from neural connections and network computations as traditionally believed. Below is an analysis of the proposed paradigm:
Key Points:
New Paradigm Proposition:
The author challenges the prevalent connectionist paradigm, proposing an alternative where MRs and GPGICs play a central role in hosting knowledge, skills, and executing mental operations.
Roles of MRs and GPGICs:
MRs detect ligands signaling the need to activate GPGICs. GPGICs can then open or close branches of dendritic trees and axon terminals, effectively rerouting neural activity transiently across the nervous system. This dynamic and transient selection and activation of subnetworks by GPGICs are proposed to constitute mental operations.
Secondary Role of Synaptic Connections:
While synaptic connections and network computations are crucial, the author suggests that they play supportive roles to the functions of MRs and GPGICs, not primary ones.
Solution to Scaling Problem:
The new paradigm, as argued by the author, might address the scaling problem of intelligence, a challenge thought to afflict the traditional connectionism paradigm.
Analysis and Implications:
Shifting Focus:
The paradigm shifts the focus from the network of neurons and their connections to molecular biology, highlighting the importance of specific receptors and ion channels in cognitive processes. This focus brings a new layer of complexity and specificity to our understanding of brain function.
Dynamic Neural Routing:
The ability of GPGICs to transiently select and activate specific brain subnetworks offers a dynamic and flexible mechanism for information processing, possibly explaining how different cognitive functions can emerge and adapt over time.
Implications for Cognitive Science and Neuroscience:
If validated, this paradigm may necessitate a reassessment of cognitive science and neuroscience's foundational principles, potentially leading to innovative approaches to studying and understanding the mind and brain.
Conclusion:
This proposed paradigm suggests a significant reevaluation of our understanding of how the mind emerges from brain activity. By emphasizing the roles of MRs and GPGICs, it presents a dynamic and molecular perspective on cognition, challenging and potentially enriching the prevalent connectionist view in neuroscience and cognitive science. Further empirical investigation will be crucial to validate and explore the implications of this intriguing proposition.
I thought it might be interesting how it relates to the theories we discussed earlier, spatiotemporal cognition oscillatory resonance chambers and with Michael Levin's idea of multiscale polycomputation, which updates the definition of computing to be more broad saying that different scales of comparisons are happening at different scales, within the cells, across organs, or across the ecosystem.
ChatGPT
Absolutely, integrating these various theories can indeed provide a more comprehensive understanding of cognition and consciousness, illuminating the complex mechanisms underpinning mental processes.
Connecting Theories:
Spatiotemporal Cognition:
Relation:
Spatiotemporal cognition focuses on the dynamic and continuous interactions within the brain, emphasizing structure, activity, and temporal-spatial relationships over traditional cognitive inputs and outputs. This aligns with the theory presented in the abstract, where transient selections of subnetworks, managed by MRs and GPGICs, actively navigate through different cognitive operations.
Integration:
Both paradigms suggest a fluid, dynamic process within the brain that isn't rigidly segmented into input-output mechanisms but is continuously adapting and reconfiguring.
Oscillatory Resonance Chambers:
Relation:
The resonance chamber theory mirrors the idea of oscillatory patterns creating coherent brain activity. The transient selection of subnetworks could be envisioned as a form of dynamic resonance, with MRs and GPGICs acting as the modulators or 'conductors' of this cerebral symphony.
Integration:
Recognizing the brain as a resonance chamber allows for the incorporation of oscillatory dynamics in explaining how transient subnetworks are selected and activated, perhaps through resonance modes that facilitate coherent, long-range brain activity.
Multiscale Polycomputation (Michael Levin):
Relation:
Levin���s multiscale polycomputation is about computations occurring at different scales, not limited to neurons but extended to cells, organs, and even ecosystems. The theory from the abstract aligns with this, as MRs and GPGICs at the cellular and molecular level transiently select and direct neural activity, contributing to cognition at a larger scale.
Integration:
The concept of polycomputation supports a holistic view of cognition where different scales of activity and computation, from molecular to neural to systemic, collaboratively contribute to the emergent property known as the mind.
Implications:
Holistic Understanding:
An integrated approach allows for a more holistic understanding of cognition, appreciating it as a multi-scale, dynamic process.
Guiding Research:
These theories collectively could guide future research directions, providing a framework that accommodates molecular, neural, and systemic levels of investigation and interpretation.
Clinical Applications:
Understanding these mechanisms can inform the development of novel therapeutic interventions for cognitive and neurological disorders, facilitating targeted modulation of the implicated processes.
Conclusion:
Through the lens of these integrated theories, cognition can be seen as a dynamic, multi-level process involving transient neural subnetworks, oscillatory resonances, and computations at various scales. This synergy between theories may offer valuable insights, pushing the boundaries of our current understanding and offering novel perspectives on the mind-brain relationship.
