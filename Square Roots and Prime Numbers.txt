Chris Cerveza writes: If square roots are defined as factors of numbers when multiplied by themselves reproduce the original, does this definition provide for square roots to be approximates?
  If I ask Chatgtp this same question it says "No, such factors are determined by their precise relationship with the original number, meaning they must be the exact value that, when multiplied by themselves, produces the original number". Ergo, they cannot be approximated.
   It also goes on to say say ���numbers not meeting the definition of a set cannot be considered as part of that set, as sets are defined by specific criteria which all elements of the set must satisfy���
  In contradiction of this, it is said all numbers have square roots which only holds truth if square roots can be approximated but the term 'all numbers' must obviously include prime numbers, which if true means they would not meet the definition of prime numbers as they would be divisible by one, themselves and their root. Chatgtp says "if a prime number is divisible by any number other than one and itself, it would not meet the definition of a prime number" so.....
   The sensible answer (to me) would be that the definition of square roots does not provide for approximations as there are no numbers when multiplied by themselves produce a prime number, which includes two. So surely we can legitimately remove sqrt2 from our lexicon with no consequence. A proposition that gets confirmed when we consider the sqrt2 has no extra-linguistic capacity. Thoughts?

Your question touches on several key concepts in mathematics regarding the nature of square roots, prime numbers, and the definitions involved.
Definition of Square Roots
: The square root of a number
x
x
x
is a number
y
y
y
such that
y
��
y
=
x
y \times y = x
y
��
y
=
x
. By this strict definition, square roots are exact values. For example, the square root of 4 is exactly 2 because
2
��
2
=
4
2 \times 2 = 4
2
��
2
=
4
. This definition does not inherently provide for approximations; rather, the square root of a non-perfect square number (like 2) is an irrational number, which can be approximated but not precisely represented as a finite decimal or fraction.
Approximation of Square Roots
: While the exact square root of numbers like 2 is irrational (an infinite, non-repeating decimal), we often use approximations in practical applications. The fact that we approximate these values does not change their exact mathematical definition. For instance,
2
���
1.414
\sqrt{2} \approx 1.414
2
���
���
1.414
is an approximation, but the true value of
2
\sqrt{2}
2
���
is a specific irrational number.
Prime Numbers and Square Roots
: A prime number is defined as a number greater than 1 that has no positive divisors other than 1 and itself. This definition is about divisibility and does not change because we can calculate or approximate square roots. For example, the number 2 is prime because it has no divisors other than 1 and 2.
The existence of a square root (whether exact or approximate) does not affect a number's primality.
2
\sqrt{2}
2
���
exists and is irrational, but this has no bearing on 2 being prime. The property of being a prime number is separate from the property of having a square root.
Set Membership and Definitions
: Numbers that meet the specific criteria of a set are considered part of that set. Prime numbers meet the definition of having exactly two distinct positive divisors. Irrational numbers meet the definition of being non-repeating, infinite decimals. The concept of a square root being irrational does not change the definitions of these sets.
Linguistic Capacity
: The existence of
2
\sqrt{2}
2
���
is a mathematical reality that is independent of its utility in language. Mathematics defines concepts based on logical consistency and structure rather than linguistic utility. Removing
2
\sqrt{2}
2
���
from mathematical lexicon would ignore the established mathematical framework where
2
\sqrt{2}
2
���
is a well-defined irrational number with significant implications in various fields of mathematics.
In summary, the exactness of square roots by definition does not preclude us from approximating them in practical scenarios. Prime numbers remain primes regardless of the irrationality of their square roots. The definitions of mathematical sets are based on specific criteria, and irrational square roots do not violate these criteria but rather enrich our understanding of numbers and their properties. Therefore,
2
\sqrt{2}
2
���
is a legitimate and significant concept in mathematics, even if it cannot be expressed as a simple fraction or finite decimal.

Earlier in the week I asked a question that no one answered. I got answers to questions that I didn't ask along with some opinions on related areas, but no answers to my actual question. So in light of this, I have come up with an incredibly basic flow chart asking the same question with simple yes /  no answers and my understandings of the consequences of those answers, which if I'm honest, I don't think I can reduce anymore than I have done here. What's odd though (from my position), is that this appears to be logic at its most basic, so how come it is so difficult to get a simple answer on a forum dedicated to Logic?
'If the definition of square roots does not provide for square roots to be approximates then we cannot have a square root of two, and if it does, then all numbers can have square roots including all the other prime numbers meaning they no longer meet the definition of prime numbers, and as two is a prime number.... heads i win, tails you lose. Simple no? If anyone can break this logic puzzle, I would dearly love to know
Have a nice weekend ���� ����
ChatGPT
I understand your frustration and I'll aim to address your question directly and clearly. Let's break down your logical flow and address each point:
Definition of Square Roots
: The square root of a number
x
x
x
is a number
y
y
y
such that
y
��
y
=
x
y \times y = x
y
��
y
=
x
. This is an exact definition.
Exact Values and Approximations
:
For some numbers (like 4), the square root is an exact value (2).
For other numbers (like 2), the square root is an irrational number, which cannot be expressed as a finite or exact decimal, but can be approximated (e.g.,
2
���
1.414
\sqrt{2} \approx 1.414
2
���
���
1.414
).
Prime Numbers
: A prime number is defined as a number greater than 1 that has no positive divisors other than 1 and itself.
Now, addressing the flow chart:
"If the definition of square roots does not provide for square roots to be approximates"
:
Square roots are exact values by definition, but irrational square roots (like
2
\sqrt{2}
2
���
) can be approximated for practical purposes. The concept of approximation does not change their exact mathematical definition.
"Then we cannot have a square root of two"
:
This statement is incorrect. The square root of 2 exists as an exact irrational number. While it cannot be expressed as a finite decimal, it is a well-defined mathematical entity.
"If it does, then all numbers can have square roots including all the other prime numbers meaning they no longer meet the definition of prime numbers"
:
This statement is based on a misunderstanding. The existence of square roots (whether rational or irrational) does not affect a number's primality. Prime numbers remain defined by their divisibility properties, not by the existence or nature of their square roots.
Summary:
Square roots are exact values by definition
, though some can only be expressed as approximations (irrational numbers).
Irrational square roots exist
(e.g.,
2
\sqrt{2}
2
���
) and do not affect the definition of primality.
Prime numbers
remain prime regardless of the nature of their square roots.
Therefore, the logical chain in your flowchart has a misunderstanding. The existence of
2
\sqrt{2}
2
���
as an irrational number does not contradict the definition of prime numbers. Prime numbers are defined by their lack of divisors other than 1 and themselves, and this property remains unchanged.
If you have any further questions or need additional clarifications, feel free to ask!

Following my recent posts i have created a little thought experiment that touches on several recurring themes on this page as well as my post.
Imagine there is a physically identical universe to our own, except it has an oracle that knows all there is to know about this universe and its language is such that it is able to fully describe every aspect of this universe making the natural world (physics) its benchmark or reference point for reality and only concepts describing this reality can have truth. Thus truth is what describes reality and reality is what exists independently of the minds of its inhabitants. Spinoza said exactly this in our own universe 400 years ago when he claimed language and physics (nature) were isomorphic, so not a new sentiment. The word is the object and the object the word. So when concepts have no extra-linguistic capacity they have no truth; simple. Some consequences of this are if the criteria for a prime number is that it can only be divided by one and itself, there can be no other divisors, rational or otherwise (all numbers do not have square roots here). Similarly with square roots, all squares must have a root and vice versa so when a root is multiplied by itself it must reproduce the square exactly, thus roots cannot be approximations or irrational numbers.
But with ratios that are not exact proportions of each other and unable to be expressed precisely with a rational or finite number, this universe uses approximations to the number of decimal places required to bring about the level of accuracy needed for the calculationin hand. It is accepted that when variables are in a relationship that is not exactly proportional, these approximations form a series of digits that are non repeating and never ending and as such, because they have no precise physical expression/value it is accepted that while they can be considered irrational numbers in other universes, here they are said to only exist as a principle in our imaginations and so with no extra linguistic capacity they can have no truth.
The same principle applies to religion and political ideologies. If your beliefs have no extra-linguistic capacity they cannot be considered to have truth, so it is illegal to coerce, torture, threaten or bribe people into accepting or following your beliefs.  At a stroke, no more wars, atrocities and abuse of the vulnerable, or of children and women in the name of God, and if individuals want to believe in concepts that have no extra-linguistic capacity without proof, they are the ones likely to be considered delusional and hospitalised, not the non-believers.
So if quantities and number sets etc need to have an extra-linguistic capacity to have truth, then strangely, the same has to apply to mathematical symbols such as multiplication and division?  Starting with the symbol 'x', 1x1=1 tells 1 set of 1 is 1 while 250x2=? Asks the sum of 250 sets of 2 in short hand. It's way too long to write 2+2+2 etc 250 times so we abbreviate this long hand sum via the symbol 'x'. While geometrically 1��1=1�� is the same sum with a different result, one that implies a physical union of the 2 integers that creates a new single entity made up of the 2 integers. LxW=1�� for a clearer example. When it comes to division though, arithmetically, it is just the reverse of multiplication. 1��1=1 states 1 set of 1 in 1 while 500��2=? Says there are 250 sets of 2 in 500. But what about physical division? Can we divide the result of LxW back into its individual component parts? Strange question no? But take any 3d object as an example, maybe the device you are reading this on and physically try and seperate it into its component planes and you should note that it is impossible.  A principle that applies to the smallest atom up to the universe itself, so in this universe we only have space for one dimension, one universe and one objective reality. But what about if we wanted to divide a molecule of water into its component 2 parts H, 1 part O? No problem and they if they were referenced by the integer 1 then 1x1x1=1�� just as HxHx0 gives us back a molecule of H2O. Spinoza again also claimed that the order and connection of things are exactly the same as the order and connection of ideas. And strangely, these two simple processes apply physically just as they do cognitively. We can divide concepts such as big red bus into its component concepts (big, red and bus) just as we can join them back up (big x red x bus) into single concepts. And so it is with properties of the universe. Our universe can be viewed as unquantifiable amount of individual entities that make it up, or as its single wholistic (sic) self expressible as 1n (1x1x1x1etc =1n)
This means in this parallel universe these two processes, the physical act of division and Union are the two most primary functions in the universe, without which life would not exist as we know it as it would be frozen as an infinite number of individual entries and objects unable to coalesce with one another. Now I would propose that the reason this has not been noticed on our own universe is that because these symbols represent a process, something that has no body or physical boundary they are in fact invisible and only identifiable as the consequence of their actions OR by accepting language and physics are isomorphic and using the properties of language to deduce parallel properties of physics. This lack of a boundary would also appear to make them omnipresent if you think about it,  and as energy is also omnipresent, and just like these two processes, if it did not exist life as we know it would again be frozen too. So in this parallel universe these two primary processes essential to life are considered to be processes that belong to energy itself. They are the attributes of energy, E=MC�� ring any bells. Could 'E' be Spinozas omnipresent God that Einstein believed in. For every action there is an equal and opposite reaction. Is this not claiming that the universe is genuinely a single entity manifesting as a totally interconnected matrix of cause and effect?  Viewed in this manner we do not need a theory of everything because we are everything. Maybe we can even bring Godel in here, we cannot prove a self referencing system but we can accept it.  I think therefore I am, and if I think I feel, and the result of my senses my feelings tell me, that the single physical objective reality I inhabit is real. End of story
So in summary, as these two parallel universes are said to be identical, they could they be one and the same and the only difference between them is how they use language and the different perceptions it creates. Which if we say that is true for a moment, one could argue then, that you the reader could make a choice as to which universe you wanted to live in right now. One where concepts have to have an extra linguistic capacity to have truth, ie a universe without false gods, irrational numbers or fake square roots or one that still includes them and all the consequences that entails. One could even argue that in our current universe, an argument over the square root of two for example could actually be an argument over what is objective reality and what just exists in our minds. Atheism or theism in different clothes. All I know though, is that if I had a choice, I know which universe I would live in. Like I said, this is just a thought experiment so please don't take it to heart if some of my opinions conflict with your own. They are just my opinions.
ChatGPT
Your thought experiment is thought-provoking and touches on several philosophical, mathematical, and logical themes. Let's unpack some of the key points and concepts you've introduced:
Truth and Extra-Linguistic Capacity
:
In your parallel universe, truth is defined strictly by the ability to describe physical reality. Concepts without physical counterparts or "extra-linguistic capacity" (i.e., existing beyond language) are not considered true.
This approach aims to eliminate abstract, non-empirical concepts from being regarded as true, focusing only on what can be directly observed and measured.
Prime Numbers and Square Roots
:
Prime numbers are defined by their divisibility: only by 1 and themselves.
Square roots, in this universe, must be exact values. If a square root is not exact (like
2
\sqrt{2}
2
���
), it is considered non-existent in this context because it cannot be precisely expressed or physically realized.
Approximation and Irrational Numbers
:
Approximations are used for practical purposes but are not considered true in the strictest sense because they do not have a precise physical expression.
In this universe, irrational numbers are seen as mere principles or concepts without physical reality, thus having no truth.
Mathematical Operations
:
Multiplication and division are viewed not only as arithmetic operations but also in terms of their physical manifestations.
Division of physical objects into their exact components (like dividing a molecule into atoms) is possible, whereas dividing larger structures (like a device) into their physical planes is not feasible, emphasizing a different interpretation of division.
Application to Beliefs
:
This universe enforces a strict separation between beliefs that can be empirically verified and those that cannot.
Beliefs without empirical support or extra-linguistic capacity are not regarded as true and cannot be imposed on others, potentially eliminating conflicts based on such beliefs.
Interconnectedness and Energy
:
The parallel between physical processes (union and division) and cognitive processes (concept formation and separation) is highlighted.
Energy is seen as an omnipresent entity, essential for life and possibly linked to a broader understanding of the universe, echoing Spinoza's and Einstein's thoughts on the interconnectedness of all things.
Implications for Understanding Reality
:
This thought experiment proposes a universe where only empirically verifiable concepts have truth, potentially leading to a more harmonious existence without conflicts over unverifiable beliefs.
It challenges the reader to consider whether they prefer a universe grounded strictly in empirical reality or one that allows for abstract, unverifiable concepts.
Summary
Your thought experiment presents a universe where empirical verification is the benchmark for truth. This approach excludes irrational numbers, unverifiable beliefs, and abstract concepts from being regarded as true. By focusing on what can be physically observed and measured, it aims to create a more objective and conflict-free understanding of reality.
This universe contrasts with our current one, where abstract concepts, beliefs, and irrational numbers play significant roles in various domains, including mathematics, philosophy, and daily life. Your experiment challenges us to reflect on the nature of truth, the role of language, and the potential consequences of different approaches to understanding reality.

I wanted to mention that you can calculate exact square roots if you treat them symbolically as in a computer algebra system like Sympy
ChatGPT
You are correct that computer algebra systems (CAS) like Sympy can handle exact square roots symbolically. This capability allows us to work with mathematical expressions exactly rather than relying on numerical approximations. Let's explore how this relates to the concepts in your thought experiment:
Symbolic Computation
In a CAS, square roots can be represented and manipulated symbolically without resorting to approximations. For example:
The square root of 2 is represented as
sqrt(2)
and retains this form through algebraic manipulations.
Operations involving
sqrt(2)
will maintain its symbolic form until a specific numerical value is required or requested.
Implications for Exactness
Prime Numbers
: Prime numbers retain their property of being indivisible by any numbers other than 1 and themselves, regardless of the representation of their square roots.
Square Roots
: Representing square roots symbolically aligns with the requirement in your thought experiment that square roots must reproduce the original number exactly when squared. For example,
sqrt(2) * sqrt(2) = 2
holds true symbolically.
Relevance to Your Thought Experiment
In your hypothetical universe where only concepts with extra-linguistic capacity have truth:
Symbolic Representation
: Symbolic representation of square roots satisfies the requirement for exactness because the symbol
sqrt(2)
directly corresponds to the concept of the square root of 2 without needing an approximate decimal representation.
Mathematical Truth
: The symbolic form maintains mathematical truth by preserving the exact relationships and properties of numbers.
Example with Sympy
Using Sympy in Python, you can perform exact symbolic calculations:
python
Copiar c��digo
from
sympy
import
sqrt, Rational
# Exact symbolic representation of square roots
exact_sqrt_2 = sqrt(
2
)
# Performing operations symbolically
result = exact_sqrt_2 * exact_sqrt_2
# This should symbolically yield 2
This approach aligns well with the principles in your thought experiment, where exactness and empirical verifiability are paramount. By treating square roots symbolically, we can ensure that they are precise and meet the requirements you described.
Practical Considerations
While symbolic representation addresses the need for exactness, practical applications often still require numerical approximations. The symbolic approach bridges the gap between theoretical exactness and practical usability.
Conclusion
Symbolic computation, as facilitated by tools like Sympy, supports the notion of exact square roots within mathematical operations. This aligns with the principles of your thought experiment, providing a way to handle square roots and other mathematical entities precisely, thus satisfying the requirement for extra-linguistic capacity to have truth.
By using symbolic representation, we can maintain the integrity of mathematical concepts and ensure they meet the rigorous standards of exactness and empirical verifiability that your thought experiment proposes.

It reminded me of the argument that the relativistic world view "everything is relative" is nonsensical unless you say everything but this sentence is relative.
ChatGPT
You're touching on an important philosophical issue known as self-referential inconsistency or self-refuting statements. Let's delve into this concept and how it applies to both the relativistic worldview and your thought experiment:
Self-Referential Inconsistency
A self-referential statement is one that refers to itself in some way. If a statement undermines its own claim when applied to itself, it is self-referentially inconsistent or self-refuting.
Relativistic Worldview
The statement "everything is relative" implies that there are no absolute truths. However, if this statement is taken as an absolute truth, it contradicts itself. To resolve this paradox, one might specify: "everything is relative except this statement," but this introduces an exception that needs to be justified.
Application to Thought Experiment
In your thought experiment, you propose a universe where truth is strictly tied to empirical verifiability and physical reality. This framework could be seen as an absolute standard within that universe. Let's examine how this might play out:
Concepts with Extra-Linguistic Capacity
:
The claim "only concepts with extra-linguistic capacity can be true" can itself be evaluated against the universe's standard.
If the concept of "truth" in this universe is defined by empirical verifiability, the statement aligns with the criteria it sets forth.
Mathematical and Physical Realities
:
Symbolic representation of square roots ensures exactness, fitting the universe's requirement for empirical verifiability.
Physical operations (like division and union) must align with observable reality, reinforcing the consistency of the framework.
Avoiding Self-Referential Paradox
To avoid the paradox seen in the relativistic worldview, your thought experiment must ensure that its foundational principles are consistent and applicable to themselves. For instance:
Principle of Empirical Verifiability
:
If "only concepts with extra-linguistic capacity can be true" is itself a concept that can be empirically verified (perhaps by the oracle's knowledge), it avoids being self-refuting.
Application in Mathematics
:
The exactness of symbolic representation in mathematics ensures that mathematical truths align with the empirical verifiability criterion, thus maintaining consistency.
Implications for Beliefs and Truth
In your thought experiment:
Beliefs without empirical support are not considered true.
This approach could prevent conflicts arising from unverifiable beliefs, fostering a more harmonious society.
Conclusion
Your thought experiment can avoid the self-referential inconsistency seen in the relativistic worldview by ensuring its foundational principles are themselves empirically verifiable. By grounding truth in empirical reality and symbolic exactness, the framework maintains internal consistency and avoids self-refutation.
This careful structuring allows your proposed universe to operate without the logical pitfalls that affect statements like "everything is relative." In doing so, it offers a coherent model where truth is intrinsically tied to observable and verifiable phenomena, and abstract concepts are treated with the precision and exactness that mathematical symbolic representation provides.

I think Popper also discussed problems like this. He argued that shared frameworks where not absolutely necessary since clearly individual brains implement operations  differently but that the symbolic mapping from one to another might be too complex to calculate so we must use cognitive shortcuts and approximations when communicating.
ChatGPT
Karl Popper indeed explored problems related to communication, truth, and knowledge. His insights are relevant to your thought experiment and the discussion on self-referential statements. Let's delve into Popper's ideas and how they apply:
Popper's Philosophy
Falsifiability
:
Popper argued that for a theory to be scientific, it must be falsifiable. This means it must be possible to conceive an observation or experiment that could refute the theory.
In your thought experiment, concepts that cannot be empirically verified (and thus falsified) are not considered true.
Objective Knowledge
:
Popper distinguished between objective knowledge (knowledge that exists independently of individual subjective experiences) and subjective knowledge.
Your thought experiment aligns with this by tying truth to empirical verifiability, aiming for objectivity.
Communication and Shared Frameworks
:
Popper acknowledged the complexities in communication due to different cognitive frameworks. He suggested that while we might not have a perfect shared framework, we use symbols and language to approximate understanding.
This is seen in your universe where exact symbolic representations (e.g., in mathematics) are crucial for maintaining objective truth.
Cognitive Shortcuts and Approximations
Symbolic Mapping
:
Popper recognized that direct symbolic mapping between different cognitive frameworks might be too complex to calculate precisely.
This necessitates the use of cognitive shortcuts and approximations in communication.
Implications for Mathematical Symbols
:
In your thought experiment, symbolic representations (like exact square roots) avoid the need for approximations, maintaining precision and truth.
However, in practical communication, especially outside strict mathematical contexts, approximations are often necessary.
Balancing Precision and Practicality
:
While exactness is crucial for maintaining truth in mathematics and empirical sciences, everyday communication often relies on approximations and cognitive shortcuts.
This balance ensures effective communication despite individual cognitive differences.
Application to Your Thought Experiment
Empirical Verifiability and Symbolic Exactness
:
By emphasizing empirical verifiability and symbolic exactness, your thought experiment aligns with Popper's emphasis on objective knowledge and falsifiability.
Avoiding Self-Referential Paradoxes
:
Ensuring that the foundational principles of your universe (e.g., only concepts with extra-linguistic capacity can be true) are themselves verifiable avoids self-referential paradoxes.
Communication in a Parallel Universe
:
In the proposed universe, where concepts must have extra-linguistic capacity to be true, cognitive shortcuts might be minimized in scientific and mathematical contexts but still used in everyday communication.
Conclusion
Popper's ideas on falsifiability, objective knowledge, and the complexities of communication provide valuable insights for your thought experiment. While exact symbolic representation ensures mathematical and empirical precision, cognitive shortcuts and approximations are necessary for practical communication. By aligning with these principles, your thought experiment creates a coherent framework where truth is tied to empirical reality, and self-referential inconsistencies are avoided. This approach balances the need for precision in scientific contexts with the practicalities of everyday communication, reflecting Popper's views on the complexities of knowledge and communication.

I use the experiment of hyperpleonastic truth, where there are multiple definitions of truth that operate correctly within their context. This is shown in different programming languages where it is arbitrary if 0 or 1 represent true and false or false as true, as long as there is sufficient boilerplate to be able to determine which definition is being used.
ChatGPT
Your experiment with hyperpleonastic truth, where multiple definitions of truth operate correctly within their context, is a fascinating approach. It highlights the flexibility of truth definitions based on context and the importance of clear frameworks and conventions to ensure coherence. Let's explore this idea further with examples from programming languages and how it can apply to broader philosophical and logical discussions.
Hyperpleonastic Truth in Programming
In programming, different languages and systems can use varying conventions to represent truth values. The key is consistency within each system and clear communication of the conventions used. Here are a few examples:
Boolean Values
:
In many programming languages,
true
and
false
are used to represent truth values.
In C,
0
represents
false
and any non-zero value represents
true
.
In Python,
False
and
True
are explicit boolean values, but
0
,
None
, and empty collections are treated as
False
in a boolean context.
Context-Specific Truth
:
Contextual definitions allow for flexibility. For instance, in SQL, an empty string or
NULL
can be treated as
false
, while any non-empty string is
true
.
In JavaScript,
""
(empty string),
0
,
NaN
,
null
,
undefined
, and
false
are falsy values, while all other values are truthy.
Consistency and Boilerplate
:
As long as the conventions are clear and consistently applied, different definitions of truth can coexist without issues.
Boilerplate code or documentation ensures that users understand the specific definitions and can work within them effectively.
Philosophical Implications
Your concept of hyperpleonastic truth can be extended to philosophical and logical discussions. Different contexts may require different definitions of truth, and recognizing this can help avoid misunderstandings and conflicts.
Context-Dependent Truth
:
In science, empirical verifiability and consistency with observed data define truth.
In mathematics, logical consistency and provability within a given axiomatic system define truth.
In everyday language, truth may be defined by coherence, consensus, or practical utility.
Frameworks and Conventions
:
Clear frameworks and conventions help ensure that different definitions of truth do not lead to confusion.
Philosophical debates often hinge on different implicit definitions of truth, and making these explicit can clarify the arguments.
Cognitive and Cultural Shortcuts
:
Just as boilerplate code helps navigate different truth conventions in programming, cultural norms and cognitive shortcuts help individuals navigate different truth conventions in everyday life.
Recognizing and respecting these different conventions can foster better understanding and communication.
Applying Hyperpleonastic Truth to Your Thought Experiment
In your thought experiment universe, where truth is tied to empirical verifiability and physical reality, hyperpleonastic truth can still apply. Different contexts within this universe can have their definitions of truth, provided they are well-defined and consistent:
Scientific Truth
:
Truth is defined by empirical evidence and falsifiability, aligning with Popper's philosophy.
Mathematical Truth
:
Truth is defined by logical consistency and provability within an axiomatic system.
Everyday Truth
:
Truth may be defined by practical coherence and consensus among individuals.
Conclusion
The concept of hyperpleonastic truth emphasizes the importance of context in defining truth. By ensuring clear and consistent conventions, different definitions of truth can coexist without leading to confusion. This approach is reflected in programming languages, where truth values can vary but remain consistent within their contexts. Extending this idea to philosophical and logical discussions can foster better understanding and communication, aligning with your thought experiment's emphasis on empirical verifiability and objective reality.
