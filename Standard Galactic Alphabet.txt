games, the script is an example of an 
alien language spoken throughout the 
galaxy.

The player first encounters the 
alphabet in the first game, Marooned on 
Mars, in which Keen receives a 
telepathic message. Unfortunately, he 
cannot read SGA.

History[edit]

Standard Galactic is a substitution 
cipher invented by Tom Hall for the 
Commander Keen game series.
[1] Originally, for the first game, he 
drew a two-dimensional 
computer graphic for the "Exit" sign at 
the end of each level. This was 
intended to give it an alien look. This 

 
 
 
 
 
 
expanded to other messages, such as "hi"
and "this is neat" (next to a weapon).
The first characters of the script were
made by modifying the letters of 
the Latin alphabet. As development of 
the game progressed, Hall also invented
characters as he needed them to place 
messages throughout the game. Although
the script may look unusual, the words 
are all in English. Standard Galactic is 
not a constructed language, but it is 
a constructed script

Decipherment[edit]
Players of the Keen series tried to 
decipher the script by comparing the 
different boards. Marooned on 
Mars only revealed fifteen letters A, 
B, C, D, E, H, I, K, L, N, O, S, T, X, and 
Y), and more letters were revealed as 
the game progressed. [2]

The third Commander Keen offered the 
greatest opportunity for players. This 
game included extra boards in both the 
SGA letters and regular letters. Also, 
in a hidden level in this game, a full 
translation of the SGA could be found, 
similar to the Rosetta Stone.

Keen 6 contained a similar cipher, also in
a hidden level. It is important for the 
player to be able to decipher the entire
alphabet in order to translate the note 
Keen finds at the end of Keen 5.

Legacy[edit]
Joe Siegler later used Standard Galactic 
in the game, Rise of the Triad, writing 
the message "Dopefish lives" on a wall. 
Tom Hall, who helped design this game, 
didn't want to post any messages, but he 
still allowed a message in SGA.

SGA sometimes appears in other video 
games. It did serve as the basis for 
other invented scripts in, among 
others, Ion Storm's Anachronox, Quake 
4 and Minecraft.[3]
 [4]
Trivia[edit]
• The symbol for N resembles 
the Japanese Katakana sign for "Ri" (リ).

 
 
 
•SGA was once used to hide a swear word 
in the beginning of Keen 2's "Paris" 
level. This word is not really visible, as
it consists of yellow figures on a red 
field.
