 Physics of creation - Symmetry breaking, (en)active inference, and unfolding statespaces
Physics of creation - Symmetry breaking, (en)active inference, and unfolding statespaces
 1st Nov 2022

Featuring Avel Gu��nin--Carlut, KAIROS Research

Physical explanation relies on the description of natural systems through the construct of ���statespaces���, i.e. mathematical representations of the space of their accessible states. By construction, any change falling outside the statespace representation must be held as causally irrelevant. Therefore, although statespace representation appears necessary for formal tractability, it entails the reification of the physical symmetries underlying the target system.

This is unproblematic if we hold to the Platonic belief in an ordered, legible universe, whose activity is explained by well-defined ���natural laws��� imposing observable symmetries onto Nature. However, this idea relates poorly to the life sciences, where the organization that underlies system activity is clearly history-ladden and context-sensitive. More precisely, life and mind seem permeated by the phenomenon of autopoiesis (or self-creation), in which they create their own constitutive symmetries.

We discuss here the motivations of law-like explanation, and its intrinsic limitation to account for ���creation��� in life and mind. We then draft a formal account derived from the Free Energy Principle, rearticulated as a ���statespace-free��� theory of physical observation grounded in quantum information theory. Finally, we discuss the implication of this treatment for our role as agents in constructing physical reality

This article discusses the limitations of traditional physics in explaining the intricacies of the life sciences, particularly in relation to the concepts of self-creation, or autopoiesis. According to the authors, typical physics models tend to simplify the universe into a structured, comprehensible system, represented by the concept of "statespaces". Statespaces are mathematical representations of the range of possible states a system can have. While these models are valuable for understanding many natural phenomena, they inherently exclude changes or phenomena that can't be captured within the pre-defined statespace.
The authors argue that this approach doesn't account for the complex, context-sensitive, and history-laden systems seen in life sciences. Living organisms and mental processes are characterized by autopoiesis - the ability to create and define their own symmetries, which don't fit neatly into the typical statespace model.
The article then proposes a new perspective derived from the Free Energy Principle, reframed as a "statespace-free" theory of physical observation based on quantum information theory. This theory offers a more nuanced approach to understanding creation in life and mind, without relying on traditional statespace constructs. The authors also explore the implications of this new approach, including the role of individual agents in constructing physical reality.

Consciousness is characterized by particular content as foreground within a background environment. This presupposes an intimate relation of brain and environment that is neglected in most theories of consciousness. This void is addressed by the Temporo-spatial Theory of Consciousness (TTC) which considers the relative symmetry and synchronization of the brain with the environment, through temporo-spatial alignment. Temporo-spatial alignment refers to the mechanisms by which the brain actively adapts to and coordinates its own neural activity with the one of the various inputs from body and environment. Through a synthetic review supported by novel data, we propose a novel three layer conceptual model of neuronal and neuro-phenomenal mechanisms. These three layers embody input processing (shared input, input integration-segregation, input sampling) along a continuum of long to short time-space scales. These functional layers correspond to phenomenal layers of consciousness, i.e. background structure, intermediate layer with relationship between contents, and specific contents in the foreground. The layers are thus shared by brain and consciousness as their ���common currency��� of spatio-temporal dynamics of neuronal activity coupled to the environment. In establishing an intimate relationship between the world and brain, temporo-spatial alignment can also be conceived in terms of basic physical-energetic processes,such as free energy, and the dynamical emergence of (a)symmetries

This article discusses the Temporo-spatial Theory of Consciousness (TTC), a novel approach to understanding consciousness that emphasizes the dynamic relationship between the brain and its environment. Unlike traditional theories of consciousness, which often overlook this relationship, the TTC emphasizes the importance of the brain's adaptation and coordination with environmental and bodily inputs, a concept referred to as temporo-spatial alignment.
Through a comprehensive review and new data, the authors propose a three-layer model of neuronal and neuro-phenomenal mechanisms, based on the input processing of the brain. This involves shared input, input integration-segregation, and input sampling across a range of time-space scales.
The three functional layers correspond to different phenomenal layers of consciousness: the background structure, an intermediate layer involving the relationship between contents, and the specific content in the foreground. These layers are seen as a "common currency" between the brain and consciousness, based on the spatio-temporal dynamics of neuronal activity and its relationship to the environment.
The authors further suggest that the process of temporo-spatial alignment can be understood in terms of basic physical-energetic processes, such as free energy, and the emergence of dynamical (a)symmetries. This approach thus provides a more nuanced and holistic understanding of consciousness by acknowledging the intricate interplay between the brain and its surroundings.

 Embodied Cognitive Morphogenesis as a Route to Intelligent Systems
Embodied Cognitive Morphogenesis as a Route to Intelligent Systems
 1st Nov 2022

Featuring Bradly Alicea (OpenWorm Foundation and Orthogonal Research and Education Laboratory), Richard Gordon (Wayne State University), and Jesse Parent (Orthogonal Research and Education Laboratory)

The embryological view of biological development is that coordinated gene expression along with cellular physics and migration provides the basis for pattern formation and phenotypic complexity. This stands in contrast to the prevailing view of embodied cognition, which claims that informational feedback between organisms and their environment is key to the emergence of intelligent behaviors, particularly in development. We aim to unite these two perspectives, and call this approach embodied cognitive morphogenesis. Embodied cognitive morphogenesis leads to both fluctuating phenotypic asymmetry and the emergence of information processing subsystems. Our guiding question involves the role morphogenetic symmetry-breaking plays in the differentiation of specialized organismal subsystems, and how this serves as a substrate for the emergence of autonomous behaviors.

As the process of embodied cognitive morphogenesis unfolds, we observe three distinct properties: acquisition, generativity, and transformation. A related issue involves the quantitative models we might use to evaluate the increasingly complex structure of embodied cognitive morphogenetic agents. These include tensegrity modeling, differentiation trees, and embodied hypernetworks. These three types of models provide a means to identify the context of various symmetry-breaking events in developmental time. Related concepts that help us define this phenotype further will also be discussed. These include concepts such as modularity, homeostasis, and 4E (embodied, enactive, embedded, and extended) cognition. In conclusion, we will consider these autonomous developmental systems as a process called connectogenesis, or the process of connecting various parts of the emerged phenotype. This approach is useful for the analysis of organisms and the design of bio-inspired computational agents.

This paper presents a new theoretical approach, called "embodied cognitive morphogenesis", which attempts to unify the embryological view of biological development with the concept of embodied cognition.
In biological development, the embryological perspective emphasizes the role of coordinated gene expression, cellular physics, and migration in forming patterns and creating phenotypic complexity. On the other hand, the concept of embodied cognition stresses the significance of informational feedback between organisms and their environment in the emergence of intelligent behaviors, particularly during development.
The authors suggest that these two perspectives can be synthesized in the concept of embodied cognitive morphogenesis. This approach posits that both fluctuating phenotypic asymmetry and the emergence of information processing subsystems are key outcomes of this process. The researchers explore the role of morphogenetic symmetry-breaking in the creation of specialized organismal subsystems and how this leads to autonomous behaviors.
As embodied cognitive morphogenesis progresses, the authors identify three unique properties: acquisition, generativity, and transformation. They also propose several quantitative models, including tensegrity modeling, differentiation trees, and embodied hypernetworks, to analyze the increasing complexity of embodied cognitive morphogenetic agents. They also consider related concepts, such as modularity, homeostasis, and 4E (embodied, enactive, embedded, and extended) cognition, to further define this phenotype.
Finally, the authors examine these autonomous developmental systems through a process called connectogenesis, which involves connecting various parts of the emerged phenotype. This approach is suggested to be beneficial not only for studying organisms but also for designing bio-inspired computational agents.

In this research, Stuart A. Kauffman introduces the novel concept that the variables forming the group structure of particle physics, known as SU(3) x SU(2) x U(1), can act as a collectively autocatalytic system. This means that the particles can transform directly or indirectly into each other, perpetuating their own existence and behaviors.
Kauffman presents a theoretical model named the "Toy" Particle Apothecary Model (PAM), to study the stochastic branching of autocatalytic processes among these fundamental particles. This model suggests that the autocatalytic process yields a kinetic phase transition which breaks the symmetry between matter and antimatter, a process known as baryogenesis.
Baryogenesis results in the creation of particles, and Kauffman proposes that the interaction and entanglement among these particles can be interpreted as the construction of spacetime. This idea provides a new candidate for the unknown physics of Inflation, a theory explaining the rapid expansion of the universe shortly after the Big Bang.
Together, these concepts aim to extend our understanding beyond the current Standard Model of particle physics, suggesting a pathway from the SU(3) x SU(2) x U(1) structure to the Lambda-CDM standard model, which is the prevailing cosmological model explaining the evolution of the universe.

Since Newton, classical and quantum physics depend upon the ���Newtonian Paradigm���. The relevant variables of the system are identified. For example, we identify the position and momentum of classical particles. Laws of motion in differential form connecting the variables are formulated. An example is Newton���s three Laws of Motion. The boundary conditions creating the phase space of all possible values of the variables are defined. Then, given any initial condition, the differential equations of motion are integrated to yield an entailed trajectory in the pre-stated phase space. It is fundamental to the Newtonian Paradigm that the set of possibilities that constitute the phase space is always definable and fixed ahead of time.

This fails for the diachronic evolution of ever-new adaptations in any biosphere. Living cells achieve Constraint Closure and construct themselves. Thus, living cells, evolving via heritable variation and Natural selection, adaptively construct new, in-the-universe possibilities. We can neither define nor deduce the evolving phase space: we can use no mathematics based on Set Theory to do so. We cannot write or solve differential equations for the diachronic evolution of ever-new adaptations in a biosphere.

Evolving biospheres are outside the Newtonian Paradigm. There can be no Theory of Everything that entails all that comes to exist. We face a third major transition in science beyond the Pythagorean dream that ���All is Number��� echoed by Newtonian physics. However, we begin to understand the emergent creativity of an evolving biosphere: Emergence is not engineering.

Free energy and inference in living systems

FREE ENERGY PRINCIPLE ACTIVE INFERENCE AUTOPOIESIS
Featuring Chang Sub Kim, Chonnam National University

Organisms are nonequilibrium stationary systems self-organized from spontaneous symmetry breaking in the environment and undergo irreversible work cycles without detailed balance. The free energy principle (FEP) in thermodynamics describes an organism's homeostasis as regulating metabolic work constrained by the thermodynamic FE cost. In contrast, the recent neuroscience and theoretical biology efforts account for an organism's adaptive fitness as purposeful allostasis by demanding minimization of the informational FE. For a coalesced view of life, this study proposes a physically-principled FE minimization theory overarching the essential features from both FEPs. Consequently, the resulting Bayesian mechanics reveals that the brain function of perception and action operates like Schr{\"o}dinger's clockwork and develops optimal trajectories in neural manifolds when the sensory perturbation is presented. Furthermore, the sensory and motor interactions of the biological agents with the environment are manifested to induce a dynamic transition between neural attractors

MIRRORING SOCIAL INTERACTION AGENT BASED MODEL
Featuring Marco M��ller (Pionix GmbH/VetVise GmbH) and Daniel Polani (University of Hertfordshire)

We study in a elementary gridworld agent model how concepts reflecting higher structural symmetry of an environment can emerge in a collective of agents. To survive, organisms extract information from their environment. When that information is essentially processed just by the individual organism itself, the structure of this information can be idiosyncratic. While it needs to be functional, it has little pressure to reflect any structural principles in the environment. However, once multiple agents are involved which need to exchange information, this changes. We find that, if structural features are an essential part of the environmental makeup, it becomes an advantage to reflect these in concepts "understood" jointly by the agents. Concretely, in a world with symmetries, there is often no need to reflect them in an individual agent as a dedicated concept. In the coordination with other agents, though, such a feature can become essential for a jointly compatible representation. Thus we consider how symmetries in an environment become reflected in the agents' representation of the world as a consequence of having the agents develop joint concepts. Furthermore, we find that, once such joint concepts are discovered, these can be be acquired by modifying the agent's information extraction process in a relatively simple manner - an indicator how not only the individuals can give rise to the collective concepts, but that, also, show how such concepts could, in turn, influence the individuals. In addition to global symmetries of the given world, we also consider "intrinsic" symmetries which emerge through the specific sensorimotor contingency of agents. A number of relevant features are discussed

THEORETICAL MODEL VALENCE CONSCIOUSNESS
Featuring Michael Edward Johnson, Qualia Research Institute

If consciousness is amenable to formalization, symmetry within the formalism is likely to play a significant compositional, functional, and aesthetic role. We offer a theoretical and experimental paradigm constructed around (1) qualia formalism (Tononi, Tegmark, Barrett et al.) and (2) the symmetry aesthetic inherited from physics and mathematics (Helmholtz, Noether, Wilczek et al.). The initial pilot of this approach is the Symmetry Theory of Valence (STV), the first formal, universal, frame-invariant candidate theory of pain and pleasure. Part I begins with grounding the general inquiry into consciousness by considering a concrete question: what makes some conscious experiences more pleasant than others? We first review what���s known about the neuroscience of pain & pleasure, find the current state of knowledge narrow, inconsistent, and often circular, and conclude properly solving emotional valence requires the scaffolding of a formal theory of consciousness (Sections I & II). We then review the Integrated Information Theory (IIT) of consciousness and several variants of IIT, and find each of them promising, yet also underdeveloped and flawed (Sections III-V). We then take a step back and distill what kind of problem consciousness is. Importantly, we offer eight sub-problems whose solutions would, in aggregate, constitute a complete theory of consciousness (Section VI). Armed with this framework, in Part II we return to the subject of pain & pleasure (valence) and offer some assumptions, distinctions, and heuristics to clarify and constrain the problem (Sections VII-IX). The core output of this work is the Symmetry Theory of Valence (STV), the first formal, universal, frame-invariant candidate theory of pain and pleasure; implications for testing STV are discussed (Sections X-XI). Part III finishes with discussion of how this general approach may inform open problems in neuroscience, and the prospects for building a new science of qualia (Sections XII & XIII.

The Collective Mind: An Experimental Analysis of Imitation and Self-organization in Humans

MIRRORING SOCIAL INTERACTION EMPIRICAL STUDY
Featuring Emmanuel Olarewaju

I present an experimental paradigm to explore the interpersonal dynamics generating a collective mind. I hypothesized that collective organization is based on dual interpersonal modes: (1) symmetrical and (2) anti���symmetrical. I specified the geometric topology of these modes by detecting the spatiotemporal patterns that embed cooperative agents in a three���dimensional matrix. Within this collective matrix, I found that the symmetrical mode is executed automatically and without guidance. Conversely, the anti���symmetrical mode required explicit direction and recruited attention for execution. I demonstrate that self-other mirror���symmetry stabilized group dynamics, enabled fast and efficient symmetrical imitation that optimized information transmission, whereas anti���symmetrical imitation was comparatively slow, inefficient, and unstable. I determined that the anti���symmetrical mode spontaneously transitioned to the symmetrical mode under perturbations. Crucially, this renormalization mechanism never transitioned from symmetrical to anti���symmetrical. These self-organizing dynamics speak to interpersonal symmetry���breaking. In the present work, spontaneous group choice mandated that agents synchronize cooperative cycles in symmetrical space under internal or external perturbations. I provide examples to illustrate that this self-regulating pullback attractor manifests in invertebrates and vertebrates alike. I conclude by suggesting that inter���agent symmetry provides the social stability manifold through which attention-driven interactions enable intrapersonal and interpersonal change. Future researchers may employ the methods I provide to explore the intrinsic neural timescales that give rise to interpersonal symmetry���breaking and group renormalization. Research in this area may offer insight into the spatiotemporal patterns of neural activity predicting multiscale symmetry���breaking, thereby enabling the experimental analysis of the mind-body alignments underlying collective organization and social cognition

In the research "A Third Transition in Science?", Stuart A. Kauffman and Andrea Roli argue that evolving biospheres do not fit into the "Newtonian Paradigm", which forms the foundation of classical and quantum physics. They state that living cells, via heritable variation and natural selection, create new possibilities in the universe that cannot be defined or deduced within the set, pre-defined phase space of the Newtonian Paradigm. Therefore, they propose that we are facing a third major transition in science, one that acknowledges the emergent creativity of an evolving biosphere, moving beyond the notion that "All is Number".

Summarize: mind acting upon its own body (rather than an individuated organism), this also 
provides us with an explanatory mechanism for the emergence of embodied 
intelligence. 
The ability of (en)ActInf agents to constantly redefine their boundaries and recreate 
their structure makes it dif f icult to identify the proper scale of analysis for the study of 
human societies. Indeed, we have showed that they display an autonomous structure, 
which could either be understood in enactive terms as an operationaly closed set of 
constitutive constraints, or in ActInf terms as an implicit world model they embody and 
adaptively work to evidence through their activity. Both entail a multiscale approach 
encompassing the whole autopoietic structure rather than a single arbitrarily chosen 
trait (such as cereal agriculture) or scale (such as the activity of individual humans). 
Importantly, nothing entails that a single structural identity could account for the 
activity of any human society, as symbiotic multiscale integration (eg between cities 
and States, or individuals and organisations) remains a distinct possibility. This 
provides a critical argument for the necessity of importing in the social sciences the 
integrative multiscale approach characteristic of the life sciences. 
In particular, I argue that it is critical to adopt what is traditionally understood as a 
holistic approach by replacing the study of structural traits in the context of the 
broader system���s activity and of its historical emergence, as is standard in the 
evolutionary science (Bateson & Laland, 2013). While I have focused my argument on 
early urbanisation dynamics, when the most determinant features of later urban 
societies arguably emerged, a lot of structural traits have since disappeared from or 
emerged in human societies. In particular, the modern period has been the pivotal 
moment when European institutions of early capitalism and State control emerged, 
and consequently took over the world. The study of its dynamics should provide key 
insights into the prospective of our socio-political trajectories in the early 
Anthropocene era. The (en)active inference framework I have hereby introduced, 
motivated, and illustrated could facilitate such an integrative historical demarch by 
providing a core formal ontology for describing in a unified manner the metabolic, 
behavioural, developmental, and evolutionary timescales of the system���s dynamics.

This passage suggests that the study of human societies requires a multiscale approach, considering the full autopoietic structure rather than focusing on individual elements or scales. The author points out that the autonomous structure displayed by societies can be viewed either as an operationally closed set of constitutive constraints (from an enactive perspective) or as an embodied and adaptive world model (from an active inference or "ActInf" perspective).
The author proposes the need for a holistic approach, drawing from the life sciences, in the study of social structures. This would entail investigating structural traits in the broader context of a system's activity and historical emergence. Such an approach would allow for the consideration of the different scales of interaction (for example, between cities and states, or individuals and organizations) and their potential for symbiotic integration.
The author believes that this framework will be particularly useful in the study of historical dynamics, such as early urbanization or the emergence of early capitalism and state control in Europe. In the context of the early Anthropocene era, understanding these dynamics could provide key insights into the potential trajectories of our socio-political systems.
By adopting the (en)active inference framework, the author argues that we can provide a unified formal ontology capable of describing the metabolic, behavioural, developmental, and evolutionary timescales of a system's dynamics. This would facilitate an integrative historical approach to the study of human societies.

We have hereby articulated an account of embodied intelligence as adaptive knowledge 
integrated into an organism���s structure, and explained how this account could apply to 
human societies. By recruiting a formal notion of inference as synchronisation across a 
Markov Blanket, therefore applying to any scale that displays individuated boundary 
states, we were able to motivate a unified understanding of the nested scales of 
sociocultural evolution as a single process of active inference. Accordingly, we exposed 
how urban systems infer adaptive knowledge through behavioural, developmental and 
evolutionary time, and integrate this knowledge into their material and sociocultural 
structure so as to ef f ectively constrain their activity to metabolically and ecologically 
viable domains. Our (en)active inference account relates in a principled manner the 
subjective understanding of their world States enact to the historical development of 
the objective structure that enables their activity, by showing how both processes 
participate in the maintenance and (re)production of the structural identity of urban 
systems. 
This discussion is meant to introduce and illustrate a proposal to articulate active 
inference and the enactive approach in a single framework drawing from their 
conceptual and formal synergy. Both understand cognition as a fundamentally 
multiscale and relational process, permeating all forms of biological organisation. 
While the enactive approach grounds its study of cognition in the way an organism 
enacts its structural identity, Active Inference formalises the relation between the 
structural architecture of a cognitive system (ie what constraints define it) (Hesp et al., 
2019) and its functional architecture (ie what world it enacts) (K. J. Friston et al., 2017).

The author presents a model for embodied intelligence, suggesting that it can be viewed as adaptive knowledge integrated into an organism's structure. This model can also be applied to human societies. By invoking the concept of inference as synchronization across a Markov Blanket, the author suggests that we can better understand the multi-layered scales of socio-cultural evolution as a single process of active inference.
Urban systems, in this model, gain adaptive knowledge over time through their behavior, development, and evolution. This knowledge is then integrated into their material and socio-cultural structures to effectively guide their activities within sustainable metabolic and ecological domains. The (en)active inference model provides a systematic way to relate the subjective understanding of the world to the historical development of the objective structure that enables their activity. It shows how both processes contribute to maintaining and reproducing the structural identity of urban systems.
The author's goal is to articulate active inference and the enactive approach into a unified framework that draws upon their conceptual and formal synergy. Both approaches view cognition as inherently multiscale and relational, and applicable to all forms of biological organization.
The enactive approach grounds cognition in how an organism enacts its structural identity, while active inference formalizes the relationship between a cognitive system's structural architecture and its functional architecture (how it interacts with its world). This understanding permits us to see extended intelligence as an ActInf agent's expectations externalized as constraints in its environment, and how such an agent can integrate these constraints into its structural identity.

���embodied intelligence��� implicitly entails that they are not passive recipients of an 
external cognitive agent���s expectations, but constituant part of its organism. It is worth 
noting here that our notion of intelligence is based on Active Inference, a scale-free 
framework applying to any system with individuated boundary states. That States 
define implicit expectations through their activities and of f load them onto their 
environment is therefore insuf f icient to make them the proper locus of urban system���s 
cognitive activity. As urban systems build structural constraints into their world (like 
an agricultural landscape or a civil code) and become dependant on their maintenance, 
they integrate those constraints themselves into the boundaries of its operationally 
closed socio-ecologic structure, and their life goes on. 
We can finally turn back to our central question, what it means to think like a State. By 
our account, the cognitive activity of States is defined mechanically by the 
standardised administrative systems they use to understand and manipulate their 
world, and functionally by their drive to build and enact grip over their material and 
sociocultural niche. As it ultimately relies on a form of predictive processing, their 
phenomonology must consist of a ���controlled hallucination��� made of the expectations 
they build in the course of their ecological activity (Ramstead, Hesp, Sandved-Smith, et 
al., 2021). This activity is of course determined by their administrative mind, but it is 
also deeply coloured and oriented by the broader cognitive and metabolic activity of 
the broader self-producing structure of the urban societies they emerge from. 
Therefore, a naturalistic account of a State���s mental activity cannot circumvent a 
motivated analysis of the structural identity it participates to enact. 
We have now exposed how the historical development of urban systems can be 
described as a process of (en)active inference, and how this process af f ords the 
integration of adaptive knowledge in their material and sociocultural structure. This 
discussion should establish that the collective mind does not directly emerge from 
interindividual interactions, but from slower evolving dynamical constraints which 
supervene on (but do not reduce to) human activity. Therefore, the proper scale of 
analysis of collective cognition is the integrated activity of entire urban systems, and 
should more specifically be grounded in the broader processes by which they maintain 
and (re)produce their structural identity ��� understood as an operationally closed set of 
constraints underlying their metabolic, cognitive and ecological activity. This 
perspective enables a unified understanding of the historical emergence of urban 
societies, where the progressive evolution of a basic form of life entailed the 
development of increasingly complex forms of regulation.

The author expands on the concept of "embodied intelligence," asserting that systems (like urban systems or States) aren't merely passive recipients of external expectations, but integral components of the cognitive process. This perspective stems from Active Inference, a scale-free framework applicable to any system with individuated boundary states. Urban systems are depicted as entities that create structural constraints within their world (for example, through agricultural landscapes or legal codes) and then become dependent on their maintenance, thereby integrating these constraints into their operationally closed socio-ecological structures.
The author revisits the central question of what it means to think like a State. The cognitive activity of States, according to the author, is mechanically defined by the standardized administrative systems they use to comprehend and influence their world and is functionally determined by their desire to establish and exert control over their material and socio-cultural niches. The States' perception is suggested to be a sort of "controlled hallucination," constituted by the expectations they form in their ecological activities. However, this activity is not solely driven by the administrative mind of the State; it's also shaped by the broader cognitive and metabolic activities of the urban societies they emerge from. Thus, an analysis of a State's mental activity should also consider the structural identity it helps shape.
The author proposes that the historical evolution of urban systems can be understood as a process of (en)active inference, wherein these systems integrate adaptive knowledge into their material and socio-cultural structures over time. Contrary to some views, collective cognition does not directly stem from inter-individual interactions, but rather from more slowly-evolving constraints that shape (but are not reduced to) human activity. Thus, the proper scale for analyzing collective cognition is the integrated activity of entire urban systems, with a focus on how these systems maintain and reproduce their structural identities.
This perspective offers a unified understanding of the historical emergence of urban societies, where the gradual evolution from basic forms of life led to the development of increasingly complex forms of regulation.

documents) (Scot t , 2020). In other words, they distinctively implement a form of 
predictive processing, an cognitive architecture which corresponds most directly to the 
mechanical implementation of the abstract principle of active inference (K. Friston et 
al., 2016). As predictive cognition is an intrisically embodied and contextual activity 
(Hip��lito, Baltieri, et al., 2021; Nave et al., 2020), the question of embodied intelligence 
in urban systems reduces to the documentation of how constitutive traits prolong or 
support the activity of administrative systems. 
The deep history of urban systems we articulated above incidentally provides us with 
numerous instances of administrative systems externalising their expectations, which 
directly corresponds to the core theme of Scot t ���s Seeing like a State (Scot t , 2020). An 
obvious example is of course the way cities and States have worked to impose an 
ecological niche they knew how to exploit, both in the deep history of cereal 
agriculture in Neolithic societies and in modern at t empts to manage forest at the 
advantage of military industry. But more importantly, cities themselves have been 
shaped to enforce State-sponsored social organisation. Scot t provides the extreme 
exemple of Brazilia���s urbanism, explicitly meant to segregate family, leisure, and work, 
and therefore promote productivity for dominant institutions at the expense of 
serendipity. The same logic operates far back in time with the role of monumental 
architecture in the legitimation of power and the promotion of dominant norms. 
Importantly, the externalisation of admistrative expectations does not limit to the 
alteration of the material niche by States. Indeed, the institution of State-sponsored 
legal codes af f ords a way to directly transcribe administrative expectations into 
individual minds. Because it consists of a publically available set of social norms 
expected to apply to all, and to regulate decisions of the State itself, the law modulates 
behaviour at a slower time scale (and independantly from) any individual executive or 
judicial decision (van Rooij, 2020). Consequently, it af f ords top-down social engineering 
by the State

Most importantly, those constraints define the af f ordances the State has in its 
interaction with the wider society ��� such as taxation, draf t ing, or economic 
management. Rule of law is therefore a core tool by which States create their world 
through building the basis of their own intelligent behaviour into their sociocultural 
niche. 
This discussion should have established that the normal cognitive activity of States is 
prolonged in the structure of the landscapes and sociocultural constraints they interact 
with. However, talking of landscapes or sociocultural constraints as bearers of

over the definition of the law, and judges are only allowed to define it. In contrast, common 
law systems recognise a legally binding role to judicial precedents, therefore allowing 
individual judges to make law. As judges remain State of f icials, I don���t consider this 
distinction to be critical here.

The author compares administrative systems in States to predictive processing, an inherently embodied and contextual cognitive architecture that aligns with the principle of active inference. The idea of embodied intelligence in urban systems boils down to how their intrinsic traits can extend or bolster the activities of these administrative systems.
Historically, numerous examples demonstrate administrative systems externalizing their expectations, as illustrated in Scott's book, Seeing Like a State. The author cites various instances, including how cities and States have created an ecological niche that they can exploit, visible in the ancient practice of cereal agriculture and modern efforts to manage forests for military benefits. The structural design of cities themselves has often been dictated by state-driven social organization. An extreme example provided is Bras��lia's urban planning, explicitly designed to segregate family, leisure, and work to boost productivity for dominant institutions at the expense of serendipity.
The author emphasizes that the externalization of administrative expectations doesn't only pertain to material alterations by States. State-sponsored legal codes offer a means to transcribe administrative expectations directly into individual minds. Since it constitutes a publicly available set of social norms expected to apply to all (including the State itself), the law modulates behavior independently of any individual executive or judicial decision, enabling top-down social engineering by the State through enforcing new socio-cultural constraints.
Moreover, these constraints define the interactions the State has with wider society, shaping its abilities for taxation, drafting, or economic management. Therefore, the rule of law becomes a crucial tool through which States shape their world, embedding the foundations of their own intelligent behavior into their socio-cultural niche.
The author concludes that the cognitive activity of States extends into the structure of the landscapes and socio-cultural constraints they interact with. However, the distinction between civil law and common law systems (where the former gives legislative institutions a monopoly over law definition, and the latter allows individual judges to establish legally binding precedents) is deemed non-critical to the argument.

I want to interject. In order to think like a state, you should learn to think like a bat (using echolocation and exploration to make a mental map of the world), think like a swarm, in which each individual reacts to local factors as in perceptual control theory, and play descent, stars! (1995) and age of empires.

Your metaphorical statement underscores the importance of adopting diverse perspectives and strategies to "think like a state." Let's break down these references:
Thinking like a bat:
This analogy emphasizes the use of unique, non-human senses to understand the environment. Bats use echolocation to navigate and find food in the dark. When translated to state-level thinking, this could refer to relying on non-traditional or non-obvious sources of information, utilizing analytics and predictive modeling to understand the landscape, and making decisions based on this comprehensive understanding.
Thinking like a swarm:
This concept borrows from swarm intelligence, seen in species like ants or bees, where individuals follow simple, local rules, yet the collective behavior leads to the solution of complex problems. In the context of state thinking, it may imply decentralization and local decision-making that cumulatively lead to large-scale, organized outcomes. It underlines the importance of local actors and their responses to local stimuli, leading to emergent behavior on a larger scale.
Playing Descent, Stars! (1995) and Age of Empires:
These games, known for their strategy and management aspects, simulate managing resources, strategizing against opponents, and making complex decisions that have long-term effects���skills that are crucial for statecraft. Playing these games could be a metaphor for understanding the complexities and challenges that arise in state management and strategic planning.
Overall, your statement advocates for a holistic, multi-faceted approach to understanding and navigating the challenges faced by states, combining sensory awareness, decentralization, and strategic resource management.
