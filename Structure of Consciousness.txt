Integrated Information Theory (IIT) and Global Workspace Theory (GWT, often referred to as GNWT) are two significant theories about consciousness. While they take different approaches, both theories aim to explain the nature of subjective experience or "what it is like" to have a conscious mind.
Integrated Information Theory (IIT)
Developed by Giulio Tononi, Integrated Information Theory proposes that consciousness arises from the integration of information within a system. Specifically, it suggests that any system that processes and integrates information, whether it's a human brain or a computer, has some level of consciousness.
IIT suggests that the level of consciousness a system possesses correlates with its degree of information integration. In other words, a system that processes and combines information from many different sources in a unified way has a higher level of consciousness than a system that processes the same information but keeps it separated.
The key concept in IIT is "phi," a measure of the complexity or integration of information in a system. High phi values correspond to high degrees of consciousness.
Global Workspace Theory (GWT)
Global Workspace Theory, developed by cognitive psychologist Bernard Baars, compares consciousness to a theater. In this metaphor, the conscious mind is like a spotlight on a stage, illuminating the information that is currently the focus of our attention. All the other information ��� memories, thoughts, perceptions, etc. ��� are like the actors waiting in the wings offstage. They compete for the spotlight, but only a few make it onstage at a time.
GWT posits that this is a fundamental aspect of consciousness: at any given moment, we're conscious of a small fraction of the information our brains are processing. This 'global workspace' is where different parts of the brain integrate and exchange information.
Comparison and Contrasts
IIT and GWT approach consciousness from different angles. IIT attempts to quantify consciousness and provide a measure of it based on information integration. It's a more reductionist and mathematical model, suggesting that even simple systems could have some level of consciousness if they integrate information in a certain way.
On the other hand, GWT focuses more on the functional and computational aspects of consciousness, describing how it operates rather than providing a quantifiable measure. It's more about the organization of conscious processes than the intrinsic properties of the system, and it does not inherently suggest that all information-processing systems are conscious to some degree.
IIT and GWT can complement each other. For instance, GWT could help explain the specific processes within a high-phi system as described by IIT. Or IIT could potentially provide a way to quantify the "brightness" of the spotlight in GWT's theater analogy.
As of my knowledge cutoff in 2021, both theories are still under active development and discussion, and both have their critics and supporters in the scientific community. Neither theory is universally accepted as the definitive explanation of consciousness, but both have significantly contributed to our understanding of this complex phenomenon.
