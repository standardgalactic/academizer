**** LLM humor is improving rapidly. ****

This is not the usual "it made a stupid mistake" kind of story.
You will not get those from me.

I was working on a short presentation based on my recent substack post called "Two kinds of AI" (link in comment). I made slides, but then I thought I'd use Claude to come up with an alternative presentation based on the post.

It did.
I asked for presenter's notes.
It provided those.
I asked for it to re-do the slides based on the presenter's notes (!)
It did. Result had better overall structure and fewer choke points.

Then I said: 
Are there any examples, anecdotes, or jokes in the original blog post that could liven up the slides or the presenter's notes. Can you make places where we could make it funnier? 
-----------------------

Certainly! After reviewing the original blog post, there are indeed some elements we can use to liven up the presentation. Here are some suggestions:

Trigger Warning Slide (can be inserted after Slide 3):
"Trigger Warning: STEM Graduates Beware!"

Your education might work against you
Prepare for potential worldview reorganization
1% may experience "short-circuiting"

Presenter note: "If you see smoke coming from anyone's ears, don't panic. It's just their STEM education short-circuiting."

For Slide 5 (The STEM-AI Gap), add:
"From textbooks to prompts: Welcome to the AI rollercoaster!"

Presenter note: "Imagine spending years learning complex algorithms, only to find your first job is asking an AI 'Pretty please, with a cherry on top?'"

For Slide 6 (Limitations of Models), add:
"When life gives you complexity, science makes lemonade... badly."

Presenter note: "Ever tried to use F=ma to understand the stock market? Yeah, that's what we're dealing with here."

New slide after Slide 7: "The Revenge of the Holists"

Science peaked with the Moon Shot
Now, pre-scientific methods are making a comeback
Plot twist: Computers are joining Team Holistic

Presenter note: "It's like the ultimate underdog story. Holism was down for the count, but now it's back with a vengeance, and it's brought a silicon army!"

For Slide 9 (AI Beyond Traditional Science), add:
"Humans: Not General Intelligences, but World-Class Guessers"

Presenter note: "Turns out, we're not solving differential equations while walking. We're just really good at guessing where to put our feet next."

Final slide: "The Red Pill of Machine Learning"

Warning: May cause reality shifts
Side effects include seeing the world differently
Consult your epistemologist if symptoms persist

Presenter note: "Remember, what we're discussing here is like 'The Matrix', but instead of kung fu, you download a new way of thinking about AI. No leather trench coat required."
These additions inject some humor and relatable analogies into the presentation while still maintaining the core message. They can help keep the audience engaged and provide some lighter moments in what is otherwise a complex and potentially paradigm-shifting topic.

Because Who Needs New Thoughts When You've Got Old Ones?

Prepare to have your mind moderately blown���or at least dusted off a bit���with the newest cognitive buzzword on the block: Aspect Relegation Theory. Yes, folks, gather around as we discover that our brains might just be lazier than we thought, efficiently shoving learned behaviors from the penthouse suite of our consciousness down to the basement of our subconscious.

So, What's the Big Idea?

Apparently, after doing something a billion times, we start doing it without thinking. Groundbreaking, right? Enter Aspect Relegation Theory, which suggests that our fancy System 2 thinking���where we're all conscious, attentive, and making an effort���eventually gets demoted to System 1 thinking, where everything is automatic, effortless, and, frankly, a bit boring.

Brain on Autopilot: The Ultimate Efficiency Hack

Forget mindfulness and living in the moment. According to Aspect Relegation Theory, the real goal is to make everything so routine that you don���t have to bother actually thinking about it. Efficiency is the name of the game, and our brains are the undefeated champions, turning once-complex tasks like driving, typing, or tuning out during meetings into no-brainers.

Revolutionary or Just Really Obvious?

The theory takes a page from every self-help book ever: practice makes perfect, or at least makes permanent. By doing something over and over, our brains shift the workload from "I actually have to think about this" to "I can do this in my sleep." It's a thrilling reminder that we can train our brains to be less engaged���just what everyone striving for personal growth probably doesn't want to hear.

Why You Should Care (Or Not)

If you're into hacking your brain's system to make life smoother, Aspect Relegation Theory might just be your new best friend. It's a handy excuse for why you forgot your anniversary again ("Sorry, honey, my brain relegated it") and a great reason to never change your morning routine.

In all seriousness, Aspect Relegation Theory does offer some genuinely interesting insights into how and why we automate tasks and behaviors. It opens up discussions about cognitive load, learning processes, and how we can optimize both for better productivity and mental health. Just be prepared to wrestle with the notion that being on autopilot isn't just for airplanes and bad dates anymore.

Bottom Line

While Aspect Relegation Theory might not be stopping the presses, it's certainly a conversation starter about how our brains streamline the tedious complexity of daily life into manageable automaticity. So the next time you find yourself driving to work on autopilot, thank your brain for its service in making life a little less mentally taxing. Just make sure to wake up in time for your exit.

Just a summary
ChatGPT
"Subconscious Shuffling" refers to the concept where tasks, after being repeated numerous times, transition from requiring conscious, deliberate thought to becoming automatic processes managed subconsciously. This cognitive phenomenon is a core aspect of Aspect Relegation Theory, which posits that our brains efficiently relocate learned behaviors from active, conscious oversight (System 2 thinking) to passive, subconscious execution (System 1 thinking). This shift not only streamlines mental operations but also frees up cognitive resources for new and complex tasks, reflecting our brain's capacity for adaptation and efficiency. The theory provides insightful implications for understanding everyday habits, AI interactions, and even the potential pitfalls of over-reliance on automated systems.
