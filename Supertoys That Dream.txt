In the same year, the short story was republished in the eponymous Aldiss short-story collection Supertoys Last All Summer Long and Other Stories of Future Time, along with the tie-in stories Supertoys When Winter Comes and Supertoys in Other Seasons. Parts of two other Supertoys stories are also reflected in the film. The collection also contained a number of stories not tied to the Supertoys theme.[2]

Plot
edit
In a dystopian future where only a quarter of the world's oversized human population is fed and living comfortably, families must request permission to bear children. Monica Swinton lives with her husband, Henry, and her young son, David, with whom she struggles to bond. She seeks help from Teddy, a robot toy companion of sorts, to try to understand why she feels unable to communicate with David, let alone feel compassion for him. David also questions Teddy about whether his mother truly loves him and wonders whether he is truly real. He attempts to write letters of his own to explain how he feels about his mother and the inner conflict he faces but all of his letters remain unfinished.

Meanwhile, the story jumps to Henry, who is in a meeting with a company he is associated with known as Synthank. They are discussing artificial life forms and bio-electronic beings for future developments. Henry tells them he believes that the new AI under production will finally solve humanity's problems with experiencing personal isolation and loneliness.

Monica discovers David's unfinished letters which express both love and a jealous contempt for Teddy, whom Monica always seemed to connect with more than David himself. Monica is horrified by the letters but overjoyed when Henry arrives home and she is able to share with him that the family has been chosen to give birth to a child by the Ministry of Population. It is then revealed that David is an artificial human, used as a replacement for a real child (of that he is himself unaware, he becomes aware in second book: Supertoys When Winter Comes). Monica tells Henry that David is having verbal "malfunctioning" problems and must be sent back to the factory again. The story ends with David thinking of the love and warmth of his mother.

"Supertoys Last All Summer Long" by Brian Aldiss is set in a dystopian future where overpopulation and resource scarcity mean that families must obtain permission to have children. Monica Swinton lives uncomfortably with her husband Henry and son David, an artificial human whom she struggles to love or connect with emotionally. David, feeling unloved and questioning his own reality, writes unfinished letters expressing his complex feelings towards his mother and Teddy, his robot companion.
As David grapples with his existence, Henry engages in discussions about artificial intelligence with his company, hoping these developments will alleviate human loneliness. The story reveals Monica's discovery of David's letters, expressing jealousy and longing for genuine affection, which disturbs her but is overshadowed by the news that they can have a real child. The revelation that David is not a real boy and must be returned to the factory due to his verbal "malfunctions" culminates the narrative, leaving David yearning for his mother's love.

Do you think it might have also inspired the movie DARYL?
ChatGPT
"D.A.R.Y.L." is a 1985 film that centers around a young boy who is actually an android, with advanced artificial intelligence and emotional responses designed by the military. While "D.A.R.Y.L." shares themes of artificial intelligence and questions of humanity and identity with Brian Aldiss's "Supertoys Last All Summer Long," there isn't direct evidence that Aldiss's story directly inspired "D.A.R.Y.L." However, both works are part of a broader science fiction tradition exploring the consequences and ethical implications of creating life through artificial means, which suggests they draw from similar thematic wells. The focus on AI and its integration into society, as well as the emotional and psychological complexities of such beings, are common topics in the genre during the late 20th century.

See if you can write a screen play for a movie that combines elements from both and the following: ��� The i rst essay, ���Gentleness and the artif i cial Other,��� discusses the possibility of ���gentle- 
ness��� towards various non-human Others���for example, animals, aliens, and AI sys- 
tems. And it also highlights the possibility of ���getting eaten,��� in the way that Timothy 
Treadwell gets eaten by a bear in Werner Herzog���s Grizzly Man: that is, eaten in the 
midst of an attempt at gentleness. 
��� The second essay, ������Deep atheism and AI risk,��� discusses what I call ���deep atheism������a 
fundamental mistrust both towards Nature, and towards ���bare intelligence.��� I take 
Eliezer Yudkowsky as a paradigmatic deep atheist, and I highlight the connection be- 
tween his deep atheism and his concern about misaligned AI. I also connect deep 
atheism to the duality of ���yang��� (active, controlling) vs ���yin��� (receptive, letting-go). A 
lot of my concern, in the series, is about ways in which certain strands of the AI risk 
discourse can propel themselves, philosophically, towards ever-greater yang. 
��� The third essay, ���When ���yang��� goes wrong,��� expands on this concern. In particular: it 
discusses the sense in which deep atheism can prompt an aspiration to exert extreme 
levels of control over the universe; it highlights the sense in which both humans and 
AIs, on Yudkowsky���s narrative, are animated by this sort of aspiration; and it discusses 
some ways in which our civilization has built up wariness around control-seeking of 
this kind. I think we should be taking this sort of wariness quite seriously. 
��� Pursuant to this goal, the fourth essay, ���Does AI risk ���other��� the AIs?,��� examines Robin 
Hanson���s critique of the AI risk discourse���and in particular, his accusation that this 
discourse ���others��� the AIs, and seeks too much control over the values that steer the 
future. I i nd some aspects of Hanson���s critique uncompelling and implausible, but I 
do think he���s pointing at a real discomfort. 
��� The i fth essay, ���An even deeper atheism,��� argues that this discomfort should deepen 
yet further when we bring some other Yudkowskian philosophical vibes into view��� 
in particular, vibes related to the ���fragility of value,��� ���extremal Goodhart,��� and ���the tails 
come apart.��� These vibes, I suggest, create a certain momentum towards deeming more 
and more agents���including: human agents������misaligned��� in the sense of: not-to-be- 
trusted to optimize the universe very intensely according to their values-on-ref l ection. 
1There are lots of other risks from AI, too; but I want to focus on existential risk from misalignment, here, 
and I want the short phrase ���AI risk��� for the thing I���m going to be referring to repeatedly. 
otherness and control in the age of agi8 
And even if we do not follow this momentum, I think it can remind us of the sense in 
which AI risk is substantially (though, not entirely) a generalization and intensif i cation 
of the sort of ���balance of power between agents with different values��� problem we 
already deal with in the purely human world���a problem about which our existing 
ethical and political traditions already offer lots of guidance. 
��� The sixth essay, ���Being nicer than Clippy,��� tries to draw on this guidance. In particular, it 
tries to point at the distinction between a paradigmatically ���paperclip-y��� way of being, 
and some broad and hazily-def i ned set of alternatives that I group under the label 
���niceness/liberalism/ boundaries.���2Too often, I think, a simplistic interpretation of 
the alignment discourse imagines that humans and AIs-with-different-values are both 
paperclippy at heart���except, only, with a different favored sort of ���stuff.��� I think this 
picture neglects core aspects of human ethics that are, themselves, about navigating 
precisely the sorts of differences-in-values that the possibility of misaligned AI forces 
us to grapple with. I think that attention to this part of human ethics can help us be 
better than the paperclippers we fear���not just in what we do with spare resources, 
but in how we relate to the distribution of power amongst a plurality of value systems 
more broadly. And I think it may have practical benef i ts as well, in navigating possible 
conf l icts both between different humans, and between humans and AIs. That said, I 
don���t think that ���niceness/liberalism/boundaries��� is enough, on its own, to ensure a 
good future, or to allay all concern about trying to control that future over-much.

��� The seventh essay, ���On the abolition of man,��� examines another version of that con- 
cern: namely, C.S. Lewis���s argument (in his book The Abolition of Man) that attempts by 
moral anti-realists to inf l uence the values of future people must necessarily be ���tyran- 
nical.��� I mostly disagree with Lewis���and in particular, I think he makes a number of 
fairly basic philosophical mistakes related to e.g. compatibilism about freedom, to the 
difference between creating-Bob-instead-of-Alice vs. brainwashing-Alice-to-make-her- 
like-Bob, and to the sense in which moral anti-realists can retain their grip on morality. 
But I do think his discussion points at some diff i cult questions about the ethics of in- 
l uencing the values of others, including AIs���questions the essay takes an initial stab 
at grappling with. 
��� The eight essay, ���On green,��� examines a philosophical vibe that I (following others) call 
���green,��� and which I think contrasts in interesting ways with ���deep atheism.��� Green 
is one of the i ve colors on the Magic the Gathering Color Wheel, which I���ve found 
(despite not playing Magic myself) an interesting way of classifying the sort of energies 
that tend to animate people.3The colors, and their corresponding shticks-according- 
to-Joe, are: 
��� White: Morality. 
��� Blue: Knowledge. 
��� Black: Power. 
��� Red: Passion. 
��� Green: ... 
2Of course, there are lots of other options as well. 
3My relationship to the MtG Color Wheel is mostly via somewhat-reinterpreting Duncan Sabien���s presen- 
tation here, who credits Mark Rosewater for a lot of his understanding. My characterization won���t necessarily 
resonate with people who actually play Magic. 
otherness and control in the age of agi9 
I haven���t found a single word that I think captures green, but associations include: en- 
vironmentalism, tradition, spirituality, hippies, stereotypes of Native Americans, Yoda, 
humility, wholesomeness, health, and yin. The essay tries to bring the vibe that under- 
lies these associations into clearer view, and to point at some ways that attempts by other 
colors to reconstruct green can miss parts of it. In particular, I focus on the way green 
cares about respect, in a sense that goes beyond ���not trampling on the rights/interests of 
moral patients��� (what I call ���green-according-to-white���); and on the way green takes 
joy in (certain kinds of) yin, in a sense that contrasts with merely ���accepting things 
you���re too weak to change��� (what I call ���green-according-to-black���). 
��� The ninth essay, ���On attunement,��� on which green is centrally about making sure that 
we act with enough knowledge. I think there���s something to this, but I also suggest that 
green cares especially about ���attunement������a kind of meaning-laden receptivity to the 
world���as opposed to more paradigmatically blue-like types of knowledge. What���s 
more, I think that attunement is core to certain kinds of ethical epistemology, including 
my own; and it plays a key role in my own vision, at least, of a ���wise��� future. And 
while attunement may, ultimately, be made out of red and blue, I think we should take 
it seriously on its own terms. 
��� The tenth essay, ���Loving a world you don���t trust,��� closes the series with an effort to make 
sure I���ve given both yang and ���deep atheism��� their due, and been clear about my over- 
all take. To this end, the i rst part of the essay praises certain types of yang directly, in 
an effort to avoid over-correction towards yin. The second part praises something quite 
nearby to deep atheism that I care about a lot���something I call ���humanism.��� And the 
third part tries to clarify the depth of atheism I ultimately endorse. In particular, I dis- 
tinguish between trust in the Real, and various other attitudes towards it���attitudes like 
love, reverence, loyalty, and forgiveness. And I talk about ways these latter attitudes 
can still look the world���s horrors in the eye.
