Gaussian States from a Symplectic Geometry 
Point of View 
Maurice de Gosson 
Faculty of Mathematics, NuHAG group, Senior Researcher at the University 
of Vienna 
https://homepage.univie.ac.at/maurice.de.gosson 
Abstract: Gaussian states play a ubiquitous role in quantum information theory 
and in quantum optics because they are easy to manufacture in the laboratory, 
and have in addition important extremality properties. Of particular interest are 
their separability properties. Even if major advances have been made in their 
study in recent years, the topic is still largely open. In this talk we will discuss 
separability questions for Gaussian states from a rigorous point of view using 
symplectic geometry, and present some new results and properties.

Abstract. The present work is motivated by the problem of Bayesian 
inference for Gaussian distributions in symmetric Hadamard spaces (that 
is, Hadamard manifolds which are also symmetric spaces). To investigate 
this problem, it introduces new tools for Markov Chain Monte Carlo, and 
convex optimisation: (1) it provides easy-to-verify suf i cient conditions 
for the geometric ergodicity of an isotropic Metropolis-Hastings Markov 
chain, in a symmetric Hadamard space, (2) it shows how the Riemannian 
gradient descent method can achieve an exponential rate of convergence, 
when applied to a strongly convex function, on a Hadamard manifold. 
Using these tools, two Bayesian estimators, maximum-a-posteriori and 
minimum-mean-squares, are compared. When the underlying Hadamard 
manifold is a space of constant negative curvature, they are found to be 
surprisingly close to each other. This leads to an open problem: are these 
two estimators, in fact, equal (assuming constant negative curvature)?

which is also a symmetric space (for a background discussion, see AppendixA).

probability density function, with respect to Riemannian volume, reads

where Z(��) is a normalising constant, and d(��,��) is the distance in M. 
The maximum-likelihood estimator of the parameter x, based on independent 
samples (y1,...,yN), is equal to the Riemannian barycentre of these samples.

Abstract:
The study is driven by the problem of Bayesian inference for Gaussian distributions within symmetric Hadamard spaces. This requires the introduction of new tools for Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) and convex optimization. Two primary contributions are:
Introducing sufficient conditions for the geometric ergodicity of an isotropic Metropolis-Hastings Markov chain within a symmetric Hadamard space.
Demonstrating that the Riemannian gradient descent method can achieve exponential rates of convergence when applied to a strongly convex function on a Hadamard manifold.
The paper then compares two Bayesian estimators: the maximum-a-posteriori (MAP) and the minimum-mean-squares (MMS). In cases where the underlying Hadamard manifold has constant negative curvature, these estimators are very close in value. The paper raises the open question of whether the two estimators are, in fact, the same when assuming constant negative curvature.
Keywords:
Hadamard manifold, Gaussian distribution, Bayesian inference, MCMC, Convex optimization
Main Content:
The paper further delves into the specifics of Gaussian distributions on symmetric Hadamard spaces. A Gaussian distribution on this space is defined with a given probability density function related to the Riemannian volume. The maximum-likelihood estimator for a parameter, based on independent samples, is found to be the Riemannian barycentre of the samples. The paper then contrasts the maximum-likelihood estimator with a Bayesian approach for estimating a parameter. This Bayesian approach uses a prior density that is Gaussian.
It's worth noting that the paper seems to be making significant contributions to the area of Bayesian inference within the context of Hadamard manifolds. The use of MCMC techniques and convex optimization tools to study this problem reflects the mathematical sophistication of the subject matter.

3Metropolis-Hastings 
Often, the i rst step in Bayesian inference is sampling from the posterior density. 
Here, this is ��(x), given by (3). Since ��(x) is known only up to normalisation, 
a suitable sampling method is af f orded by the Metropolis-Hastings algorithm. 
This algorithm generates a Markov chain (xn;n ��� 1), with transition kernel [6] 
Pf(x) = ? 
M 
��(x,y)q(x,y)f(y)vol(dy) + ��(x)f(x)(9) 
for any bounded measurable f : M ��� R, where ��(x,y) is the probability of 
accepting a transition from x to dy, and ��(x) is the probability of staying at x, 
and where q(x,y) is the proposed transition density 
q(x,y) ��� 0and ? 
M 
q(x,y)vol(dy) = 1for x ��� M(10) 
In the following, (xn) will be an isotropic Metropolis-Hastings chain, in the sense 
that q(x,y) = q(d(x,y)) only depends on the distance d(x,y). In this case, the 
acceptance probability ��(x,y) is given by ��(x,y) = min{1,��(y)/��(x)}. 
The aim of the Metropolis-Hastings algorithm is to produce a Markov chain 
(xn) which is geometrically ergodic. Geometric ergodicity means the distribution 
��nof xnconverges to ��, at a geometric rate (that is, exponentially fast ��� See [3], 
Theorem 15.0.2). If the chain (xn) is geometrically ergodic, then it satisf i es the 
strong law of large numbers (for any suitable function f : M ��� R) [3]

N 
N ? 
n=1 f(xn) ������ ? 
M 
f(x)��(dx) (almost-surely)(11) 
as well as a corresponding central limit theorem (see [3], Theorem 17.0.1). Then, 
in practice, the Metropolis-Hastings algorithm generates samples (x1,x2,...) 
from the posterior density ��(x). 
In [7] (Chapter4), the following general statement is proved, concerning the 
geometric ergodicity of isotropic Metropolis-Hastings chains. 
Proposition 2. Let M be a symmetric Hadamard space. Assume (xn;n ��� 1) 
is a Markov chain in M, with transition kernel given by (9), with proposed 
transition density q(x,y) = q(d(x,y)), and with strictly positive invariant density 
��. The chain (xn) is geometrically ergodic if the following assumptions hold, 
(a1) there exists x������ M, such that r(x) = d(x���,x) 
and ?(x) = log��(x) satisfy 
limsup

(a3) there exist ��q> 0 and ��q> 0 such that d(x,y) < ��qimplies q(x,y) > ��q

Remark: the posterior density �� in (3) verif i es the Assumptions (a1) and (a2).

The provided content delves into the Metropolis-Hastings (MH) algorithm, which is a popular technique used in Bayesian statistics for generating samples from complex distributions. Here's a concise overview:
Metropolis-Hastings Algorithm:
Purpose
: The Metropolis-Hastings algorithm is a method for obtaining samples from a distribution, in this case, the posterior density
��
(
x
)
\pi(x)
��
(
x
)
. The true form of
��
(
x
)
\pi(x)
��
(
x
)
may not be known completely, but the MH algorithm can sample from it by using a proposal distribution and an acceptance rule.
Transition Kernel
: The MH algorithm uses a transition kernel, denoted as
P
P
P
, to decide how the next sample in the Markov chain should be generated. The kernel is influenced by the acceptance probability
��
(
x
,
y
)
\alpha(x,y)
��
(
x
,
y
)
and the proposal density
q
(
x
,
y
)
q(x,y)
q
(
x
,
y
)
.
Isotropy
: In the discussed context, the proposal distribution is isotropic, meaning it only depends on the distance between x and y, not their absolute positions.
Goal
: One of the main objectives of the MH algorithm is to ensure that the generated Markov chain is geometrically ergodic. This means that the chain converges to the desired distribution
��
\pi
��
at a geometric (or exponential) rate.
Properties of Geometrically Ergodic Chains
:
The distribution of the chain converges to
��
\pi
��
at a geometric rate.
The chain satisfies the strong law of large numbers, which means the average of the function values from the chain will converge to the expected value of the function under the distribution
��
\pi
��
.
A corresponding central limit theorem is also satisfied, which informs about the distribution of the average of the function values.
Conditions for Geometric Ergodicity
: The paper references another work ([7], Chapter 4) that proves a proposition about the conditions required for the isotropic Metropolis-Hastings chain to be geometrically ergodic. Three assumptions (a1, a2, and a3) are stated, involving specific properties of the symmetric Hadamard space and the involved functions. If these conditions hold, then the MH chain will be geometrically ergodic.
Posterior Density Observations
: A remark is made that the posterior density
��
\pi
��
in the equation (3) meets the conditions (a1) and (a2) presented earlier. Some mathematical derivations related to gradient functions are also provided to support this claim.
Impression:
The discussion provides a rigorous look into the application of the Metropolis-Hastings algorithm in a specific mathematical setting, namely symmetric Hadamard spaces. The conditions for the geometric ergodicity of the MH chain are vital as they ensure that the chain will converge to the desired distribution at a guaranteed rate. This is critical in Bayesian inference, where accurate sampling from the posterior distribution is crucial for making informed decisions.

Assuming it is well-def i ned, let �� x denote the barycentre of the invariant density 
��. It turns out that �� xNconverges almost-surely to �� x. 
Proposition 3. Let (xn) be any Markov chain in a Hadamard manifold M, with 
invariant distribution ��. Denote �� xNthe empirical barycentre of (x1,...,xN), and 
�� x the Riemannian barycentre of �� (assuming it is well-def i ned). If (xn) satisf i es 
the strong law of large numbers (11), then �� xNconverges to �� x, almost-surely. 
According to the remarks after Proposition2, the Metropolis-Hastings Markov 
chain (xn), whose invariant density is the posterior density ��(x), given by (3), is 
geometrically ergodic. Then, by Proposition3, the empirical barycentre �� xMMS, 
8S. Said et al. 
of the samples (x1,...,xN), converges almost-surely to the minimum mean 
square error estimator �� xMMS(since this is the barycentre of the posterior den- 
sity ��). This provides a practical means of approximating �� xMMS. Indeed, �� xMMS 
can be computed using the Riemannian gradient descent method, discussed in 
the following section. 
Remark: the proof of Proposition3 is nearly a word-for-word repetition of the 
proof in [1] (Theorem 2.3), which i rst established the strong consistency of 
empirical barycentres (in [1], these are called Fr�� echet sample means). In [1], the 
focus is on i.i.d. samples (x1,x2,...), but the proof only uses the strong law of 
large numbers (11), and nowhere requires the samples to be independent. 
5Riemannian Gradient Descent 
Since the minimum mean square error estimator �� xMMScould not be computed 
directly, it was approximated by �� xMMS, the global minimum of the variance 
function EN, def i ned as in (13). This function ENbeing 
(1/2)-strongly convex, 
its global minimum can be computed using the Riemannian gradient descent 
method, which even guarantees an exponential rate of convergence. 
This method is here studied from a general point of view. The aim is to 
minimise a function f : M ��� R, where M is a Hadamard manifold, with sectional 
curvatures in the interval [���c2,0], 
and f is an (��/2)-strongly convex function. 
This means f is (��/2)-strongly convex along any geodesic in M. In particular, 
f(y) ��� f(x) ��� ?Exp���1 
x (y),gradf(x)?x+ (��/2)d2(x,y)(14) 
for x,y ��� M. 
This implies that f has compact sublevel sets. Indeed, let x���be the global 
minimum of f, so gradf(x���) = 0. Putting x = x���and y = x in (14), it follows 
that f(x) ��� f(x���) ��� (��/2)d2(x���,x)(15) 
Accordingly, if S(y) is the sublevel set of y, then S(y) is contained in the closed 
ball �� 
B(x���,Ry), where Ry= (2/��)(f(y) ��� f(x���)). 
Therefore, S(y) is compact, 
since it is closed and bounded [5]. 
The Riemannian gradient descent method is based on the iterative scheme 
xt+1= Expxt(�����gradf(xt))(16) 
where �� is a positive step-size, �� ��� 1. If this is chosen suf i ciently small, then the 
iterates xtremain within the sublevel set S(x0). In fact, let �� 
B0= �� 
B(x���,Rx0) and 
�� 
B? 0= �� 
B(x���,Rx0+G), where G denotes the supremum of the norm of gradf(x),

A.1Hadamard Manifolds 
Def i nition 
A Hadamard manifold is a Riemannian manifold which is complete, simply 
connected, and has negative sectional curvatures [5]. Completeness means that 
geodesics extend indef i nitely in both directions, and is equivalent to the prop- 
erty that closed and bounded sets are compact (by the Hopf-Rinow theorem [5]). 
The simple connectedness and negative curvature properties combine to ensure 
that the Riemannian exponential map is a dif f eomorphism. In particular, any 
two points x,y in a Hadamard manifold M are connected by a unique length- 
minimising geodesic c : [0,1] ��� M, with c(0) = x, and dc/dt|t=0= 
Exp���1 
x (y). 
Convexity 
Now, this geodesic c : [0,1] ��� M is called the segment between x and y. For 
t ��� [0,1], the point x#ty 
= c(t) is said to be a geodesic convex combination of 
x and y, with respective weights (1���t) and t. In a Hadamard manifold [5], any 
open geodesic ball B(x���,R) (or any closed geodesic ball �� 
B(x���,R)) is convex: if 
x and y belong to this ball, so does x#ty for all t ��� (0,1). 
A function f : M ��� R is called (��/2)-strongly convex, if (f ��� c)(t) is an 
(��/2)-strongly convex function of t, for any geodesic c : [0,1] ��� M. That is, if 
there exists �� > 0, such that for any x and y in M, and t ��� [0,1], 
f(x#ty) ��� (1 ��� t)f(x) + tf(y) ��� (��/2)t(1 ��� t)d2(x,y)(19) 
10S. Said et al. 
When f is C2-smooth, this is equivalent to (14). 
Squared Distance Function 
For y ��� M, consider the function fy: M ��� R, where fy(x) = d2(x,y)/2. If M 
is a Hadamard manifold, then this function has several remarkable properties. 
Specif i cally, it is both smooth and (1/2)-strongly convex (irrespective of y). 
It���s gradient is given by gradfy(x) = ���Exp���1 
x (y), in terms of the Riemannian 
exponential map. On the other hand, on any geodesic ball B(y,R), the operator 
norm of its Hessian is bounded by cRcoth(cR), where c > 0 is such that the 
sectional curvatures of M lie in the interval [���c2,0] 
(see [5], Theorem 27). 
A result of the strong convexity of these functions fyis the uniqueness of 
Riemannian barycentres. If �� is a probability distribution on M, its Riemannian 
barycentre �� x��is the unique global minimiser of the so-called variance function 
E��(x) 
= ? 
M fy(x)��(dy). If M is a Hadamard manifold, each function fyis 
(1/2)-strongly convex, and therefore E��is (1/2)-strongly convex. Thus, E��has 
a unique global minimiser. 
A.2Symmetric Spaces 
Def i nition 
A Riemannian symmetric space is a Riemannian manifold M, such that for each 
x ��� M there exists an isometry sx: M ��� M, which i xes x and reverses geodesics 
passing through x: if c is a geodesic curve with c(0) = x, then sx(c(t)) = c(���t). 
As a consequence of this def i nition, a Riemannian symmetric space is always 
complete and homogeneous. Completeness was discussed in AppendixA.1. On 
the other hand, homogeneity means that for each x and y in M, there exists 
an isometry g : M ��� M, with g(x) = y. A symmetric space M may always be 
expressed as a quotient manifold M = G/K, where G is a certain Lie group of 
isometries of M, and K is the subgroup of elements of G which i x some point 
x ��� M. 
A Familiar Example 
A familiar example of a symmetric Hadamard manifold is the cone Pdof d �� d 
symmetric positive-def i nite matrices, which was discussed in some length in [8,9]. 
A geodesic curve through x ��� Pdis 
of the form c(t) = xexp(tx���1u) where exp is 
the matrix exponential, and u a symmetric matrix, dc/dt|t=0= 
u. The isometry 
sxis given by sx(y) = xy���1x for y ��� Pd, 
and one easily checks sx(c(t)) = c(���t). 
Let G = GL(d,R) denote the group of invertible d �� d real matrices. Then, 
g ��� G def i nes an isometry ��g: Pd��� Pd, 
given by ��g(x) = gxg���(��� the transpose). 
Typically, one writes ��g(x) = g(x). Note that x = Id(the identity matrix) belongs 
to Pd, and then g(x) = x if and only if g ��� K, where K = O(d) is the orthogonal 
group. In fact, one has the quotient manifold structure Pd= GL(d,R)/O(d).

This section discusses two types of Riemannian manifolds: Hadamard Manifolds and Symmetric Spaces. Here's a breakdown of the information provided:
A.1 Hadamard Manifolds

A Hadamard manifold is a Riemannian manifold that is complete, simply connected, and has negative sectional curvatures.
Completeness implies that geodesics (shortest paths between two points) extend indefinitely.
The manifold's characteristics ensure that the Riemannian exponential map is a diffeomorphism, which means any two points in the manifold are connected by a unique shortest path.

A Riemannian symmetric space is a manifold where, for each point, there's an isometry (distance-preserving transformation) that fixes the point and reverses the geodesics passing through it.
These spaces are always complete and homogeneous, meaning there's an isometry that maps any point to any other point.

Connections with the prievous topics
1 / 1
ChatGPT
Certainly, let's draw some connections between the topics of Hadamard manifolds, symmetric spaces, and the symplectic topics you've mentioned:
Nature of Manifolds
:
Both Hadamard manifolds and the manifolds discussed in symplectic geometry are Riemannian manifolds, meaning they come equipped with a metric that allows for the measurement of distances and angles. The structure of these manifolds is central to understanding the geometry and topology of the spaces they define.
Geodesics
:
In the context of Hadamard manifolds, geodesics play a significant role. They represent the shortest paths between points. In symplectic geometry, geodesics also play a role, especially when understanding Hamiltonian dynamics where the flow along a Hamiltonian vector field can be thought of in terms of geodesics.
Curvature
:
Hadamard manifolds have negative sectional curvatures. In the context of symplectic geometry, curvature, especially the curvature of certain canonical bundles, can play a role in understanding the global properties of the manifold. For instance, K��hler manifolds, which are both symplectic and complex, have a curvature form that is closed.
Convexity
:
Convexity in Hadamard manifolds, as you've mentioned, is related to geodesics and the property that geodesic balls are convex. In symplectic geometry, convexity properties can arise when studying moment maps and symplectic reductions, which are fundamental in understanding the geometry and topology of symplectic manifolds.
Applications in Physics
:
Symplectic geometry has deep ties to classical mechanics through the study of Hamiltonian systems. The symplectic structure captures the essence of the conservation of energy and momentum. While Hadamard manifolds and symmetric spaces may not be as directly tied to physical systems, they do provide insights into the geometric properties of spaces that can be applied in various contexts.
Group Actions
:
Symmetric spaces involve the action of a group (the isometry group) on a manifold. Similarly, in symplectic geometry, group actions, especially those of Lie groups, are prevalent. For example, when studying symplectic reductions or understanding the geometry of moduli spaces.
Isometries and Diffeomorphisms
:
Both Hadamard manifolds and symmetric spaces emphasize the importance of isometries. In symplectic geometry, diffeomorphisms preserving the symplectic structure (symplectic diffeomorphisms) play a crucial role, much like isometries in Riemannian geometry.
To delve deeper into the connections and see them in action, one would typically need to study specific problems or examples where these concepts intertwine. However, at a high level, both Hadamard manifolds and symplectic geometry offer perspectives on the rich tapestry of structures and properties that differentiable manifolds can exhibit.

These appear to be chapter titles and subsections from a book or a set of lecture notes focusing on the foundational topics in symplectic geometry, specifically relating to Gromov's Nonsqueezing Theorem, and aspects of J-holomorphic curve theory. Let's unpack some of these:
Gromov���s Nonsqueezing Theorem
: This theorem, often simply known as Gromov's Nonsqueezing, is a fundamental result in symplectic geometry. It states that a ball in a symplectic vector space cannot be symplectically embedded into a cylinder of the same height but with a smaller radius. This theorem reveals a deep geometric constraint that symplectic structures impose, which is in contrast to the flexibility we see in general topology.
Liouville���s theorem in Hamiltonian mechanics
: Liouville's theorem is a foundational result in classical mechanics which states that the volume in phase space is preserved under the flow of a Hamiltonian system.
Symplectomorphisms and symplectic embeddings
: These are diffeomorphisms that preserve the symplectic structure. They play a crucial role in the study of the geometry and dynamics of symplectic manifolds.
Almost complex structures
: An almost complex structure on a manifold is a bundle endomorphism that squares to -1. When paired with a symplectic structure, it can be used to define holomorphic curves, which are central to Gromov's methods.
Holomorphic curves
: These are mappings from Riemann surfaces into almost complex manifolds that are holomorphic with respect to the given almost complex structure. They have become a central tool in symplectic topology due to their many applications, including the proof of Gromov's nonsqueezing theorem.
Compactness
: This appears to focus on the compactness properties of spaces of holomorphic curves, which is crucial for understanding their moduli spaces and the associated Gromov-Witten invariants.
Symplectic energy, action, and other functionals
: These are essential tools in symplectic geometry and topology to study dynamical properties, invariants, and constraints on symplectic and Hamiltonian systems.
Moduli space of J-holomorphic discs
: This refers to the space of all J-holomorphic discs modulo certain equivalence relations. Moduli spaces play a crucial role in many areas of mathematics and have deep connections with algebraic geometry, string theory, and representation theory.
The topics covered provide a good depth of insight into the powerful interplay between analysis, geometry, and topology in the symplectic setting. Gromov's methods, which revolve around the use of pseudoholomorphic curves, have revolutionized the field of symplectic geometry, leading to a plethora of new discoveries and invariants.

The holomorphic discs in the title of this book refer to a mathematical object 
that is, strictly speaking, neither holomorphic nor a disc. This is in accordance 
with the principle, as laid down by [Hirsch 1976], that ���in mathematics a red 
herring does not have to be either red or a herring���. 
By discs we mean smooth maps def i ned on the unit disc in the complex 
plane C, taking values in some manifold. We shall be speaking of curves as smooth 
maps def i ned on a domain (or its closure) in the complex plane1. More generally, 
the domain of def i nition may be a Riemann surface (possibly with boundary); such 
curves will not be considered in the present text, though. 
The usage of the word holomorphic requires a more detailed explication. 
In the strict sense of the word, this refers to curves where the target space is a 
complex manifold, and the map satisf i es the Cauchy���Riemann equations. Equiva- 
lently, these are maps whose dif f erential at any point of the domain of def i nition 
is a complex linear map. In the main body of the text, we shall adhere to this 
narrow interpretation of the word ���holomorphic���. 
The holomorphic discs of the title in point of fact refer to the more general 
pseudoholomorphic or J-holomorphic maps. The idea behind this concept is quite 
simple. In order to speak sensibly of maps with complex linear dif f erential, there is 
no need for (local) complex coordinates on the target space. All that is required is 
a notion of complex multiplication on each tangent space, which is precisely what 
an almost complex structure J on a manifold amounts to. (In two real dimensions, 
any almost complex structure comes from complex coordinates, thanks to the 
existence of isothermal coordinates2for any conformal structure; for this reason 
we need not consider a wider class of domains of def i nition.) 
Beware that many authors nowadays use ���holomorphic curve��� with the latter, 
wider meaning. To keep the title of this book snappy, we have done the same there, 
but there only. 
The ground-breaking observation in [Gromov 1985] was that pseudoholomor- 
phic curves share many desirable features with holomorphic curves, provided that 
the almost complex structure J is compatible, in a sense to be def i ned, with a sym- 
plectic form �� (that is, a closed nondegenerate dif f erential 2-form). This includes 
1Except when, as will be clear from the context, we are speaking of real curves def i ned on 
intervals in the real line. 
2This is a deep result; see [Bers 1957/8] or [Donaldson 2011]. xi 
xiiPreface 
them being minimal surfaces, and energy estimates that guarantee the compact- 
ness of certain ���moduli spaces��� of pseudoholomorphic curves. Such compactness 
results pave the way for cobordism- or degree-theoretic topological arguments. 
Gromov���s i rst application of the theory of pseudoholomorphic curves in sym- 
plectic manifolds was the nonsqueezing theorem, which may be regarded as the big 
bang for the new i eld of symplectic topology. 
Symplectic geometry is a time-honoured subject, as it provides the mathe- 
matical framework for classical mechanics; see [Arnol���d 1989]. Liouville���s theorem 
on the preservation of volume in phase space is in fact a statement about symplec- 
tic mappings. The nonsqueezing theorem demonstrates that symplectic mappings 
are considerably more restrained than volume-preserving ones. It says that one cannot squeeze a ball (in the standard symplectic space R2n) into a cylinder of 
smaller radius by a symplectic embedding.

The preface of this book introduces the reader to the concept of "holomorphic discs" in the context of symplectic geometry and topology. Here is a summary:
The
quote
from Gottfried Keller implies that many mathematical teachings begin without much preamble or context, plunging into the subject matter without ensuring comprehension for everyone.
The term
"holomorphic discs"
is clarified as neither strictly holomorphic nor a disc. This is justified with a humorous note that in mathematics, things aren't always as they seem on the surface, referencing Hirsch's statement about a "red herring."
By "discs"
, the author refers to smooth maps defined on the unit disc in the complex plane
C
C
C
, with outputs in some manifold. Curves are defined similarly, but on a domain in the complex plane.
The term
"holomorphic"
is discussed in detail. In a strict sense, it pertains to curves where the target space is a complex manifold, and the map satisfies the Cauchy���Riemann equations. The text mainly uses this strict definition.
The
"holomorphic discs"
of the title actually refer to more general pseudoholomorphic or J-holomorphic maps. This concept does not require local complex coordinates on the target space but needs a notion of complex multiplication on each tangent space, which an almost complex structure
J
J
J
provides.
There's a note of caution: many modern authors use the term 'holomorphic curve' in the broader sense of pseudoholomorphic curves.

is highlighted, which observed that pseudoholomorphic curves have many properties in common with holomorphic curves, especially when an almost complex structure

is compatible with a symplectic form

.
Gromov's application of pseudoholomorphic curves in symplectic manifolds led to the nonsqueezing theorem, marking the inception of symplectic topology.
Symplectic geometry
has deep roots in classical mechanics, offering a mathematical framework for it. Liouville's theorem about the preservation of phase space volume is essentially about symplectic mappings. The nonsqueezing theorem further distinguishes symplectic mappings from volume-preserving ones, with the conclusion that one cannot compress a ball into a cylinder of a smaller radius using a symplectic embedding.
The preface sets the stage for the book's exploration of symplectic topology, starting with foundational concepts and leading into more advanced topics.

Outline of the text 
The book you hold in your hands (if you are an old-fashioned reader) presents 
a complete proof of the nonsqueezing theorem. In Chapter I we expand on the 
classical context just mentioned and introduce all the concepts required to give a 
precise formulation of the theorem and a sketch of its proof. 
The later chapters successively i ll in the details of this proof. Given a sym- 
plectic embedding of a ball of radius r into a cylinder of radius R, the aim is to 
show that r ��� R. Ultimately, the proof boils down to establishing the existence 
of a J-holomorphic disc passing through the centre of the embedded ball, and 
whose boundary is mapped to the boundary of the cylinder. The almost complex 
structure J in question is adapted to the embedding of the ball. Energy estimates 
and an isoperimetric inequality for holomorphic discs then combine to yield the 
desired inequality on the radii. 
The existence of such a disc rests crucially on the properties of the mod- 
uli space of all pseudoholomorphic discs with boundary behaviour as described. 
Broadly speaking, chapters II and III are devoted to establishing the compactness 
of this space; chapter V deals with the manifold property of this space. A major 
complication in the proof stems from the fact that one cannot work solely within 
the framework of smooth discs, as spaces of smooth maps fail to be Banach mani- 
folds. Chapter IV shows how to resolve this issue by considering spaces of weakly 
dif f erentiable pseudoholomorphic curves and then establishing regularity results 
for such curves. 
The nonsqueezing theorem is very easy to state, and the formidable mathe- 
matical ef f ort we need to expend on its proof may seem surprising and daunting. 
In order to assuage the intellectual strain, at several places in the text we pause 
to explain why one cannot do without the intricate, mostly analytic tools that we 
introduce.

Gromov���s original proof of the nonsqueezing theorem works with a partial 
compactif i cation S2 R/2��R 
2n���2 of the cylinder B2 R��R 
2n���2, and then utilises pseu- 
doholomorphic spheres. As mentioned earlier, our proof instead studies pseudo- 
holomorphic discs whose boundary lies on the boundary of the cylinder. Arguably 
this is a more natural approach. 
Pseudoholomorphic discs made their i rst appearance in applications to con- 
tact topology, where one works with the symplectisation of a contact manifold. 
This symplectisation carries an exact symplectic form and therefore does not ad- 
mit nonconstant closed pseudoholomorphic curves such as spheres. A compre- 
hensive monograph on the use of pseudoholomorphic discs in contact topology is 
[Abbas & Hofer 2019]. 
The ideas for i lling cylinders with discs, again in the context of contact 
topology (and Reeb dynamics), go back to [Eliashberg & Hofer 1994]. That paper 
mostly dealt with 3-dimensional contact topology; in [Geiges & Zehmisch 2016] 
we extended the theory to higher-dimensional contact manifolds. 
There, we also systematically began to explore degree-theoretic arguments 
for pseudoholomorphic discs ��� here, the content of Chapter V ��� that originate 
(for spheres) from [McDuf f 1991]. Again for spheres, this was developed further in 
[Barth, Geiges & Zehmisch 2019]. 
In [Eliashberg & Hofer 1994] and [Geiges & Zehmisch 2016] the use of discs 
was necessitated by the contact-geometric setting. In the symplectic setting, pseu- 
doholomorphic discs were used in [Gromov 1985] to deal with Lagrangian sub- 
manifolds. The present text might also serve to encourage more mature readers to 
revisit some of the results in this area, and to i nd other applications of pseudo- 
holomorphic discs in symplectic topology. 
An interesting variation on the theme of pseudoholomorphic discs can be 
found in [Sukhov & Tumanov 2014].4There, the authors establish the existence of 
pseudoholomorphic discs ��� and use this to give a proof of Gromov���s nonsqueezing 
theorem ��� by solving a vector analogue of the classical Beltrami equation. For 
analytical reasons in dealing with the boundary problem, the authors replace the 
round cylinder with a cylinder having a triangular base. 
For further reading on applications of pseudoholomorphic discs we modestly 
suggest [Geiges & Zehmisch 2010], where we l eshed out an idea by Eliashberg to 
give a contact-geometric proof of Cerf���s theorem that every dif f eomorphism of 
the 3-sphere S3extends to a dif f eomorphism of the 4-ball. This proof relies on a 
���f i lling��� of S3��� C2by 
holomorphic discs, i.e. discs in the 4-ball with boundary 
on S3, adapted to a contactomorphism of the standard contact structure5on S3. 
In [Geiges & Zehmisch 2013], more generally, we studied the i lling of symplec-tic cobordisms with pseudoholomorphic discs. This allowed us to give a unif i ed 
treatment of some ���classical��� results in symplectic and contact topology (including 
Reeb dynamics). A number of arguments developed in these papers have found 
their way into the presentation here.

Mathematical prerequisites 
The theory of pseudoholomorphic curves draws on methods and results, some of 
them quite deep, from diverse areas of mathematics. We have tried to develop 
the theory from i rst principles wherever feasible, but it is impossible to include 
everything without the book becoming encyclopaedic. 
The i rst two chapters can probably be understood with little more than a 
background in complex analysis. In fact, we have read this part prof i tably (for 
all involved) with students in the third and i nal year of their Bachelor stud- 
ies. Advanced calculus, which German students take in their second and third 
semesters, is taken for granted. This includes concepts such as (sub-)manifolds, 
tangent spaces, dif f erential forms, and Stokes���s theorem (especially in the diver- 
gence version known as the theorem of Gau��). 
Everything we require from point-set topology can be found in [J�� anich 1996]: 
compactness vs. sequential compactness, continuity vs. sequential continuity, i rst 
and second countability axioms for topological spaces. 
Concerning analysis on manifolds, we freely (but sparingly) use concepts such 
as the l ow of a vector i eld and the Lie derivative (including Cartan���s formula). 
Where possible, we provide alternative and more elementary arguments. 
The remaining chapters require some basic concepts and results from linear 
functional analysis, such as Banach spaces, bounded (a.k.a. continuous) linear 
operators, and the open mapping theorem. In a few places, and in passing, we quote 
the Hahn���Banach theorem. Everything we use can be found in the undergraduate 
text [Bollob�� as 1999] or the slightly more advanced [Hirzebruch & Scharlau 1971]. 
We need much less than these books cover. For instance, all the prerequisites from 
Fredholm theory are introduced in Chapter V, even though they can be found in 
the text by Hirzebruch and Scharlau. 
As concerns Sobolev spaces, some acquaintance with the fundamental con- 
cepts in [Adams & Fournier 2003] is certainly a boon, but not required. We quote 
without proof some Sobolev inequalities and embedding theorems, but the theory 
of weakly dif f erentiable functions is developed from scratch in Chapter IV. 
From dif f erential geometry, we use the concept of geodesics without expla- 
nation, but we do discuss the exponential map ��� the only reason we need to 
talk about geodesics ��� in detail. We also use some concepts from elementary 
dif f erential geometry such as the curvature of plane curves. 
Concerning dif f erential topological methods, we occasionally apply them with- 
out being overly loquacious. Books such as [Br�� ocker & J�� anich 1973], [Hirsch 1976], 
or [Wall 2016] cover much more than what is needed here, but a certain acquain- 
tance with one of these books certainly helps to smooth some corners in the text. 
xviPreface 
The mapping degree theory in Chapter V is developed in detail, following a dif- 
ferential topological route. The alternative approach, using homological methods, 
is sketched for readers familiar with the relevant algebraic topology. 
No previous knowledge of symplectic geometry is assumed.

Although they can be defined for any almost complex manifold, pseudoholomorphic curves are especially interesting when {\displaystyle J}J interacts with a symplectic form {\displaystyle \omega }\omega . An almost complex structure {\displaystyle J}J is said to be {\displaystyle \omega }\omega -tame if and only if

{\displaystyle \omega (v,Jv)>0}{\displaystyle \omega (v,Jv)>0}
for all nonzero tangent vectors {\displaystyle v}v. Tameness implies that the formula

{\displaystyle (v,w)={\frac {1}{2}}\left(\omega (v,Jw)+\omega (w,Jv)\right)}{\displaystyle (v,w)={\frac {1}{2}}\left(\omega (v,Jw)+\omega (w,Jv)\right)}
defines a Riemannian metric on {\displaystyle X}X. Gromov showed that, for a given {\displaystyle \omega }\omega , the space of {\displaystyle \omega }\omega -tame {\displaystyle J}J is nonempty and contractible. He used this theory to prove a non-squeezing theorem concerning symplectic embeddings of spheres into cylinders.

Gromov showed that certain moduli spaces of pseudoholomorphic curves (satisfying additional specified conditions) are compact, and described the way in which pseudoholomorphic curves can degenerate when only finite energy is assumed. (The finite energy condition holds most notably for curves with a fixed homology class in a symplectic manifold where J is {\displaystyle \omega }\omega -tame or {\displaystyle \omega }\omega -compatible). This Gromov compactness theorem, now greatly generalized using stable maps, makes possible the definition of Gromov���Witten invariants, which count pseudoholomorphic curves in symplectic manifolds.

Compact moduli spaces of pseudoholomorphic curves are also used to construct Floer homology, which Andreas Floer (and later authors, in greater generality) used to prove the famous conjecture of Vladimir Arnol'd concerning the number of fixed points of Hamiltonian flows.

, which provides an inherent geometric structure.
This concept is important for the study of pseudoholomorphic curves because it guarantees that these curves will have well-defined geometric properties that can be analyzed.
Gromov���s Contribution
:
Gromov's non-squeezing theorem is a fundamental result in symplectic geometry. It states that certain symplectic embeddings (mappings preserving the symplectic structure) have restrictions, hence the term "non-squeezing."
The theorem demonstrates the power and subtlety of the symplectic structure. The mention of the non-squeezing theorem ties back to the previous topics, where Gromov's original proof of the theorem was discussed, highlighting the importance of pseudoholomorphic curves in its proof.
Moduli Spaces and Compactness
:
Gromov's analysis of moduli spaces of pseudoholomorphic curves is foundational. These spaces essentially parameterize (or catalog) pseudoholomorphic curves with certain properties.
The compactness of these moduli spaces, which refers to a topological property ensuring that sequences of points have convergent subsequences, is crucial for various applications. This includes the definition of Gromov���Witten invariants that count these curves in symplectic manifolds. This links to the earlier discussion about the significance of pseudoholomorphic curves in symplectic topology.
Floer Homology and Arnol'd's Conjecture
:
Compact moduli spaces of pseudoholomorphic curves aren't just useful for Gromov���Witten invariants. They also play a pivotal role in Floer homology, a tool used to study symplectic manifolds and Lagrangian submanifolds.
Andreas Floer developed this homology theory and applied it to prove a conjecture by Vladimir Arnol'd concerning fixed points of Hamiltonian flows. This further cements the deep interconnections between pseudoholomorphic curves, symplectic geometry, and broader areas of mathematical physics.
In summary, the details provided give an overview of the central themes in the study of pseudoholomorphic curves in symplectic geometry. From foundational theorems to advanced applications, these curves offer a rich mathematical tapestry that intersects with various domains in mathematics and mathematical physics.

In type II string theory, one considers surfaces traced out by strings as they travel along paths in a Calabi���Yau 3-fold. Following the path integral formulation of quantum mechanics, one wishes to compute certain integrals over the space of all such surfaces. Because such a space is infinite-dimensional, these path integrals are not mathematically well-defined in general. However, under the A-twist one can deduce that the surfaces are parametrized by pseudoholomorphic curves, and so the path integrals reduce to integrals over moduli spaces of pseudoholomorphic curves (or rather stable maps), which are finite-dimensional. In closed type IIA string theory, for example, these integrals are precisely the Gromov���Witten invariants.

Absolutely! This ties back the vast realm of string theory with the intricate mathematical structures of symplectic geometry and pseudoholomorphic curves. Here���s a breakdown to connect the topics:
Type II String Theory and Calabi���Yau 3-fold
:
Type II string theory refers to two supersymmetric string theories in ten dimensions. The surfaces traced out by strings, called world-sheets, can be embedded in compact manifolds known as Calabi���Yau 3-folds, which have particularly special geometric properties suitable for compactifying the extra dimensions in string theory.
Path Integral Formulation
:
The path integral approach is fundamental in quantum mechanics, especially in quantum field theory. It seeks to compute the probability amplitude by summing (integrating) over all possible histories of a system. In string theory, this means integrating over all possible world-sheets.
A-Twist and Pseudoholomorphic Curves
:
The A-twist (or A-model) is a particular topological twist in string theory. When applied to a string world-sheet theory, it constrains the maps (from the world-sheet to the target space, i.e., Calabi���Yau manifold) to be pseudoholomorphic. This is the deep connection between string theory and the previously discussed topic of pseudoholomorphic curves. This constraint greatly simplifies the infinite-dimensional problem of integrating over all world-sheets.
Integrals Over Moduli Spaces and Gromov���Witten Invariants
:
The moduli space of pseudoholomorphic curves (or stable maps, to include certain degenerate situations) is a finite-dimensional space that parametrizes these curves. Thus, our previously ill-defined infinite-dimensional path integrals become well-defined integrals over these moduli spaces.
In the context of closed type IIA string theory, these integrals compute the Gromov���Witten invariants. As mentioned earlier, these invariants count pseudoholomorphic curves in symplectic manifolds, and here, they have a direct physical interpretation in terms of string amplitudes.
The intertwining of advanced concepts from string theory with the rich mathematical structures of symplectic geometry is a prime example of the deep connections between modern physics and mathematics. Concepts like pseudoholomorphic curves, initially developed purely for mathematical reasons, find unexpected and profound applications in our quest to understand the fundamental nature of the universe.

The role of the characteristic function in the theory of meromorphic functions in the plane is similar to that of

{\displaystyle \log M(r,f)=\log \max _{|z|\leq r}|f(z)|\,}\log M(r,f)=\log \max _{{|z|\leq r}}|f(z)|\,
in the theory of entire functions. In fact, it is possible to directly compare T(r,f) and M(r,f) for an entire function:

{\displaystyle T(r,f)\leq \log ^{+}M(r,f)\,}T(r,f)\leq \log ^{+}M(r,f)\,
and

{\displaystyle \log M(r,f)\leq \left({\dfrac {R+r}{R-r}}\right)T(R,f),\,}\log M(r,f)\leq \left({\dfrac  {R+r}{R-r}}\right)T(R,f),\,
for any R > r.

If f is a rational function of degree d, then T(r,f) ~ d log r; in fact, T(r,f) = O(log r) if and only if f is a rational function.

The order of a meromorphic function is defined by

{\displaystyle \rho (f)=\limsup _{r\rightarrow \infty }{\dfrac {\log ^{+}T(r,f)}{\log r}}.}\rho (f)=\limsup _{{r\rightarrow \infty }}{\dfrac  {\log ^{+}T(r,f)}{\log r}}.
Functions of finite order constitute an important subclass which was much studied.

When the radius R of the disc |z| ��� R, in which the meromorphic function is defined, is finite, the Nevanlinna characteristic may be bounded. Functions in a disc with bounded characteristic, also known as functions of bounded type, are exactly those functions that are ratios of bounded analytic functions. Functions of bounded type may also be so defined for another domain such as the upper half-plane.

The order of a meromorphic function is a crucial concept that captures the growth rate of the function. It is defined using the limsup (limit superior) of the characteristic function.
Functions of finite order have been the subject of extensive study due to their special properties and significance in function theory.
Functions of Bounded Type:
When dealing with functions defined on a finite disc, it's possible for the Nevanlinna characteristic to be bounded. Such functions are called "functions of bounded type."
These functions can be expressed as ratios of bounded analytic functions, making them essential in complex analysis. The concept of bounded type can be generalized to other domains, like the upper half-plane.
In sum, these concepts serve as foundational tools in the study of complex analysis, particularly in the analysis of meromorphic and entire functions. Understanding the growth and behavior of these functions is crucial for various applications in both pure and applied mathematics.

In mathematics, in particular the subfield of algebraic geometry, a rational map or rational mapping is a kind of partial function between algebraic varieties. This article uses the convention that varieties are irreducible.


Definition
Edit
Formal definition
Edit
Formally, a rational map {\displaystyle f\colon V\to W}f\colon V\to W between two varieties is an equivalence class of pairs {\displaystyle (f_{U},U)}(f_{U},U) in which {\displaystyle f_{U}}f_{U} is a morphism of varieties from a non-empty open set {\displaystyle U\subset V}U\subset V to {\displaystyle W}W, and two such pairs {\displaystyle (f_{U},U)}(f_{U},U) and {\displaystyle ({f'}_{U'},U')}{\displaystyle ({f'}_{U'},U')} are considered equivalent if {\displaystyle f_{U}}f_{U} and {\displaystyle {f'}_{U'}}{\displaystyle {f'}_{U'}} coincide on the intersection {\displaystyle U\cap U'}U\cap U' (this is, in particular, vacuously true if the intersection is empty, but since {\displaystyle V}V is assumed irreducible, this is impossible). The proof that this defines an equivalence relation relies on the following lemma:

If two morphisms of varieties are equal on some non-empty open set, then they are equal.
{\displaystyle f}f is said to be birational if there exists a rational map {\displaystyle g\colon W\to V}g\colon W\to V which is its inverse, where the composition is taken in the above sense.

The importance of rational maps to algebraic geometry is in the connection between such maps and maps between the function fields of {\displaystyle V}V and {\displaystyle W}W. Even a cursory examination of the definitions reveals a similarity between that of rational map and that of rational function; in fact, a rational function is just a rational map whose range is the projective line. Composition of functions then allows us to "pull back" rational functions along a rational map, so that a single rational map {\displaystyle f\colon V\to W}f\colon V\to W induces a homomorphism of fields {\displaystyle K(W)\to K(V)}K(W)\to K(V). In particular, the following theorem is central: the functor from the category of projective varieties with dominant rational maps (over a fixed base field, for example {\displaystyle \mathbb {C} }\mathbb {C} ) to the category of finitely generated field extensions of the base field with reverse inclusion of extensions as morphisms, which associates each variety to its function field and each map to the associated map of function fields, is an equivalence of categories.

Rational maps are an essential concept in algebraic geometry, which is the study of algebraic solutions to polynomial equations. Let's unpack the content provided:
Rational Maps

A rational map is a partial function between algebraic varieties. Unlike regular functions which are defined everywhere, a rational map might not be defined at some points.

is birational if there exists an inverse rational map. This implies that the two varieties are 'almost' isomorphic, at least in the open sets where the maps are defined.
Connection with Function Fields
:
A vital aspect of rational maps in algebraic geometry is their relationship to function fields. The function field of a variety is, informally, the set of all rational functions on that variety.
The comparison between the definitions of rational maps and rational functions is made. A rational function is a special case of a rational map where the target is the projective line.
Composition and Homomorphism
:
You can "pull back" rational functions along a rational map, meaning that a single rational map induces a homomorphism between the function fields of the varieties.
Fundamental Theorem
:
This theorem bridges the gap between algebra and geometry. It states that there's an equivalence between the category of projective varieties (with dominant rational maps) and the category of field extensions (with reverse inclusion). Here, a category is a collection of objects and morphisms (maps) between them, and this theorem captures a deep correspondence between the geometric world of varieties and the algebraic world of fields.
This is a quick overview of the topic. Algebraic geometry is a profound subject, and these ideas touch upon the core principle that algebra (equations and functions) and geometry (shapes and spaces) can be studied in tandem, often providing insights into each other's realms. Rational maps, by bridging these two areas, serve as a central tool in understanding the intricate relationship between them.

In mathematics, the Poincar�� residue is a generalization, to several complex variables and complex manifold theory, of the residue at a pole of complex function theory. It is just one of a number of such possible extensions.

Given a hypersurface {\displaystyle X\subset \mathbb {P} ^{n}}{\displaystyle X\subset \mathbb {P} ^{n}} defined by a degree {\displaystyle d}d polynomial {\displaystyle F}F and a rational {\displaystyle n}n-form {\displaystyle \omega }\omega  on {\displaystyle \mathbb {P} ^{n}}\mathbb {P} ^{n} with a pole of order {\displaystyle k>0}k>0 on {\displaystyle X}X, then we can construct a cohomology class {\displaystyle \operatorname {Res} (\omega )\in H^{n-1}(X;\mathbb {C} )}{\displaystyle \operatorname {Res} (\omega )\in H^{n-1}(X;\mathbb {C} )}. If {\displaystyle n=1}n=1 we recover the classical residue construction.

The Poincar�� residue is a powerful tool in the realm of several complex variables and complex manifold theory, generalizing the notion of residue in the one-variable complex function theory.
To give a basic overview:
Complex Function Theory (Single Variable)
:
In the setting of functions of a single complex variable, the residue is a number associated with a singular point (pole) of a function, capturing the 'essence' of the behavior of the function near that pole. It's an integral concept in evaluating certain complex integrals.
Poincar�� Residue (Several Complex Variables)
:
The Poincar�� residue extends this idea to the setting of several complex variables. The fundamental concept remains ��� we're looking at the behavior of a function near a special point or set ��� but the setting is richer and more complex.

This generalized concept keeps the spirit of capturing the local behavior of the function (or form) but does so in a manner appropriate to the more intricate setting of several variables.

In mathematics, the fixed-point index is a concept in topological fixed-point theory, and in particular Nielsen theory. The fixed-point index can be thought of as a multiplicity measurement for fixed points.

The index can be easily defined in the setting of complex analysis: Let f(z) be a holomorphic mapping on the complex plane, and let z0 be a fixed point of f. Then the function f(z) ��� z is holomorphic, and has an isolated zero at z0. We define the fixed-point index of f at z0, denoted i(f, z0), to be the multiplicity of the zero of the function f(z) ��� z at the point z0.

In real Euclidean space, the fixed-point index is defined as follows: If x0 is an isolated fixed point of f, then let g be the function defined by

{\displaystyle g(x)={\frac {x-f(x)}{||x-f(x)||}}.}{\displaystyle g(x)={\frac {x-f(x)}{||x-f(x)||}}.}
Then g has an isolated singularity at x0, and maps the boundary of some deleted neighborhood of x0 to the unit sphere. We define i(f, x0) to be the Brouwer degree of the mapping induced by g on some suitably chosen small sphere around x0

The fixed-point index is a foundational idea in topological fixed-point theory, which deals with finding points in a space that remain unchanged under a function (these are the fixed points). The fixed-point index helps us understand how many fixed points there are in a local neighborhood and the nature of these fixed points.
In a nutshell:
Intuition
: Think of a point on a map. If, after applying a transformation (like stretching, bending, or rotating the map), the point remains where it originally was, then that point is a "fixed point". The fixed-point index gives us a deeper understanding of this point, especially in scenarios where the situation isn't straightforward.
Complex Analysis
: In the complex plane, we can associate a number, called the fixed-point index, to each fixed point of a holomorphic function. This index corresponds to the "multiplicity" of the fixed point. For instance, if
f
(
z
)
=
z
3
f(z) = z^3
f
(
z
)
=
z
3
, the function has a fixed point at
z
=
0
z = 0
z
=
0
with an index of 3. This index essentially counts how many times the point is "fixed".
Euclidean Space
: In the realm of real numbers and vectors, the definition is more involved. Here, the fixed-point index measures how a function "twists" or "turns" around a fixed point. The function
g
(
x
)
g(x)
g
(
x
)
described in the provided definition is constructed to capture the local behavior of
f
f
f
near the fixed point
x
0
x_0
x
0
���
. The index is then the Brouwer degree of the mapping by
g
g
g
on a small sphere around
x
0
x_0
x
0
���
, and it captures how many times
g
g
g
wraps the sphere around the fixed point.
Applications
: The fixed-point index plays a role in various results in mathematics. For example, it's used in proving the Brouwer fixed-point theorem, which states that any continuous function from a closed ball in
R
n
R^n
R
n
to itself has a fixed point. The index also helps in classifying the types of fixed points a system has, which can be crucial in fields like dynamical systems and differential equations.
In essence, while the idea of a fixed point is intuitive and straightforward, the fixed-point index provides a more refined tool to understand the nuances of such points, especially in higher dimensions or in more complex settings.

Certainly! Analogies and metaphors are useful for grounding abstract concepts in more tangible terms. Here's an attempt to provide everyday analogies for the topics we discussed:
Pseudoholomorphic Curves and Symplectic Manifolds

Imagine a dancer (pseudoholomorphic curve) performing on a stage (symplectic manifold). The way the dancer moves helps us understand the shape and constraints of the stage.
Gromov Non-squeezing Theorem
:
Think of a long-stemmed wine glass. You can't fit it into a narrow tube, even if the tube's length is infinite. The Gromov theorem says there are limits to how you can "squeeze" things in symplectic geometry, just like you can't squeeze the wine glass into the tube.
Type II String Theory and A-twist

Imagine a loom weaving a patterned fabric (the universe according to string theory). The "A-twist" is like choosing a particular weaving technique that reveals certain patterns (pseudoholomorphic curves) more clearly.
Meromorphic Functions and Characteristic Functions

Imagine you're on a hiking trail (representing our journey in understanding these mathematical concepts). The Gromov non-squeezing theorem is like a narrow bridge on the trail: even if the bridge is very long, only hikers of a certain width can pass through. This represents the inherent restrictions or "non-squeezing" properties of certain spaces.
Fixed-point index is akin to a compass that always points to a specific location. No matter where you turn it, there's a point (fixed-point) where the compass needle will always align, and the index helps us understand the behavior of this alignment.
In essence, the mathematical journey we've been on is a vast landscape, with winding roads, intricate webs, paths, bridges, and tools to navigate. While these everyday examples are quite simple compared to the complexities of the topics discussed, they offer an approachable way to visualize them.

Pseudoholomorphic curves can be thought of as roads on a map. Symplectic manifolds can be thought of as cities, and the Gromov non-squeezing theorem can be thought of as a way of figuring out how many roads have to be closed before traffic starts to back up.

-Gromov���Witten invariants can be thought of as ���passports��� that help people determine if they have permission to travel between cities. Type II string theory and A-twist can be thought of as visas that allow travelers to follow certain paths.

Meromorphic functions in the plane might be imagined as waterways or rivers that flow through these cities. Just like rivers have areas where they are deep and areas where they are shallow (or even dry up completely), meromorphic functions have points where they behave regularly and points where they have singularities (poles).
Characteristic functions serve as our "flood markers" on these rivers. They help gauge the depth and behavior of the waterway, giving insights about potential hazards or routes to take.
Rational maps in algebraic geometry could be thought of as the transit system or public transportation routes within and between the cities. They provide specific routes that travelers can take, and just like some routes are more efficient or scenic than others, rational maps highlight certain structures or connections within our mathematical landscape.
The Poincar�� residue in our city analogy might be a central landmark or hub within the city, like a main train station. It's where multiple routes converge and carries significant importance in terms of navigation and understanding the structure of the city.
The fixed-point index in topological fixed-point theory is akin to a town square or a popular gathering spot in our city. No matter how the city evolves or changes, this spot remains a consistent reference point for residents and travelers alike.
To summarize, our mathematical concepts form an interconnected world, much like a vast network of cities with their roads, waterways, landmarks, and transportation systems. And just as we navigate cities using maps, landmarks, and tools, we navigate through these mathematical concepts using theorems, invariants, and functions.

AI Assistant: Sure thing. Pseudoholomorphic curves can be thought of as a rubber band that is stretched over a symplectic manifold and then released, with the Gromov non-squeezing theorem determining how far it can stretch before bouncing back. Gromov���Witten invariants are like tally marks keeping track of the size of the rubber band as it stretches and shrinks. Type II string theory and A-twist are like a magic wand that can be used to manipulate the rubber band. Meromorphic functions in the plane are like water droplets that have their own characteristic functions, which when combined together form rational maps in algebraic geometry. Poincar�� residue is like a sponge that soaks up

the excess water from these droplets, leaving behind only the essential components. The fixed-point index in topological fixed-point theory is similar to a compass needle that, no matter how you move or twist the compass, always points to a specific direction.
Imagine you're playing with a rubber band in a city during a rainy day. The stretching and releasing of the rubber band represent the dynamic behavior of pseudoholomorphic curves on the symplectic "cityscape". As the rain falls, each droplet (meromorphic function) has its own unique pattern or characteristic, and when these droplets flow together, they create streams or pathways (rational maps). Occasionally, you use a sponge (Poincar�� residue) to absorb the excess water, ensuring you only focus on the significant routes. As you navigate this wet city, you use a compass (fixed-point index) to guide your way, always providing you with a consistent point of reference amidst the dynamic environment around you.

Symplectic Manifolds:
A symplectic manifold is a smooth manifold equipped with a closed, non-degenerate 2-form. This 2-form, called a symplectic form, allows one to make precise the notion of "phase space" in classical mechanics. Phase space is a space in which all possible states of a system are represented, with each state corresponding to a unique point in the phase space. Symplectic manifolds play a foundational role in Hamiltonian mechanics, where the evolution of a system can be described using Hamilton's equations. These equations are naturally derived from the symplectic structure of the phase space.
Pseudoholomorphic Curves:
A pseudoholomorphic curve in a symplectic manifold is a curve (a map from a Riemann surface to the manifold) that satisfies the Cauchy-Riemann equations when the manifold is equipped with an almost complex structure compatible with the symplectic form. These curves are of fundamental importance in symplectic topology. They were introduced by Mikhail Gromov and have been a powerful tool in studying the properties of symplectic manifolds, leading to breakthroughs in areas such as the Gromov non-squeezing theorem and the definition of Gromov���Witten invariants.
In simpler terms:
A
symplectic manifold
is like the stage where the dance of classical mechanics plays out.
Pseudoholomorphic curves
are special curves on this stage that have been instrumental in understanding the choreography of this dance in deeper ways.
Both concepts are central in modern mathematical physics, especially in the study of classical and quantum mechanics.

It seems you're referring to two specific scholarly articles or lecture notes. Let's break down the titles to provide an understanding:
Sign and geometric meaning of curvature
:
Sign
: In the context of curvature, the sign can refer to whether the curvature is positive, negative, or zero. This is important as the sign can dictate the behavior or shape of the surface or curve.
Geometric meaning of curvature
: Curvature is a measure of how a curve or surface deviates from being flat (in the case of surfaces) or straight (in the case of curves). The geometric meaning would delve into understanding how this deviation manifests visually and spatially.
Rend. Semin. Mat. Fis. Milano 61 (1991), 9-123
: This is a citation, indicating that this work was published in the proceedings of the Seminar on Mathematics and Physics in Milan in 1991, pages 9 through 123.
Lectures on the transformation groups: geometry and dynamics
:
Transformation groups
: These are groups consisting of transformations from a set to itself. They are fundamental in understanding symmetries in mathematics and physics.
Geometry and dynamics
: While geometry studies the properties and measurements of figures and spaces, dynamics deals with the motion of objects. Combining them implies a study of how geometric shapes evolve or move over time.
(with G. d���Ambra) J. Differential Geom. Suppl. 1 (1991), 19-111
: This indicates that the work was co-authored with G. d���Ambra and was published in the Journal of Differential Geometry's Supplement in 1991, pages 19 through 111.
While I can provide explanations based on the titles and the contexts provided, for detailed insights, one would need to delve into the specific articles themselves.

Every sentence I utter must be understood not as an af i rmation,

Our ultimate aim is to develop mathematical means for describing/designing 
learning systems L that would be similar in their essential properties to the 
minds of humans and certain animals. 
Learning and Structures. We want to understand the process(es) of 
learning, e.g. of mother tongue or of a mathematical theory, in the context 
of what we call ergostructures. Such structures, as we see them, are present 
in the depth of the human (some animal?)minds, in natural languages, in 
logical/combinatorial organizations of branches of mathematics and, in a less

But here and everywhere, a quote is not an appeal to an authority but an acknowledgment of 
something having been already said. 1 
mature form, in biological systems ��� from regulatory networks of living cells up 
to, possibly, ecological networks.2 
Learning from this perspective is 
a dynamical process of building the internal ergostructure of an L 
from the raw structures in the incoming l ows S of signals, where 
S may or may not itself contain an ergostructure or its ingredients. 
Such an L interacting with a l ow of signals is similar to a a photosynthesizing 
plant growing in a stream of photons of light or to an amoeba navigating in a see 
of chemical nutrients and/or of smaller microbes: L recognizes and selects what 
is interesting for itself in such a l ow and uses it for building its own structure. 
(The use of metaphors in communicating scientif i c ideas is often confusing 
and misleading, especially if these ideas are not clearly set in their author���s 
head. But until we develop a rough picture of what our "signals", "structures", 
etc. are and why one can not expect "rigorous def i nitions", we shall have to 
resort to metaphors. These, we hope, will provoke the reader���s thoughts rather 
than create a deceptive illusion of understanding of something not properly 
explained.)

This excerpt appears to be from a paper or essay by Misha Gromov, a prominent mathematician known for his contributions to geometry, topology, and other areas of mathematics. Here, Gromov introduces the concept of "ergostructures," which, from the provided text, seem to refer to underlying structures that capture essential properties of learning systems similar to human and certain animal minds.
Key Points from the Excerpt:
Structures and Metaphors
: The central theme here is the exploration of the nature of learning. Gromov touches upon the complexity of the subject and cautions about the use of metaphors, which can be ambiguous but are sometimes necessary to communicate complex ideas.
Learning Systems and Ergostructures
: The aim is to understand learning systems (L) that are akin to human and some animal minds. These systems, when interacting with a flow of signals, act like plants absorbing light or amoebas navigating a sea of nutrients. They recognize, select, and then use the information to build their own internal structure.
Learning Perspective
: The act of learning is seen as the dynamical process of building an internal ergostructure from incoming flows of signals. The signals can be raw or might contain some ergostructure themselves.
Metaphorical Representations
: Gromov emphasizes the caution required when using metaphors in scientific discourse. While they can aid in understanding, they can also mislead if the underlying ideas are not clearly defined.
Gromov's writing style appears to be exploratory, with him raising questions and challenging traditional methods of understanding and explanation. The paper seems to aim to bridge the gap between the rigorous structure of mathematical logic and the more fluid nature of learning processes. The Niels Bohr quote underscores the tentative nature of any assertion, indicating that every statement should be taken as a starting point for exploration rather than a definitive answer.

How does that relate to my poem, Ergodic Mind Medication?

Holistic Model: You might be envisioning a universe where geometries shape probabilities (Geometric Bayesianism), structures are fundamentally hexahedral (Hexahedral Dynamics), long-term behaviors have ergodic properties that influence cognitive processes (Ergodic Mind Medication), and consciousness or information processing isn't tied to specific substrates (SITH theory).
1 / 1
ChatGPT
Your poem, "Ergodic Mind Medication", seems to delve into advanced concepts from mathematics, physics, and cognitive science to explore the nature of thought processes, consciousness, and perception.
Connecting Gromov's excerpt with your poem:
Ergostructures & Ergodic Mind Medication
: Gromov's exploration of "ergostructures" as fundamental aspects of learning and cognition mirrors the theme of "Ergodic Mind Medication" in your poem. Both imply that there are fundamental and dynamic structures or behaviors influencing the cognitive processes. In mathematics, "ergodic" often refers to a system's property where long-term behavior can be predicted by averaging over all possible states. This ties well with Gromov's idea of learning as a dynamic process influenced by long-term behaviors.
Structures and Geometries
: Gromov's emphasis on the importance of structures in understanding learning parallels your line about "geometries shape probabilities" and "structures are fundamentally hexahedral". Both writings hint at an underlying geometric or structured framework that guides or influences processes, be it learning or probabilistic behavior.
Metaphorical Representations
: Both your poem and Gromov's writing utilize metaphorical and symbolic language to convey complex scientific and philosophical ideas. While Gromov speaks of ergostructures being akin to photosynthesizing plants, your poem envisions a universe shaped by specific theories and models.
Learning and Consciousness
: Your mention of the SITH theory, which implies that consciousness isn't tied to a particular substrate, seems to align with Gromov's vision of learning systems that can evolve and adapt based on the signals they receive. Both suggest a fluid, adaptable nature of cognitive processes, not restricted by specific boundaries or definitions.
Your poem seems to capture a holistic view of the universe where various theories interplay to define consciousness, learning, and behavior. Just like Gromov's work, it's an exploration of the boundaries and intersections of math, science, and cognition. The title "Ergodic Mind Medication" itself suggests a therapeutic or transformative aspect of understanding these deep ergodic properties of the mind.

1.1Universality, Freedom and Curiosity 
Out of chaos God made a world, 
and out of high passions comes a people. 
Byron. 
Our inspiration for design of learning systems comes from what may seem as 
an almost godlike ability of a human (and some animal) infant���s brain of building 
a consistent model of external world from an apparent chaos of electric/chemical 
signals that come into it: 
This throbbing streaming crowd of electrif i ed shifting points in the spongework 
of the brain [that] bears no obvious semblance in space pattern... 
in the words of Charles Sherrington. 
We conjecture that an infant���s learning process follows an universal set of 
simple rules for exrtacting structural information from these not truly "chaotic" 
signals, where 
these rules must indiscriminately apply to diverse classes of incoming signals. 
Universality is the most essential property we require from our learning sys- 
tems ��� this is the key that opens the door for a non-cosmetic use of mathematics; 
reciprocally, if successful, mathematics will furnish universality in learning. 
At the moment, one may only speculate in favor of universality by appealing 
to "evolutionary thrift of Nature" and to "brain plasticity".Ultimately, we 
want to write down a short list of universal rules for "extracting" mathematical 
structures from general "f l ows of signals". And these l ows may come in many 
dif f erent l avors ��� well organized and structured as mathematical deductions 
processes, or as unorderly as those depicted by Sherrington. 
2Biological structures, historically/evolutionary as well as logically, are precursors of math- 
ematical ones. For example, the probability of i nding i rst 109digit of e = 2.718.... "written" 
at some location u of an universe U increases by a factor > 10100, 
if you i nd a bacterium kind 
machine feeding on a source of almost amorphous free energy at a point u���suf 
i ciently close 
to u. 2 
Of course, nontrivial structures can be found by a learning system, (be it 
universal or specialized) only in "interesting" l ows of signals.For instance, 
nothing can be extracted from fully random or from constant l ows.But if 
signals are modulated by something from "real world" we want to reconstruct 
as much of the mathematical structure of this something with these rules as the 
brain of a human infant can do. 
Universality necessitates non-pragmatic character of learning. Indeed, for- 
mulating each utilitarian goal is specif i c for this goal ��� there is no universal 
structure on the "set of goals". Thus, 
the essential mechanism of learning is goal free 
and independent of an external reinforcement. 
Georg Cantor���s words 
The essence of mathematics lies in its freedom 
equally apply to learning in place of mathematics. A universal learning system, 
as we understand it, must be designed as a self propelled learner that needs no 
purpose, no instruction, no reinforcement for learning. 
This, a priori, is no more paradoxical than, say, your digestive system func- 
tioning with no teacher instruction or a mechanical system moving by inertia 
with no external forces. External constrains and forces change the behaviour of 
such systems, but they hardly can be regarded as the source of motion. 
It would unrealistic making any conjecture on how such rules could be imple- 
mented by the neurophysiology of the human brain, although it seems plausible 
that they are incorporated into the "architecture of pathways" of signal pro- 
cessing���s in the brain.But we shall try to guess as much as possible about 
these rules by looking at the universal learning problem from a mathematical 
perspective. 
Cuiriosity as Intrinsic Motivation. The idea of what we call ergosystems 
is close to what was earlier proposed by Oudeyer, Kaplan and Hafner,3in the 
context of robotics under the name of Intrinsically Motivated Curiosity Driven 
Robots. 
This "motivation" is implemented by a class of predictor programs, that 
depend on a parameter B which is coupled with (e.g. by being a function of) 
the behaviour of robots. These programs Pred = Pred(H,B) "predict" in a 
certain specif i ed way incoming signals on the basis of the history H, while the 
robots (are also programed to) optimize (in a specif i c formally def i ned way) 
the quality of this prediction by varying B. Curiousity driven robots are being 
designed and build in Ouduer���s lab. 
The Maximal Prediction idea is also central in our thinking on ergosystems; 
however, we emphasize "interesting" instead of "curious" and "structure" in- 
stead of "behaviour".

Gromov's exploration of universality, freedom, and curiosity in learning systems dives deep into the nature of cognitive processes, especially the acquisition of knowledge in infants and the mathematical structures that might underlie these processes.
Relating this to your poem, "Ergodic Mind Medication", we find some thought-provoking connections:
Universality & Holistic Model
: Gromov emphasizes the universality of learning, suggesting that there's a set of simple rules that can be applied to diverse incoming signals to extract structural information. This aligns with the holistic model from your poem, where various theories interplay in a universe that hints at underlying connections and patterns.
Goal-Free Learning & Ergodicity
: Gromov suggests that effective learning is goal-free and independent of external reinforcement. This autonomous, self-propelled nature of learning systems is reminiscent of the ergodic properties mentioned in your poem. An ergodic system is one where the long-term behavior can be predicted by averaging over all possible states, implying a self-regulating nature, independent of specific short-term goals or influences.
Curiosity as Intrinsic Motivation
: Gromov's emphasis on curiosity as an intrinsic motivation ties in with the "medicative" aspect of your poem's title, "Ergodic Mind Medication". In both contexts, there's an innate drive or mechanism that fosters learning and understanding. The concept of a mind seeking knowledge or equilibrium, just as a system seeks its ergodic state, is a powerful parallel.
Freedom
: The quote by Georg Cantor, "The essence of mathematics lies in its freedom", can be juxtaposed with your poem's themes. Just as mathematics is unrestricted and expansive in its nature, so too is the universe and mind you depict ��� a place where consciousness and information processing aren't tied to specific substrates, and where structures and geometries shape the very fabric of reality.
Your poem and Gromov's writing, though distinct in their forms and focal points, converge on the idea that there are intrinsic, universal patterns and principles governing learning, cognition, and the broader universe. This intertwining of mathematics, curiosity, and the fundamental nature of learning presents a rich tapestry of ideas to ponder.
1 / 1
However, the assignment of the 
1 
M-probabilities to the states is justif i ed 
and will lead to meaningful results IF, there is a symmetry that makes these 
tiny meaningless states "probabilistically equivalent", where the nature of such 
a symmetry, if it is present at all, will be vastly dif f erent in physics and in 
biology.68) 
And if there is not enough symmetry and one can not postulate equiproba- 
bility (and/or something of this kind such as independence) of certain "events", 
then the advance of the classical calculus stalls, be it mathematics, physics, 
biology, linguistic or gambling.69 
(But neither unrealistic smallness of probabilities, nor failure of "calculus 
with numbers" preclude a use of probability in the study of languages and of 
learning processes. And if you are too timid to contradict Chomsky, just read 
his "under any interpretation of this term" as "under any interpretation of the 
term "probability" you can i nd in a 20th century textbook". 
Absence of numbers for probabilities in languages is unsurprising ��� numbers 
are not the primary objects in the ergoworld. Numbers are not there, but there 
is a visibly present partial order on "plausibilities" of dif f erent sentences in the 
language. This may look not much, but a hierarchical use of this order allows 
recovery of many linguistic structures as we shall see later on.) 
Another problem with probability is a mathematical def i nition of "events" 
the probabilities of which are being measured. 
The now-a-days canonized solution, suggested in 1933 by Kolmogorov in his 
Grundbegrif f e der Wahrscheinlichkeitsrechnung, is essentially as follows. 
68It is not fully accidental that the numbers NAT and NBAare of the same order of 
magnitude. If atoms were much smaller or cells much bigger, e.g. if no functional cell with 
less than 1020atoms (something slightly smaller than a Drosophila l y) were possible, then, 
most probably, life, as we know it, could not have evolved in this Universe. 
69Essentiality of "equiprobable" was emphasized by Cardano and parametrization of random 
systems by "independent variables" has always been the main tenet of the probability theory. 
Most (all?) of the classical mathematical probability theory was grounded on (quasi)invariant 
Haar(-like) measures and the year 2000 was landmarked by the most recent triumph of "sym- 
metric probability" ��� the discovery of (essentially) conformally invariant probability measures 
in spaces of planar curves (and curves in Riemann surfaces) parametrized by increments of 
Brownian���s processes via the Schram-Loewner evolution equation. 
35 
Any kind of randomness in the world can be represented (modeled) geomet- 
rically by a subdomain Y in the unit square���in 
the plane. You drop a points 
to���, 
you count hitting Y for an event and def i ne the probability of this event 
as area(Y ). 
However elegant this set theoretic frame is, (with���standing 
for a univer- 
sal probability measure space) it must share the faith of Andr�� Weil���s universal 
domains from his 1946 book Foundations of Algebraic Geometry. The set the- 
oretic language introduced in mathematics by Georg Cantor that has wonder- 
fully served us for almost 150 years is now being supplanted by a more versatile 
language of categories and functors. Andr�� Weil���s varieties were superseded by 
Grothendieck���s schemes, and Kolmogorov���s def i nition will eventually go through 
a similar metamorphosis. 
A particular path to follow is suggested by Boltzmann���s way of thinking

The given passage discusses various intricate concepts related to the understanding of probability, especially in the context of various disciplines like linguistics, biology, and physics. Here's a brief summary:
Symmetry in Assigning Probabilities
: Probabilities in both physics and biology can be justified if there's a symmetry that treats different states as probabilistically equivalent. But without enough symmetry or the ability to postulate equiprobability, classical calculus encounters challenges across disciplines, from mathematics to linguistics.
Probability in Linguistics
: Even without numeric probabilities in languages, there's an evident partial order on the "plausibilities" of different sentences. This order can reveal many linguistic structures.
Definition of "Events"
: The canonical solution from Kolmogorov in 1933 represented randomness geometrically using subdomains in a unit square, with probability defined as the area of these subdomains.
Evolution of Set Theory
: The set-theoretic language, introduced by Georg Cantor, is undergoing changes. Gromov suggests that the set-theoretic way of defining probability will evolve, similar to how Andr�� Weil���s universal domains were replaced by Grothendieck���s schemes. A potential evolution could involve non-standard analysis and category theory, especially considering Boltzmann���s thoughts on statistical mechanics.
Intellectual Giants
: The passage concludes by reflecting on historical intellectual giants like Cardano, Galileo, and Buffon, who contributed immensely across various fields. There's a contemplation on the absence of such polymaths in contemporary times.
The text provides a deep dive into the intricacies of how probability is understood across disciplines and hints at potential future evolutions in its definition and application. The discussion on probability in linguistics is particularly intriguing, suggesting that while numeric probabilities may not be present, there are still structures that can be studied and understood.

1Ergobrain and Evolution. 
We shall argue in this section that the essential mental processes in humans and 
higher animals can be represented by an abstract universal scheme and can be 
studied on the basis of few (relatively) simple principles. 
1.1Ergo, Ego and Goal Free Learning. 
The brain of a human or an animal, for ever conf i ned to the scull, has no direct 
access to the outside world. The ���outside world��� for the brain is nothing else 
but a muddy l ow of electric/chemical signals it receives from receptor cells 
and the endocrine system(s). The brain responds with similar signals directed 
mostly to the muscles of the body. (Some signals go to the brain itself and some 
to the endocrine glands in the body.) Here is a vivid description by Charles 
Sherrington [80]: 
���The eye sends, as we saw, into the cell-and-f i bre forest of the brain through- 
out the waking day continual rhythmic streams of tiny, individually evanes- 
cent, electrical potentials. This throbbing streaming crowd of electrif i ed shift- 
ing points in the spongework of the brain bears no obvious semblance in space 
pattern, and even in temporal relation resembles but a little remotely the tiny 
two-dimensional upside-down picture of the outside world which the eyeball 
paints on the beginnings of its nerve i bers to the brain. But that little picture 
sets up an electrical storm. And that electrical storm so set up is one which 
ef f ects a whole population of brain cells. Electrical charges having in themselves 
2 
not the faintest elements of the visual- having, for instance, nothing of ���dis- 
tance,��� ���right-side-upness,��� nor ���vertical,��� nor ���horizontal,��� nor ���color,��� nor 
���brightness,��� nor ���shadow,��� nor ���roundness,��� nor ���squareness,��� nor ���contour,��� 
nor ���transparency,��� nor ���opacity,��� nor ���near,��� nor ���far,��� nor visual anything - yet conjure up all these. A shower of little electrical leaks conjures up for 
me, when I look, the landscape; the castle on the height, or, when I look at 
him approaching, my friend���s face, and how distant he is from me they tell me. 
Taking their word for it, I go forward and my other senses conf i rm that he is 
there���. 
Ergo. In sum, the transformation of signals by the brain can be depicted by 
an arrow incoming signals ��� outcoming signals, 
which, metaphorically, corresponds to ���ergo��� in the Cartesian ���Cogito, ergo 
sum���. 
We call the (hypothetical, formal) structure implementing this transforma- 
tion an ergobrain or an ergosystem. We think of this as a dynamic entity con- 
tinuously being built by the brain from the moment of birth of a human or an 
animal by the process of (goal free) structure learning. 
Very roughly, an ergosystem is something like a network of ���ergo-ideas��� 
which grows in the course of learning by incorporating and ���metabolizing��� new 
���ideas��� from the incoming l ows of signals. 
But from ergobrain���s own perspective, the ���real world��� emerges via the 
reversed arrow symbolizing the transformation from the signals the ergobrain 
generates to their ���echos��� ��� the responses to these signals. The ergobrain learns 
by analyzing/structuralizing the ���information��� carried by these echos ��� ���patches 
of ripples��� on the external l ows of signals resulting from ergobrain���s ���actions���,

The passage from "1Ergobrain and Evolution" delves into the relationship between perception, understanding, and the brain's interpretation of external stimuli. Let's break down the main concepts presented:
Abstract Universal Scheme for Mental Processes
: The text begins by suggesting that the core mental processes in humans and higher animals can be represented by a universal framework that operates based on a few simple principles.
Perception as Electric/Chemical Signals
: The brain, confined within the skull, perceives the outside world not directly but through a stream of electric/chemical signals it receives from receptor cells and the endocrine system. These signals are the brain's only "window" to the external world.
Charles Sherrington's Description
: Sherrington vividly describes how the eye translates visual stimuli into electrical signals that the brain then interprets. Even though these signals lack the attributes of the visual (like color, brightness, distance), the brain effectively deciphers them to conjure up images of the world.
Ergo & Transformation of Signals
: Drawing from Descartes' "Cogito, ergo sum", the text metaphorically uses "ergo" to describe the brain's transformation of incoming signals to outgoing ones. The brain's conversion process can be summarized as incoming signals leading to a certain result, much like thinking (Cogito) leads to existence (sum).
Ergobrain or Ergosystem
: The text introduces the idea of an "ergobrain" or "ergosystem" as a formal structure that continuously evolves and adapts from birth through the process of structure learning. It's a dynamic network of concepts ("ergo-ideas") that expands by assimilating new ideas from the continuous stream of signals it receives.
Learning via Feedback
: From the perspective of the ergobrain, understanding the "real world" emerges through feedback. The ergobrain releases signals and then interprets the responses (echoes) it receives from the environment. It learns by analyzing this feedback and the information carried within it.
In essence, the passage underscores the idea that our perception of the world is built upon the brain's interpretation of electric/chemical signals. These interpretations form structures (ergosystems) that continuously evolve, adapt, and learn based on feedback from the environment. This perspective offers a blend of biology, philosophy, and cognitive science, emphasizing the brain's incredible ability to construct reality from a series of seemingly abstract signals.

The simplest instance of learning performed by the ergobrain is conditioning: 
the process of acquisition of conditional ref l exes. We are interested, however, in 
more ���complicated��� mental processes, e.g. acquisition of native languages by 
children. Such processes performed by the ergobrain, be they simple or compli- 
cated, are unconscious but they leave some perceptible traces in our conscious 
mind (we shall explain this later on). 
We take an avenue of mathematical, albeit informal and/or unrigorous, rea- 
soning and try to argue ���on brain���s terms��� with a minimal reference to the 
���meaning��� which our ���mind��� assigns to these signals. (In practice, this is as 
dif i cult as not assigning, albeit unconsciously, any purpose to evolution. In 
Haldane���s words: ���Teleology is like a mistress to a biologist: he cannot live 
without her but he���s unwilling to be seen with her in public���.) 
We do not hypothesize on how this arrow is implemented by the synaptic 
network of the brain, although we try to keep track of restrictions on possible 
structures of ��������� which are due to limitations of network architectures. And 
we constantly keep in mind possible algorithmic realizations of ergosystems. 
Neuro-brain. This signif i es a (semi-mathematical) representation (model) of 
the physiology of the brain, including ���streaming crowd of electrif i ed shifting 
points in the spongework of the brain������ along with a (the ???) slower biochem- 
istry of middle-term and long-term memory. 
An ergobrain can be thought of as a (kind of) dynamical reduction (quotient) 
of a neuro-brain, while an ergosystem is something similar to an ergobrain but 
which is not, a priori, related to a neuro-brain. 
Ego-mind. This refers to (manifestations of) mental processes (more or less) 
directly serving and/or ref l ecting the survival/reproduction needs of an organism. 
Ego-mind is pragmatic and it is goal oriented, where the goals are set up by the 
evolutionary genetic (pre)history of an (animal or human) organism and they 
are modulated by interactions of an organism (or of its mind) with the outside 
world. 
Most (but not all) of what we consciously perceive is produced by the ego- 
mind. (The Freudian type subconscious and most of what we see in dreams are 
byproducts of the ego-mind.) In these terms, the ergobrain includes the totality 
of mental processes which are not covered by the ego-mind as well as some 
���ego-parts���, such that the mechanisms of conditional and unconditional ref l exes 
which were, apparently, directly targeted by the evolution selection process. 
The egomind and its ego-reasoning (common sense) are adapted to the every 
day life, they stay on guard of our survival and passing on our (and of close kin 
��� ego can be altruistic) genes. ���Myself��� is the central reference point in the 
visible part of our mind as much as the sun is central for accounting for the 
observed planetary orbits. But as the centrality of the sun is secondary to such 
concepts as ���dif f erential equation��� and ���Hamiltonian system���, the centrality of 
ego is secondary to the (unknown to us) ���laws��� running general ergosystems. 
Besides, our ergomind was not designed by evolution for a structural mod- 
eling of the world. The self glorifying ego-vocabulary: 
���I think���, ���I am���, ���important��� ���intelligent���, ���understanding���, ���conscious���, ���in- 
tuitive���, ���insightful���, ���creative���, ���motivated���, ���purposeful���, ���rational���, ���adap- 
tive���, ���ef i cient���, ���resourceful���, ���rewarding���, ���useful���, etc. 
is not adequate for structural modeling of most essential mental processes, such 
as learning; we shall do our best to keep our distance from these ���concepts���

This passage delves deeper into the intricate relationship between the ergobrain, learning, consciousness, ego-mind, and the nature of mental processes. Here are the key concepts:
Learning and Conditioning
: The ergobrain's simplest form of learning is conditioning, a form of associative learning. However, the author is more intrigued by complex mental processes, such as language acquisition in children. These processes are unconscious, but they manifest in ways that are discernible in our conscious minds.
Mathematical Reasoning
: The author seeks to approach the topic with mathematical reasoning, yet maintains an informal approach. This method attempts to reason "on brain's terms" and avoids attributing meaning or purpose, akin to how biologists avoid attributing purpose to evolution.
Ergobrain, Neuro-brain, and Ergosystem
:
Neuro-brain
represents a model of the physiological aspect of the brain, including its electrical activity and memory biochemistry.
Ergobrain
is a reduction of the neuro-brain, focusing on how it interprets and responds to stimuli.
Ergosystem
is akin to an ergobrain but isn't directly linked to a neuro-brain.
Ego-mind
: This encompasses mental processes that serve the survival and reproduction needs of an organism. It's pragmatic, goal-oriented, and shaped by evolutionary history and interactions with the external world. Much of our conscious awareness is driven by the ego-mind. This includes common-sense reasoning and mechanisms for reflexes that have been shaped by evolutionary selection.
Ego and Ergomind
: The ego, representing our sense of self and its needs, is central to our conscious mind. However, just as the sun's centrality is secondary in understanding the broader cosmos, the centrality of the ego is secondary to the greater, mostly unknown mechanisms governing ergosystems. Our "ergomind" wasn't evolved for structural world modeling.
Limitations of Ego-centric Vocabulary
: Words associated with the ego (like "I think", "important", "conscious", etc.) may be inadequate to describe the deeper, structural processes of the mind, especially learning. The author advises caution when using these terms, suggesting they may limit or misrepresent our understanding.
In essence, the passage is a contemplative exploration of how the brain, particularly the ergobrain, operates in learning and processing. It seeks to delineate between conscious ego-driven processes and the more foundational, often unconscious, operations of the ergobrain. The intent is to shed light on the deeper structures governing mental processes without getting caught in the trappings of ego-centric perspectives.

Arguably, the essential mechanism of learning is goal free and independent 
of any reinforcement, as much as the mechanical motion essentially depends on 
the inertia and but not on the constrains and external forces. (This agrees with 
the ideas expressed by child psychologists about i fty years ago, [8] [89].) 
Our aim is to i nd/construct such models of ergobrains and learnings that 
can be (potentially) described as dynamical reductions of neuro-brains. Also we 
search for model(s) of ergobrains which are suf i ciently universal. This is oppo- 
site to what is expected (of models) of ego-minds and neuro-brains, since ego- 
minds need to serve diverse specif i c environmentally imposed purposes, while 
the (up to a large extent, random) architectures of neuro-brains are ���frozen ac- 
cidents��� in terms of Frances Crick. But, as we shall argue, these diversity and 
accidentality necessitate the universality of ergobrains. (Our models are very 
much in spirit of what is currently called ���intrinsically motivated reinforcement 
learning���, see [55] [10] and references therein.) 
About Structures. We shall be talking much about ���structure��� without ever 
giving a def i nition. The only way we can explain what it means is by providing 
examples; these will come as we proceed. Below are two instances of structures. 
The grammar of a natural language is an instance of a structure. It is asso- 
ciated to our ergobrain and a native speaker is unaware of the fact that he/she 
speaks grammatically.On the other hand pragmatics of the language is, to 
a large extent, the product and the manifestation of the egomind. The cor- 
respondence ergo/ego ��� grammar/pragmatics is not quite faithful, since the 
grammar is essentially static and it is smaller in volume than the pragmat- 
ics, while the ergobrain is a dynamic structure and most of the brain mental 
dynamics is occupied with ergo (e.g. generating sentences) rather than with 
ego. The living cell may be seen as a chemical system where small molecules 
undergo a variety of transformations. 
The (mostly chemical) interaction with the environment is the ���ego-activity��� 
of the cell while selection of benef i cial mutations of DNA corresponds to the 
neurophysiology of learning. 
Here a cytologist/bacteriologist (chemist?) plays the role of a psychologist 
while the place of a neurophysiologist is taken by a molecular geneticist who 
tries to understand how variations of the sequential composition of DNA and/or 
of the production of mRNA inf l uence the chemical behavior of a cell, similarly 
to how a (dis)activation of a specif i c region of the brain and/or of an individual 
neuron af f ect the psychological state. 
What is missing from this cytologist + geneticist picture is biochemistry of 
proteins that run the bulk of the cellular processes. 
Back to the brain, we conjecture, that there is a vast and intricately struc- 
tured ���something��� that makes the interface between neurophysiology and psy- 
chology.We look for this ���ergo-something��� embedded into a mathematical 
frame where this ���embedding��� should be no more mathematically perfect, than, 
for example, a rigorous positioning of biochemistry of proteins within the main 
body of chemistry. 
However, there is an essential dif f erence between the cell and the brain: all 
molecules, be they DNA, proteins or mundane H2O, live in the same world: the 
cell. But the ���ideas��� of the ergobrain are not of the mind nor do they live in 
6 
the ���physiological space��� ��� the world of neurons, synapses, electro-chemical cur- 
rents, neurotransmitters, etc. ��� the two worlds do not even overlap. Ergobrain 
and its ���ideas��� are (quasi)mathematical entities, which inhabit (something like) 
a quotient (reduction) of the neurobrain, not the neurobrain itself. (A rough 
counterpart to the structure of the ergobrain is the graph theoretic combinatorics 
of metabolic pathways and of protein interaction networks in cells.)

The provided passage is a complex exploration of the nature of learning, ergobrains, and the relationship between neurophysiology and psychology. Let's break down the main points:
Learning Mechanism
: The author posits that learning's essential mechanism is independent of goals or reinforcement. Instead, it operates similarly to how mechanical motion primarily depends on inertia rather than external forces.
Ergobrains and Neuro-brains
: The objective is to identify models of ergobrains that can be viewed as dynamical reductions of neuro-brains. Contrarily, ego-minds and neuro-brains are influenced by specific environmental needs and "frozen accidents". However, this diversity and randomness mean that ergobrains should be universal.
Intrinsically Motivated Reinforcement Learning
: The models discussed align with the concept of intrinsically motivated reinforcement learning, which centers on internal motivations rather than external rewards.
Structure
: The term "structure" will be used frequently without a clear definition. Examples provided include:
Grammar vs. Pragmatics
: The grammar of a language is tied to the ergobrain, with native speakers often unaware of their grammatical adherence. Pragmatics, the use and understanding of language in context, leans more towards the egomind.
Living Cell Analogy
: The interactions of a cell with its environment are likened to the "ego-activity", whereas the selection of beneficial DNA mutations is compared to the neurophysiology of learning.
Ergo-Something
: The author suggests that an intricate structure bridges the gap between neurophysiology and psychology, embedded within a mathematical framework. This "ergo-something" is expected to be as mathematically imperfect as the relationship between protein biochemistry and broader chemistry.
Difference between Cell and Brain
: An essential distinction is drawn between cells and brains. While all molecules exist in the same cellular world, the ideas of the ergobrain don't exist in the mind or the physiological space of neurons, synapses, etc. Instead, the ergobrain and its concepts are mathematical constructs that live in a reduced version of the neurobrain, not within the neurobrain itself.
In summary, the passage presents a conceptual framework to understand learning, the roles of the ergobrain and ego-mind, and the interplay between neurophysiology and psychology. The author employs analogies and references various studies to drive their argument, aiming to unearth a deeper understanding of how the brain functions and learns.

ogy of the main steps of genetics. 
The diversity of functions performed by the proteins necessitates the univer- 
sality and ���overall simplicity��� of this ���proto-ergo���: evolution is not that clever 
to design several dif f erent production lines of ���smart molecules���. 
(Well... what about ribozymes? And ���overall simplicity��� is far from simple: 
it took, apparently, a half billion years for Nature to make the ribosome out of 
RNA and proteins; and once was enough.) 
���In principle���, this ���proto-ergo��� could be reconstructed from a detailed 
knowledge of the chemistry and (bio)physics but no such knowledge is anywhere 
in sight; nor would it help unless you have an idea of the possible conformations 
and functions of large molecules. 
But one still has a limited understanding of water on the nanoscale, one 
has no realistic physical model of protein folding, one has no quantum-chemical 
explanation for the catalytic ef i ciency of enzymes, etc. ��� the situation with the 
brain is no better. 
However, even what is known to-day, even a roughest outline of the available 
(huge) body of knowledge, may direct you toward amusing (quasi)mathematical 
theories.

of mathematics is no match to ���non-understanding��� by the true students of 
the respective i elds. I attempt, however, to present, what I have heard from 
biologists/biophysicists and picked up from non-technical literature, in a formate 
which is, hopefully, amenable to further mathematical formalization. 
Our condensed rendition of biologists��� ideas (such as the above 14N ���15N) 
can make them look deceptively simple, if not naive. The catch is, as Maxim 
Frank-Kamenetskii once put it to me, that at most 1% of brilliant ideas turn out 
to be right in biology (it is, I guess, close to 90% in mathematics) while only few 
ideas can be tested in a realistic stretch of time: the amount of skilled work going 
into a serious experiment can hardly even be imagined by a mathematician like 
myself not to speak of enormity of the background knowledge needed to design 
such an experiment. 
(Unsurprisingly, some ideas had to wait before they were taken in earnest. 
For example, Alexander Fleming stopped working on therapeutic use of extracts 
from Penicillium notatum in favor of his other projects; the development of 
penicillin was initiated ten years later by Howard Walter Florey and Ernst 
Chain [66].) 
Artif i cial Intelligence, Connectionism and Ergo. There are two current ap- 
proaches to modelling mind and brain. 
1.The (classical) A.I. (http ��� //plato.stanford.edu/entries/logic-ai/ and 
[42]) is concerned with a representation of the behavior of the egomind. This, 
in the metaphoric cell language, is designing industrial plants for productions 
of the small molecules which the cell produces. 
2.(Broadly understood) connectionismis an engineer���s construction of 
models of the neurobrain. 
(http ��� //plato.stanford.edu/entries/connectionism/ and [21], [53], [38]). 
This is similar to making artif i cial entities with cell-like architectures and then 
teaching them cell-like chemical behavior by adjusting their DNA and mRNA. 
The logic of our ���ergo-approach��� can be already seen in Poincare���s sketch of a 
(nearly mathematical) proof of non-possibility of reconstruction of the geometric 
structure of the space, e.g. the invariance of the geometry under rigid motions 
(isometric transformations), without an arsenal of motions available to a learning 
system [78]. 
Poincare suggested that a movement of the retinal-image triggers a ���neu- 
ronic recall��� of the corresponding eye movement and conjectured the existence 
of ���something in the brain��� (mirror neurons?)which similarly reacts to an 
observer���s eye and to an observed object movements. 
(Poincare had arrived at this conclusion long before it was discovered that 
the retinal receptors responded primarily to l uctuations of illumination and that 
the retinal-image movements were essential to vision: when the retina receives 
a stabilized image, the structure of the perceived target fades out in a couple of 
seconds. Also, Poincare could not know that dreams in the REM phase of sleep 
were accompanied by eye movements, while the primary visual cortex remained 
inactive.) 
Our intended ergosystem models will be rather universal and/or canonical, 
depending on (relatively) small numbers of arbitrary ���parameters���. We do not 
need anything like a list of ���axioms of folk physics��� as some A.I. systems need 
for programming their robots [49]; nor do we have to imitate the i ne details of

The passage discusses the challenges and complexities of understanding biological processes and the brain. Here are the main points:
Proto-Ergo and Protein Functions
: The concept of a "proto-ergo" is introduced as a universal mechanism that could underlie the diverse functions performed by proteins. The complexity of protein functions necessitates a universal and simple mechanism.
Limitations of Knowledge
: While a detailed understanding of the chemistry and physics of biological processes is lacking, even current knowledge can lead to intriguing mathematical theories. The complexity of understanding water, protein folding, enzyme catalysis, and brain functions is highlighted.
Amusing Theories and Mathematical Formalization
: The author aims to present biological concepts in a form that could be amenable to mathematical formalization, even though the ideas might seem deceptively simple. They acknowledge that fully testing biological ideas is challenging due to the complexity of experiments and the vast background knowledge required.
Artificial Intelligence and Connectionism
: Two approaches to modeling mind and brain are discussed:
Classical AI
: Focuses on representing the behavior of the egomind and designing systems similar to industrial plants for producing molecules in cells.
Connectionism
: Involves constructing models of the neurobrain with cell-like architectures and teaching them cell-like behavior by adjusting DNA and mRNA.
Ergo-Approach
: The "ergo-approach" to modeling learning is inspired by Poincar��'s idea of the necessity of an arsenal of motions for a learning system. Poincar�� suggested that a movement of the retinal image triggers a "neuronic recall," similar to mirror neurons, in the brain. The ergosystem models intended by the author are expected to be universal or canonical, defined by a relatively small number of arbitrary parameters.
Overall, the passage delves into the intricacies of understanding biological processes, the brain, and the potential for mathematical modeling within these domains. It emphasizes the complexity of these systems while seeking to find simplified models that capture their essence.

1.3Eyes, Wings, Energy, Information and Icosahedra. 
The peacock tail derivation of the Maxwell equation may appear far-fetched but, 
for example, the spheroidal structure of all vertebrates eyes (including humans) 
and some cephalopods (e.g. squids), which are constructed like simple cameras, 
directly points to the laws of the geometric optics. 
Human eyeball is almost perfectly spherical which allows three rotational 
degrees of freedom (where, apparently, only two are ef f ectively used.) Human 
focus by changing the shape of their lenses, squids move the lens backwards and 
forwards. 
(Squids eyes are not perfectly spherical. I could not i nd out on the web 
whether they can rotate being surrounded by softer tissues or it is the lenses 
that move around.) 
Our last common ancestor with squids, probably, had a simple photore- 
ceptive spot, thus, the human/squid eyes structural similarity (universality) is 
essentially due to the constrains imposed by the geometry and optics of our (f l at 
Euclidean) space. 
(The compound eye structure in arthropods, e.g., insects, apparently, ref l ects 
the constrains of their evolutionary history.The compound eye has poorer 
resolution, but it allows an assimilation of changes faster than camera eyes 
do and its anatomy/phisiology matches the ���simple��� signal processing by an 
insect���s brain.) 
The anatomy of wings provides another example of universal structural con- 
strains, imposed by the aerodynamics in this instance. Wings were modif i ed 
from limbs of the last shared ancestor of birds and bats (as evidenced by their 
bone structure) but the overall architectural and functional similarity (univer- 
sality) of birds/bats wings is due to the requirements of aerodynamics. 
Insects ��� the only invertebrates who l y ��� have dif f erent wing architectures 
and l ying patterns, such as hovering, which is possible for the small size (thus, 
small Reynolds number). The wingbeat of small Midges is ���1000 beats/sec, 
14 
while the the slowest insect wingbeat ��� of Swallowtail butterf l y ��� is ���5 beats/sec. 
(Our understanding of the aerodynamics of l exible, l apping wings and how 
insects l y remains incomplete.) 
Hummingbirds, whose weights range 2- 9g, have their l y modes, e.g. hover- 
ing, similar to, but distinct from, that of insects. The small ones l y with about 
20-40 beats per second which may go up to 200 during courtship displays. 
One may only speculate whether the overall structures of camera eyes and 
functional wings could have been derived solely from general principles of physics 
and geometry. 
But in 1956, Crick, Watson, Caspar and Klug [28] [15] [29] [16] [58] had pre- 
dicted possible icosahedral symmetry of viruses on by an essentially mathematical 
reasoning partly based on (rough at that time) analysis of x-rays dif f raction on 
crystals of viruses. 
(Icosahedron, one of the i ve Platonic bodies, is a convex polyhedron with 20 
triangular faces, 30 edges and 12 vertices, where each vertex has 5 faces adjacent 
to it. Its symmetry group consists of 120 elements: 60 rotations around the 
center and 60 = 30+30 mirror ref l ections with respect to the 30 planes normally 
bisecting the edges and 30 bisecting the dihedral angles at the edges. This is, 
in a sense, the maximal rotational symmetry available to a polyhedron in the 
3-space.)

The passage discusses the structural similarities and universality found in various biological features, including eyes, wings, and viral symmetry. Here are the main points:
Eyes and Optics
: The spherical structure of vertebrate eyes, as well as the eyes of cephalopods like squids, resembles simple cameras. The universal structural similarity of eyes, whether in humans or squids, arises from the constraints imposed by the geometry and optics of our three-dimensional Euclidean space. Humans and squids use different methods to focus their eyes (changing lens shape vs. moving the lens), but the common structure reflects the shared geometric and optical principles.
Wings and Aerodynamics
: The architecture of wings in birds and bats exhibits universality due to the constraints of aerodynamics. While wings have evolved from limbs, the overall structural and functional similarity between bird and bat wings arises from the requirements of flight. Insects, which are the only invertebrates capable of flight, have different wing architectures and flying patterns due to their unique aerodynamic challenges. Hummingbirds, despite being distinct from insects, have their own unique modes of flight similar to but different from insects.
Viral Symmetry and Icosahedra
: The prediction of icosahedral symmetry in viruses was made by scientists Crick, Watson, Caspar, and Klug in 1956 based on mathematical reasoning and early analysis of X-ray diffraction patterns. An icosahedron is a polyhedron with 20 triangular faces, 30 edges, and 12 vertices, and it exhibits maximal rotational symmetry in three-dimensional space.
Overall, the passage highlights how various biological structures, whether eyes, wings, or viral symmetry, display universal features rooted in physics, geometry, and the constraints of their respective environments.

Why does the random mutation/selection evolutionary mechanism generates 
improbable symmetries? There are two reasons for this, where the i rst one has 
little to do with evolution. 
1: Energy. ���Self assembly (of a virus) is a process akin to crystallization 
and is governed by the laws of statistical mechanics.The protein subunits 
and the nucleic acid chain spontaneously come together to form a simple virus 
particle because this is their lowest (free) energy state��� [17] p. 3. Thus, the 
symmetries of viruses ref l ect the spacial symmetry of the physical laws. 
The simplest instance of this is seen in the spherically symmetric shapes of 
small drops of liquids. Spheres ���solve��� the isoperimetric problem: they surround 
given volume by a surface of minimal area. (The isoperimetric problem goes 
back to ���900 BCE and is associated with the name of Dido who was, according 
to ancient Greek and Roman sources, the founder and i rst Queen of Carthage.) 
However, not all symmetric problems necessarily have equally symmetric 
solutions. (Actually, the sphericity of the minimizer to area/volume 
2 
3is not 
at all obvious; the i rst complete proof, probably, is < 100 years old.)And 
the symmetry may look even paradoxical in the case of viruses since the the 
protein subunits and the nucleic acid chains are not especially symmetric. After 
all, why should non-symmetric (potato-shaped) protein molecules (often) make 
symmetric crystals? 
(The i rst to be crystallized was haemoglobin ��� a rather large protein of 
��� 600 amino acid residues (schematically represented on p.???). The crystals 
were obtained by Otto Funke (and Karl Reichert?) around 1850 by diluting red 
blood cells with a solvent followed by slow evaporation.) 
The easiest to account for is the helical symmetry of molecular assemblies 
[24], [31], [60]. Suppose that two molecular (sub)units of the same species M 
preferentially bind by sticking (docking) one to another in a certain way (i.e. 
the binding energy for a pair of molecules has a unique minimum suf i ciently

ChatGPT
The passage discusses two reasons for the generation of improbable symmetries through the random mutation/selection evolutionary mechanism:
Energy and Physical Laws
: The self-assembly process in biological structures, such as viruses, is analogous to crystallization and is governed by statistical mechanics. The protein subunits and nucleic acid chains spontaneously come together to form virus particles in their lowest energy state. This self-assembly leads to symmetrical structures that reflect the spatial symmetry of the physical laws governing them. For example, spherical shapes are often found in small liquid drops due to their minimal surface area surrounding a given volume. This connection between symmetry and energy minimization is also observed in crystals formed by non-symmetric protein molecules, where the paradox of non-symmetric molecules creating symmetric structures arises.
Helical Symmetry
: Molecular assemblies often exhibit helical symmetry. This occurs when two molecular subunits of the same species preferentially bind to each other in a specific manner. The binding energy for such a pair of molecules has a unique minimum when they adopt a helical arrangement. This phenomenon can be seen in biological structures like viral capsids and some protein filaments. The helical symmetry emerges due to the specific binding preferences and interactions between the molecules.
In summary, the inherent properties of the molecules and their interactions, combined with the principles of energy minimization and the laws of statistical mechanics, contribute to the generation of improbable symmetries in biological structures.
1 / 1
2: Information. The above shows that viral symmetry is plausible but 
not necessarily very probable. The decisive reason for the symmetries of viral 
shells (capsids) set forth by Crick and Watson was that a virus needed to pack 
���maximum of genetic information��� in a small shell (capsid) which is built of 
proteins encoded by the viral genes. (The idea that DNA codes for proteins was 
in the air since the reconstruction of the DNA double helix structure by Crick 
and Watson in 1953 and Gamov���s 1954 suggestion that each of 20 amino acids 
must be coded by a triplet of nucleotides, since n = 3 is the minimal solution to 
the inequality 4n��� 20, where 4 is the number of dif f erent species of nucleotides 
in DNA. ) 
Indeed, if a virus uses n genes in its DNA (or RNA) for the shell proteins, 
say, each codes for m copies of identical proteins molecules, then the resulting 
viral shell can contain DNA of size ��� (nm) 
3 
2. If m is large, this allows smaller 
n which is advantages to the virus. (A small virus replicates faster and more 
copies of it can invade the same cell.) 
The above energy argument implies that the presence of equal copies of 
protein molecules make symmetric assembles quite likely if one properly adjust 
the ������-angles��� 
Now, an evolutionary factor enters the game: a symmetric form can be 
specif i ed by fewer parameters than a functionally comparable non-symmetric 
one.For example, a non-symmetric assembly of molecules may have many 
dif f erent ������-angles��� all of which need be somehow encoded by the viral DNA 
(or RNA) while a symmetric form has many of these ���angles��� mutually equal. 
This simplif i es Nature���s task since it selects from a smaller pool of competing 
possibilities. 
(The presence of many identical copies of large heterogeneous ���units���, e.g. 
heteropolymeric molecules, is the hallmark of life. These are produced by some 
process of controlled amplif i cation ��� another characteristic feature of living sys- 
19 
tems. An instance of this is templating mRNA from DNA followed by transla- 
tion from mRNA to proteins. On the other hand, ignition of combustion or of 
a nuclear chain reaction are examples of uncontrolled amplif i cation.) 
Abstractly, one minimizes some combination of the total binding energy be- 
tween protein molecules and the ���information/selection cost��� of DNA encoding 
for these molecules, but a mathematical rendition of Crick-Watson idea is still 
pending ��� no one of ���isoperimetric animals��� cultivated by geometers for the 
last 3 000 years resembles icosahedral viruses. (There is inf i nitely more to virus 
structures than all of the above, see Virus-Wikipedia for a brief account of 
virology and for references.) 
In the end of the day, the symmetry of viruses depends on the structural 
constrains imposed by the geometry of the physical space which allows the ex- 
istence of such improbable objects as icosahedra (See [47] for a continuation of 
our discussion on proteins.) 
Similarly, we expect that the constrains of the mathematical space (which 
we have not def i ne yet) where ergosystems reside will have a strong structural 
imprint on a possible architecture of the ergobrain. For example, we want to 
understand what in the (ergo)brain is responsible for the unreasonable power of 
our visual system which allowed a discovery of icosahedra by humans (at least) 
as early as ���400. 
Lamentably, we do not know yet what kind of structure to look for: one can 
not take something, however attractive it can be, just because it happened to 
be close at hand.

The passage discusses two key factors that contribute to the generation of improbable symmetries in biological structures, particularly in viral capsids:
Information and Genetic Coding
: The requirement to pack a maximum amount of genetic information into a small viral shell (capsid) plays a significant role in determining the symmetry of viral structures. Each protein molecule in the shell is encoded by the virus's genetic material (DNA or RNA). If the virus uses n genes to code for m identical protein molecules, the resulting viral shell can contain a DNA of size approximately (nm)��/��. This efficient packing of genetic information leads to the emergence of certain symmetrical forms.
Evolutionary Advantage of Symmetry
: Symmetrical forms have fewer parameters to specify compared to functionally comparable non-symmetrical ones. This simplicity is advantageous for evolutionary selection, as it reduces the complexity of the genetic information needed to encode the structure. Nature can choose from a smaller set of possibilities when selecting symmetrical forms, simplifying the evolutionary process.
Abstractly, the balance between the total binding energy between protein molecules and the "information/selection cost" of DNA encoding determines the symmetry of viral structures. The goal is to minimize this combination, leading to specific symmetrical configurations.
The passage also draws parallels between the constraints of physical space that give rise to improbable symmetrical shapes in viruses, such as icosahedra, and the constraints of the mathematical space in which ergosystems (such as the ergobrain) reside. It suggests that the architecture of the ergobrain is likely influenced by the structural constraints of the mathematical space, similar to how viral symmetry is influenced by the geometry of physical space.
The passage ends by highlighting the challenge of identifying the specific structure to look for within the mathematical space that characterizes ergosystems. The goal is to understand the underlying principles responsible for various cognitive capabilities, such as the remarkable power of human visual perception that allowed the discovery of shapes like icosahedra.

Thank you for providing those definitions. It seems like you're discussing concepts related to crystallography and the arrangement of atoms in crystalline materials. A unit cell is indeed the smallest repeating structure within a crystal lattice, and a crystal lattice is the regular arrangement of unit cells in three-dimensional space.
In the context of the passage you shared earlier, which discussed symmetry in various biological structures and physical systems, the idea of unit cells and crystal lattices might relate in terms of symmetry and repetition of structural elements. Crystals often exhibit symmetrical patterns due to the repeated arrangement of unit cells in a lattice. This concept of symmetry and repeating structures might have analogies in the discussion of structural organization within biological systems or even in the theoretical framework being explored in the text.

Could studying swarm behaviors teach us how to help drones fly safely?

by Tom Abate, Glen Martin , Stanford University

Anyone who's seen a flock of starlings twist and turn across the sky may have wondered: How do they maneuver in such close formation without colliding?

"Many types of animals swarm or flock or otherwise move in coordinated ways," says Nicholas Ouellette, an associate professor of civil and environmental engineering at Stanford. "No individual animal knows what every other animal is doing, yet somehow they move cohesively as a group."

Understanding precisely how they do this, Ouellette says, may be a key to helping engineers design "flocks" of aerial drones and driverless cars. Emulating animal swarms is attractive because they not only operate without central control but they're also fault-tolerant, to use an engineering term, meaning they can adapt quickly and gracefully to sudden or unexpected conditions. Swarms are also resilient in that they can operate in dirty, disturbed environments.

So Ouellette and his team have embarked on a series of studies that explore how animal swarms develop the kind of self-organized and self-regulated systems that would allow devices such as drones and mobile sensors to operate safely and efficiently, without the sort of top-down controls that typify, for example, something like the air traffic control system.

Rather than examine starlings or other birds, which would be impractical to study in the lab because of the space they need to fly, Ouellette and his crew look at non-biting midges, a type of flying insect often found near water or in the shade of trees. Unlike starlings, whose graceful formations, called murmurations, make us stare up at the sky, midges buzz around in chaotic, cloud-like masses. But, says Ouellette, midge swarms still share common features with bird flocks and other animal groups, in that the swarms stay cohesive without any outside control or leadership.

"Midges are so small, they're easy to keep in a lab," Ouellette says. "They swarm at dusk and dawn and are easy to cue with lights." In his lab, the midges live in a roughly 5-foot plastic cube, surrounded by high-speed cameras that he uses to reconstruct 3-D trajectories for each insect���direction, acceleration���all the essential kinematic information needed to characterize swarm movements.

Working in the lab allows Ouellette's team to run experiments to test different models. The team starts with observed data taken from the camera images. Then they use this data to test hypotheses about what sorts of rules might govern midge movements. But because natural swarm behavior does not provide enough information to distinguish between many hypotheses, the researchers also disrupt the swarm using light and sound to observe whether the real swarm is affected as their proposed rules had predicted.

Ouellette says it's too early to design artificial systems that behave the same way as animal groups. But his team is developing the sort of experimental environment that other researchers may one day use to build and test high-tech systems based on the bottom-up wisdom of the swarms rather than the top-down rules that typify many technological undertakings.

"As engineers we like to control things," Ouellette says. "But we have a lot to learn from insects and other animals that operate just fine without human command and control frameworks

The article you provided discusses the potential insights that can be gained from studying the swarming behaviors of animals, such as birds and insects, in order to develop self-organized and self-regulated systems for aerial drones and other autonomous devices. These animal swarms exhibit cohesive movements without centralized control, which makes them attractive models for designing fault-tolerant and adaptable systems.
Nicholas Ouellette and his team are conducting studies using non-biting midges, a type of flying insect, as a model for swarm behavior. Unlike birds, midges are small and can be easily studied in a lab environment. The researchers use high-speed cameras to track and analyze the 3D trajectories of individual midges within a swarm. By disrupting the swarm in controlled experiments, they can test hypotheses about the rules that govern swarm movements and observe how the real swarm reacts.
The goal of this research is to develop an understanding of the principles underlying animal swarming behaviors, and eventually apply these insights to design artificial systems that can operate without centralized control. This approach contrasts with the traditional top-down control frameworks commonly used in technology, as it seeks to harness the collective wisdom of swarms to create more adaptive and resilient autonomous systems.

Ways that cellular automata and Ising synchs can model swarm behavior
1 / 1
ChatGPT
Cellular automata and the Ising model are two computational approaches that can be used to model swarm behavior in different ways:
Cellular Automata (CA):
Cellular automata are discrete models that consist of a grid of cells, each with a state that can evolve over discrete time steps based on a set of predefined rules. CA can simulate complex behaviors emerging from simple rules. To model swarm behavior using cellular automata:
Individual Rules:
Each cell represents an individual agent, and its state represents its behavior or movement. The rules for state transitions can be designed to mimic the local interactions and behaviors observed in real swarms.
Neighborhood Interactions:
The state transition rules can take into account the states of neighboring cells, representing the interactions among swarm members. For example, each cell could adjust its state based on the states of its neighboring cells.
Emergent Patterns:
Through interactions and rule-based updates, emergent swarm behaviors can arise, such as flocking, clustering, and pattern formation. These behaviors can be studied to understand how local interactions give rise to global swarm behavior.
Ising Model:
The Ising model is a mathematical model used in statistical mechanics to study the behavior of magnetic spins in a lattice. It can also be adapted to model collective behavior, including swarm behavior, by considering the alignment of agents' states.
Spin Alignment:
In the Ising model, each agent or "spin" has a binary state (up or down). Similarly, each swarm member can be assigned a state that represents its behavior or direction (e.g., moving left or right).
Interaction Energies:
Interactions between neighboring agents are characterized by interaction energies that influence their states. Positive energies encourage alignment, while negative energies favor misalignment.
Temperature Parameter:
The temperature parameter controls the balance between alignment and randomness. At higher temperatures, agents are more likely to change their states, resembling more chaotic or exploratory behavior. At lower temperatures, alignment dominates.
Phase Transitions:
By varying the temperature parameter, the model can exhibit phase transitions, where swarm behavior transitions from disordered to ordered states, resembling the emergence of coordinated swarming behaviors.
Both cellular automata and the Ising model provide a framework to explore the emergence of swarm behavior through simple rules and interactions. They allow researchers to study how local interactions among agents lead to the emergence of complex and coordinated global behaviors observed in natural swarms.

Connections with the prievous topics.
1 / 1
ChatGPT
The discussion you provided earlier about viral symmetry, crystal lattices, and mathematical constraints in biological systems can be related to the modeling of swarm behavior using cellular automata and the Ising model in the context of emergent behaviors:
Symmetry and Emergent Behavior:
Just as the symmetry of viruses is influenced by the underlying physical laws and energy considerations, the emergent behavior of swarms can also be influenced by the local interactions and constraints present in the environment. Symmetry and regularity in the rules governing agent interactions can lead to coordinated swarm behavior, much like the regular arrangement of atoms in a crystal lattice.
Constraints and Self-Organization:
The study of how animal swarms self-organize and self-regulate their movements without central control relates to the concept of constraints and structural properties discussed in your previous topics. The constraints imposed by the environment and interactions among agents play a role in shaping the emergent behavior of the swarm. Cellular automata and the Ising model capture how simple local rules, in the presence of constraints, can lead to complex and organized patterns.
Bottom-Up vs. Top-Down:
Just as your earlier discussion highlighted the differences between bottom-up structures and top-down control in biological systems, the modeling of swarm behavior using cellular automata and the Ising model focuses on understanding how complex behaviors can emerge from individual interactions and local rules rather than relying on centralized control. This aligns with the idea that swarms operate without central command and control frameworks.
Universal Principles:
The exploration of universal principles in your previous discussion, such as the energy considerations in viral symmetry, finds parallels in the study of swarm behavior. Cellular automata and the Ising model provide a platform to investigate whether certain universal principles or rules governing local interactions can lead to consistent emergent behaviors across different swarm systems.
In summary, the concepts of symmetry, constraints, self-organization, and the relationship between bottom-up and top-down influences all have connections to the modeling of swarm behavior using cellular automata and the Ising model. These computational approaches allow researchers to explore how simple rules and interactions give rise to complex swarm behaviors, echoing the underlying principles observed in biological systems.

1.8Ergoworld, Ergothinking and Mathematics. 
Dif f erent aspects/fragments of the world have dif f erent level of structurality and, 
accordingly, there are dif f erent ���parts��� of the brain/mind which ref l ect such 
fragments.It has so happened that the structural aspects are mostly taken 
care of by the ergobrain and loose structures are in the domain of the egomind. 
These ���ref l ections��� are the worlds in their own right, call them ergoworld and 
egoworld, which, besides being dif f erent in what they ref l ect, also dif f er in their 
���how��� and ���why���. 34 
The ego-processes which create the egoworld and performed, controlled and 
recorded by the egomind, center around generations of actions and concepts 
which (more or less) directly serve the goals that are set by the survival/reproduction 
needs of an organism; particular patterns of egomind were specif i cally targeted 
by the evolution/selection mechanism. Many (most?) ego-processes are per- 
ceived by retrospection and/or are directly observed in the behavior of human 
and animals. Egomind is ���real���, large and ���structurally shallow���. 
The ergobrain, unlike the egomind, is a structural entity, which, conjec- 
turally, underlies deeper mental processes in humans and higher animals; these 
are not accessible either to retrospection or to observations of behavior of peo- 
ple and/or animals. This makes the ergobrain dif i cult (but not impossible) for 
an experimental psychologist to study. (���Folk psychology���, ���common sense���, 
���conventional wisdom���, ���psychoanalysis��� tell you as much about non-trivial 
processes in the mind as astrology does about the synthesis of heavy atomic 
nuclei in supernovas.) 
The ergobrain and the egomind are autonomous entities, although they com- 
municate. In young children, human and animals, the two, probably, are not 
much separated, but as the egomind (���personality���, in the ego-language) devel- 
ops it becomes protected from the ergobrain by a kind of a wall. This makes 
most of ergobrain���s activity invisible. 
Seeing through this wall is an essential intellectual dif i culty in modeling 
the ergobrain and ergosystems in general. Our ergobrains are entrenched into 
services of our ego-minds and it is hard to separate the ���real ergo-staf f ��� from 
the ego-imprints.We attempt to identify and erase these imprints by every 
imaginable means; the pertinacious resistance of our ego-minds, both of the 
reader and of the writer of these lines, makes this task dif i cult. 
For example, it is hard to mentally switch from the common ideas of ���reality��� 
and its ���meaning��� ��� two stereotyped ���survival ego-programs��� installed into you 
by the evolutionary selection process, to the ���reality��� of the ergoworld and to 
the structural ���meaning��� of combinatorics of ���networks of ergo-ideas��� in the 
ergosystems. 
(Our emphasis on the ���ergo-reality��� should not be confused with the nega- 
tion of ���physical reality��� by solipsists and, more recently, by cosmological bio- 
centrists. 
In fact, solipsism, after centuries of unsuccessful attempts, has been even- 
tually brought to the i rm ground by Terry Pratchett in his ���Soul Music��� of 
Discworld: 
���... horses won���t walk backward voluntarily, because what they can not see 
does not exist.��� 
This conf i rms what solipsists were predicting all along, Pratchett���s presup- 
position that the equidae, i.e. perissodactyl ungulate mammals, of Discworld 
possess no recognizable visual organs on their hindquarters notwithstanding.) 
The dif i culty in modeling the ergoworld is compounded by the lack of a gen- 
eral mental mechanism for inventing new kind of structures: our own ergobrain 
is severely limited in its structure creative ability. The main source of ideas for 
designing ���ergo-architectures��� comes from mathematics.

In this section, the text delves into the distinction between the "ergoworld" and the "egoworld," which represent different aspects of human experience and cognition. Here are some connections and themes that arise from this discussion:
Ergobrain and Egomind as Separate Entities
:
This notion aligns with the idea of separating cognitive processes related to deep structural understanding (ergobrain) from those associated with more immediate and practical aspects (egomind).
Structurality and Autonomy
:
The concept of the ergobrain handling structural aspects resonates with previous discussions about structures in various contexts, such as the structure of learning and mathematical structures.
The autonomy of the ergobrain and egomind mirrors the idea of autonomy in swarming behavior and self-organization.
Communication and Interaction
:
The communication between the ergobrain and egomind parallels the interactions and communication observed in swarming behavior and the interconnectedness of various mathematical concepts.
Barrier Between Egomind and Ergobrain
:
The "wall" that develops between the egomind and ergobrain aligns with the difficulty of accessing the underlying structures and complexities of swarming behavior or mathematical theories.
Reality and Meaning
:
The discussion about switching from the common notions of reality to the "ergo-reality" reflects the challenge of grasping the intricate concepts of mathematics or understanding the emergent behavior of swarms.
Creativity and Structure Generation
:
The limitation of the ergobrain's creative ability to invent new structures connects with the idea of exploring mathematical structures and concepts as sources of inspiration.
Influence of Mathematics
:
The idea that mathematics provides a source of ideas for designing "ergo-architectures" ties back to previous discussions about mathematical reasoning, the abstract concepts from Misha Gromov's work, and the potential connections between mathematical theories and real-world phenomena.
Interdisciplinary Exploration
:
This section emphasizes the interdisciplinary nature of exploring the ergoworld and ergosystems, much like the exploration of swarm behavior involves insights from biology, engineering, and mathematics.
Overall, the discussion of the ergoworld and egoworld brings together concepts from cognitive science, mathematics, biology, and philosophy, illustrating the complex interplay of these domains in understanding human cognition and natural phenomena.

Ok it looks like ergobrain is like rational conceptual blending and ergomind is like automatically triggering working feedback loops
1 / 1
ChatGPT
That's an insightful way to conceptualize the relationship between the "ergobrain" and "ergomind." The analogy you've drawn aligns with the ideas presented in the text. The "ergobrain" can be seen as the rational and structured aspect of cognition, involving deep conceptual blending and the formation of complex structures. On the other hand, the "ergomind" could correspond to the more automatic and feedback-driven processes that influence our immediate perceptions, actions, and reactions.
Your interpretation captures the distinction between the two realms and how they interact in cognitive processes. It's worth noting that these concepts are nuanced and multidimensional, and various interpretations can contribute to a richer understanding of human cognition and behavior.
