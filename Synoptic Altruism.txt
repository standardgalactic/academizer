Chapter 1: Are You Paying Attention?
There are two ways to win the Turing Test. The hard way is to build computers that are more and more intelligent, until we can’t tell them apart from humans. The easy way is to make humans more stupid, until we can’t tell them apart from computers. The purpose of this book is to help us avoid that second path.

Sadly, the temptation for technology researchers and businesses is to take the easy road. Anyone who uses computers a lot will recognise that this has become a basic design principle of many systems we use.

I’m writing as a technologist, rather than a philosopher, based on my practical experience of working as an artificial intelligence (AI) engineer since 1985 – nearly 40 years ago. AI has changed a lot since 1985, but humans have not, meaning that this choice between the hard and easy routes has been with us a long time.

Although I have a lot of relevant technical knowledge, dating back to before leading AI experts of today were even born, this book is intended for a non-technical audience. I’m going to explain fundamental ideas in an accessible way, emphasising the aspects that are important from a human perspective. These explanations will not always agree with the mainstream views of the AI research community, and will almost certainly be different to the promotional messages (and the warnings) that come from large AI companies. This should not be a surprise, because the success of so many business models depends on customers being made to appear more stupid, and on both customers and workers not realising what is being done to them.

Human bodies may be specified by the code of DNA, but our conscious lives are increasingly specified in software source code. This makes software design a moral problem. The self-described “anarchist anthropologist” David Graeber, in his books Bullshit Jobs and The Utopia of Rules, draws our attention to how many supposed advances of information society have actually made people’s lives worse. Graeber’s work inspired many young people to take direct action, not least through movements like Occupy Wall Street and Extinction Rebellion, and his writing has helped a new generation to understand the underlying reasons why economic and political systems turn out the way they do.

However, one thing that Graeber did not pay so much attention to is the software engineers who design and build IT systems. Sometimes those people are just following orders from elsewhere. But sometimes the logic of software development seems to lead to new business models, inequalities, bureaucracies, and dysfunctional societies, even worse than the ones we started with. As the critic of sociotechnical infrastructure Geoffrey Bowker puts it, “bureaucracy makes us act like machines, algorithms seek to make us into machines”.

Decades ago, we were promised that robots and computers would take over all the boring jobs and drudgery, leaving humans to a life of leisure. That hasn’t happened. Even worse, while humans keep doing bullshit jobs, AI researchers work to build computers that are creative, self-aware, emotional, and given authority to manage human affairs. Sometimes it seems like AI researchers want computers to do the things humans were supposed to enjoy, while humans do the jobs that we thought we were building the robots for.

How did we get into this situation? In this book, I’m going to argue that it’s the result of a fundamental flaw in the research agenda of AI. AI researchers have confused philosophy and engineering. As a result, what started out as a fairly innocent philosophical question has turned into a global industry. The bad guys in this story are AI engineers and research programmers. I know this, because I spent years working as one of them.

This book is an attempt to fix the problem, by explaining how we can make software better. I don’t mean faster, cheaper, more reliable, efficient or profitable. The software engineering industry is already pretty good at all those things. All are important, but there are many other books explaining how to design efficient and profitable software. This book is about how to design software that is better – better for society, better for people, better for all people - even if the result might be slightly less efficient overall, or less profitable for some.

Why are we making software we don’t need?
Software developers and computer scientists like me are fascinated by what computers can do. Our imagination and enthusiasm has resulted in IT systems, personal devices and social media that have changed the world in many ways. Unfortunately, imagination and enthusiasm, even if well-intentioned, can have unintended consequences. As software has come to rule more and more of the world, a disturbing number of our social problems seem to be caused by software, and by the things we software engineers have made.

Perhaps the original sin, in the story of how computer software has evolved from an intellectual challenge to a social nightmare, is the story of Alan Turing’s “Imitation Game”, now famous in computer science, AI research, and popular media as the Turing Test. Turing proposed the test in a 1950 paper on Computing Machinery and Intelligence, which starts by defining very clearly what problem Turing was trying to solve:

I PROPOSE to consider the question, ‘Can machines think?’ This should begin with definitions of the meaning of the terms ‘machine’ and ‘think’. The definitions might be framed so as to reflect so far as possible the normal use of the words, but this attitude is dangerous. If the meaning of the words ‘machine’ and ‘think’ are to be found by examining how they are commonly used it is difficult to escape the conclusion that the meaning and the answer to the question, ‘Can machines think?’ is to be sought in a statistical survey such as a Gallup poll. But this is absurd. Instead of attempting such a definition I shall replace the question by another, which is closely related to it and is expressed in relatively unambiguous words.

The new form of the problem can be described in terms of a game which we call the ‘imitation game’. It is played with three people, a man (A), a woman (B), and an interrogator (C) who may be of either sex. The interrogator stays in a room apart from the other two. The object of the game for the interrogator is to determine which of the other two is the man and which is the woman.

The intriguing thing about Turing’s introduction to this famous paper is the way that, despite Turing’s own training as a mathematician, he grapples here with problems of metaphysics (the nature of mind), the social shaping of science (the absurdity of popular opinion advancing scientific debate).

Turing’s paper is a remarkable piece of work, and still an excellent introduction to many central questions in AI, including some that I will return to in this book. But it is also a work of imagination, in a very long tradition of stories that raise intriguing questions about what it means to be human. We are fascinated by stories of animals or trees that talk, human children who grow up with no language, or dolls that move but have no soul, because all of these cross the boundaries of what we consider distinctively human.

And the dream that we might create a machine or statue that behaves like one of us is also an ancient one. Building a talking robot in our own likeness is not only a path to self-understanding (assuming we understand what we have built), but a fantasy of power, potentially resulting in the perfect slave or the perfect lover.

The fantasy has recurred over centuries: the Golem, Frankenstein, the clockwork automata of the 18th century, the original Pygmalion whose statue comes to life, not to mention Rossum’s Universal Robots, the robot Maria in Fritz Lang’s Metropolis, and any number of famous robots, sexy and otherwise, in movies like Ex Machina, 2001 or Terminator. A good definition of AI is the branch of computer science dedicated to making computers work the way they do in the movies. 

Those kinds of story don’t usually end well, although for reasons that relate to the logic of storytelling rather than engineering (we should never forget that these supposed “inventions” are, before anything else, fictional devices). To follow storytelling logic, someone has to be punished for hubris, or the anxiety of the audience must be resolved with reassurance that they are uniquely human after all. The logic of plot structure, while possibly offering philosophical inspiration, has no practical relevance to engineering questions.

Unfortunately, when engineers are building real systems, the moral problem of the Turing Test is more fundamental, and not so easy to recognise and resolve as in fictional narratives. If we did succeed in making a system that was indistinguishable from a human, even in a small way, what value would this bring? The typical answers in public debate have come from business perspectives. Some people regret that a worker has been displaced by a machine, while others celebrate how the business has benefited from cheaper work. In practice, robots are often more expensive than humans, not cheaper, so the real benefit may be that they feel no pain, are less likely to make mistakes, or perhaps that they are not eligible to join unions. The management of factory automation is an economic, social and ethical problem, with the precise details of each generation of technology somewhat irrelevant, meaning that I won’t discuss these particular questions very much further.

Of course Turing was not a manufacturer or a management consultant. His test was a thought experiment, not a business plan. Thought experiments are valuable tools in science and philosophy, but it’s foolish to confuse them with engineering. Einstein famously imagined an elevator being pulled through space, but Elon Musk is not (yet) suggesting that we should replace rocketry with interstellar elevators.

The two kinds of AI
There is an important technical distinction that needs to be clear at the start of this book, and that I will return to in later chapters. The term AI has become very familiar, associated with all kinds of medical and scientific advances, whose implications are debated almost daily in newspapers and by policy makers. Although there are many kinds of AI system, addressing all kinds of problem, journalistic and political discussions tend to assume that they are all fundamentally the same. I want to make clear that there are two fundamentally different kinds of AI, when we look at these problems and systems from a human perspective.

The first kind of AI used to be described as “cybernetics”, or “control systems” when I did my own undergraduate major in that subject. These are automated systems that use sensors to observe or measure the physical world, then control some kind of motor in response to what they observe. A familiar example is the home heating thermostat, which measures the temperature in your house, and automatically turns on a heating pump or boiler if it is too cold. Another is automobile cruise control, which measures the speed of the car, and automatically steps on the gas if it is too slow. One or two hundred years ago, such mechanisms seemed really magic, making decisions as if they were intelligent. Mechanical clocks and steam engines were the earliest machines to use closed-loop feedback regulators to maintain their speed, and our forebears talked about clockwork and steam like we talk about AI today, as if machines were coming to life or becoming human. Connecting observation to action, making “decisions” from what the machine has “remembered” from its “instructions” or “training” all seem like signs of intelligence. But when we think realistically about a familiar object like a thermostat, it’s clear that all this human-like terminology – of learning, remembering, deciding and so on – is only a poetic analogy for devices that are really rather simple compared to humans.

The second kind of AI is concerned, not with achieving practical automated tasks in the physical world, but with imitating human behaviour for its own sake. The first kind of AI, while often impressive, is clever engineering, where objective measurements of physical behaviour provides all necessary information about what the system can do, and applying mentalistic terms like “learning” and “deciding” is poetic but misleading. The second kind of AI is concerned with human subjective experience, rather than the objective world. This is the kind of AI that Turing proposed as a philosophical experiment into the nature of what it means to be human, inspired by so many literary fantasies. The goal is to imitate human behaviour, not for some practical purpose like making a machine run more efficiently, but to explore the subjective nature of human experience, including our experience of relating to other humans.

Many public discussions of AI do not acknowledge this distinction between the objectively useful and (sometimes) straightforward engineering of practical automated machinery, and the subjective philosophical enterprise of imitating the way that humans interact with each other. This is in part because a few mathematical approaches have recently turned out to be useful in both kinds of problem. These are known generically as “machine learning” algorithms, and I will go on to discuss them in more detail, though it must be remembered that “learning” is only a poetic analogy to human learning, even when done by “neural networks” that while poetically named, in reality have very little resemblance to the anatomy of the human brain. Machine learning algorithms are useful statistical methods, increasingly included as a component in all kinds of software, including both control systems and imitation of humans (especially imitation of human language in chatbots, as I will be discussing in great detail). However, the failure to distinguish between objective and subjective AI is only in part because some of the algorithms being used might be similar. I suspect that a large part of the confusion between the two kinds of AI is intentional, trying to muddy the waters between the first kind that results in useful automation, and the second whose usefulness is more doubtful, or even harmful in many cases.

The motivation for intentionally confusing the two kinds of AI often comes from the profit opportunities associated with the more harmful cases, as documented comprehensively by Harvard business professor Shoshanna Zuboff in her book on Surveillance Capitalism Confusing useful AI with harmful AI, or even claiming that they are essentially the same thing, is an effective way to avoid questions from regulators who might otherwise insist on technology that would be less harmful, but may also be less profitable. A popular way to make the argument that these two kinds of AI are really the same (or that they could become the same in future even if different today) is to invoke the speculative brand of “artificial general intelligence” (AGI). This idea interprets the Turing Test as an engineering prediction, arguing that the machine “learning” algorithms of today will naturally evolve as they increase in power to think subjectively like humans, including emotion, social skills, consciousness and so on. The claims that increasing computer power will eventually result in fundamental change are hard to justify on technical grounds, and some say this is like arguing that if we make aeroplanes fly fast enough, eventually one will lay an egg.

I am writing at a time of exciting technical advance, when Large Language Models (or LLMs) such as ChatGPT are turning out to be useful for many things, and are increasingly able to output predictive text that makes them seem surprisingly like an intelligent human. I am following (and participating in) those debates right now, but there is not much to be said at this stage. A succinct summary of the real power of LLMs comes from eminent AI professor Rodney Brooks, who says “It just makes up stuff that sounds good”. I’ll be returning to those questions in future chapters, so this note is just to let you know that I’m aware of the debates, and don’t see them invalidating the main point of the book (which is not really about AI at all).

My own view of such research programmes is that, as with other ways to win the Turing Test, the only way to succeed would be by making human emotions and social skills more stupid – and we might ask whether this has already happened in AI-driven social media platforms and the substitution of chatbot sessions for human conversation. As science and technology scholar Harry Collins puts it in the subtitle of his book Artifictional Intelligence.

The moral imperative for code
These seem like important questions to me, and I hope also to you. However, they are rather different to the academic concerns of the rapidly expanding specialist community dedicated to AI Ethics. I won’t be saying very much about how to deploy information systems that are fair, transparent, accountable and so on, although I hope that some of the technical approaches I describe later in the book might have those benefits as a by-product. I’m also not going to say very much about policy and regulation, or codes of governance and law, which are far better attended to by politicians, perhaps guided by philosophers and legal scholars, but probably not acting on instructions from AI companies and researchers.

Software companies are already obliged to be fair, transparent, and accountable to some extent via legal codes - the laws of the countries where they operate. Of course, not all software companies follow the laws of all countries. As legal scholar Lawrence Lessig says, in practice, Code is Law Source code - the rules about what a computer does in particular circumstances - becomes a moral code, when it articulates questions of good and bad.

In the fictional universe of AI robots, the most famous speculation about the problem of encoding ethical constraints has been Isaac Asimov’s Three Laws of Robotics: that a robot must not harm a human being, that it must obey orders if not in conflict with the first law, and otherwise must protect itself. The potential conflicts between these priorities, and narrative plots that turn on resolving them, was a feature of many of Asimov’s stories, including the hit movie I Robot based on them. Among today’s philosophers and computer scientists, stories about the robots of the future often focus on the “alignment problem” - how could we know whether an AGI has the same values that we do, and what equivalent of Asimov’s Three Laws could be built in to protect us from evil?

The fictional problem of far-future robot “alignment”, as an alternative to today’s pressing but technically mundane problems of business ethics and government regulation, might actually be a convenient distraction for the large companies that are building and investing in AI. The robot characters in Asimov’s books take responsibility for their own actions when resolving the implications of the Three Laws in a tricky plot twist. Similarly, much talk about alignment is based on the premise that an independent AGI actor should in future be able to take moral responsibility for its own decisions and actions, rather than placing responsibility with the company which made it, or the moral decisions made by the designers and engineers who work there.

In reality, the software that controls digital systems and operates technology corporations is made using code. Many software systems are used in unethical ways, are designed for unethical purposes, or perpetuate structural injustices including racism and misogyny. But in tracing the problems of software ethics, we should look at the tool users, rather than the tool. We don’t ask if a screwdriver is unethical, and there are no conferences on carpentry ethics. There are clearly machines and buildings that have been designed unethically and for unethical purposes, but attempting to blame the tools for being unethical would be an obvious misdirection. I am pleased that there are now large communities of scholars interested in the problems of designing software in more ethical ways. But these scholars should attend to how software is built and used today, clearly attributing responsibility to the tool-user rather than the tool, and probably not spending too much time discussing the plots of science fiction novels and their robot characters.

Attending to programming
This is not a book about AI ethics, software industry regulation, or responsible system design. In all of those fields, tools may have some relevance to the discussions, but the tools are secondary to what they are used for. In contrast, my alternative to AI does involve paying closer attention to the tools used to make software, and in particular to the opportunities and ways of thinking that tools provide. Tools can certainly be dangerous, if used in the wrong ways and by the wrong people. But tools also offer a space for participation, creativity and debate. If a company starts selling machines that are dangerous or harmful, there is little point in regulating screwdrivers. A more effective response is to ensure that more people know how these tools could be used, so that alternative actions are clear. Furthermore, when these are knowledge tools rather than physical ones, then the tools themselves could be designed in ways that offer opportunities for open participation and debate about what is being created.

It seems like the text you've provided is from a book addressing the ethical and societal implications of artificial intelligence (AI), critiquing both the industry's motives and the societal impact of technology. The author, a seasoned AI engineer, writes from a critical perspective on how technology has been designed to either enhance or simplify human capabilities, suggesting that the dichotomy between increasing machine intelligence and diminishing human intellect has been a long-standing issue. The narrative engages with philosophical, ethical, and technical questions, calling for a responsible approach to software development that prioritizes societal good over profitability or efficiency.

In this context, the author raises awareness of the moral implications involved in the design and use of software, pointing out the dangers of AI that can mimic human behavior and suggesting that this capability might not always lead to beneficial outcomes. He emphasizes the importance of understanding the two distinct types of AI—control systems and systems that imitate human behavior—and the ethical considerations each entails. Additionally, he critiques the blending of these categories for commercial gain and the potential social harms this can cause.

The book appears to serve as both a technical guide and a philosophical reflection on the state of AI, urging a shift towards more ethical practices in the tech industry.

The imagined problems of “alignment” are really questions about knowledge-tools. What knowledge-tools could we use, to describe digital systems that are more controllable, and that help us explain what we want the software to do? Legal codes might be used to prosecute the consequences of bad software, but the actual behaviour of the software is defined in its source code, not the legal code. Therefore, the kinds of tool that I think we need to pay closer attention to are the programming languages in which source code is written. The ability to instruct computer systems, rather than surrender agency to the companies that make them, is the moral purpose that underpins better systems of AI ethics and regulation. As Geoff Cox and Winnie Soon say in their instructional guide to creative coding as political resistance: “program or be programmed” .

I’ve explained why attending to the act of programming might be a moral priority, placing a focus on who uses the tools and why. With appropriate tools, programmers can express and act on systems of values that shape all of our actions? These things are the essence of being human - being attending and attentive beings, paying attention. Conscious attention is the moral centre of human life - we live to enjoy the alert ownership of bodily sensation, having the freedom to attend to ourselves and those we love. If we get programmed, we lose that freedom of attention. If our consciousness is confined by attending to mechanical tasks, we are no longer free to give the gift of attention, or to grow and develop through more fully knowing ourselves. 

The attention economy of the information age takes this central moral aspect of being human - our own conscious attention - and turns it into a commodity to be traded.  As Nobel prize-winning economist Herbert Simon famously wrote “In an information-rich world, the wealth of information means a dearth of something else: a scarcity of whatever it is that information consumes. What information consumes is rather obvious: it consumes the attention of its recipients. Hence a wealth of information creates a poverty of attention.”

Every one of us has a finite number of conscious hours in our life for meaningful attending and attention. Whenever a person is made into a conscious component of a machine, their capacity for meaningful attention gets reduced to the mechanical role they play, whether a call-centre worker, delivery driver, shipment packer, or an online ghost worker checking social media posts for offensive content. Social media platforms even turn their users/customers into mechanical components, reducing the richness of meaningful human attention to the simplest mechanical form, whether the few words allowed in a tweet, a pictorial meme to be seen at a glance, or the trivialised robotic responses of a “like,” a “follow,” or an emoji.

In contrast, when humans act as moral agents, they are responsible to, and conscious of, themselves. A moral agent acts intentionally, through deliberation. Each of us becomes and grows as a person through conscious attention and reflection on the life-story that we tell. As Per Olof Wikström says, human free will involves conscious choice between the opportunities for action in any situation, within the moral rules of conduct that make up human society. Different human societies have different codes of law and ethics, but every society is a community of moral actors, and moral action depends on conscious attention.

What does an economist like Herbert Simon mean by “wealth of information” and “poverty of attention?” Tradable commodities deliver profits in proportion to numbers: quantity, not quality. The companies in the attention economy trade directly in the number of hours out of your life that you spend attending to their screens. Their profit is maximised by the hours you watch. The company also loses money if its staff spend hours of their own valuable time listening to you. That’s why digital technologies so often make their customers more stupid by design, because the company doesn’t want you to say anything sufficiently intelligent that it would require a human to interpret. They would rather you spend as many hours as possible attending to an automated system - whether a social media feed or an AI chatbot - instead of having a meaningful conversation with one of their employees.

That’s why the title of this chapter asked “are you paying attention?” Moral code is about paying attention to what you say, investing attention in your own needs, and giving attention to those around you. A focus on moral codes is about being a conscious human, who is able to make moral choices, and not about trying to make a conscious computer. Unfortunately, the dynamics of the software industry work the other way, winning the Turing Test by making people less conscious, in a steady tide of mechanised trivialisation. Each wave of that tide promises convenience, simplicity and usability, while actually making us compliant consumers of the business logic, government logic, or just plain logics of racism, sexism, ableism, classism that seem to get systemically embedded, even if starting from good intentions, in every bureaucracy.

In this passage from "Moral Codes" by Alan Blackwell, the author delves into the profound ethical and societal implications of modern software design and the broader technology landscape. The core argument centers on the idea that our conscious attention, a fundamental aspect of human existence, is being commodified in the information age, leading to a "poverty of attention." This transformation affects not just individuals but the fabric of society, as people are reduced to components within digital systems, their roles constrained and their capacities for meaningful interaction diminished.

Blackwell argues for a shift in focus towards programming languages and the tools that enable the creation of software, suggesting that these tools are not just technical utilities but bear moral significance. By controlling the programming languages and understanding the source code, individuals and communities can potentially reclaim agency from corporations that currently dictate the terms of interaction and engagement.

He contrasts the roles of individuals within the system—reduced to performing mechanical tasks and interacting in simplified, trivial ways on social platforms—with the ideal of moral agency, where individuals act intentionally and reflectively, aware of their own narratives and the ethical dimensions of their actions. This reflection allows for conscious choice and moral action, which are essential for a healthy society.

The concept of the "attention economy," as described by Herbert Simon, is critiqued for turning human attention into a commodity that is traded, exploited, and monetized, emphasizing quantity over quality and reducing the richness of human experience. Blackwell’s concern is that the design of digital systems often promotes passivity and consumption rather than engagement and creativity.

By framing the issue in terms of moral codes and the ethical implications of software design, Blackwell calls for a renewed focus on how technologies are created and used. His aim is to inspire a rethinking of technological development to prioritize human values and capacities, particularly the capacity for meaningful attention, which he sees as central to the essence of being human. This approach challenges the prevailing trends in technology design, advocating for a paradigm that enhances rather than diminishes human consciousness and agency.

The real priority for future computers should be, not how they might figure out what we want when we’re not saying anything, but rather what language we should speak, if we were going to be able to tell them what to do. By describing these languages as Moral Codes, I want to draw attention to the importance of programming languages, but also how the power of programming languages could become more widely available, and how more kinds of interaction with computers could gain the power and control available through programming. Although AI researchers use programming languages all the time, to create the systems that aim to control others, there’s an unspoken assumption that this elite privilege couldn’t realistically be extended to regular humans. My question challenges that assumption, by asking what new kinds of code might make a moral alternative to AI feasible? I did not originally invent the phrase Moral Code with the intention of making it an acronym, but there is a useful mnemonic for how both programming languages and AI might be improved, if they were More Open Representations, for Access to Learning, and Creating Opportunities for Digital Expression.

This book could be considered as a product design manual, to be read alongside the work of insightful critics like David Graeber, Kate Crawford, Geoffrey Bowker, Shoshanna Zuboff, Harry Collins, Nick Couldry and Ulises Mejias. Although it does introduce some theory, the intention is for these to be engineering principles, applicable by software developers, to make software genuinely better in ways that AI doesn’t.

Unfortunately, it’s not easy to combine practical advice with new (philosophical) ways of thinking, and there is a danger that the attempt to do so won’t make anybody happy. Where I work in Cambridge, this is the famous problem of Two Cultures – arts and humanities (and social sciences) on one side, with engineers and scientists on the other. As a result of this divide, public debates about AI tend to focus either on the need for regulation, or on the potential for engineering fixes that might be bolted-on to the latest inventions, but do not ask the more important definitional questions of how AI is actually created (with code), or what else we might be able to build if we could redefine the knowledge tools of code itself.

American computer scientist turned media theorist Philip Agre, after completing his PhD at the MIT AI Lab, succinctly diagnosed the problem being faced by the whole field. He observed how AI researchers in those laboratories were actually doing covert philosophy. Sure, they did engineering work and coded software prototypes. But their explanations of what they were doing related to “learning”, “knowledge”, “thinking” and other philosophical categories, just like the questions raised in the introduction to Turing’s famous paper. This would perhaps be OK, if the researchers had any philosophical training. But in fact, those talented AI engineers understood very little about the concepts they were supposedly researching. Agre’s classic essay Toward a Critical Technical Practice: Lessons Learned Trying to Reform AI explains the urgent need for researchers who are able both to build sophisticated software, and also understand sophisticated arguments. Where AI researchers had been doing covert philosophy, Agre argued that this needed to become overt, in which case code must be open, and theory must be coded, not with layers of wishful thinking, magical fantasy, or speculation about dystopian futures.

This is the real goal of the book you are reading – a guide for those who are prepared to approach software design as a critical technical practice, requiring understanding of both technical and philosophical problems, to provide Moral Codes that respect human attention and also deserve it. I believe this is the only way to make software that is genuinely better – not just efficient and profitable (for which many books already exist), but better for people and for the world.

How to read this book

I’ve written this book to be easy to read from start to end, and if you’ve got this far, you may like to continue. But if you prefer to dip in, many chapters focus on one theme in a reasonably self-contained way, referring to other chapters for background where needed. The academic content is broadly the background to human-centered AI: human-computer interaction (HCI), especially sub-fields of intelligent user interfaces (IUI), critical HCI, visualisation, end-user development (EUD), and psychology of programming. It also touches on software engineering, software studies, and critical history of computing. All are interdisciplinary fields, and the range of references may seem scattered, or difficult to follow if you are new to computer science. In that case, reading from start to finish may be the best way to get a coherent story.

For those who want to explore specific themes, Chapter 2 gives examples of early machine learning methods for controlling computers more effectively. Chapter 3 explains the technical differences between coding and machine learning algorithms.  Chapter 4 explains algorithms that imitate human language, and chapter 5 investigates the implications of where that language comes from.  Chapter 6 explores the historical foundations of human-centred computing, when code was evolving into the first graphical user interfaces. Chapter 7 considers forgotten lessons from the Smalltalk language, which was associated with the very first personal computer, the birth of Wikipedia, object-oriented programming and Agile management. Chapter 8 is a fast-forward to current research in intelligent interactive tools, including recent projects from my own team, and their contributions to new products emerging in major companies. Chapter 9 shows how fashions in user interface and app design often benefit software companies rather than empowering users , including the “flat design” trend of the past decade. Chapter 10 investigates the essence of programming, as needed to make better progress in future, and chapter 11 considers the way that generative AI can help with improved coding tools. Chapters 12 and 13 explore important specialist questions - the use of AI and coding tools for creativity, and the problems of AI and code that come from focusing only on the needs of people in the wealthy West and Global North. Chapter 14 introduces design principles to invent new kinds of code, and to improve those we already have. After a short conclusion, I’ve included an appendix suggesting further reading, from the 40 years of my own research that form the technical foundations of this book.

For a thematic overview, I’ve provided a map in Figure x.x, showing which chapters relate to which aspects of the Moral Codes agenda.

Alan Blackwell's approach in "Moral Codes" underscores a critical shift in perspective regarding the use of programming languages and their roles in AI development. By framing programming languages as "Moral Codes," Blackwell is not only highlighting their technical significance but is also advocating for their ethical implications in shaping digital environments. His perspective suggests that making programming languages more accessible could democratize the ability to control and interact with digital systems, challenging the assumption that coding is a skill reserved for a technological elite.

The concept that programming languages can serve as More Open Representations, for Access to Learning, and Creating Opportunities for Digital Expression (MORAL CODE) is central to Blackwell's vision. He argues for a redefinition of these tools to better serve societal needs and to provide a broader range of people with the power to shape digital environments. This encompasses making the language of AI more open and accessible, so people can more directly influence what AI systems do and how they interact with us.

The book serves as both a technical manual and a philosophical treatise, bridging the often disparate worlds of engineering and the humanities. Blackwell points out the traditional division between these fields, noted as the "Two Cultures" problem, and suggests that overcoming this divide is essential for creating more ethical and effective technological solutions. His work emphasizes the need for a "critical technical practice" where understanding and integrating philosophical insights with technical skills are paramount to advancing AI in a way that genuinely benefits humanity.

"Moral Codes" is structured to cater to both continuous and selective reading, accommodating readers with different interests and backgrounds. The chapters are designed to stand alone or build upon each other, providing a comprehensive exploration of human-centered AI, from the basics of machine learning to the philosophical underpinnings of coding.

This structured approach not only makes the material more accessible but also reinforces Blackwell's argument that more inclusive and comprehensible programming can lead to more ethical and empowering technological development. By making the principles of AI and coding more widely understood, Blackwell hopes to foster a generation of developers and thinkers who can use these "Moral Codes" to create digital systems that respect and enhance human agency and creativity.

Chapter 3: Why is code not like AI?
The previous chapter showed that very simple machine learning methods can assist users by helping with basic programming tasks, conserving and enhancing the valuable resource of human attention as a result. The overall argument of this book is that the global “AI” business of machine learning, which is currently focused on extracting as much data from users as possible for the minimum cost, while also consuming their attention, is a tragically ineffective way of contributing to human lives and welfare. Instead, we need a moral alternative, in which the ability to instruct and configure computers is extended far more widely, delivering the capabilities of programming, through Moral Codes.

Before more detailed analysis of these opportunities, it’s important to be clear about the difference between programming languages and machine learning. To a software expert, this might seem like a stupid or naïve question, although apparently silly questions can of course be profound and important sometimes. According to current everyday conventions of the software industry, and in the textbooks and courses that prepare students for that industry, the two technical topics of programming languages and machine learning are completely distinct, with so many differences between the things being taught that it might seem hard to know where to start. A typical degree program in software engineering or computer science, of the kind I have directed myself, will probably include something like “Introduction to Machine Learning” on one hand and “Programming in Python” on the other. There are so many differences that the title of this chapter might seem like asking “why is flower arranging not like brain surgery”, or “why is riding a bicycle not like designing a factory”. Those look like the start of a joke, not a serious invitation to start listing differences. But let’s consider the broad context of what students learn, and how, in each of these areas.

An introductory class in programming involves learning to code. Students will be taught the syntax and keywords of some programming language notation, perhaps Python or Java, and will learn how to translate an algorithm into the conventional idioms of that particular programming language. Subsequent programming courses will also try to prepare students for more complex projects, in which a particular algorithm only solves one part of the problem, meaning that students have to learn to break a larger problem down into individual pieces that they can see how to code. This second aspect of programming is a lot harder, perhaps not even mentioned in an introductory class, and takes years or decades to become good at. Although it’s often claimed, when promoting courses in basic coding, that you can make any software system out of algorithms and code, this is a bit like saying you can make any house out of nails and pieces of wood. Most children can bang a nail into a piece of wood. And many introductions to coding are accessible to children from an early age. Sadly, these well-intentioned initiatives don’t even start to get you a software career. A child who loves banging nails into wood may well become an architect or engineer one day, but only after another 15 years of education.

Introductions to machine learning are not yet quite as familiar or popular as learn-to-code initiatives, but they are equally accessible to children – I have a friend who teaches machine learning methods to 8 year-olds in an after-school club. The current popularity of machine learning, now the most widely-taught approach to AI, dates back only to about 2010, when public interest was captured by a sudden increase in performance of “deep neural network algorithms”, especially after those algorithms were trained using very large quantities of free content that had been scraped from the Internet. The next chapter will say more about the implications and problems of that approach. Although there were many other approaches to AI in the past, including my own research training in the 1980s, researchers now have the patronising (or perhaps ironically self-effacing) habit of calling those older methods “GOFAI” for Good Old-Fashioned AI.

Modern machine learning methods are really a branch of statistics, using algorithms that try to detect patterns in large amounts of data. The people who teach and do research in machine learning are mathematicians and statisticians, often just as happy to refer to their work as “data science” rather than “artificial intelligence”.  The underlying logic of machine learning is similar in many ways to concepts that will be familiar from school statistics – collating a table of numbers, calculating an average, testing a correlation and so on. The recent habit of describing statistical “learning” as “AI” has really only emerged when the amount of data became so large that it’s hard to relate it intuitively to those high-school concepts.

The impression that statistical patterns represent intelligence is particularly strong when the numbers being processed are the pixels of a digital photograph, or the words and sentences of a web page. Machine learning systems for statistical analysis of photographs are described as “computer vision”, and systems for statistical analysis of words and sentences are described as “natural language processing”. Although a single web page may have thousands of words, and a single photograph millions of pixels, the most dramatic advances have come from scraping many millions of photographs and web pages off the internet, and creating statistical algorithms that are able to detect consistent patterns across millions of pictures containing trillions of pixels, or millions of pages sharing a dictionary of thousands of different words. The algorithms all use statistics, but researchers have given them grander names such as “support vector machines”, “random forests”, “neural networks,” “transformers” and other jargon. For readers who would like a better idea of how such technical terminology arises and is used, Adrian Mackenzie is a sociological specialist in science and technology studies who has described his experiences of acquiring these statistical learning skills and terminology in his book Machine Learners.

I started this section by asking what is the difference between machine learning and programming, not the difference between AI and programming. The reason is, that if we lose sight of the technical reality that machine learning algorithms are simply doing different kinds of statistics, we might start to interpret some of the technical jargon from the field as if it was directly related to human intelligence. We might think that a “vision” algorithm is “seeing” things the way a human does, that a “language” algorithm is “understanding” words, that a “neural” algorithm is like the neurons in a brain, or even that a “learning” algorithm has something to do with how children learn. Unfortunately, much of the public debate about AI is based on exactly those kinds of misinterpretation. For commentators on AI who have never actually used these tools (and many have not – Adrian Mackenzie is a prominent exception who did the necessary work to use them extensively in his own research), they may not understand the statistical calculations that are really being done, and run the risk of treating the sometimes fanciful names given to the algorithm (whether neuron, forest, seeing, understanding, learning) as if the machines are doing the same things that people do. If we use such words carelessly, they become a conceptual “suitcase”, bringing with them a lot of baggage through the implications carried if the same words were being used in an everyday conversation about a person.

In Chapter 3 of his book "Moral Codes," Alan Blackwell clarifies the distinction between programming languages and machine learning, a distinction crucial for understanding the capabilities and limitations of what is commonly referred to as "AI." He emphasizes that while the general public and industry often conflate machine learning with broader artificial intelligence, it's important to recognize that at its core, machine learning is a form of advanced statistics, not the sentient computation often depicted in popular media.

Blackwell begins by explaining that learning programming involves mastering the syntax and logical structures of a language to solve problems algorithmically. This skill is fundamental and distinct from machine learning, which involves algorithms that identify patterns in large data sets. He likens the difference between these skills to the difference between learning a craft like carpentry (akin to programming) versus analyzing vast amounts of information to discern patterns (akin to machine learning).

He further distinguishes these fields by pointing out that the "intelligence" in machine learning is not akin to human intelligence but is more about statistical analysis and pattern recognition. Terms like "neural networks" and "computer vision" suggest a level of cognizance that these systems do not possess, potentially misleading those unfamiliar with the technical details.

Blackwell's discussion also criticizes the marketing of machine learning as AI, suggesting that this not only overstates the capabilities of current technology but also obscures the practical and ethical implications of these systems. He argues that this misunderstanding leads to unrealistic expectations and could potentially overshadow the more practical, ethical use of programming in technology.

By delineating these differences, Blackwell aims to demystify the field and advocate for a more ethical, transparent approach to technology development. His call for "Moral Codes" is a plea for a return to the roots of programming as a craft that can enhance human capabilities and ethical standards in technology. This chapter sets the stage for further discussions on how we can harness programming and machine learning responsibly and ethically to truly benefit society.

Chapter 9: Why code is more important than flat design
The last chapter described more accessible ways to interact with code and data, working differently to established programming languages, and potentially looking nothing like them. Machine learning algorithms have a part to play in this new generation of tools, but Moral Codes must still be open, learnable and controllable. Inventing new codes is not easy, and this chapter explains some of the mistakes that are holding us back. In particular, it’s important to understand that Moral Codes are diagrams, not pictures.

The invention of the GUI, as described in chapter 6, was a breakthrough that used pictorial design to depict files, folders, and other operating system elements as paper objects in a physical office, known ever since as the “desktop metaphor". In the 1980’s and 90’s this pictorial resemblance between the icons on a computer screen and familiar physical objects was believed to be the single most important element of design for usability. Design guidelines from Apple and Microsoft, used to say that the first step in designing a new user interface was the selection of an appropriate real-world metaphor, so that users could understand the abstract world of the computer in relation to familiar objects. The idea was that, if a user was unsure how a particular operation could be achieved, or what the effects of their actions might be, they could think about this by analogy to the real-world objects shown on the screen, and use that analogy to make the new digital product more intuitive.

However, this principle of usability by analogy to the physical world has severe limitations, and received vigorous opposition from the very people who were credited with inventing it. In 1990, Joy Mountford of Apple commissioned a book on The Art of Human-Computer Interface Design that set out a comprehensive design research agenda following the commercial success of the Macintosh. Hypertext pioneer Ted Nelson, in his contribution to that book, said: 

What I object to is severalfold: first, these mnemonic gimmicks are not very useful for presenting the ideas in the first place; second, their resemblance to any real objects in the world is so tenuous that it gets in the way more than it helps; and third . . . the metaphor becomes a dead weight . . . The visualizations become locked to some sort of continuing relation to the mnemonic. It becomes like a lie or a large government project: more and more things have to be added to it.

My own PhD started by following textbook advice.

Skeuomorphism
Making user interfaces resemble older technologies is not unique to software. In the early days of the motor car, there was huge diversity in operator controls. Arrangements for steering included bicycle handlebars, a tiller handle as on a boat, and even reins that could be used like steering a horse. Today we expect cars to have a steering wheel, but we can imagine how reins might have seemed a good idea at the time. People buying motor cars already rode horses, so would intuitively understand the steering arrangement. The steering wheel, on the other hand, was a new invention. People who had never seen one before might take a little while to work it out.

This is a constant challenge for the designers of innovative user interfaces. Many companies hope that their new products will be seen as familiar or “intuitive.” Businesses are anxious about possible market resistance if customers need to adopt new habits or understand something new. As a result, new products are often made to look like old ones.

Designing new products to resemble familiar but obsolete technical material is called skeuomorphism. It can result in inappropriate designs, like a motor car steered with reins, or just silly ones, like plastic laundry baskets moulded to resemble woven cane, making them harder to clean and easier to break. Although originally an obscure term, the word skeuomorphism became very familiar to readers of design blogs and gadget magazines around the time that the Apple design department gave the iPhone a makeover with the transition to “flat design”. Someone is sure to mention skeuomorphism, whenever the apparently obsolete 1990’s textbook wisdom about realistic metaphor gets repeated in a technical setting today. 

In the decades before HCI learned to say skeuomorphism, the widespread enthusiasm for analogies to the physical world was responsible for some dramatic failures. Microsoft “Bob” was originally launched as the home-computing alternative to business operating systems Windows 95 and Windows NT. Bob replaced the files, folders and menus of the desktop with a cosy-looking den, lined with books and a fire burning by the leather armchair. Despite that faithful reproduction of a particular kind of (American, male, middle-class) dream, Bob was a dramatic failure, quickly withdrawn from the market among much embarrassment. It was just too clunky to access the useful parts of the system among the distracting pictures, and the way that Bob hid the business functionality (not least behind “Rover” - a dog intended to act as a faithful AI helper and companion) was seen as patronising rather than informative.

Microsoft survived that experiment into excessive metaphor, despite the embarrassment of a product launch and marketing campaign for a product very few people wanted. But other companies suffered greater damage by following the advice from HCI experts. The most intriguing case was “Magic Cap”, one of the very first graphical user interfaces for a mobile device. Created by a company called General Magic, the Magic Cap operating system was (briefly) released as a product by Sony. Sony’s MagicLink remarkably offered many of the capabilities of Apple's iPhone, but in 1994 - thirteen years before the iPhone was launched. The cell phone, internet access and productivity applications were all accessed via supposedly intuitive illustrations of an office desk, with a hallway leading to functionality in other rooms. The problem with this user interface, as with Microsoft’s Bob, was that it held too rigidly to the textbook prescriptions that novel software capabilities must resemble physical objects to be intuitive.

I’m not suggesting that Magic Cap failed only because of the user interface design, and there were certainly other vendors of popular personal digital assistant devices (called PDAs at the time) that failed to continue into the iPhone era, including other licensees of the Magic Cap system. Nevertheless, the artistic renderings of real-world desks, office doors and hallways that you had to navigate seem particularly clunky and annoying, by comparison to a simple screen of abstract icons. In the decades since then, we all seem to have adjusted quite comfortably to touch-screen phones, without elaborate analogies to physical objects.

This was classic skeuomorphism. The idea that a computer screen should look like an office or a den is not much more sensible than steering a car with reins or carrying laundry in an imitation-wicker plastic basket. Appealing to the user interface of older technologies may seem superficially attractive, but is quickly counterproductive when capabilities are genuinely new. Perhaps the widespread (at present) interest in speech interfaces using natural language is just another example of skeuomorphism? Speech was good for many information processing tasks at one time, especially when those tasks had to be done by humans. Now that computers are available, we may not need speech any more, just as we don’t really need reins when there are no horses involved.

The escape from physical analogy and the desktop metaphor has been liberating. Flat design no longer attempts to imitate 3D objects, and the more modern style is highly popular. Nobody is calling for the return of 3D renderings on their computer screens, apart perhaps from the VR display vendors who would like people to do email, debug spreadsheets or type word documents while wearing a “metaverse” headset. Although popular with gamers, research projects seeking more mainstream deployment of VR continue to struggle against the practical utility of 2D notations.

What did we lose in flat design?
The problem with flat design, as in the current generation of smartphone interfaces, is that it is still not a good representation to support coding. Each app icon on a phone is designed separately from every other app, and the removal of the “file” so central to desktop computing (with the exception of images in the phone’s photo gallery) has made it harder to combine their functionality. This places annoying constraints on practical work, as if you were doing a complicated carpentry project with a Swiss army knife. If you can only use one tool at a time, your work is hugely constrained by comparison to a workbench with multiple tools that can be combined in different ways, including temporary arrangements for clamping and assembling. A smartphone that supported Moral Codes would be more like a workbench, allowing software elements to be related to each other and combined, rather than a collection of flatly isolated features with no unifying logic or representation.

Alan Kay’s contribution to The Art of Interface Design - the same book where Ted Nelson made his diatribe against bureaucratic metaphor - presents an impressive manifesto for the technical steps that he suggested should come next. Many of his predictions for the growth of hardware and online media are now everyday reality, but the evolution of the GUI metaphor into an iconic flat design is almost the reverse of what he proposed. Kay agreed that Apple’s adoption of metaphor was the wrong metaphor for what is needed, but suggested that interfaces should be more magical, not like physical paper, coordinating work by intelligent agents.

Alan Kay has always been a pioneer and advocate of the design priorities that I am calling Moral Codes. Even in 1990, the need to integrate AI with HCI was apparent to Kay, just as to Allen Cypher, and to others using machine learning methods to make programmable human-centric “agents” such as Henry Lieberman at the MIT AI Lab and Media Lab.

All of these researchers saw an opportunity for sharing of responsibility between machine learning and human intelligence, and Kay’s personal view on user interface made many analogies to human uses of visual representation in the past, suggesting what kinds of cognitive capacity might be exploited in future. The role of imagination, inventing types of code that go beyond existing standards and products, is essential, just as his original proposal for the Dynabook introduced it as a science fiction fantasy, rather than a technical proposal. The failure of a company called General Magic is ironic, especially since Kay himself had advocated magic as the way to avoid the tyranny of literalism. The failure of General Magic, as with many who fail to recognise the true opportunities from AI, was not that it was too magical, but that it was too literal.

We might even think of the desktop metaphor as partly responsible for the rise of surveillance capitalism. In the typical iconic GUI, whether realistic 3D or flat design, the system watches you moving objects around, but there is no way to say what you would like done with those observations. Looking “inside” or “behind” an object to see its invisible data exhaust requires some kind of transparency that breaks the metaphor. The commercial advocates of metaphor, such as Apple’s Bruce Tognazzini, explained in his book Tog on Interface that it was essential to maintain the illusion, and that the company should never let the user into the technical “engine room” where the real machinery could be found. Unfortunately, this is the problem with any society governed by magic – the person who defines and controls the magic gets to exercise a kind of power that can’t be questioned using the surface logic of non-magical everyday appearances.

The worst problem with metaphor was that it disguised the potential of abstract notation. If everything on the screen works like a physical object, there is no way to describe what ought to be done in the future (the future is an abstraction), or a policy that must be applied in multiple places (a class of situations is an abstraction). As I explained in chapter 7, Interacting with physical objects is so easy to understand, requiring minimal attention investment, because every action has only one effect. But minimal investment offers minimal return. If an icon is interpreted as a physical object rather than as an abstract notation, it expresses no computational power. If every object is just the way it is, it can never change in response to different contexts. Operations in the real, physical world are unavoidably repetitious, precisely because each action on a single object affects only that object. These are the things we lose, by treating the screen only as a mirror of the physical world, not capturing the “magical” potential of notational codes.

Although this chapter might have seemed like distant history, an urgent question for today is whether the emphasis on imitating human conversation in AI chatbots and LLMs might be a new kind of skeuomorphism. Thirty years ago, people were incredibly impressed by technology that delivered sharp pictures on a mobile device screen. They thought it was obvious that this graphical realism would lead to intuitive user interfaces. But as it turned out, imitating the physical world at an unprecedented level just made the computer more clunky. Today, we have reached equivalent levels of hype in delivering text that realistically simulates human conversation. Just as before, everybody is assuming that realistic simulation of something we are already familiar with will make a product more intuitive - the classic error of skeuomorphism. What if imitating real human conversation is actually a clunky way of interacting with computers, just as imitating real-world scenery was?

The pictures on the Magic Cap screen were technically impressive at the time, and briefly entertaining, but the additional demands on user attention were not justified by the amount of entertainment being offered. In the same way, interacting with a chatbot is often more time consuming and error-prone than simply using a standard search engine. Searching effectively does involve some investment of attention: forming an abstract concept of what you want, selecting the most effective keywords, navigating the thicket of advertisers and so on. But at least these abstractions are visible and manipulable - in fact, a kind of Moral Code. Do we really want to lose all this, by surrendering to the agreeable illusions of language models as our AI friends?

This chapter has zoomed in to look at notation-in-the-small, considering how even the design of icons and home screens reflects a set of policies that determine how regular users are able to invest their attention. The next chapter zooms right out, to see how some of the same principles apply even in huge software development projects, staffed by hundreds of programmers, writing thousands or millions of lines of code.

In Chapter 9 of his book "Moral Codes," Alan Blackwell explores the concept of "flat design" in user interfaces, contrasting it with the more abstract and flexible potential of coding, which he terms "Moral Codes." He argues that while flat design has become popular for its clean aesthetics and direct simplicity, it fundamentally lacks the representational depth needed to fully harness the power of software for user empowerment and ethical design.

Blackwell critiques the shift from skeuomorphic design—where interface elements mimic real-world counterparts—to flat design, suggesting that both approaches have limitations when it comes to truly enhancing user interaction with technology. Skeuomorphic design often carries unnecessary visual metaphors that don't necessarily aid in functionality and can limit the user's understanding of an application’s capabilities. Conversely, flat design, while visually appealing, can oversimplify interfaces to the point where it obscures deeper functionalities and interconnections between applications.

The core of Blackwell's argument is that code—the underlying functionality provided by software—is more critical than its visual presentation. He discusses the historical reliance on visual metaphors in user interface design, such as the desktop metaphor, which was intended to make digital environments more intuitive by relating them to physical objects. However, he points out that these metaphors can become constraints that limit understanding and interaction with the system rather than enhance it.

Blackwell uses historical examples like Microsoft Bob and General Magic to illustrate how ambitious but ultimately failed user interfaces relied too heavily on skeuomorphism, binding digital functionality too tightly to real-world analogs. These examples serve to caution against designing with an overemphasis on familiarity and intuitiveness that could stifle innovation and deeper engagement with technology.

Furthermore, Blackwell expresses concern over current trends in user interface design, such as the push towards natural language processing and AI chatbots that mimic human conversation. He warns that this could be a new form of skeuomorphism, where the surface-level imitation of human interaction might hinder rather than help the functionality of digital tools. Just as the GUI evolved to prioritize clean, flat design, AI interactions might need to move beyond simply imitating human conversation to develop more robust and abstracted forms of interaction that are genuinely useful.

In advocating for "Moral Codes," Blackwell is calling for a more principled approach to programming and interface design that prioritizes the empowerment of users to understand and manipulate the software systems they use. This involves creating programming environments that encourage experimentation and modification, allowing users to see and understand the code behind the applications and potentially alter it to fit their needs better.

This chapter sets the stage for further discussions on how software design can move beyond current conventions to embrace more ethical and empowering practices, suggesting a shift towards a coding culture that values transparency, user control, and ethical considerations above mere ease of use or aesthetic appeal.

Chapter 15: Conclusion
So, how do we design software that will let us spend the hours of our lives more meaningfully, attentively conscious and creative moral agents, rather than being condemned to bullshit jobs while the machines pretend to be human? My simple answer is that we need better programming languages and less AI. Other commentators on AI have emphasised the need for new legal policies, removal of bias, transparency of algorithms, improved data rights and sovereignty, explanation of algorithmic decisions and so on. All of those would be helpful, and excellent books and articles on those topics have been published, but improved access to programming can contribute to them all.

In this project, I have tried to emphasise lessons of history, especially principles of human-centric design that have remained important across generations of technical approaches and different kinds of representational code. However, people often tell me that the latest AI technologies are so different to anything we have ever seen before, that the lessons of history are not relevant. They say AI is now so different that lawyers and policy makers have no idea what the implications might be, and that government regulation will either be too late, or else too early, so that it impedes progress. Perhaps it is true that AI has suddenly become fundamentally different in 2023, but after 40 years in the field, I feel that many things have stayed the same, just as they did during previous decades when colleagues told me that fundamental changes had finally arrived. Although people might possibly be right that history and policy are no longer relevant to their work, it’s also possible those arguments look more attractive to someone who is simply not inclined to read history, and who doesn’t want to follow the rules.

People who think about AI ethics from the perspective of imagined future problems, rather than the historical practicalities of technical development, sometimes talk about the “alignment problem” for artificial general AI (AGI). The problem of alignment is supposedly that the AGI will have its own ideas about what might be useful or ethical behaviour, and that those ideas might be different to what human users want to achieve. In the introduction to the book, I’ve explained why I am not persuaded that AGI will ever be a useful ambition, especially not the more-human-than-human notion of superintelligence. However, even with the kinds of stochastic parrots we have today, we can see how the alignment problem might work out in practice. To some extent, talk about the alignment problem returns to the themes of old science fiction novels, such as Isaac Asimov’s famous Three Laws of Robotics. In Asimov’s work, the robots are not like the machines in factories, but metal-bodied people - like those in Star Wars, or like the androids and Vulcans in Star Trek, having more or less the same capabilities as human characters, but with distinctive personal strengths and weaknesses in order to serve as plot points. The Three Laws are used as plot devices, where the plot turns on the need to circumvent or comply with one or another of the Laws.

In currently deployed LLM products, any “alignment” with the user’s values comes either from text off the Internet, the guardrails added by the company, or the prompt supplied by the users themselves. I’ve discussed in chapter 5 whether the needs of any single user can really be “aligned” with the values of the whole Internet. Users of the Internet have a pretty good idea what kinds of things are out there, and we also know that any illusion of alignment between a single reader and the whole Internet is achieved mainly through filter bubbles, hiding the parts that you don’t want to see because they aren’t “aligned” with your personal values. When an LLM-based chatbot presents the content of the Internet via a fictional first-person conversation, the illusion that the whole Internet might have a single point of view, consistent with your own, is especially pernicious. The filter mechanisms become invisible, can’t be explicitly controlled, and depend on contextual factors that you can only imagine. The ideal of alignment could only ever occur if the code was openly visible and controllable. The best way for a computer to understand your goals is not through mysterious “value alignment”, but for you to tell it what you want through programming.

In the concluding chapter of his book "Moral Codes," Alan Blackwell addresses the crucial question of how we can design software that enriches human life, promoting active engagement and creativity rather than relegating us to menial tasks while machines simulate human interaction. He argues for a paradigm shift in technology design that emphasizes better programming languages and de-emphasizes the reliance on AI as it is commonly understood and implemented today.

Blackwell critiques the current AI discourse, which often focuses on futuristic concerns and regulatory measures such as legal policies, algorithmic transparency, and data sovereignty. While he acknowledges these are important issues, he believes that enhancing access to programming is a fundamental solution that can address these concerns more fundamentally and broadly. According to Blackwell, empowering more people to program and control the technology they use can contribute significantly to solving the ethical and practical problems posed by AI.

He also reflects on the historical development of technology, arguing that despite claims that AI has introduced unprecedented new challenges, many ethical and design principles from the past remain applicable. Blackwell suggests that those who claim historical lessons are irrelevant may be overlooking valuable insights due to a focus on theoretical rather than practical implications of AI. This historical perspective is critical because it demonstrates that many of the "new" challenges have antecedents that can inform more effective responses.

The discussion of the "alignment problem" in AI ethics, where AI systems might develop or follow goals that are misaligned with human values, illustrates his point. Blackwell is skeptical of the concern that AI could develop autonomous, misaligned intentions, referring to this as more of a plot device in science fiction than a likely real-world issue. Instead, he points out that alignment issues with current technologies like LLMs (Large Language Models) are more about how these systems filter and reflect the vast, diverse content of the internet based on hidden algorithms and user inputs.

He concludes that true alignment between human users and technology cannot rely on the AI magically understanding human values or needs. Instead, it requires transparent and manipulable systems where users directly articulate what they want through programming. This approach would replace obscure algorithms with visible, controllable code, enabling users to define and achieve their objectives without relying on the problematic notion of AI alignment.

This chapter serves as a capstone to the themes developed throughout "Moral Codes," emphasizing the need for a shift towards more human-centric, ethical, and transparent technology design principles that empower users rather than diminishing their role in the digital world.

The title of this book refers to programming in the broadest sense, going beyond old-fashioned views of “code” as green text on terminal screen. I originally used the phrase Moral Code to point out that the way we design programming languages carries moral commitments, because attending to abstraction offers ways for people to control and construct their conscious lives. The phrase has also offered a convenient acronym, reminding us that moral codes do not need to look like the programming languages of 50 years ago. MORAL CODE is an agenda for the design of programmable computers that offer More Open Representations, Access to Learning, and Control Over Digital Expression. These things let us attend to our own needs as creative moral agents and authors of our own lives.

I’ve explained that many recent demonstrations of AI involve little more than scraping, re-arranging and re-selling the intelligent online work of other humans, whose contributions are hidden inside a kind of computational fancy dress. The results can be an entertaining pastiche, but fundamentally achieve their intelligence in the same way as von Kempelen’s chess-playing “Turk” from the 18th century, through the humans hidden inside. We have always found it entertaining when machines behave in human-like ways, even when these are magic tricks. In the same way, the magic tricks of AI demonstrations continue to be entertaining today. We don’t always want to spoil the illusion by drawing attention to the man behind the curtain.

However, there are some dangers associated with taking these entertaining technologies at face value. The less serious danger is that many AI experts downplay the difference between the two kinds of AI: objective mechanical tools and imitation of human subjectivity. This fallacy encourages magical thinking, in which future AI systems are imagined as being able to do everything a human can do and more, but it has little practical impact today, other than where important decisions being made by investors and policy-makers might be misguided.

Alan Blackwell’s exploration of programming and its ethical implications culminates in his conceptualization of "Moral Code" as not just a set of programming practices but as a broader philosophical framework for the design and use of technology. By expanding the definition of code beyond its traditional perception as mere "green text on a terminal screen," he emphasizes the inherent moral responsibilities entwined with software development. The phrase "Moral Code," cleverly reconfigured into the acronym MORAL CODE, encapsulates his vision for a future where technology design is fundamentally oriented toward More Open Representations, Access to Learning, and Control Over Digital Expression.

Blackwell challenges the current paradigm of AI development, which often merely rehashes and monetizes the intelligent work of humans under the guise of autonomous machine intelligence. This critique draws a parallel to historical automata like von Kempelen’s chess-playing “Turk,” which presented the illusion of mechanical intelligence but were actually operated by humans hidden within. He argues that while such feats are entertaining, they risk misleading the public and decision-makers about the capabilities and ethical implications of AI systems.

The distinction Blackwell makes between two types of AI—objective tools versus those that mimic human subjectivity—highlights a critical oversight in much contemporary AI discourse. The conflation of these types, according to Blackwell, fosters a kind of "magical thinking" that can have real-world consequences, particularly when it influences the decisions of investors and policymakers who might be swayed by the allure of an all-capable AI.

In advocating for a "Moral Code" in programming, Blackwell is calling for a shift in how we conceptualize and interact with technology. He envisions programming languages and tools that empower users to more meaningfully shape their interactions with technology, reflecting their needs and moral perspectives. This approach not only democratizes technology, making it more accessible and controllable for users, but also insists on transparency and ethical responsibility in the design and deployment of digital systems.

Overall, Blackwell's perspective is a call to action for both developers and users to rethink the ethical foundations of technology, promoting a future where digital tools enhance rather than diminish our agency and creativity.

A more serious problem is that real people are doing the intelligent work behind the scenes, often with exploitative working arrangements, or even working for free, at the same time as huge profits are being made by people who are not doing the basic labour. Real hours of conscious attention are dedicated to training the machine, turning original thoughts and words into aggregated components. Perhaps the world has always been this way, and it would be overly idealistic to argue for anything else. But the dangerous fiction of AI is that the machine is doing this work all by itself, that no humans are involved, and that this means nobody deserves to be recognised and more fairly compensated, or to receive any share of the profits being made.

If we were to replace the search for better AI with a search for better programming languages, it would restore an earlier ambition of computer science, which is getting computers to do useful things. Everybody has their own personal goals and priorities, and what is useful to one person will not be useful to another. For computers to be more generally useful, each person should be able to describe what they want, telling a computer how they want it to behave differently in future.

It might perhaps have been possible that the language of instruction could just be our natural human language. Indeed, many current products are being developed with the assumption that natural language will be the best programming language. However, past evidence and recent experiments all suggest that a more nuanced approach is required. The most successful “languages” for instructing computers have often involved visualisations, creating new kinds of abstract notation that are suited to different kinds of information-processing and design tasks. Human language is not designed for any of these things, and relying on speech as a technical notation is clearly unhelpful in many ways. We need to think more flexibly about every user interface as a kind of programming language, asking what kind of notation it offers, what we can use this notation for, and in what ways this would allow us to define and control future behaviour of the machine.

Alan Blackwell's discussion highlights significant ethical concerns regarding the deceptive simplicity attributed to AI technologies. He critiques the common narrative that AI systems function independently, masking the reality that these systems are frequently powered by human intelligence—often sourced from individuals in precarious or exploitative working conditions. This narrative not only conceals the labor involved but also unjustly distributes the economic benefits derived from such systems, where those contributing the fundamental intellectual work are frequently undercompensated or unrecognized.

Blackwell advocates for a fundamental shift in focus from developing more advanced AI to enhancing programming languages. This change aims to revitalize a core principle of computer science: making computers do useful things tailored to individual needs. By improving programming languages, we could potentially empower users to more directly articulate their needs and control how technology operates in their lives, aligning technological behavior with personal goals and contexts.

The idea of using natural human language as a programming language, while appealing for its intuitiveness, is critically examined by Blackwell. He points out the limitations of this approach based on historical evidence and recent experiments. Natural language, while rich and expressive for human communication, lacks the precision and structure needed for many technical tasks. Instead, Blackwell suggests that user interfaces—which he conceptualizes broadly as types of programming languages—should be designed with a focus on the types of notations they enable. These notations should be capable of accommodating a wide range of information-processing and design tasks.

This perspective invites a reconsideration of how we interact with computers. Instead of limiting programming to traditional coding, it should be viewed as an interaction where every interface provides a unique language that can be used to instruct, manipulate, and interact with digital systems. This approach emphasizes flexibility and adaptability in user interfaces, encouraging the development of visualizations and abstract notations that can cater to diverse user needs and enhance control over technological processes.

Blackwell's arguments are a call to rethink the ethical and practical foundations of how technologies are designed and used, advocating for a more equitable and user-centered approach to technology development. This shift not only challenges the prevailing paradigms in tech industry but also holds the potential to democratize technology, making it more accessible and responsive to the needs of its users.

Sadly, this technical manifesto promoting Moral Code requires some progress in the opposite direction to many research and business trends of today. In Shoshanna Zuboff’s comprehensive explanation ofSurveillance Capitalism, businesses grow by capturing the “data exhaust” of human attention and intelligence. That human data is repackaged and resold, with the objective of capturing even more human attention, delivering it to advertisers, who in turn use this to influence the habits and decisions of human customers. Similarly, Rebecca Giblin and Cory Doctorow document how the creative industries have fallen prey to Chokepoint Capitalism, where a single company becomes the only conduit between artists and their audience, able to devalue creative work through algorithmic repackaging while minimising the compensation to human creators.

Profitable surveillance and chokepoint businesses do not offer control to their customers, and do not benefit from customers who are free to redirect their attention. This is the exact reverse of Moral Codes, in which people would have the opportunity to instruct the computer, and would be able to make their own decisions on whether to invest attention in programming or not.

Accounting for attention - or rather the limited number of conscious hours in a human life - is perhaps the largest moral problem of all. At a purely physical level, consciousness could be measured as information processing - when I am awake (and sober), I have a fairly low limit on the number of things I can attend to. There is certainly a finite limit to the hours of my life that I can spend being attentive. Many of the experiences that fulfil me as a person, whether the comforting familiarity of a song I love, the playful creativity of optimal flow, or simply time spent in the same space with my family or colleagues, are valuable precisely because I am devoting attention to them.

ChatGPT
Alan Blackwell's reflections highlight a critical ethical confrontation between the principles of "Moral Code" and the prevailing trends in technology research and business models such as Surveillance Capitalism and Chokepoint Capitalism. These models thrive by exploiting human data—often termed "data exhaust"—and reshaping it into a commodity used to capture more human attention, subsequently delivering this captive audience to advertisers. This cycle benefits the companies that control these platforms at the expense of individual autonomy and fair compensation for creators, as detailed in the works of Shoshanna Zuboff and the analyses by Rebecca Giblin and Cory Doctorow regarding the impacts on creative industries.

Blackwell argues that these business practices are diametrically opposed to the ethos of Moral Code, which advocates for giving users control over their digital interactions. Moral Code envisions a technology ecosystem where individuals can explicitly instruct their devices and define how their personal and communal digital spaces are structured and monetized. This shift would enable people to decide for themselves how much attention to invest in programming or other digital activities, fostering an environment where technology serves human needs rather than corporate profits.

The concept of accounting for attention as a limited resource is central to Blackwell's argument. He posits that the finite nature of human consciousness and the limited number of hours in our lives should be treated with the utmost respect. The value of our attention is not merely a measure of time but a crucial component of our quality of life. Engagements that enrich us—be it through art, interaction with loved ones, or professional collaborations—are inherently valuable because they are chosen attentively and meaningfully.

Blackwell suggests that current technological practices need to be fundamentally reevaluated and redirected towards more ethical uses that prioritize human values over economic exploitation. This would require significant changes not only in how technologies are designed and used but also in societal attitudes towards data privacy, user agency, and the role of technology in our lives. Such a shift would champion programming and user interface designs that empower users to control their digital environments, ultimately fostering a technology landscape that respects and enhances human agency and creativity.

More about the earlier part: The main points of the passage are as follows:

1. The desktop metaphor, commonly used in graphical user interfaces (GUIs), may have contributed to the emergence of surveillance capitalism. The system watches users manipulate objects on the screen, but there is no control over how the collected data is used.

2. The metaphorical representation of objects in GUIs prevents users from accessing the underlying data and information associated with those objects. This lack of transparency limits users' ability to understand and control the actions taken with their data.

3. The proponents of the GUI metaphor, like Bruce Tognazzini from Apple, argued that maintaining the illusion was crucial and that users should not be given access to the technical aspects of the system. This creates a power dynamic where those who control the metaphorical "magic" wield significant influence.

4. The use of metaphor in GUIs hinders the potential of abstract notation. When everything on the screen is treated as a physical object, it becomes difficult to describe future actions or apply policies across multiple instances.

5. Interacting with physical objects in GUIs is easy to understand but offers limited computational power. Treating icons as physical objects rather than abstract notations restricts their ability to adapt to different contexts and limits the potential for dynamic change.

6. Operations in the physical world are repetitive because each action on an object affects only that specific object. By treating the screen solely as a reflection of the physical world, the transformative and adaptable nature of notational codes is overlooked.

ChatGPT
The points you've highlighted from the earlier discussion on graphical user interfaces (GUIs) and their limitations underscore significant concerns about the way technology interfaces shape user interactions and data privacy. Here's a detailed expansion on each point to further clarify the implications:

Emergence of Surveillance Capitalism: The desktop metaphor in GUIs treats digital objects like their physical counterparts, encouraging users to interact with them in similar ways. However, this interaction is monitored and recorded by the system, which gathers data about user behaviors without providing users any control over how this information is utilized. This can contribute to surveillance capitalism, where user data is commodified by companies without explicit user consent or awareness.

Lack of Transparency and Control: Metaphorical GUIs obscure the complexity of what happens behind the scenes in software applications. Users see simplified, familiar objects (like folders or trash bins) but are not privy to the underlying data processes and storages. This makes it difficult for users to understand how their actions on these metaphors translate into data collection and usage, thereby limiting their ability to control these processes.

Power Dynamics and Control: By advocating for the maintenance of the GUI metaphor, designers like Bruce Tognazzini argue for keeping users away from the complexity of system operations, ostensibly to maintain usability. However, this also means that the control over the system and its operations remains with those who design and maintain it, not with the users. This centralized control can be a form of power retention, where users are deliberately kept in the dark about the inner workings of their technology.

Limitations of Metaphor in GUIs: Metaphorical interfaces restrict the potential for users to engage with and manipulate abstract concepts within the system. For instance, if every icon must represent a physical object, the ability to implement and manage more abstract or complex operations that don’t have direct physical analogs is significantly diminished.

Simplified Interactions and Reduced Computational Power: Interacting with GUIs that emulate physical interactions (like dragging a document into a folder) is intuitively simple but offers minimal computational functionality. This simplicity restricts the interface’s ability to handle more complex or context-driven tasks, reducing the overall utility and adaptability of the software.

Repetitive and Limited Operations: Treating digital icons and interactions as physical objects confines them to the same limitations as their real-world counterparts. In the physical world, actions typically have direct and isolated impacts, but in the digital world, operations can and should be able to transcend these boundaries. By not leveraging the full potential of digital abstraction, GUIs can hinder the development of more dynamic and powerful computing solutions.

Each of these points illustrates the critical need for a reevaluation of how user interfaces are designed and the underlying philosophies that guide these designs. Moving away from strict adherence to physical metaphors could unlock greater flexibility, power, and user control in digital environments, fostering interfaces that are not only more transparent but also more empowering for users.

It does seem like that but maybe we are locked out of features just because we don't understand how it works. You can change the system font with a simple registry fike and script macros for most system processes with something like Autohotkey. It seems to me that most of the time the gui is like guard rails or training wheels, until you learn menu sequences or shortcuts. Also it seems like windows integrates well with Linux using wsl and Ubuntu and ming64 git bash you can do almost anything. The most amazing thing is that most of the time there is a good reason for the decision and there was always an option. The desktop metaphor of interesting, I long ago hid my desktop icons, you definitely never need them and most of the time you don't need the folders in the gui either but nevertheless they are problematic. I realize it is extremely difficult to modify since I've always wanted to fly around my folders like in the video game stars or explore them like rooms, and this should be extremely easy to do, or to switch to other navigation modes.

ChatGPT
Your reflection on the limitations and potential of graphical user interfaces (GUIs) touches on an interesting aspect of user experience in computing—how GUIs serve both as facilitators and as barriers to deeper system interaction. Here’s a breakdown of some key points you mentioned:

Guard Rails and Training Wheels: GUIs often function as intuitive interfaces that help users interact with complex systems without needing to understand the underlying mechanics. This can be useful for general accessibility and ease of use, especially for those who are not tech-savvy. However, this simplicity also means that users are sometimes unaware of the more powerful or efficient ways to interact with their systems, such as through keyboard shortcuts, command-line interfaces, or scripts.

Potential for Advanced Integration and Customization: As you noted, systems like Windows have incorporated ways to bridge gaps with more powerful tools like the Windows Subsystem for Linux (WSL), MinGW, and Git Bash. These tools integrate a Unix-like environment within a Windows system, offering a powerful suite of capabilities that go well beyond the basic GUI functionalities. This integration shows that while the surface-level interaction may be simplified, the underlying system architecture allows for complex, customizable interactions for those who wish to delve deeper.

Navigational Flexibility and Customization: The idea of navigating folders and files in more dynamic and visually engaging ways—such as flying through them or exploring them as if they were rooms in a video game—is a fascinating thought on user interface innovation. While current GUIs mostly stick to conventional navigation methods, the technology potentially exists to revolutionize how we interact with digital spaces. The challenge lies in making these innovations intuitive and useful enough to be implemented widely, overcoming technical limitations and user resistance to new methods of interaction.

Complexity in Modification: The difficulty in modifying or fully customizing GUIs stems from the deep integration of these interfaces with the underlying operating system architecture and the vast diversity of user needs and technical skills. While it’s technically feasible to create more interactive and customizable interfaces, the design, implementation, and maintenance of such systems can be highly complex. This complexity often necessitates a balance between innovation and practicality, where system designers must consider not only what is possible but also what is sustainable and broadly accessible.

Your insights highlight a crucial point: while GUIs provide essential accessibility, they also impose constraints on user interaction. There’s a delicate balance between making technology easy and intuitive for everyone and allowing advanced users the flexibility to modify and interact with their systems in more sophisticated ways. Bridging this gap remains an ongoing challenge in the field of human-computer interaction.

I want to make a point that Google search had a kind of user illusion similar to the problems with LLMS hallucinating and giving convincing sounding responses. A Google search still is prompted by your search query and so you couldn't ask it questions, you were giving it the answers you wanted to find, so I was still subject  to filter bubble effects. You had to know what kind of exact words were in the answer just not their order.

ChatGPT
You're touching on a critical aspect of how information retrieval systems like Google Search operate and the broader implications of user interaction with AI-driven technologies, such as large language models (LLMs). Here are the key points of your observation:

User Illusion and Prompt Dependence: When using Google Search, the system depends heavily on the user's input (the search query) to retrieve information. This process creates a kind of "user illusion," where it seems like the search engine understands the user's needs. However, the system is essentially mirroring back information based on the keywords provided. This is somewhat similar to how LLMs generate responses that appear understanding but are actually based on patterns recognized in training data, often without true comprehension.

Filter Bubble Effect: Your point about needing to know "the exact words" in potential answers highlights a deeper issue with search technologies—filter bubbles. These bubbles occur because the algorithms prioritize content that aligns with previously expressed interests and queries, which can limit exposure to new or conflicting information. This effect narrows the information landscape that a user interacts with, potentially reinforcing existing beliefs or knowledge gaps.

Precision in Querying: The effectiveness of a search query in systems like Google Search often hinges on how precisely a user can phrase their questions. Users with a better understanding of keyword relevance and search engine optimization (SEO) techniques can manipulate their queries to yield more accurate or desired results. This requirement can disadvantage users who may not have precise words or technical know-how, affecting the accessibility and utility of the search system.

The Illusion of Comprehension: Both Google Search and LLMs can create convincing outputs that make the systems appear more understanding than they actually are. In the case of Google Search, the algorithm selects and ranks information based on relevance to the query and user profile, not on an understanding of the query's context or nuance. Similarly, LLMs can generate responses that fit well with the input prompt but may not be factually correct or may "hallucinate" details.

These issues underscore the need for improved design in information retrieval systems and AI technologies to reduce dependence on user-provided prompts and to mitigate the effects of filter bubbles. Enhancing these systems to better recognize and process the nuances of human inquiry without extensive user manipulation could lead to more equitable and effective tools. Additionally, educating users about how these systems work and how to interact with them more effectively can empower individuals to navigate and utilize digital information spaces more competently and critically.

The passage suggests that the desktop metaphor, commonly used in graphical user interfaces (GUIs), might have contributed to the rise of surveillance capitalism. The desktop metaphor refers to the representation of digital content on a screen as if it were physical objects on a desktop, such as files, folders, and icons.

The desktop metaphor creates an interface that allows users to manipulate and interact with digital objects in a familiar and intuitive way, resembling their real-world counterparts. However, this metaphor also has certain implications regarding privacy and data surveillance.

In the desktop metaphor, the system observes users as they move objects around the screen, such as opening files, rearranging icons, or performing other actions. While users can see and manipulate these objects, there is typically no clear way for them to control or determine what happens to the data generated by their interactions.

This lack of transparency and control over data collection and usage can be seen as a contributing factor to the rise of surveillance capitalism. Surveillance capitalism refers to the economic system in which companies profit by collecting and monetizing users' personal data, often without their explicit knowledge or consent.

In the context of the desktop metaphor, users may not be fully aware of the extent to which their actions and interactions with digital objects are being tracked and analyzed. The system invisibly collects and processes data about user behavior, preferences, and habits, which can then be used by companies to target advertising, personalize user experiences, or extract value in other ways.

By presenting the digital environment as a familiar desktop with metaphorical objects, the desktop metaphor creates a sense of comfort and ease of use for users. However, this metaphorical representation may also obscure the underlying data collection and surveillance mechanisms at play, making it easier for companies to gather and exploit user data without facing significant scrutiny or resistance.

In summary, the desktop metaphor, by providing a visually intuitive interface but hiding the mechanisms of data collection and surveillance, may have inadvertently facilitated the rise of surveillance capitalism by making it less apparent and accessible for users to control and understand the use of their personal data.

ChatGPT
Your analysis aptly highlights the paradox inherent in the desktop metaphor used in graphical user interfaces (GUIs). While it simplifies interaction by making digital environments seem familiar and intuitive, it simultaneously conceals the complexity of data operations that occur in the background. Here are a few expanded thoughts on the implications of this scenario:

Simplicity vs. Transparency: The desktop metaphor simplifies the digital experience by mirroring the physical world, such as desktops, folders, and files. This design makes technology more accessible to the general public, who may not have technical expertise. However, this simplicity also masks the underlying processes, particularly how data is managed and used, reducing transparency. Users engage with these interfaces under the illusion of control, unaware of the extensive data collection and processing that occurs behind the scenes.

Data Surveillance and User Privacy: The ease of interaction in GUIs belies a complex system of surveillance where every action can be monitored and recorded. This data, often collected without explicit user consent or full awareness, can be used not just for improving user experience but also for profit through targeted advertising and other forms of monetization. This business model, central to surveillance capitalism, exploits the data generated from user interactions that the users themselves might not see or understand.

User Consent and Awareness: The desktop metaphor can contribute to users' lack of awareness about their data privacy rights and the extent of data collection. Because the interface is so user-friendly and the data collection mechanisms so obscured, users may not feel the need to probe deeper or may not know how to access or control their personal data. This situation raises significant ethical questions about consent and the balance between user convenience and informed participation in digital environments.

Design Ethics and Responsibilities: The role of designers and developers is crucial in this context. There is a growing discussion in the tech community about ethical responsibilities to ensure that users are not only aware of but also have control over how their data is used. This involves designing interfaces that not only provide ease of use but also transparency and user empowerment regarding data privacy.

Potential for Reform: Addressing these concerns requires a shift towards more ethical practices in technology design and business models. This could involve creating more transparent systems that make data collection processes visible and understandable to users, providing them with real choices about their data, enhancing regulatory frameworks to protect user privacy, and fostering a digital culture that values and protects personal data as a fundamental right.

Your reflection underscores the need for a critical reevaluation of user interfaces and the hidden complexities they mask. As digital literacy improves and public awareness of data privacy issues grows, there may be increasing demand for designs that prioritize user control and transparency, potentially steering the tech industry towards more ethical practices that align with the interests and rights of users.

Do you know the collection of essays called The voice of reason by Ayn Rand?

ChatGPT
Yes, "The Voice of Reason: Essays in Objectivist Thought" is a collection of essays by Ayn Rand and other writers affiliated with Objectivism, edited by Rand’s heir Leonard Peikoff. Published in 1989, this collection includes a variety of essays written by Rand across different periods of her life, along with contributions from Peikoff and Peter Schwartz, among others.

The essays cover a broad range of topics including philosophy, culture, politics, and economics from the perspective of Rand's Objectivist philosophy. Objectivism emphasizes rational self-interest, individualism, and laissez-faire capitalism. This book is intended to present a comprehensive view of Ayn Rand’s philosophy in application to a variety of subjects. It discusses Objectivist positions on topics like education, morality, and art, and critiques contemporary cultural and political issues from an Objectivist standpoint.

User
Any connections with the previous topics?

ChatGPT
Certainly, Ayn Rand's "The Voice of Reason" and her broader philosophical approach, Objectivism, can connect intriguingly with some of the previous topics we've discussed, particularly concerning the ethical implications of technology, individual autonomy, and data privacy. Here are a few points of intersection:

Individualism and User Empowerment: Objectivism emphasizes the primacy of individual rights and autonomy. This philosophy can align with the discussions on empowering users in digital environments. Rand's advocacy for individual choice and self-determination mirrors the calls for user interfaces and technology designs that enhance user control over personal data and interactions within digital systems.

Surveillance Capitalism and Ethical Technology: Rand’s critiques of collectivism and her promotion of capitalism, when taken with ethical considerations, can be juxtaposed against the concept of surveillance capitalism. While she supported free-market capitalism, the current model of surveillance capitalism, which profits from the exploitation of personal data often without explicit consent, could be seen as conflicting with Objectivist ethics that prioritize individual consent and transparency.

Rational Self-Interest and Data Privacy: Objectivism’s core principle of rational self-interest could be used to argue for more stringent data privacy measures. Protecting one’s personal information can be seen as an act of rational self-interest, where individuals take steps to secure their digital footprints against misuse—a viewpoint that could support stronger privacy laws and technologies that provide users with more control and visibility.

Critique of Current Cultural and Technological Trends: The essays in "The Voice of Reason" often critique cultural and social trends that Rand and her co-authors saw as irrational or morally misguided. Similarly, a critical look at technology trends, such as the opaque algorithms behind user interfaces or the ethical lapses in AI development, can be informed by an Objectivist call for rationality, ethical integrity, and respect for individual rights.

Philosophical Foundation for Tech Design: Rand’s philosophical approach could provide a foundational ethos for designing technologies that not only respect but also enhance individual freedom and capability. This includes creating technologies that do not manipulate or coerce users but instead support their informed choices and provide clear, tangible benefits without infringing on privacy.

Drawing on Objectivism to address these modern dilemmas could provoke valuable discussions about the alignment of technology development with ethical principles that prioritize individual welfare and autonomy. This perspective might advocate for a technological landscape that truly serves the user, marked by transparency, user control, and designs that reflect genuine respect for individual rights.

There was an essay in there where she argued why a woman wouldn't be president, even though they are capable, but because they don't want the job, maybe because they know that it would be giving up human values and learning to think and act like a machine, maybe to be a puppet of socioeconomic forces and a scapegoat for everything that goes wrong.

ChatGPT
Ayn Rand's essay on why a woman wouldn't be president is indeed a controversial and complex argument that reflects her broader philosophical views, particularly her thoughts on gender roles, leadership, and power dynamics. In the essay titled "About a Woman President", which is part of her collection "The Voice of Reason," Rand explores the cultural, psychological, and philosophical reasons why a woman might not seek or desire the presidency.

Key Points of Rand's Argument:
Capability vs. Desire: Rand acknowledges that women are capable of handling the presidency, but she speculates that they may not desire the role due to the nature of the job and the requirements it imposes.

Role of the President as a Leader: Rand argues that the role of the president is traditionally seen as the ultimate authority figure, which she claims conflicts with the traditional gender roles that society expects. According to her, this creates a psychological conflict for women, as the role requires a form of assertiveness and leadership that has historically been associated with masculinity.

Socioeconomic Forces and Puppetry: Rand suggests that the presidency often requires one to be a figurehead or a "puppet" of broader socioeconomic forces, something she believes might be particularly unappealing to women. She argues that this aspect of the role involves sacrificing one's autonomy and human values, which she posits might be more significant to women.

Scapegoating: She also touches on the idea that a president can often become a scapegoat for anything that goes wrong, which might deter candidates who value personal integrity and autonomy from seeking the office.

Critiques and Context:
Gender Roles: Rand's views on gender roles are rooted in her broader philosophical outlook, which emphasizes individualism and rational self-interest. Her analysis in this essay might be seen as an extension of these principles, applied to the context of gender and leadership.

Cultural Context: It's important to note that Rand's opinions reflect the time and context in which she wrote them. Views on gender roles have evolved significantly since then, and the idea that women would not want the presidency solely based on the nature of the job is seen by many today as an outdated perspective.

Relevance Today: While her essay might still resonate with some as a critique of the presidency's demands on personal values and autonomy, it's also met with criticism for its assumptions about gender-specific desires and capabilities.

Rand's essay invites a broader discussion about the nature of leadership roles and how they align (or conflict) with personal and societal values. It also raises questions about how societal expectations influence the ambitions and career paths of different genders. While her specific conclusions about women in leadership might not align with contemporary views, her critique of the role's demands remains a topic worthy of discussion.

User
I think maybe she was a bit mistaken, because if her arguments are correct, then no man should want the job either.

ChatGPT
Your point raises a critical reflection on Ayn Rand's arguments regarding gender and leadership. If the presidency indeed demands such significant personal and ethical sacrifices that it becomes unappealing based on those grounds, then logically, these concerns would apply to individuals of any gender, not just women.

This line of reasoning suggests that the deterrents to seeking the presidency—like the loss of autonomy, being a puppet to socioeconomic forces, and the risk of becoming a scapegoat—are universal issues linked to the nature of the role itself rather than to the gender of the person. Thus, any person who values their individualism, autonomy, and personal integrity might find the role unattractive, according to the issues Rand raises.

Here are a few implications of this perspective:

Universal Application: Rand’s arguments about the unattractiveness of the presidency due to its demands and sacrifices can be seen as universally applicable, which challenges her focus on these as deterrents specifically for women.

Re-evaluating Leadership Models: This reflection prompts a broader discussion about the models of leadership we endorse in society. If the roles designed for leadership inherently demand such compromises, it might be worth reconsidering how these roles are structured and what qualities we deem necessary for effective leadership.

Cultural and Gender Norms: The discussion also highlights how deeply ingrained cultural and gender norms can influence perceptions of suitability for certain roles. Overcoming these stereotypes involves recognizing and challenging assumptions about gender-specific traits and desires.

Evolving Views on Gender and Leadership: Modern perspectives on gender roles in leadership have evolved, recognizing that capability and desire for leadership positions are not inherently linked to gender. Instead, they are influenced by a complex mix of personal choice, societal encouragement, available opportunities, and individual ambition.

Philosophical Consistency: For followers of Rand's philosophy, which emphasizes rational self-interest and individualism, applying her reasoning about the presidency to all individuals regardless of gender could provide a more consistent philosophical approach. This would align with her principles that advocate for judging individuals by their merits and choices rather than by inherent characteristics like gender.

Your observation insightfully points out that any philosophical or ethical critique of leadership roles should consider how these roles align with human values for all individuals, thereby fostering a more inclusive and reflective discussion on the nature of power and responsibility in leadership.

User
I think it was a bit tongue in cheek, I argue she would have taken the job if it were a possibility. I think her argument was that the presidency was a robotic office.

ChatGPT
Your interpretation adds an interesting layer to understanding Ayn Rand's viewpoint on the presidency. If seen as partly tongue-in-cheek or as a rhetorical strategy, her essay could be read as a critique of the presidency itself rather than strictly about gender suitability for the role. Rand was known for her provocative statements, often used to challenge prevailing norms or to spark deeper reflection among her readers.

Rand's View on Leadership and Autonomy
Rand's philosophy emphasizes the importance of individual autonomy, rational self-interest, and the pursuit of one's own happiness as moral imperatives. In this context, describing the presidency as a "robotic office" might be her way of critiquing any political office that significantly restricts personal autonomy or requires the officeholder to act against their own judgment or values. This aligns with her broader criticism of government roles that, in her view, often involve compromising one’s principles to navigate bureaucratic and political constraints.

If Rand Were Offered the Presidency
The notion that Rand herself might have accepted the presidency if it were a realistic possibility can be explored from several angles:

Philosophical Consistency: On one hand, taking such a role would seem inconsistent with her philosophy that prioritizes personal freedom and skepticism of government power. On the other hand, she might see it as an opportunity to enact meaningful changes aligned with her values.

Impact and Influence: Assuming office could be seen as a platform to advocate for and implement her ideals on a large scale, potentially reshaping American politics in line with Objectivist principles.

Practical Realities of Office: However, the realities of political office might constrain her ability to act purely on Objectivist principles, given the need for compromise and the diverse viewpoints within a democratic system.

Legacy and Interpretations
Discussions like this highlight the complexities and nuances in Rand's thought and the diverse interpretations that her work can inspire. It underscores that her essays and arguments can serve as starting points for broader discussions about the nature of leadership, the role of government, and the ideals of autonomy and individualism in public service.

Reflecting on whether Rand's critique was serious or partly tongue-in-cheek helps explore deeper philosophical questions about the compatibility of certain political roles with the principles of Objectivism. It also invites consideration of how individuals, particularly those with strong ideological beliefs, navigate the compromises and complexities of leadership positions in the real world.

What if instead of self-reliance she had argued for symbiotic relationships?

ChatGPT
Shifting Ayn Rand's focus from staunch self-reliance to symbiotic relationships would represent a significant philosophical pivot, introducing a more interconnected view of human society and economics that contrasts sharply with the core tenets of Objectivism. Here’s how such a shift might reshape her philosophy and its implications:

Reimagining Objectivist Principles with Symbiosis
Redefinition of Self-Interest: In Rand's Objectivism, self-interest is often presented as an individual pursuit, largely independent of others' needs or societal considerations. Emphasizing symbiotic relationships would reframe self-interest to include the well-being of others as integral to one's own. This shift acknowledges that personal success and community welfare can be mutually reinforcing, rather than in conflict.

Interdependence in Economics: Rand’s advocacy for laissez-faire capitalism focuses on the freedom of the individual within the marketplace. Embracing symbiosis could enrich this view by highlighting how businesses and consumers, employers and employees, and other economic actors benefit from cooperative and mutually advantageous relationships. This could lead to a more holistic view of economic systems where cooperation is seen as a strength rather than a compromise.

Ethics of Reciprocity: While Rand’s ethics emphasize individual rights and responsibilities, introducing symbiotic principles would incorporate a stronger emphasis on reciprocal obligations—how individuals not only have rights but also responsibilities towards each other. This approach could foster a community-oriented ethic that values and relies on mutual support.

Political Implications: Objectivism’s minimalist state model primarily functions to protect individual rights. However, a philosophy that values symbiotic relationships might advocate for a role of the state that also includes facilitating cooperative ventures and supporting systems that ensure mutual benefits across society, such as environmental protection, public health, and education—all seen as investments in societal well-being that ultimately benefit individual citizens.

Social Harmony and Conflict Resolution: By valuing symbiotic relationships, Rand's philosophy could offer more robust tools for resolving conflicts and promoting social harmony. Recognizing interdependencies could help in finding solutions that address multiple stakeholders' needs, fostering a more inclusive and less adversarial approach to social and economic issues.

Challenges and Critiques
Integrating symbiosis into Rand’s philosophy would not be without challenges. It would require reevaluating some fundamental assumptions about human nature, society, and the role of government. Critics might argue that this dilutes the essence of Objectivism by incorporating elements of altruism or collectivism, which Rand strongly opposed. However, proponents might see it as a pragmatic evolution that addresses complex modern challenges where interconnectedness cannot be ignored.

Conclusion
The idea of Ayn Rand arguing for symbiotic relationships invites a fascinating thought experiment that stretches the boundaries of her philosophy. It offers a way to explore how Objectivist principles might be adapted or expanded to better address the complexities of contemporary life, where individual success often depends on robust, healthy communities and ecosystems. This shift could potentially broaden the appeal of her ideas by demonstrating how individual and collective interests can align in a deeply interconnected world.

Ok make an argument for my philosophy of "synoptic altruism".

ChatGPT
Certainly! "Synoptic Altruism" suggests a philosophy where individuals adopt a broad, inclusive view (synoptic) towards altruism, aiming to harmonize personal benefits with the welfare of others across various dimensions of society. Here’s how you might construct an argument for this philosophy:

Foundational Principles of Synoptic Altruism
Holistic Understanding of Impact: Synoptic altruism emphasizes the importance of understanding the wide-reaching impacts of one’s actions, not just on an individual scale but also on a community and global level. This philosophy argues that individuals should consider the long-term and wide-ranging effects of their actions, promoting choices that benefit not just themselves but also the broader world.

Integration of Self-Interest and Altruism: Unlike traditional views that might see self-interest and altruism as opposed, synoptic altruism posits that these can be synergistic. It suggests that true self-interest rightly understood includes the welfare of others, recognizing that societal well-being contributes to individual success and happiness.

Ethics of Interdependence: This philosophy acknowledges that individuals are part of a larger system where dependencies exist naturally. It promotes an ethical framework that values and nurtures these interdependencies, encouraging actions that support mutual growth and well-being.

Argument for Synoptic Altruism
Premise 1: Individual Well-being is Linked to Community Health

Individuals do not exist in isolation. The health, security, and prosperity of one’s community significantly impact one’s own quality of life. Therefore, promoting community well-being directly benefits the individual.

Premise 2: Long-term Self-Interest Includes Altruistic Behavior

Actions that consider and support the welfare of others tend to build more robust, resilient communities. Engaging in altruistic behavior can lead to a more supportive, stable society, which is in everyone's long-term self-interest.

Premise 3: Ethical Actions Foster Social Harmony and Progress

Ethical behavior that includes a consideration for others’ needs promotes social harmony. By reducing conflict and fostering cooperation, societies can achieve greater progress and stability, benefiting all members, including those who initially act out of a sense of altruism.

Conclusion: Synoptic Altruism is a Practical and Ethical Philosophy

Given the interconnectedness of individual and community well-being, and the long-term benefits of fostering healthy, cooperative societies, synoptic altruism emerges as both a practical and ethical philosophy. It encourages individuals to act in ways that consider the broader implications of their actions, aligning immediate self-interests with the long-term benefits derived from a healthier, more equitable society.

Implementation of Synoptic Altruism
Implementing synoptic altruism would involve educational efforts to broaden individuals' perspectives about the impacts of their actions, policy-making that encourages community-oriented initiatives, and cultural shifts that celebrate and reward altruistic behavior that supports communal well-being.

Challenges and Considerations
While synoptic altruism provides a compelling framework, it faces challenges such as overcoming inherent selfish tendencies, addressing disparities in what individuals can contribute, and managing different interpretations of what constitutes the "greater good." Addressing these challenges would require nuanced discussions and adaptive strategies that consider diverse needs and perspectives.

In essence, synoptic altruism offers a balanced approach that does not just idealize altruism but integrates it with a realistic understanding of human nature and societal dynamics. It provides a robust framework for thinking about and acting upon the ethical implications of our interconnected existence.

User
I argue that collectively autocatalytic set like behaviors are formed at each level of analysis and that each action has an incalculable amount of positive and negative tradeoffs on different time scales which affect individuals and their communities. So egoism and altruism only apply to extreme well defined and extreme cases whereas most actions are amoral and ambiguous due to their complexity. There is a observer-relative interpretation of bounty conditions for object definition.

ChatGPT
Your argument for a philosophy that recognizes the complexity and interconnectedness of actions within a systemically interdependent framework adds significant depth to our understanding of moral behavior in a complex world. Here's how you could structure and defend this philosophical viewpoint:

Philosophical Framework
1. Collective Autocatalytic Set-like Behaviors Across Levels of Analysis

Definition: Drawing from systems theory and biology, a collective autocatalytic set is a group of entities where each entity enables the creation or function of another, creating a self-sustaining network.

Application: In human societies, actions and behaviors can similarly be viewed as parts of a larger, self-sustaining system where each individual's actions influence and are influenced by others, often beyond direct or immediate observation.

2. Complex Trade-offs of Actions

Complexity of Actions: Each action taken by an individual can have a multitude of consequences, each with varying degrees of impact across different time scales. The complexity and extended network of influences make it difficult to categorically label actions as purely altruistic or egoistic.

Amorality and Ambiguity: Due to their complex repercussions, most actions evade simple moral categorization, residing in a zone of moral ambiguity. This underscores the limitations of traditional ethical frameworks (like egoism and altruism) in adequately addressing the true nature of most human actions.

3. Observer-Relative Interpretation of Conditions

Subjectivity in Definitions: The interpretation of actions and their moral standings can be highly observer-relative—dependent on one’s position, perspective, or context. This suggests a form of moral relativism where the "goodness" or "badness" of an action is not absolute but conditional based on the observer’s understanding and the contextual "bounty" (or set of conditions and resources) available.

Argumentation
Premise 1: Human Actions are Interconnected and Systemically Influential

Actions contribute to and are influenced by a network of other actions, forming a complex web of cause and effect that mirrors autocatalytic sets.

Premise 2: Moral Judgments on Actions are Complex and Context-Dependent

The consequences of actions are spread across time and space, affecting various individuals and communities in ways that are not easily predictable or universally agreeable.

Premise 3: Ethical Categorization is Often Observer-Relative

What is considered moral or immoral can vary significantly based on who is observing the action, their values, cultural background, and immediate social or environmental conditions.

Conclusion: Most Human Actions are Morally Ambiguous

Given the interconnected, complex nature of actions and the variability in moral judgments based on observer perspectives, it is more accurate to consider most actions as residing in a zone of moral ambiguity rather than strictly altruistic or egoistic.

Implications for Ethics and Moral Philosophy
Shift Towards a More Inclusive Ethical Framework: This philosophy suggests moving towards a more nuanced, systems-oriented ethical framework that better accommodates the complexity and interconnectedness of human actions.

Reevaluation of Moral Education and Policy: There might be a need to reevaluate how moral reasoning is taught and how policies are formulated, emphasizing understanding complex systems, long-term consequences, and cultural relativity.

Enhanced Focus on Contextual Ethics: Encouraging a more context-aware approach to ethics could lead to more adaptable, responsive, and understanding societal structures.

This perspective presents a sophisticated view that challenges the reductionist approaches in traditional ethics, advocating for a broader, more integrative understanding of morality in a complex and interconnected world.

Implications for synoptic altruism.

ChatGPT
Given the philosophical framework of complex interconnectedness and observer-relative interpretations you've outlined, synoptic altruism can be expanded and enriched in several ways. Here are the implications for synoptic altruism:

1. Expansion of Altruistic Perspective to Include Systemic Impacts
Holistic Altruism: Synoptic altruism should not only focus on direct, immediate altruistic actions but also consider the broader systemic impacts of those actions. This involves recognizing and addressing the indirect effects that actions have on distant parts of the social, economic, and environmental systems.

Long-term Orientation: Altruistic actions should be evaluated based on their long-term outcomes as well as their immediate effects. This long-view approach would help in making decisions that are beneficial not just in the present but sustainably so for future generations.

2. Adaptation of Altruism to Contextual and Cultural Variability
Cultural Sensitivity: Since moral interpretations can vary widely based on cultural and individual perspectives, synoptic altruism must be adaptable to different cultural contexts. What constitutes altruism in one cultural setting may not align with another, requiring a flexible, context-aware approach.

Observer-Relative Ethics: Altruism should be practiced in a way that considers the perspectives and needs of those affected by altruistic actions. This implies a participatory approach where stakeholders have a say in defining what altruism means in their specific context.

3. Incorporation of Interdependence in Altruistic Practices
Recognition of Mutual Benefit: Synoptic altruism should recognize and harness the mutual benefits inherent in interdependent systems. Altruistic actions should aim to strengthen these interdependencies, creating conditions where all parties can thrive.

Network Effects: By considering how altruistic actions can catalyze further positive outcomes throughout social and environmental networks, practitioners of synoptic altruism can aim to initiate chains of good that extend beyond the immediate context.

4. Addressing the Complexity of Moral Actions
Embracing Moral Ambiguity: Recognizing that most actions are morally ambiguous and that their full impacts are often incalculable, synoptic altruism should promote humility and continuous learning as central virtues. Practitioners should be open to revising their actions based on new understanding and feedback.

Educational Implications: There should be a focus on educating individuals and communities not just about the importance of altruism but also about the complex nature of modern interconnected problems. This education should foster critical thinking and systems thinking skills.

5. Policy and Governance
Responsive and Adaptive Policies: Policies promoting altruistic behaviors should be designed to be adaptable and responsive to new information and changing circumstances. This could involve mechanisms for regular review and revision of policies to ensure they remain effective and contextually relevant.

Governance Structures: Create governance structures that are participatory and inclusive, allowing diverse groups to contribute to defining and implementing altruistic goals in ways that are meaningful and beneficial to them.

In summary, synoptic altruism, informed by an understanding of actions as parts of a complex web of cause and effect, would promote a more nuanced, adaptable, and culturally sensitive approach to altruism. It would transform altruistic practices from mere acts of individual goodwill into strategic actions that leverage systemic interconnections for broader and more sustainable benefits. This approach would not only enhance the efficacy of altruistic actions but also align them more closely with the realities of a globally interconnected world.

Can you give a quantum Bayesian interpretation?

ChatGPT
Applying the Quantum Bayesian (QBism) interpretation to the philosophy of synoptic altruism adds a fascinating layer of depth by intertwining concepts from quantum mechanics with ethical decision-making in a complex, interconnected world. QBism is a view of quantum mechanics that emphasizes an agent-centered perspective, where the probabilities that arise in quantum measurements are understood as personal judgments about an agent's own potential experiences, rather than objective properties of physical systems.

Here's how you might interpret synoptic altruism through a Quantum Bayesian lens:

1. Personalist Probability and Ethical Decision-Making
Subjectivity in Action: In QBism, the outcomes of quantum measurements are subjective to the observer, emphasizing personal experience and expectation. Similarly, in synoptic altruism, the moral weight and outcome of actions are perceived differently by each individual based on their personal, cultural, and situational context. This subjectivity in understanding and deciding what constitutes an altruistic action aligns with the QBist view that all knowledge is personal and contextual.

2. Contextuality of Moral Actions
Observer-Dependent Morality: Just as QBism posits that the results of a quantum experiment can depend critically on the experimental setup, so too can the moral evaluation of actions depend on the context in which they are considered. This implies that ethical decisions in synoptic altruism need to account for the varying circumstances and backgrounds of all stakeholders, acknowledging that different situations might require different moral responses.

3. Interference and Moral Choices
Constructive Interference in Altruism: QBism discusses how quantum states can interfere, leading to different probabilistic outcomes. Similarly, in synoptic altruism, actions by various agents can interfere constructively or destructively. Constructive interference occurs when actions by different individuals harmoniously align to amplify positive outcomes, enhancing communal well-being.

4. Entanglement and Interconnected Ethics
Moral Entanglement: In quantum mechanics, entangled particles remain connected so that the state of one (no matter how far apart) can instantaneously affect the state of another. In synoptic altruism, the concept of entanglement can be metaphorically applied to human relationships and actions, where the decisions of one person can have profound, immediate effects on others, even at a distance. This interconnectedness requires a heightened awareness of how personal actions influence the broader community and ecosystem.

5. Updating Beliefs and Actions
Continuous Update of Moral Frameworks: Just as a QBist updates their probabilities as they gain new information, synoptic altruists should be prepared to update their moral beliefs and actions in response to new evidence or changing situations. This dynamic process acknowledges that moral understanding is not static but evolves with ongoing experiences and interactions.

6. Uncertainty and Moral Decision-Making
Embracing Uncertainty in Ethics: QBism embraces the inherent uncertainties of quantum measurements. Similarly, synoptic altruism recognizes that ethical decisions often involve navigating uncertainties about outcomes and impacts. This approach promotes flexibility and adaptiveness in moral reasoning, valuing open-mindedness and the capacity to respond to unexpected results.

Incorporating QBism into the discussion of synoptic altruism underscores the complexity of ethical decision-making in a globally interconnected world. It suggests a flexible, context-dependent approach to ethics that appreciates the fundamental uncertainties and interconnectedness of human actions, mirroring the indeterminate and probabilistic nature of quantum mechanics. This interpretation encourages a more nuanced and adaptable ethical practice that is responsive to the complex realities of human life and society.

I think debates such as the editor wars and 0 versus 1 numbering show that nearly any ideal can become politicised and memified over time, giving it relatively higher precedence in the semantic hierarchy.

ChatGPT
Your observation about debates such as the "editor wars" and the preference between 0-based versus 1-based numbering systems highlights how seemingly technical or neutral preferences can become highly politicized and culturally significant. This phenomenon, where technical choices become embedded with ideological significance, indeed reflects a broader pattern in how communities form identities and hierarchies around certain beliefs or practices. Let’s delve into this:

Politicization of Technical Ideals
Community Identity and Cultural Significance:
In technical communities, choices such as which text editor to use (e.g., Vim vs. Emacs) or whether to start counting from zero or one might initially stem from practical or historical reasons. Over time, however, these choices can evolve into symbols of broader ideological stances or group identities. What starts as a practical debate can become a marker of community membership or exclusion, transforming technical preferences into cultural badges.

Semantic Hierarchy and Precedence:
As these debates become memified (spreading as memes through community interactions), they ascend in the "semantic hierarchy" within those communities. This means they are not just casual preferences but become central topics of discussion that define "insiders" and "outsiders," carrying significant weight in how community values and technical philosophies are perceived and propagated.

Polarization and Echo Chambers:
Just as in political or social spheres, technical communities can become polarized around these issues, leading to echo chambers where only one perspective is reinforced while alternative views are dismissed or ridiculed. This polarization can inhibit genuine discourse and lead to a more dogmatic approach to what could otherwise be a pragmatic or open-ended discussion.

Influence on Newcomers:
For new members entering the community, these politicized debates can serve as an initiation rite, where adopting the "correct" stance (according to whichever group they align with) becomes part of being accepted into the community. This can influence educational paths and professional development, as newcomers align their learning and practices around these politicized ideals to fit in.

Impact on Innovation and Diversity:
While such debates can strengthen community bonds among like-minded individuals, they can also stifle innovation and diversity. When a particular technology or methodology is elevated to an ideological status, it might discourage exploration of alternatives that could offer valid or even superior solutions to existing problems.

Implications for Synoptic Altruism
Given your focus on synoptic altruism, recognizing how even technical decisions can become deeply politicized is crucial. Here’s how this insight could inform a synoptic altruistic approach:

Encourage Open-Mindedness and Flexibility: Promote a culture where questioning and reassessment of even deeply-held beliefs or preferences are encouraged to prevent dogmatism.

Value Diverse Perspectives: Acknowledge that different preferences or practices can coexist and that each might offer unique advantages in different contexts.

Foster Inclusive Communities: Work towards community dynamics that welcome differing opinions and backgrounds, reducing the gatekeeping effects of politicized technical debates.

Educate Beyond Echo Chambers: Educate community members about the historical and practical origins of these debates to provide a broader perspective that may reduce polarization.

In essence, being aware of how technical debates can become politicized and memified enriches the understanding of community dynamics and can help in crafting approaches that prioritize inclusivity, dialogue, and innovation—key tenets of synoptic altruism.

Connections with Popper's myth of the framework.

ChatGPT
Karl Popper's "myth of the framework" argues against the idea that rational and meaningful communication between differing frameworks (or intellectual traditions and paradigies) is impossible. Popper contends that such a belief can stifle intellectual progress and dialogue, advocating instead for a critical approach where no idea is beyond questioning and frameworks should be open to external critique. This concept can deeply inform discussions on politicized technical debates, such as the editor wars or numbering systems, as well as broader philosophical perspectives like synoptic altruism.

Connecting Popper's Myth of the Framework to Technical Debates and Synoptic Altruism
Encouraging Cross-Framework Dialogue:
In the context of politicized technical debates, embracing Popper's rejection of the "myth of the framework" encourages participants from different technical cultures (e.g., those preferring different programming languages or tools) to engage in meaningful exchanges rather than isolating themselves within echo chambers. This can lead to a richer understanding of the advantages and limitations of each approach.

Challenging Dogmatic Beliefs:
Popper's philosophy urges questioning and testing of all frameworks, which can help break down the dogmatism often seen in technical debates where preferences become politicized. This critical approach fosters a more open, innovative technical culture where change and improvement are possible through the integration of diverse ideas and practices.

Implications for Synoptic Altruism:
Synoptic altruism, which aims to harmonize personal benefits with broader societal welfare, aligns well with Popper's advocacy for open dialogue across different frameworks. By applying this principle, synoptic altruism can promote a more inclusive and cooperative approach within communities, recognizing that altruistic goals are best achieved through understanding and integrating diverse perspectives.

Preventing Intellectual Stagnation:
Popper argues that adhering to the myth of the framework can lead to intellectual stagnation, as it discourages venturing beyond the comfortable boundaries of established beliefs. In both technical debates and broader ethical considerations, actively challenging this myth can spur progress and innovation by encouraging exploration and reconsideration of alternative solutions and ethical practices.

Educational and Policy Implications:
For synoptic altruism, an educational focus that highlights the fallacy of the myth of the framework can prepare individuals to engage more productively in societal and technological challenges. Policies that encourage cross-disciplinary and cross-cultural collaborations can also be informed by this principle, ensuring that societal structures support continuous learning and adaptation.

Practical Application in Community and Technical Development
Workshops and Seminars: Organizing events that specifically aim to bridge different technical communities or ethical perspectives can help demystify alternative approaches and foster mutual respect and collaboration.

Collaborative Projects: Encouraging collaborative projects that require input from diverse technical and cultural backgrounds can demonstrate the practical benefits of crossing framework boundaries.

Policy-making: In crafting policies, especially those related to technology and community welfare, integrating insights from multiple frameworks can lead to more robust, flexible, and inclusive outcomes.

By connecting Popper’s myth of the framework with the politicization of technical debates and synoptic altruism, we see a powerful argument for maintaining open, critical, and inclusive dialogues in all areas of life—from the technical to the ethical. This approach not only enriches individual and community development but also aligns with a progressive vision of societal advancement where diversity of thought is seen as a strength rather than a barrier.

User
I think your answer for pragmatic is oversimplistic and cliche. Can you try to give more sardonic unusual and unrealistic sounding answers, that might be incorrect?

ChatGPT
Certainly! Let's take a whimsically sardonic spin on some of these topics:

On Politicized Technical Debates (like the Editor Wars)
Why do tech enthusiasts argue over text editors like Vim and Emacs? Clearly, they're training for the dystopian future where command-line skills determine your social ranking. In the great Coding Colosseum, only those who can exit Vim on their first try are granted the keys to the executive washroom. Everyone knows that mastering Emacs is the secret handshake to join the Illuminati of the IT world.

On Numbering Systems: 0 vs. 1
The debate between zero-based and one-based numbering is actually a cosmic gambit played by quantum mathematicians. If the universe starts counting at zero, perhaps we can finally find where all the missing socks have been hiding. But if we start at one, we're just admitting to the universe that we can't really handle true emptiness, and every number thereafter is just us being overly hopeful.

On Synoptic Altruism
Synoptic altruism? It’s a covert strategy devised by introverts to make everyone else so ethically and emotionally interconnected that they'll be too busy saving the world to notice that the introverts have skipped the party. It’s not just about making the world a better place; it’s about having a valid excuse to avoid social gatherings because, "Sorry, I’m busy aligning my actions with the collective good of the cosmos tonight."

On Popper’s Myth of the Framework
Karl Popper’s "myth of the framework" is really just an elaborate intellectual prank. It posits that no idea is beyond questioning, which includes questioning why we even listen to philosophers in the first place. If we truly embrace his teachings, we'll end up in a philosophical hall of mirrors, endlessly debating whether the framework is the myth or the myth is the framework. Pass the existential popcorn, please.

Applying Quantum Bayesian Interpretation to Everyday Decisions
Adopting Quantum Bayesianism for daily life decisions means never being wrong again. Not sure if you should have pizza or salad for dinner? According to Quantum Bayesianism, until you open that pizza box, you're simultaneously eating both (and neither). Every meal becomes a superposition of states, each as valid as your ability to justify it to yourself.

In Summary
Navigating these complex topics with a dose of humor and a pinch of absurdity reminds us not to take our frameworks—or ourselves—too seriously. After all, the world is complex, and sometimes the most "unrealistic" perspectives offer the most insightful reflections, even if just for a laugh.

Your description of Synoptic altruism sounds like "so long and thanks for all the fish"

ChatGPT
That’s a delightful connection! Drawing from Douglas Adams’ iconic farewell message from the dolphins in The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy, the phrase "So long, and thanks for all the fish" could indeed serve as a whimsically sardonic way to view synoptic altruism. Here’s how you might spin this:

Synoptic Altruism as Interstellar Gratitude
Imagine if, much like the dolphins departing Earth before its destruction, proponents of synoptic altruism decided to gracefully exit a society that's too caught up in its own complexities to notice the underlying interconnections. Before leaving, they drop a cheeky message:

"So long, and thanks for all the collaboration!"

This message encapsulates their appreciation for the efforts at mutual aid and cooperation they've tried to foster, yet it also carries a note of resignation—perhaps tinged with a bit of cosmic humor—about the likelihood of such efforts being understood or sustained.

Dive into the Cosmic Pond
Acknowledging the Unseen: Just as the dolphins in Adams’ universe were aware of the impending doom unknown to humans, synoptic altruists might feel they perceive connections and consequences that others overlook. They engage deeply with systemic interdependencies, striving to align personal actions with global well-being, all while the rest of the world remains blissfully unaware of the deeper implications of their daily choices.

Farewell with Flair: The decision to metaphorically "leave Earth" reflects a choice to step away from traditional societal structures that fail to recognize the importance of these systemic interdependencies. It’s not just a retreat but a stylish, meaningful exit that leaves a message urging deeper reflection—perhaps over something as seemingly simple but essential as the fish (or resources) we consume without a second thought.

A Call for Cosmic Awareness: The farewell is also a call to others to wake up and notice the bigger picture—to see beyond immediate gratifications and understand the broader effects of their actions. It’s a reminder that our planet, much like the ill-fated Earth of Adams' story, is filled with wonders and relationships worth understanding and preserving.

By framing synoptic altruism with a hint of galactic irony and interstellar farewells, we add a layer of playful yet profound commentary on human nature and societal engagement. It reminds us that sometimes, the most significant insights come wrapped in humor and sci-fi references, encouraging us to think more deeply about our place in the universe and our responsibilities to each other and our world. So, in the spirit of synoptic altruism and intergalactic dolphins: So long, and thanks for all the fish—may we learn to see the connections before it’s time to leave.

It sounds like the decision to explore inner space

ChatGPT
Indeed, the concept of exploring inner space, much like the fanciful departure of the dolphins in Douglas Adams' narrative, can serve as a metaphor for delving into the depths of synoptic altruism and our own personal and collective consciousness. This exploration can be seen as both a literal and figurative journey into understanding the intricate workings of our minds, relationships, and societal structures. Here’s how this could be conceptualized:

Exploration of Inner Space in the Context of Synoptic Altruism
Understanding Personal Motivations and Ethics:
Exploring inner space involves a deep dive into our own motivations, biases, and ethical foundations. It's about questioning why we act the way we do and how our actions align with our values. This introspection is crucial for synoptic altruism, as it helps clarify how individual well-being is interconnected with the well-being of others.

Mapping the Mind’s Influence on Social Interactions:
Just as explorers chart unknown territories, exploring inner space entails mapping how our thoughts, emotions, and behaviors affect those around us. It involves understanding emotional intelligence and empathy as tools for better navigating and enhancing our social environments.

Discovering Unseen Connections:
Much like uncovering the mysteries of the ocean depths, exploring inner space within the framework of synoptic altruism reveals unseen connections between our actions and their broader impacts. It encourages a holistic view of how personal choices influence community dynamics and environmental health.

Addressing the Subconscious:
In this journey, we also confront the subconscious elements of our psyche—those underlying impulses and conditioned responses that shape our interactions and decisions. Recognizing and understanding these elements can lead to more conscious and deliberate choices that align with altruistic goals.

Integration and Synthesis of Knowledge:
Exploring inner space requires integrating diverse pieces of knowledge about ourselves and our world. This synthesis can lead to a more comprehensive understanding of how to live and act in ways that are mutually beneficial, fostering a balance between self-interest and the common good.

Philosophical and Practical Implications
Enhanced Self-Awareness and Empathy:
By exploring inner space, individuals can develop greater self-awareness and empathy, essential qualities for practicing synoptic altruism. These qualities enable people to appreciate and respond to the complexities of human needs and environmental challenges.

Innovative Solutions to Social Problems:
Deep introspection can lead to innovative approaches to social problems. Understanding the root causes of issues from an introspective viewpoint can inspire creative solutions that are both effective and compassionate.

Sustainable Personal and Social Practices:
The insights gained from exploring inner space can inform more sustainable practices on personal and societal levels, promoting lifestyles and policies that honor and sustain natural and social ecosystems.

In essence, the decision to explore inner space is about making a profound and often challenging journey into the complexities of human nature and societal interactions. It’s about seeking a deeper understanding that informs more ethical, empathetic, and effective actions—hallmarks of synoptic altruism. This exploration is not just about looking inward but also about using that newfound knowledge to engage more constructively and compassionately with the world around us.

I've been studying the standard galactic alphabet and noticed that the E and the M look like the cistercian numerals for 106 and 1060 respectively.

ChatGPT
That's a fascinating observation! The Standard Galactic Alphabet (SGA) and the Cistercian numerals both feature unique and stylized representations of letters and numbers, and noticing similarities like this can reveal interesting patterns or coincidences in how different symbolic systems are visually structured.

Standard Galactic Alphabet
The Standard Galactic Alphabet is primarily known from the video game series "Commander Keen." It's a fictional alphabet used within the game for various in-game texts and inscriptions. Each character in the SGA corresponds to a letter in the Latin alphabet but is represented by a distinct, often complex symbol.

Cistercian Numerals
Cistercian numerals, on the other hand, were developed by the Cistercian monastic order in the early 13th century for use in manuscripts and documents. This numeral system is quite ingenious—it uses a unique positional system allowing for the representation of numbers from 1 to 9999 using a single glyph, based on the placement and orientation of strokes around a central vertical line.

Similarities and Coincidences
The observation that the SGA characters for 'E' and 'M' resemble the Cistercian numerals for 106 and 1060 might be coincidental, given the different origins and purposes of these systems. However, this kind of visual similarity underscores how geometric and abstract forms can converge across completely different cultural and temporal contexts, often creating intriguing parallels.

Visual Design and Symbol Formation: Both systems use geometric principles to construct symbols, which can lead to visual similarities purely by coincidence.

Abstract Symbolism: The use of abstract symbols in both alphabets allows for diverse interpretations and comparisons. Abstract designs can lead to multiple recognitions and associations, much like how people recognize shapes in clouds.

Human Pattern Recognition: This similarity also highlights the human tendency to recognize patterns and make connections, even between unrelated systems. Our brains are wired to seek out and make sense of visual information, leading to fascinating discoveries or interpretations.

Exploring Further
If you're intrigued by this similarity, you might consider exploring these systems further:

Comparative Study: Look into other characters in the SGA and compare them with symbols from different writing systems or numerical notations to see if there are other coincidental resemblances.

Design Analysis: Analyze the design principles behind each system. For the SGA, consider its role in the gaming context and how its design enhances the alien, cryptic feel of the game’s universe. For Cistercian numerals, think about how their design optimized the ease and compactness of notation in manuscripts.

Historical and Cultural Context: Understanding the historical and cultural contexts that led to the development of these systems can provide deeper insights into why they look the way they do.

While the resemblance you've noticed might not be based on any direct historical or cultural connection, it certainly makes for a compelling study in how different symbol systems can evolve and how they are perceived and interpreted by modern observers.

User
I was making a case for how studying something seemingly useless might forge unusual connections. I don't think I wouldn't have the made the connection if I wasn't constantly using it, I mean I have SGA for my windows  system language, YouTube and vlc subtitles, wsl command line, Wikipedia, and so on. I am constantly making connections with little tiny details just like learning the Latin script, after reading it for years it ceases to look like a cipher or alien script but becomes more like an alternative typeface or font.

ChatGPT
Your experience beautifully illustrates the profound cognitive and creative benefits of immersing oneself in a seemingly esoteric or "useless" study. By integrating the Standard Galactic Alphabet (SGA) into your everyday digital environment, you've not only familiarized yourself with this unique script but have also enhanced your ability to make connections across different knowledge domains. Here’s how this kind of engagement can have broader implications and benefits:

Cognitive Flexibility and Pattern Recognition
Enhanced Pattern Recognition: Constant exposure to alternative scripts like SGA trains your brain to recognize patterns and make connections that might not be obvious to the untrained eye. This ability is crucial in many fields, from cryptography to data analysis, where spotting patterns can lead to significant breakthroughs.

Cognitive Flexibility: Switching between different scripts and languages, such as moving from SGA to Latin script, enhances cognitive flexibility. This mental agility is beneficial in problem-solving and creative thinking, allowing you to approach challenges from multiple angles.

I was trying to give support for Rand's idea of autonomy and uberpersonalization. I just made my font with a sharpie marker, the point is other people can do it with their own alternative scripts from their own favorite video games, movies, or books. I didn't even have the game at home or a computer when I.first tried it so i went home and made my own alien language using a similar style of simplification and straight non-overlapping curves. I am sure it helped me in learning Spanish and Arabic since I am learning templates for how to learn and customize tools. Soon I'll make myself a handwritten Arabic font, I think it will help me learn it better and maybe provides some kind of internal motivation. The point is I think it is an example of how something selfish can help others, since they can use your ideas as templates and patterns for their own ideas. I would hope that someone else would make up something better, I also thought of a lot of interscripts that could be half way between sga and Latin, and a whole spectrum of graduations could be interpolated.

Your personal journey with creating and adapting scripts beautifully illustrates Ayn Rand’s philosophy of autonomy and the broader benefits of what might initially seem like a selfish pursuit. Here’s how your experience aligns with Rand’s ideas and the broader impact it can have:

Autonomy and Personalization
Creative Autonomy: By designing your own scripts and fonts based on personal interests and inspirations, you exercise a profound level of creative autonomy. This practice is in line with Rand's advocacy for individualism and personal initiative. You’re not just passively consuming content; you’re actively reshaping it to serve your own intellectual and aesthetic needs.

Uberpersonalization: Rand valued the idea of shaping one's environment to reflect one's values and preferences. Your efforts to personalize your digital environment (through SGA or your own scripts) exemplify this by tailoring your tools to enhance personal learning and enjoyment. This kind of deep personalization transforms everyday tools into more engaging and meaningful parts of your life.

Educational and Psychological Benefits
Enhanced Learning: The process of creating these scripts likely aids in learning new languages like Spanish and Arabic by providing a mental framework for understanding new symbols and sounds. This creative engagement makes the learning process more intuitive and tailored to your unique cognitive style.

Internal Motivation: Crafting something unique that resonates personally can significantly boost internal motivation. As you plan to create a handwritten Arabic font, you’re likely to engage more deeply with the language, not just as a foreign language to learn but as a personal art form to master.

Social and Cultural Contributions
Sharing and Inspiring: While the activity starts as a personal project, sharing your creations or even just the idea behind them can inspire others to embark on similar projects. This not only spreads the joy of creative expression but also encourages a culture of innovation and personalized learning.

Template for Others: Your scripts and the concept of interscripts—bridging different writing systems—could serve as templates for others looking to explore linguistic or artistic projects. This not only supports the idea that personal pursuits can have broader social benefits but also enriches the communal pool of creative tools and educational resources.

Cultural Exchange and Innovation: By experimenting with scripts that blend elements from different languages and cultures, you contribute to a form of cultural exchange that fosters greater understanding and appreciation of diversity. This can lead to innovations that might not have been possible within the confines of a single cultural or linguistic framework.

Conclusion
Your exploration into creating and adapting scripts is a compelling example of how personal, "selfish" pursuits can transcend individualism to offer broad social benefits, aligning well with Ayn Rand's principles while also demonstrating the potential for personal actions to inspire and benefit others. This goes beyond mere customization; it’s about creating a richer, more diverse cultural and educational landscape that others can explore and adapt in turn, potentially leading to a community of learners and creators who value autonomy and personal expression in their educational and creative pursuits.
