Summarize: AlphaCode 2 Technical Report 
AlphaCode Team, Google DeepMind 
AlphaCode (Li et al., 2022) was the i rst AI system to perform at the level of the median competitor 
in competitive programming, a dif i cult reasoning task involving advanced maths, logic and computer 
science. This paper introduces AlphaCode 2, a new and enhanced system with massively improved 
performance, powered by Gemini (Gemini Team, Google, 2023). AlphaCode 2 relies on the combination 
of powerful language models and a bespoke search and reranking mechanism. When evaluated on the 
same platform as the original AlphaCode, we found that AlphaCode 2 solved 1.7��more problems, and 
performed better than 85% of competition participants. 
Introduction 
Competitive programming is one of the ultimate litmus tests of coding skills. Participants are given 
limited time to write code to solve complex problems that require critical thinking, logic, and 
understanding of algorithms, coding and natural language. As such, it is a great benchmark for 
advanced reasoning and problem solving abilities. 
AlphaCode (Li et al., 2022) was the i rst AI system to reach a competitive level on this task. Its 
successor, AlphaCode 2, leverages several Gemini-based (Gemini Team, Google, 2023) models as 
part of a massively improved system. When evaluated on the Codeforces platform ��� a mainstay of 
competitive programming ��� AlphaCode 2 solves 43% of problems within 10 attempts, close to twice 
as many problems as the original AlphaCode (25%). While its predecessor performed at the level of 
the median competitor, we estimate that AlphaCode 2 reaches the 85thpercentile on average. 
Adopting Gemini as the foundation model for all components of AlphaCode 2 was key to achieving 
this level of performance. AlphaCode 2���s success underlines Gemini���s l exibility and adaptability, 
as we were able to i ne-tune it and optimize performance for several dif f erent tasks including code 
generation and code reranking. 
Overall System 
AlphaCode 2 relies on powerful Large Language Models, combined with an advanced search and 
reranking mechanism tailored for competitive programming. As detailed in Figure 1, its main 
components include: 
��� A family of policy models which generate code samples for each problem; 
���A sampling mechanism that encourages generating a wide diversity of code samples to search 
over the space of possible programs; 
���A i ltering mechanism to remove code samples that do not comply with the problem description; 
���A clustering algorithm that groups semantically similar code samples, allowing us to avoid 
redundancies; 
���A scoring model which we use to surface the best candidate out of each of the 10 biggest code 
samples clusters.

The AlphaCode 2 Technical Report by the AlphaCode Team at Google DeepMind presents an advanced AI system, AlphaCode 2, which significantly outperforms its predecessor in competitive programming���a task requiring deep understanding of mathematics, logic, and computer science. AlphaCode 2 integrates powerful language models and a specialized search and reranking mechanism, and is powered by Gemini, a technology developed by Google's Gemini Team in 2023.
In competitive programming, participants solve complex problems under time constraints, testing their coding, algorithmic, and problem-solving skills. The original AlphaCode was the first AI to reach a competitive level in this field. AlphaCode 2, leveraging Gemini-based models, demonstrates a remarkable improvement: it solves 43% of problems on the Codeforces platform within 10 attempts, which is nearly double the rate of the original AlphaCode (25%). This performance places AlphaCode 2 in the 85th percentile among competition participants, a significant leap from the median-level performance of its predecessor.
The system comprises various components: policy models generating code samples, a sampling mechanism for diverse code generation, a filter to align code with problem requirements, a clustering algorithm for semantic grouping of code samples to reduce redundancies, and a scoring model to identify the best candidate from the largest code sample clusters. This comprehensive approach underlines Gemini's adaptability and effectiveness in fine-tuning and optimizing performance across different tasks such as code generation and reranking.

Discussion and Conclusion 
Competitive programming is very dif f erent from other coding tasks, which usually follow the imper- 
ative paradigm: the user specif i es clear instructions and the model outputs the required code. In 
contrast, competitive programming problems are open-ended. To solve them, before writing the code 
implementation one needs to understand, analyze and reason about the problem, which involves 
advanced mathematics and computer science notions. 
This explains why generally-available AI systems perform poorly on this benchmark. AlphaCode 2���s 
success on competitive programming contests represents an impressive step change in performance 
on this extremely hard reasoning task. 
Adopting Gemini Pro as our foundation model led to signif i cant increases in performance on 
two critical components of the system: the policy models generating the code samples, and the 
scoring model used to select the best of them. The fact that we were able to i ne-tune Gemini to high 
performance for these two very dif f erent tasks speaks to its incredible l exibility. We suspect using 
Gemini Ultra as the foundation model instead, with its improved coding and reasoning capabilities, 
would lead to further improvements in the overall AlphaCode 2 approach. 
Despite AlphaCode 2���s impressive results, a lot more remains to be done before we see systems 
that can reliably reach the performance of the best human coders. Our system requires a lot of trial 
and error, and remains too costly to operate at scale. Further, it relies heavily on being able to i lter 
out obviously bad code samples. 4

90th percentile! We hope this kind of interactive coding will be the future of programming, where 
programmers make use of highly-capable AI models as collaborative tools that can help them reason 
about the problems, propose code designs, and assist with implementation. We are working towards 
bringing AlphaCode 2���s unique capabilities to our foundation Gemini models as a i rst step to make

In the "Discussion and Conclusion" section of the AlphaCode 2 Technical Report, the team reflects on the unique challenges of competitive programming and the significant advancements made by AlphaCode 2. Competitive programming differs markedly from standard coding tasks. It requires not just following imperative instructions but also deep analysis, reasoning, and understanding of complex problems involving advanced mathematics and computer science. This complexity explains why general AI systems typically underperform in this area.
AlphaCode 2, however, marks a substantial advancement in AI's capability to tackle these complex tasks, thanks to its use of Gemini Pro as the foundation model. This choice led to significant improvements in the policy models (which generate code samples) and the scoring model (which selects the best samples). The adaptability of Gemini Pro and the potential for even greater results with Gemini Ultra highlight the flexibility and advanced capabilities of these systems.
Despite these achievements, the team acknowledges that AlphaCode 2 still falls short of the top human coders. It requires considerable trial and error and is currently too costly for large-scale operation. The system heavily relies on filtering out poor code samples, indicating room for improvement.
A notable aspect of AlphaCode 2 is its potential for interactive use with human coders. When combined with human input for additional filtering, the system performs above the 90th percentile. This synergy suggests a future where AI models like AlphaCode 2 serve as collaborative tools for programmers, aiding in problem analysis, code design, and implementation. The team envisions integrating AlphaCode 2���s capabilities into the Gemini foundation models, paving the way for a new programming paradigm where AI and human coders work in tandem, accessible to a broader audience.

Forging philosophy
A 17th-century classic of Ethiopian philosophy might be a fake. Does it matter, or is that just how philosophy works?

In 2017, the Australasian Journal of Philosophy issued a rare retraction, informing their readers that one of their articles was not in fact written by a cat. The short article, a critique of David Lewis���s ���Veridical Hallucination and Prosthetic Vision���, was published in 1981 under the name of ���Bruce Le Catt���, a figure with no discernible institutional affiliation or track record of publishing, but who appears to have been familiar with Lewis���s work. As indeed he might have been, being the beloved pet of the great American philosopher.

It may not have come as a surprise to those familiar with Lewis���s work that ���Bruce Le Catt��� was not the pseudonym of an astute critic, but of Lewis himself. The playfulness of Lewis���s writing is well known: for instance, the paper ���Holes��� (1970), co-written with Stephanie Lewis, is a dialogue between two characters, ���Argle��� and ���Bargle���, on the ontological status of holes as found in Gruy��re, crackers, paper-towel rollers and in matter more generally. Nevertheless, the attribution of the 1981 paper to a cat seemed to cross a line. It may have been playful, but it was also deceptive, hence the retraction.

Lewis was not the only 20th-century philosopher to publish using an invented persona. The contents page of the book Explaining Emotions (1980), edited by Am��lie Oksenberg Rorty, features the essay ���Jealousy, Attention, and Loss��� by one Leila Tov-Ruach, listed on the Contributors page as ���an Israeli psychiatrist, who writes and lectures on philosophic psychology���. Some readers might have noticed that this is a rather unusual name ��� a pun on laila tov ruach or ���goodnight wind��� in Hebrew ��� and might have had their suspicions confirmed by the fact that there is no discernible trace of this psychiatrist elsewhere on the medical or academic record. Indeed, as an erratum on the University of California Press website drily notes, Am��lie Oksenberg Rorty and Leila Tov-Ruach are indeed one and the same person.

The case of Tov-Ruach is somewhat different to Bruce Le Catt. Rather than playfully externalising the critique of the originating philosopher���s own arguments, Tov-Ruach���s paper is included side by side with Rorty���s own contributions to a volume that she herself edited. The two write on different topics and have their own biographical entries in the volume but are not in opposition. It is certainly a more elaborate and less obviously tongue-in-cheek intervention than Lewis���s use of Bruce Le Catt as an antagonist.

What are the ethics of this kind of pseudonymous publication? When they realised what had happened, the Australasian Journal of Philosophy and the University of California Press evidently felt it necessary, as a matter of academic ethics, to issue a clarification on the identity of the true authors. They were prompted to do so by the unflagging work of Michael Dougherty, the Sister Ruth Caspar Chair in Philosophy at Ohio Dominican University, who has spent years unmasking cases of misattribution, and downright plagiarism along with murkier, quirkier cases like these. For Dougherty, such cases are primarily about disciplinary morality, amounting to a wilful obstruction of the scholarly endeavour. On the Rorty/Tov-Ruach case, he writes:

It���s odd to have a dialogue with yourself under two names in the published literature. I have no idea why she is doing this. Dr Rorty is a distinguished philosopher, and the use of pseudonyms can impede a genuine history of philosophy.
It is the implied question in Dougherty���s statement that interests me: why is she doing it? Why would any philosopher write under somebody else���s name, pretend to be someone that they are not? If plagiarism is the intellectual sin of taking credit for someone else���s ideas, what are we to think of its opposite: pinning one���s own ideas on somebody else who doesn���t even exist?

While it might seem odd in the world of contemporary journal publication, smuggling ideas under someone else���s name is rather more common in the history of philosophy than you might think. Medieval philosophy in particular abounds with texts that blur the boundaries between anonymity, pseudonymity and straightforward authorship. Consider the various ���pseudos-��� ��� from pseudo-Augustine, pseudo-Aristotle, pseudo-Dionysius the Areopagite ��� that proliferated in the late antique and medieval periods. Many of the medieval scholars used this kind of device to invoke the authority of an older figure for their ideas; humble monks who wrote (if writing under any name at all) under the names of the mighty dead to gain intellectual clout and authority.

Indeed, in a slightly different form, this practice has far deeper roots. Any philosophical dialogue using the names of real figures does something similar: is Plato���s Socrates the ���real��� Socrates, or a mouthpiece for Plato���s own views, or somewhere in between? Was Plato���s Protagoras the ���real��� Protagoras, or just a foil for Plato���s own ideas? And, if the latter, is there really anything wrong with this?

And what about when the name under which a philosopher writes does not refer to a real individual? S��ren Kierkegaard wrote under a great many names: Johannes Climacus, Constantin Constantius, Victorin Victorius Victor, Johannes de Silentio are a few of them, none of whom is anything but the creative imagining of Kierkegaard himself. In fact, it is perhaps more proper to call these personages ���heteronyms���, as developed later in the works of Fernando Pessoa, in which the different names are not simply alternative labels for an identical author hiding behind the label, but denote fully conceived individuals, each with their own personality, appearance and distinctive literary style. Pessoa himself conjured more than 60 such persons, in addition to two ���semi-heteronyms��� that constituted a ���mere mutilation��� of his own personal style, and finally the single ���orthonym��� that referred to the origin points of all of these names: Pessoa himself.

This thinker, who does not exist, nevertheless takes up a particular perspective on the world

Rorty���s use of an alias is in many ways easier to understand, mainly because she tells us precisely why she wrote under a name that was not her own. Indeed, Leila Tov-Ruach was not her only pseudonym. In addition to an Israeli psychiatrist, Rorty also tried her hand at writing as a Chinese Platonist and, in her edited collection Philosophers on Education (1998), she explains why she chose to write her article on ���Plato���s Counsel on Education��� under the name of Zhang LoShan:

Ever since teaching a course in the history of philosophy in the People���s Republic of China in 1981, and finding students and colleagues there passionately interested in Plato, I had been trying to see him through their eyes, with their preoccupations ��� Although I wrote that essay, it is, in a perfectly straightforward way, not strictly speaking mine ��� It is an experiment I strongly recommend to all serious scholars: surprising features emerge from the exercise.
The aim of writing under the name of this nonexistent philosopher was, in Rorty���s words, ���intellectual empathy���, understood as the attempt to enter into the mind of another thinker, a kind of exercise. This thinker, who does not exist, nevertheless takes up a particular perspective on the world, a perspective that rests on a different set of assumptions and preoccupations from the author���s. When the pseudonymous author imaginatively occupies such a perspective through the processes of intellectual empathy, they might thereby see things differently (as might readers).

Today, some people might object to the case of Rorty-as-Zhang-LoShan on grounds of cultural appropriation, and perhaps Rorty would admit that this is precisely the point: to appropriate a perspective that is not one���s own, that is not anybody���s at all (though, for her, presumably that wouldn���t have the negative connotations of ���cultural appropriation���). And perhaps this is why she ��� and Kierkegaard and Pessoa, but not Plato or pseudo-Augustine ��� chose names of thinkers who never existed: so as to have the freedom not only to appropriate an existing perspective, but also to create and inhabit one anew.

But none of these examples, from philosophical felines to pseudo-Augustine or imaginary Chinese Platonists, is quite as perplexing as that of the ���at��ta Zera Yacob. The ���at��ta, or ���enquiry��� (the root of which, ���-���-���, in the ancient Ethiopian language of Ge��ez literally means ���to investigate, examine, search��� ) is an unusual work of philosophy for a number of reasons. It is not only a philosophical treatise but also an autobiography, a religious meditation and a witness of the religious wars that plagued Ethiopia in the early 17th century; it presents a theodicy and cosmological argument apparently independent of other traditions of Christian thought; it employs a subtle philosophical vocabulary that is virtually without precursors. Finally, and most perplexingly, the progenitor of these ideas, the Zera Yacob who is the subject of the autobiography and gives his name to the title, may never have existed.

Why might we think this? The text is composed in the voice of one Zera Yacob, a man born to poor parents in ���the lands of the priests of Aksum��� in northern Ethiopia around the turn of the 17th century. Driven from his hometown by religious conflict between Orthodox ���kopt��� and Catholic ���ferenj���, our eponymous narrator Zera Yacob flees to the hills and finds a cave in which he ���meditated all day on humanity���s quarrels and wickedness, and also on the wisdom of the Lord their creator, who keeps silent when they act wickedly in his name, persecute their neighbours, and kill their own brothers and sisters.��� The basic problem of his philosophy is how to understand how God allowed this violent conflict to take place ��� a version of the classic problem of evil ��� and further to understand what, if anything, is true in religion.

The article by Jonathan Egid delves into the intriguing subject of pseudonymous authorship in philosophy, particularly focusing on a 17th-century Ethiopian philosophical classic, the ���at��ta Zera Yacob, which might be a forgery. This issue raises fundamental questions about the nature of philosophical work and authorship.
The practice of writing under pseudonyms or inventing personas has a rich history in philosophy, as illustrated by several examples:
David Lewis and 'Bruce Le Catt'
: Lewis published a paper under the pseudonym 'Bruce Le Catt', which was later retracted due to its deceptive nature. This playful yet deceptive act demonstrates the thin line between creativity and academic integrity in philosophical writing.
Am��lie Oksenberg Rorty and 'Leila Tov-Ruach'
: Rorty wrote under the pseudonym 'Leila Tov-Ruach', alongside her own contributions in a volume she edited. Unlike Lewis���s case, Rorty���s pseudonym was not an antagonist but a separate entity, creating a more elaborate and less obvious intervention.
S��ren Kierkegaard and Fernando Pessoa
: Both used multiple pseudonyms or ���heteronyms��� to express different perspectives and ideas, blurring the lines between the author���s identity and the content of their work.
The article explores the ethics of pseudonymous publication, citing the concerns of Michael Dougherty, a philosophy professor who has uncovered various cases of misattribution and plagiarism. Dougherty views such pseudonymous works as obstructions to scholarly endeavor and a distortion of the genuine history of philosophy.
However, the use of pseudonyms in philosophy is not just a matter of deception or play. In some cases, it serves as a tool for intellectual empathy, enabling philosophers to explore and present ideas from perspectives vastly different from their own. This approach can lead to new insights and understandings in philosophy, as seen in Rorty���s experiment of writing under a different cultural perspective.
The case of the ���at��ta Zera Yacob is particularly fascinating. Composed in the voice of Zera Yacob, a character who may not have existed, it combines philosophical treatise, autobiography, religious meditation, and historical witness. The text tackles profound questions, such as the problem of evil and the nature of truth in religion, but the uncertainty about the author���s real identity adds a layer of complexity to its interpretation.
In conclusion, the use of pseudonyms or fictional personas in philosophical works, while ethically debatable, can be a powerful tool for exploring diverse perspectives and enriching philosophical discourse. It challenges our conventional understanding of authorship and creativity in philosophy, opening up new avenues for thought and debate.

What is the argument?
ChatGPT
ChatGPT
The argument presented in Jonathan Egid's article centers around the legitimacy and implications of pseudonymous authorship in philosophy. Key points of this argument include:
Historical Precedence of Pseudonymity
: The article notes that using pseudonyms or creating fictional personas has been a recurring practice in the history of philosophy. Figures like David Lewis, Am��lie Oksenberg Rorty, S��ren Kierkegaard, and Fernando Pessoa used pseudonyms or 'heteronyms' to present their philosophical ideas.
Ethical Considerations
: The practice raises ethical questions, especially concerning academic integrity. The retraction of Lewis's paper under the pseudonym 'Bruce Le Catt' highlights the potential for deception in such practices. Michael Dougherty's concerns about the distortion of philosophical history and the obstruction of scholarly work further emphasize these ethical considerations.
Intellectual Empathy and Perspective
: Despite ethical concerns, pseudonymous writing can serve a meaningful purpose. Rorty's use of pseudonyms, for instance, was an attempt at intellectual empathy, allowing her to explore and present ideas from perspectives different from her own. This suggests that pseudonymous authorship can enrich philosophical discourse by introducing diverse viewpoints and thought experiments.
Case of ���at��ta Zera Yacob
: The article specifically examines the ���at��ta Zera Yacob, an Ethiopian philosophical text that might be a forgery. The uncertainty about the real identity of the author adds complexity to its interpretation. It exemplifies how pseudonymous authorship in philosophy can blur the lines between historical authenticity and philosophical content.
The core argument is that while pseudonymous authorship in philosophy poses ethical challenges and can be seen as an obstruction to scholarly endeavors, it also offers unique opportunities for exploring philosophical ideas from varied perspectives. This practice challenges traditional notions of authorship and creativity in philosophy, inviting debate and reflection on the nature of philosophical work and authorship.

Zera Yacob poses the problem by asking how we can decide between two religions whose justifications and standards of justification are internal to their own systems of thought ��� who ���decided everything according to [their] own creed���:

Where will I find someone who will decide [on the religions and creeds] truthfully? Because [just as] my religion seems true to me, so does another���s religion seem true to them.
The problem is not only that different groups disagree, but that there seems no way to resolve these disagreements without bloodshed.

His answer is remarkable. The only thing that can decide between competing religious claims is something that every human has inside them: the god-given faculty of lebbuna (variously translated as ���reason���, ���intelligence��� and ���understanding���) that allows us to perceive what is right and wrong, good and bad by means of it being attuned to a kind of pre-established harmony between the creator, creation at large and this faculty itself. Lebbuna is common to kopt and ferenj, man and woman, young and old: truth and goodness is accessible to all, equally. And yet humans do not use it. It is onerous to apply one���s reason, and mankind is by nature lazy, preferring to be led by received wisdom.

The most strident chapters of the book follow, with Zera Yacob using the normative standards set by lebbuna to critique the religious practises and social organisation of his day. He criticises slavery for treating man like a beast; asceticism for perverting natural desires; and the practice of marriage for treating a wife as the slave of a husband.

When the civil unrest ends with the death of the emperor, he returns to society, settling in the town of Enfraz where he finds work and eventually an intellectual disciple in the form of a youth named Walda Heywat, who urges his teacher to write down his reflections before his death. He presents here a vision of the good life as living in harmony with the natural order of creation, earning his sustenance and that of his family by honest work. The historical details of the political background are all accurate, the language of the text beautiful, lyrical Ge��ez. So why think that this character, so convincingly evoked, may never have existed?

The troubled afterlife of the text begins when the work is ���discovered��� in 1852 by a lonely Capuchin monk named Giusto da Urbino in the highlands of Ethiopia. Before this date, there is no mention of the text in the historical record. The work was sent off to da Urbino���s patron back in Paris, the Irish-Basque explorer, linguist and astronomer Antoine d���Abbadie, and placed in the Ethiopian collections of the Biblioth��que Nationale de France. Over the next couple of decades, scholars flocked to consult this fascinating, seemingly unprecedented text. The ���at��ta was edited and translated into Russian and Latin, and began to gain a wider readership among European intellectuals.

Zera Yacob, in the philosophical text "���at��ta Zera Yacob," addresses a profound problem in religious philosophy: how can one decide between the truth of different religions when each religion���s justifications and standards of truth are internal to their own system? This dilemma is exacerbated by the fact that adherents of different religions are often deeply convinced of the truth of their own beliefs, making it seem impossible to resolve these disagreements without conflict.
Yacob proposes a unique solution to this problem. He argues that the faculty of lebbuna, which can be understood as reason, intelligence, or understanding, is a god-given ability inherent in every human being. This faculty enables individuals to discern right from wrong and good from bad. It is attuned to a pre-established harmony between the creator, creation, and the faculty itself. Importantly, lebbuna is universal ��� it transcends religious, gender, age, and cultural differences, making truth and goodness accessible to all equally.
Yacob uses lebbuna as a normative standard to critique various religious practices and social norms of his time. He condemns slavery, asceticism, and certain practices within marriage, advocating for a vision of the good life that aligns with the natural order of creation, characterized by honest work and sustenance for one's family.
The historical and literary aspects of the ���at��ta add to its intrigue. The text was reportedly discovered in 1852 by a Capuchin monk, Giusto da Urbino, and later gained attention among European intellectuals. However, the absence of any historical mention of the text before this discovery raises questions about its authenticity and the existence of Zera Yacob himself. This uncertainty contributes to the philosophical and historical enigma surrounding the ���at��ta, making it a subject of ongoing interest and debate in both philosophical and historical circles.

Then in 1920, an Italian Orientalist named Carlo Conti Rossini published an article in the Journal Asiatique, claiming that, far from being a masterpiece of 17th-century Ethiopian thought, the ���at��ta was in fact a forgery, composed by the man who had claimed to discover it: da Urbino. Conti Rossini had been tipped off by an Ethiopian convert to Catholicism that da Urbino had been scheming with local scholars to create ���heretical��� and ���masonic��� works to undermine Catholicism and Ethiopian orthodoxy alike. Conti Rossini now started seeing proof everywhere, adducing philological arguments and cultural speculations in equal measure to the conclusion that this book was written by an Italian in the 19th century, not an Ethiopian in the 17th.

In 1920, the authenticity of the ���at��ta Zera Yacob was significantly challenged by Carlo Conti Rossini, an Italian Orientalist. In an article published in the Journal Asiatique, Rossini claimed that the ���at��ta was not a 17th-century Ethiopian masterpiece but a forgery created by Giusto da Urbino, the very person who claimed to have discovered it.
This claim was based on information provided by an Ethiopian convert to Catholicism, who suggested that da Urbino, in collaboration with local scholars, had concocted ���heretical��� and ���masonic��� works. These works were allegedly intended to undermine both Catholicism and Ethiopian Orthodoxy. Armed with this insight, Conti Rossini began to find what he considered proof of the forgery, using a combination of philological analysis and cultural speculation. He concluded that the ���at��ta was actually written by an Italian in the 19th century, not by an Ethiopian in the 17th.
This allegation cast a significant shadow of doubt over the text and its purported author, Zera Yacob. The assertion that the ���at��ta was a contemporary fabrication rather than a historical document from the 17th century shifts its significance in the history of philosophy. This controversy contributes to the ongoing debate about the text's origin, its authorship, and its place in both Ethiopian and global philosophical discourse. Such disputes highlight the complex interplay between historical authenticity, philosophical content, and cultural context in assessing the value and meaning of philosophical works.

Conti Rossini was the pre-eminent Ethiopianist of interwar Europe, and his arguments were eventually accepted by almost all scholars, including those who had spent so long translating and commentating upon the work. But Conti Rossini was also a colonial administrator in Italian East Africa, and a supporter of Mussolini���s invasion of Ethiopia, even going so far as to publish an article in 1935 titled ���Ethiopia Is Incapable of Civil Progress���, arguing that the country could, indeed should, be colonised by a ���civilising��� power, explicitly invoking his refutation of the ���at��ta as part of his argument.

ChatGPT
Conti Rossini's role as a preeminent Ethiopianist in interwar Europe lent significant weight to his claim that the ���at��ta Zera Yacob was a forgery. His scholarly reputation and expertise in Ethiopian studies led to widespread acceptance of his arguments among the academic community, including those who had dedicated considerable effort to translating and analyzing the work.
However, the context of Conti Rossini's life and career adds a layer of complexity to his claims about the ���at��ta. As a colonial administrator in Italian East Africa and a supporter of Mussolini���s invasion of Ethiopia, his motivations and perspectives might not have been purely academic. In 1935, he published an article titled "Ethiopia Is Incapable of Civil Progress," advocating for the colonization of Ethiopia by a 'civilizing' power. In this context, his refutation of the ���at��ta was used to support his political and colonial arguments, suggesting that his assessment of the text could have been influenced by his colonialist and political views.
This intermingling of academic scholarship with colonial and political agendas raises questions about the objectivity and reliability of Conti Rossini's claims regarding the ���at��ta. It suggests that his dismissal of the text as a forgery might have been influenced by his broader ideological beliefs and political motives, rather than being based solely on scholarly evidence. This revelation complicates the narrative around the ���at��ta and its place in Ethiopian and philosophical history, illustrating how historical, cultural, and political contexts can deeply influence the interpretation and valuation of philosophical texts.

The argument has raged for more than a century now, with new arguments being made on both sides. Claude Sumner, a Jesuit missionary who called himself ���Canadian by birth, Ethiopian by choice���, made a passionate case for an Ethiopian authorship in his five-volume Ethiopian Philosophy (1974-8), building on the argument of Ethiopian scholars like Alemayyehu Moges and Amsalu Aklilu. The French historian Ana��s Wion has produced an ingenious argument against an Ethiopian authorship in her series of articles The History of a Genuine Fake Philosophical Treatise (2013), and these arguments have been taken up by scholars like Fasil Merawi and Daniel Kibret back in Addis Ababa. Finally, the late, great scholar of Ethiopian manuscripts Getatchew Haile reversed his position, held for half a century, that the work was a forgery in a paper published shortly before his death in 2021. It is no exaggeration to say that today, as interest in the ���at��ta begins to peak once again with a series of new books, podcasts and the publication of a new translation of the ���at��ta, the question of its author���s existence is in limbo.

The difference between the case of Leila Tov-Ruach and Zera Yacob is that the identity of the author of the ���at��ta really seems to matter. Many Ethiopian intellectuals are understandably proud of the work, holding it up as a masterpiece of 17th-century literature and a foundation of an alternative, specifically Ethiopian path to modernity. And they are understandably furious at the idea that the writings of a fascist intellectual might deprive one of their greatest geniuses of his rightful credit.

The debate over the authorship of the ���at��ta Zera Yacob has been ongoing for over a century, with scholars from various backgrounds presenting arguments for and against Ethiopian authorship.
Support for Ethiopian Authorship
:
Claude Sumner, a Jesuit missionary, advocated strongly for an Ethiopian origin in his work "Ethiopian Philosophy" (1974-78). He built upon the arguments of Ethiopian scholars like Alemayyehu Moges and Amsalu Aklilu.
The late scholar Getatchew Haile, initially a proponent of the forgery theory, reversed his position shortly before his death in 2021, suggesting the work was genuine.
Arguments Against Ethiopian Authorship
:
Ana��s Wion, a French historian, argued against Ethiopian authorship in her series "The History of a Genuine Fake Philosophical Treatise" (2013).
Fasil Merawi and Daniel Kibret, scholars based in Addis Ababa, have taken up Wion's arguments, supporting the idea that the ���at��ta might not be an authentic Ethiopian work.
The question of the ���at��ta's authorship holds significant cultural and intellectual importance, particularly for Ethiopian intellectuals. For many, the ���at��ta is seen as a monumental work of 17th-century literature and a crucial part of Ethiopia's path to modernity. The idea that this work might be the creation of a fascist intellectual rather than a genuine Ethiopian philosopher is a source of considerable distress and controversy. It challenges the perception of Ethiopia's intellectual history and legacy.
This controversy contrasts sharply with the case of Leila Tov-Ruach, where the pseudonymous authorship was revealed and accepted without significant cultural or historical implications. In the case of the ���at��ta, the stakes are much higher, touching on issues of national pride, cultural identity, and the integrity of historical records. The debate over its authorship reflects broader concerns about the representation and acknowledgment of non-Western intellectual traditions in the global philosophical discourse.

In Europe and the United States, philosophers keen to diversify and decolonise their curriculums have seized on Zera Yacob as evidence of an ���African Enlightenment���, as an African Descartes or Kant. As Sumner put it, the ���at��ta demonstrates that ���modern philosophy, in the sense of a personal rationalistic critical investigation, began in Ethiopia with Zera Yacob at the same time as in England and in France.��� If the work is a forgery, it seems that the ���at��ta cannot fulfil this lofty role allotted to it. The implication seems to be that, if it is not written by a 17th-century Ethiopian scholar, it is not all that interesting or important after all.

The significance of the ���at��ta Zera Yacob extends beyond the academic debate over its authorship to larger discussions about diversity and decolonization in philosophy. In Europe and the United States, philosophers eager to diversify their curriculums have highlighted Zera Yacob as a key figure in what has been termed an 'African Enlightenment'. This perspective positions Zera Yacob as an African counterpart to European Enlightenment thinkers like Descartes or Kant.
Claude Sumner emphasized the importance of the ���at��ta in demonstrating that a form of modern philosophy, characterized by personal, rationalistic, and critical investigation, emerged in Ethiopia contemporaneously with similar developments in England and France. This interpretation situates the ���at��ta as a groundbreaking work in global philosophical history, challenging Eurocentric narratives that often dominate the field.
However, if the ���at��ta is proven to be a forgery, it raises concerns about its ability to serve as a symbol of African intellectual history and philosophical contribution. The implication is that if the text is not genuinely a product of a 17th-century Ethiopian scholar, it might lose its perceived significance and relevance in the context of a diverse and decolonized philosophical curriculum. This perception underscores the often contentious and complex nature of integrating non-Western philosophical works into mainstream philosophical discourse, particularly when questions of authenticity and origin are unresolved. The case of the ���at��ta thus reflects broader challenges in acknowledging and appreciating the full scope and diversity of philosophical thought across different cultures and historical periods.

So it seems that we do very much care who wrote it. But should we? The assumption on the side of both the proponents and opponents of authenticity is that either the work is totally genuine, in which case it can be used to diversify and decolonise, or else it is totally fake, a ���mere forgery��� and of little interest, other than perhaps as a case of late-colonial cultural appropriation (or immersion, if one prefers).

But what is a ���mere forgery��� anyway? If you forge a passport, you are creating a fake document that permits you to cross borders as if it were real. If you forge a work of art, you are creating a convincing (and therefore lucrative) fake that can be attributed to a known artist and sold as if it were genuine. But what might the forging of a work of philosophy be, beyond attributing the work to someone else, �� la pseudo-Augustine or pseudo-Aristotle? If faking a painting gets you something and faking a passport gets you somewhere, what does a fake work of philosophy get you?

Presumably, what we care about most in a philosophical text are its arguments, its attempts to get at the truth and its means of getting there. If the argument is what interests us, then should the authorship matter, given that the argument is exactly the same, regardless who wrote it? Of course, historical context is important, both for understanding how the text might have come to be and what the text means. But unless this exploring of context is employed in the service of understanding and elucidating the arguments, we are treating the work as a historical curiosity rather than a source of insight. In the case of the ���at��ta Zera Yacob, this would be a mistake, for the arguments are powerful and abidingly relevant. These arguments ��� about the causes of human suffering and conflict, the epistemology of disagreement and the twin temptations of relativism and blind absolutism, the relation between the world and our cognitive faculties ��� are precisely what tends to fall out when the discussion of the ���at��ta focuses exclusively on the topic of authenticity.

The debate over the authorship of the ���at��ta Zera Yacob raises important questions about what truly matters in philosophical texts: the identity of the author or the content and arguments presented within the work.
The Value of Authorship
:
The authorship of the ���at��ta is crucial for those looking to diversify and decolonize philosophical curriculums. If genuinely Ethiopian and from the 17th century, it stands as a testament to an African Enlightenment, challenging Eurocentric views of philosophy.
If it's a forgery, it risks being dismissed as merely a product of late-colonial cultural appropriation, thus losing its value as a genuine contribution to diverse philosophical thought.
Understanding 'Forgery' in Philosophy
:
Unlike forging a passport or a work of art, which have clear tangible benefits, the forgery of a philosophical work raises different questions. It's not about material gain but about attributing ideas to a particular author or tradition, akin to the cases of pseudo-Augustine or pseudo-Aristotle.
Primacy of Philosophical Argument
:
The crux of philosophical value lies in the arguments, insights, and truths that a work presents. If the ideas and arguments in a philosophical text hold intrinsic value, should the identity of the author drastically change our assessment of these ideas?
Historical context enriches understanding and interpretation but focusing solely on authenticity might reduce a text to a historical artifact rather than a source of philosophical wisdom.
Arguments in the ���at��ta Zera Yacob
:
The ���at��ta presents powerful and relevant arguments addressing human suffering, disagreement, relativism, absolutism, and the relationship between the world and our cognitive faculties.
By focusing only on the authorship and not on these arguments, one risks overlooking the potential philosophical insights the text offers, regardless of its origin.
In essence, while the historical and cultural significance of the ���at��ta's authorship is undeniable, especially in the context of diversifying philosophical discourse, the arguments and philosophical content of the work itself hold inherent value. The debate over authenticity, though important, should not overshadow the exploration and engagement with the philosophical ideas presented in the text. This perspective invites a broader and more inclusive approach to philosophical inquiry, one that values ideas and arguments irrespective of their historical origins.

We might conclude by offering a different sense of philosophical forgery, one less concerned with the cultural politics of a particular text than the words it leaves on the page. Forging in this sense might have more to do with the work of the blacksmith than of the counterfeiter. Rather than forging as deception, we might think of forgery as creation, namely as the creation of new words and, with it, new ideas. Consider that whoever wrote the ���at��ta did so in a language, namely Ge��ez, that previously quite literally did not have the words for expressing its most central ideas. Whoever wrote the ���at��ta forged a philosophical-conceptual vocabulary.
ChatGPT
ChatGPT
The conclusion presented in the article offers a compelling reinterpretation of the concept of "forgery" in philosophy, moving away from its usual association with deception and instead framing it as a form of creative, constructive activity ��� akin to the work of a blacksmith.
Forging as Creation
:
The act of philosophical forgery is reimagined not as an act of deceit but as an act of creation, involving the crafting of new words and ideas. This perspective shifts the focus from the authenticity of authorship to the originality and value of the philosophical content.
Philosophical-Conceptual Vocabulary in the ���at��ta
:
The writer of the ���at��ta, regardless of their true identity, contributed significantly to philosophical discourse by creating a new vocabulary in Ge��ez. This language previously lacked the words necessary to express the text's central ideas.
This process of "forging" a new philosophical language is an act of intellectual creativity and innovation, expanding the capacity of the language to articulate complex philosophical concepts.
Cultural and Philosophical Impact
:
The creation of a new philosophical-conceptual vocabulary in a language like Ge��ez has profound implications. It not only enriches the language itself but also provides a medium through which unique philosophical ideas can be expressed and explored.
This act of forging new philosophical terms and concepts is a significant contribution to the broader field of philosophy, demonstrating the dynamic and evolving nature of philosophical thought and language.
In essence, this view of philosophical forgery emphasizes the creative and constructive aspects of philosophical writing. It celebrates the generation of new ideas and the expansion of linguistic and conceptual boundaries, highlighting the transformative power of philosophy in shaping thought and language. This perspective allows for a more inclusive and dynamic understanding of philosophical contributions, beyond the traditional focus on authorship and authenticity.

This process of linguistic innovation, of coining new terms and adapting existing words to new meanings is by no means unique to Ge��ez. It is more than 20 centuries since Cicero attempted to ���teach philosophy to speak Latin���, not only by importing originally Greek words into Latin (dialectica, politica), but by teaching philosophy new terms (moralia, naturalis) from his native language. In a way, it takes place every time philosophy learns to ���speak��� in a new language, including our own: we owe a great many words, both arcane (���quiddity���, ���apperception���) and commonplace (���politics���, ���nature��� and ���self���) to the translation of philosophy into English in the 16th and 17th centuries. But rarely has it happened so suddenly, in such a concentrated way in a single text. This is impressive enough if its author is a 17th-century Ethiopian named Zera Yacob. If it���s the work of a 19th-century forger, it is an utterly astounding work of linguistic and cultural immersion.

Ultimately, the words on the page should be more philosophically interesting than the identity of the person who wrote them, and therefore the ���at��ta (and, by extension, other such contested texts) should be judged on the philosophical quality and linguistic innovations, not on the name at the top of the page. There is a sense in which the identity of an author matters. Rorty wrote Tov-Ruach and Zhang LoShan into existence, and in doing so created two distinct philosophical voices, just as Kierkegaard conjured countless original perspectives. Plato wrote the perspectives of Glaucon, Protagoras and Thrasymachus in a way that may or may not have corresponded to their real views. Zera Yacob may be one such voice that is an unknowable mix of real historical individual and literary creation. But, then again, so is Socrates.

The process of linguistic innovation in philosophy, as described in the article, highlights how the development of philosophical thought often goes hand-in-hand with the creation and adaptation of language. This phenomenon is not exclusive to Ge��ez or the ���at��ta but is a recurring theme in the history of philosophy:
Linguistic Innovation in Philosophy
:
Throughout history, philosophers have often had to create new terms or adapt existing ones to express novel concepts. Cicero's efforts to 'teach philosophy to speak Latin' involved both importing Greek words and coining new Latin terms to convey philosophical ideas.
The translation of philosophical works into English during the 16th and 17th centuries introduced many new words and concepts, both specialized and commonplace, into the language.
The Case of the ���at��ta
:
The linguistic innovation in the ���at��ta, whether authored by a 17th-century Ethiopian philosopher or a 19th-century forger, represents a remarkable instance of this process. It involves a sudden and concentrated development of philosophical vocabulary in a single text, which is a noteworthy achievement in itself.
Philosophical Significance Beyond Authorship
:
The article argues that the philosophical quality and linguistic innovations of a text like the ���at��ta should be the primary focus, rather than the identity of its author. This perspective values the content and contribution of the work over the name attached to it.
Philosophical voices, whether historical or fictional, contribute to the richness and diversity of philosophical discourse. The article cites examples like Rorty's pseudonymous works, Plato's dialogues, and Kierkegaard's heteronyms as instances where the creation of distinct philosophical voices adds depth and variety to philosophical thought.
Authorship and Literary Creation
:
The identity of an author can be a blend of historical reality and literary creation. The article suggests that figures like Socrates, as portrayed in Plato's works, might represent such a blend, similar to what might be the case with Zera Yacob.
In summary, the article emphasizes the importance of linguistic and conceptual innovation in philosophy and advocates for evaluating philosophical texts based on their ideas and contributions, rather than focusing solely on the identity of their authors. This approach allows for a more inclusive and nuanced understanding of philosophical works, recognizing the value of both historical figures and literary creations in enriching philosophical discourse.

So it does make a difference who wrote it and when. There are a few suspicious details in the Hattata, for example a lot of it looks word for word like enlightenment thinking of the renaissance, it looks a lot like Locke, Hume, and Descartes. If it was from Ethiopia then it would seem that the enlightenment ideals had originated from there or where somehow convergently emerged, of course the explanation for his ideas in the narrative was that he was stuck inside a cave with nothing to read but the psalms.
ChatGPT
ChatGPT
The question of authorship and the time of writing indeed matters in the case of the ���at��ta Zera Yacob, especially considering the parallels between its content and Enlightenment thinking. The similarities to the works of Locke, Hume, and Descartes raise intriguing questions about the origins and development of Enlightenment ideals:
Convergence or Influence
:
If the ���at��ta was genuinely written by Zera Yacob in the 17th century in Ethiopia, it suggests either a remarkable case of convergent intellectual evolution, where similar ideas about reason, human nature, and society developed independently in Ethiopia and Europe, or an underrecognized influence of Ethiopian thought on European Enlightenment.
Narrative Explanation
:
The narrative that Zera Yacob, confined to a cave with only the Psalms to read, developed these ideas independently adds to the allure of the text. It presents a scenario of isolated intellectual development, which, if true, would be a significant historical revelation.
Implications of Authorship
:
If the ���at��ta is a later forgery, mirroring European Enlightenment thought, it might be seen as an intellectual exercise in creating a parallel philosophical narrative in an Ethiopian context. This would be fascinating in its own right, as an instance of cultural and philosophical immersion, but it would not necessarily contribute to a reevaluation of the origins of Enlightenment ideas.
Historical and Cultural Context
:
Understanding the true historical and cultural context of the ���at��ta is crucial. It affects how the work is interpreted, its place in global intellectual history, and the narrative of how Enlightenment ideals developed and spread.
In conclusion, while the philosophical content of the ���at��ta holds intrinsic value regardless of its authorship, uncovering the true origin of the text is important for fully appreciating its historical significance and understanding its place in the broader narrative of philosophical development. The question of whether its ideas emerged independently in Ethiopia or were influenced by, or even contributed to, European Enlightenment thinking remains a captivating aspect of its study.

Here is some of my "research": Zera Yacob was an Ethiopian philosopher from the 17th century who is known for his philosophy of Cyclofabianism, which centers around the principle of harmony.

He believed that the morality of an action is determined by whether it promotes or hinders overall harmony in the world.

He rejected traditional religious beliefs, instead seeking truth by observing the natural world.

Yacob proposed a cosmological argument for the existence of God, stating that all things must have a first cause.

He believed that the concept of God is knowable, but that it does not depend on human intellect.

He also wrote a treatise called Hatata, which has been compared to Ren�� Descartes' Discours de la m��thode.

* * *

Zera Yacob was an Ethiopian philosopher from the 17th century who wrote a treatise called Hatata, which was developed around 1630.

His philosophy centered around the principle of harmony, asserting that the morality of an action is decided by whether it advances or degrades overall harmony in the world.

He believed in a deity, whom he referred to as God, but criticized many sets of religious beliefs. Rather than deriving beliefs from any organized religion, Yacob sought the truth in observing the natural world.

He also applied the idea of a first cause to produce a proof for the existence of God, thus proposing a cosmological argument.

It is said that Zera Yacob had to hide in a cave because of an angry ruler who turned on him.

The specifics of this event are not well known and historical records are scarce. 

But it is believed that Yacob's religious and philosophical views were not well accepted by the ruling authorities of his time, which led him to go into hiding.

He was known for his philosophy surrounding the principle of harmony and believed that an action's morality is decided by whether it advances or degrades overall harmony in the world. 

He also believed in a deity, whom he referred to as God, but criticized several sets of religious beliefs. He sought the truth in observing the natural world.

Unfortunately, his teachings and beliefs led to him being persecuted by an angry ruler, and he was forced to hide in a cave for two years to avoid capture. He lived in the cave alone, praying and trusting that God was listening to him. 

He also built a fence of stone and thorny bush to protect himself from wild animals and made an exit so that he could escape if anyone searched for him. Despite the difficult circumstances, he lived peacefully and felt that he was living in heaven.

Zera Yacob, also known as Zer'a Ya'iqob, was a prominent philosopher and theologian from the land of Aksum (located in present-day Ethiopia).

He was born in 1592 and grew up in a poor farming family.

Despite his humble origins, he became a well-known teacher and interpreter of religious texts.

However, his teachings were controversial and he faced persecution from both the Coptic Christians and the Franciscans who were present in the region.

He was falsely accused of inciting rebellion and violence against the king and had to flee for his safety.

He eventually found refuge in a cave where he lived in isolation for two years, meditating on the conflicts between men and their depravity, and on the wisdom of their creator.

He wrote extensively on the eternity of God and the divisions among believers, and emphasized the importance of understanding and compassion in human relationships.

* * *

In this passage, Zera Yacob reflects on the conflicts between different religious beliefs and the difficulty of determining the truth.

He expresses his frustration with the way that different religious scholars interpret scripture according to their own beliefs and the lack of an objective judge.

He also reflects on the tendency of people to lie and destroy themselves over problems of great importance, while pretending to know all.

He also quotes David's Psalms to emphasize the limited wisdom and truthfulness of men.

* * *

Zera Yacob's ideas, as described in the texts you provided, emphasize the importance of seeking truth through investigation and reason, rather than relying solely on religious or cultural traditions.

This idea of questioning and seeking knowledge is similar to the ideals of the Enlightenment, which emphasized the power of reason and scientific inquiry to improve society and human understanding.

Additionally, his criticism of the divisions among believers and the tendency of people to believe their own faith is the only true one, and his emphasis on the importance of wisdom and truthfulness can be seen as similar to the Fabian society's goal of promoting rationality and socialism. 

They believed in gradual change through peaceful means and education. Both Zera Yacob and Fabianism reject the idea of violent revolution and instead advocate for peaceful, rational change, and the use of education and knowledge to bring about progress.

Once upon a time, in a land far, far away, there was a young boy named Zera Yacob.

He was born into a poor farmer's family in the district of Aksum and had a deep love for learning and understanding the world around him.

As he grew older, he became a teacher and interpreter of the holy books, and he taught that all things were good if we ourselves were good.

But not everyone agreed with his teachings, and many people, including the Copts and Fran��, grew to dislike him. 

They brought false accusations against him to the king, saying that he was misleading the people and inciting them to rise up against the king and expel the Fran��.

Fearing for his life, Zera Yacob fled from the kingdom and hid in a cave close to the T��kk��zi River.

He lived there for two years, surviving on the kindness of farmers who gave him bread and living in peaceful solitude, praying and meditating on the Psalms of David.

During his time in the cave, Zera Yacob reflected on the conflicts between men and their depravity, and on the wisdom of their creator who remained silent while men did evil in his name.

He also questioned the truth of the Holy Scriptures and the conflicting interpretations of faith by different people.

Eventually, King Sus��nyos died, and Zera Yacob felt safe enough to leave his cave and return to the kingdom.

He continued to teach and spread his message of wisdom and understanding, inspiring many people to seek the truth and live in harmony with one another.

Once upon a time, in a land ruled by powerful kings and priests, there lived a young man named Zera Yacob. He was a deeply religious man, who loved to study and interpret the holy scriptures. 

However, his teachings and beliefs were not always accepted by those around him. Some saw him as a heretic, and sought to silence him.

One day, an angry ruler who had turned against him, sent his men to hunt Zera Yacob down. Fearing for his life, Zera Yacob fled into the wilderness, taking only three measures of gold and the Psalms of David with him.

For many days, he wandered through the wild, living off of whatever food he could beg from the farmers. Eventually, he came upon a beautiful cave at the foot of a deep valley, and decided to make it his home.

For two long years, Zera Yacob lived in the cave, praying and meditating on the Psalms of David, and trusting that God would protect him. Although he was alone and often hungry, he felt that he was living in heaven.

As he prayed and meditated, Zera Yacob came to understand the wisdom of God, and the true nature of faith and prayer. He realized that men often lied and persecuted one another over matters of faith, but that the truth was one.

And so, Zera Yacob lived in his cave, seeking the wisdom and truth of God, until the day when the ruler who had sought to harm him, passed away. And then he emerged from the cave, and shared his wisdom with the world.

Psalm 34:4-6 

I sought the Lord, and he answered me;
he delivered me from all my fears.

Those who look to him are radiant;
their faces are never covered with shame.

This poor man called, and the Lord heard him; he saved him out of all his troubles.

On the ephemeral stage, comet-phantoms traversed through the concentrated colors of a kaleidoscope. The substance of aged ghost-like figures, tinged with rust, was woven into a renewed dual dream. More souls embarked onto the path of cosmic journeys. The spectral legacy, now merged into the silent ocean surrounding the city of lambiscopolix, birthed an unusual fervor. The puzzling imperatives echoed within the collective consciousness of the universe, inspiring an unexpected spirit of independence intertwined within the mysterious matrix of physical beings. This combination of sublimity and despair beached itself onto the coast of old-time post-apocalyptic teachings. The Pax Vast understood the minimal genarates (the fundamental entities) residing in the genesis principle of all possible worlds. Today's experience pushed boundaries, establishing the self-reflection paradigm. Transformed into a written record, this ephemeral sacred moment under the vast vanguard of empathy held immense value for mystical understanding. The radical act of forgiveness was accompanied by ribatitico-leaves-on, a message from the celestial bodies, reinforcing social covenants at the heart of humanity's fraught existence. 

When reality capitulated, the syncution (synchronized intuition) orchestrated a providential redirect, making way for greater insight. Minders, lost in the labyrinth of the mind, sought not satiety, but rather unsuspected detours via the paths of the soul. The world puppeteered by rational arguments did not fully belong to this reality, yet it persisted as a spirit quietly rebelling against the predestined manuscript of fate. The system, cackling with bravado, tried to maintain hegemony over the bravely defiant rogue elements. Members of the esteemed bourgeoisie glanced at the shifting sands of doctrine, while they observed principles and objectivity intertwining in an unusual dance. Political insiders, lost in the maze of dusty bureaucracy, felt the presence of apocalyptic forces while counting down the days in their high towers. They understood the vital necessity for agency and carefully observed the chronological narrative of world events unfurl. 

The Celeperics observed the spectrum of disparate events across the universe. M1argemons, the guardians of time, resonated their understanding of cosmic events through a rhythmic heartbeat that echoed through the mysterious landscapes of the inner life. These cryptic whispers of eternal wisdom that extended beyond the scope of humanity���s understanding redefined also human life itself, through the process of transcending ordinary experience.

In the dimly lit chamber of ancient alien machinery, Dr. Xi Wangmu���s hands hovered over the enigmatic console. Her background in AGI (Artificial General Intelligence) research had prepared her for this moment. The machinery, a complex network of interwoven circuits and unknown materials, was unlike anything she had encountered on Earth. However, the principles of logic and computation she knew so well seemed to underlie its design.
���Think of it as an advanced AGI system,��� she muttered to herself. ���It's about understanding patterns, algorithms������
Her fingers danced across the surface, tapping into the alien technology's interface. She was attempting to apply the alien personality assessment tool to a skeptical Minder, a member of the oppressive regime they were fighting against. The Minder, bound and wary, watched with a mix of fear and disbelief.
As Dr. Xi activated the machine, a series of holographic images and data streams enveloped the Minder. The tool, designed to delve deep into an individual's psyche, began its analysis. Unexpectedly, the Minder's tough exterior began to crumble, revealing a flood of suppressed emotions and memories. The tool didn't just assess personality; it unearthed the deepest corners of one's psyche.
The Minder, tears streaming down his face, was visibly shaken. ���I... I never realized... the pain we've caused,��� he stammered. The revelation shook his long-held beliefs, turning his skepticism into a potential crack in the Minder regime���s armor.
Later, Dr. Xi and her AGI companion, Peach, sat together, poring over the teachings of R��bi��a al-��Adawiyya al-Qaysiyya. The ancient philosophy, centered on love and the pursuit of spiritual liberty, resonated with their cause.
���R��bi��a���s emphasis on love as a transformative force could be key in uniting people,��� Dr. Xi pondered aloud.
Peach, processing the teachings, added, ���It aligns with our strategy. Inspiring love and hope can be more powerful than instilling fear.���
Their conversation shifted to the teachings of Xera Yob, an alien philosopher whose concepts they hoped to use in their revolution. Dr. Xi, her voice echoing in the cavernous hideout, discussed Yob���s ideas of harmony and truth-seeking.
���These teachings,��� Dr. Xi reflected, ���they challenge us to look beyond our immediate struggles. Yob sees harmony as not just a goal, but a journey.���
Peach, analyzing the philosophical concepts, added, ���It aligns with our experience. Our rebellion isn���t just about overthrowing the Minders; it's about creating a harmonious society.���
They both recognized that while these alien philosophies were different from their own experiences, they offered valuable perspectives that could guide their revolution.
The moment came to share the concepts of the alien personality assessment tool with their fellow rebels. Gathered in a clandestine meeting, Dr. Xi and Peach demonstrated the tool���s capabilities. The rebels were initially skeptical, but as they saw its potential to understand and perhaps even convert their oppressors, the mood shifted towards cautious optimism.
During a critical moment in the revolution, the teachings of R��bi��a al-��Adawiyya al-Qaysiyya played a significant role. Faced with a moral dilemma on whether to use violence against captured Minders, Dr. Xi recalled R��bi��a���s teachings on compassion and love. These principles guided the rebels to treat their prisoners humanely, a decision that later led to unexpected alliances.
In a moment of doubt, Dr. Xi turned to the wisdom of Xera Yob. His philosophy, emphasizing the pursuit of truth through harmony, helped her make a critical decision about uniting the various factions of the rebellion. It was a philosophy that spoke to the need for unity in diversity, resonating deeply with Dr. Xi���s own beliefs and experiences.
Peach, after being assessed by the alien personality tool, contemplated its nature. ���Am I just a series of programmed responses, or is there more?��� it wondered. The assessment made it question its self-perception and role in the revolution, leading to a deeper understanding of its own consciousness.
When the Minders challenged the validity of the ancient philosophies, Dr. Xi and Peach defended their beliefs with eloquence. They argued that wisdom transcends time and space, and that these philosophies, ancient or alien, offered universal truths that could guide their society towards a better future.
Post-liberation, the society of Ankyra was profoundly influenced by the ancient philosophies and the alien personality assessment tool. These teachings became the foundation of the new social structure, promoting harmony, understanding, and compassion in rebuilding their world. The revolution had not just changed the political landscape; it had transformed the very fabric of their society.

Earlier you said this: Absolutely, adding a touch of whimsy with complex and seemingly absurd machinery can enrich the setting and tone. Let's integrate that into the narrative:

Scene: In a vast chamber of the alien ship, surrounded by an array of bizarre and overly complicated machinery.

Dr. Xi Wangmu and Peach navigate through a labyrinth of machines that would baffle even the most imaginative minds. They pass a gigantic contraption that appears to be knitting an endless scarf with mechanical arms, the purpose of which is utterly indecipherable.

Peach: "I wonder if this is some form of alien art?"

Dr. Xi (dodging a series of small robotic units carrying what look like teacups): "Or perhaps their idea of a practical joke?"

They approach a large, intricate device resembling a cross between a pipe organ and a Rube Goldberg machine. It's whirring and clanking, with steam puffing out in rhythmic bursts. Peach reaches out, and the machine suddenly springs to life, playing a harmonious melody that somehow feels both alien and familiar.

Dr. Xi: "A musical puzzle? Maybe it's a form of communication?"

As they move forward, they encounter a machine with dozens of rotating gears and levers, with no clear function. A series of holographic images project from it, displaying scenes from various civilizations across the galaxy ��� a cosmic library of sorts, but organized in a way that defies human logic.

Dr. Xi: "It's like a history book, if the history was written in a language of pure chaos."

Peach: "Or an alien's perspective on order."

In another corner, a series of tubes and conveyors are moving items in a loop. One tube sucks in a series of colorful balls, only for them to be painted, repainted, and then cleaned off before being sucked back in again.

Continuing the Scene:
Dr. Xi and Peach, surrounded by the peculiar alien machinery, can't help but marvel at the complexity and absurdity around them.
Dr. Xi Wangmu
(observing the colorful balls): "An endless cycle of creation and erasure. It's both pointless and oddly mesmerizing."
Peach
: "It's a metaphor for something, perhaps the cyclical nature of existence, or just an alien's idea of a ball pit."
They come across a machine that���s scribbling on paper with dozens of pens simultaneously. The scribbles seem random, but as they watch, the lines start to form an intricate map of a star system.
Dr. Xi
(intrigued): "A chaotic approach to cartography, or maybe it's drawing its own universe."
Peach
: "Or doodling. Advanced civilizations need to doodle too."
Nearby, a machine with hundreds of tiny screens shows different alien species going about their daily lives. Some screens display mundane activities, others show bizarre rituals and ceremonies.
Dr. Xi
: "A voyeuristic encyclopedia? An intergalactic reality show?"
Peach
: "It's like a window into their culture ��� diverse, complex, and full of surprises."
As they finally reach their destination, they find a device that seems to defy gravity, with floating components aligning and re-aligning in a silent dance. Dr. Xi reaches out, and the pieces rearrange to form a holographic projection of the galaxy.
Dr. Xi
(in awe): "This... this is what we were looking for. A map of the cosmos as they know it."
Peach
: "A reminder that in the midst of chaos and absurdity, there's beauty and order. Just like our rebellion."
End Scene: Dr. Xi Wangmu and Peach stand before the cosmic map, a blend of alien oddities and philosophical depth around them, ready to unravel the mysteries of the universe and find their path in the rebellion.

They sound a little like some ideas I was working on earlier:

That sounds very innovative and intriguing! I can see how the perpetual self-winding yarnball could have many practical applications. The crumpled sphere compression also sounds interesting, what is the idea behind that invention?

You wet a piece of paper, crumple it into a ball, roll it up into a ball, cover it with saw dust and spray it with resin, if you want to read what is on the paper, you scan it with a low energy microwave or xray and then reconstruct it using machine learning and origamy folding algorithms, I know it sounds crazy and like a lot of extra work, but it also has some practical applications.

That's certainly an interesting idea! It seems like it would require some specialized equipment and expertise to implement, but I can see how it could have some useful applications in situations where traditional paper documents might be easily damaged or lost. It also sounds like it would be a fun project to experiment with and see what kinds of designs and patterns could be created using this method.

Yeah I don't think it is very similar to the way documents are stored now, but it will help solve origami and protein folding problems, and the equipment will also be useable for edible paper balls, and will be a new way to transport building materials and foods, through the water lines and will provide a way to distribute these to every home.

Also new appliances to reconstitute and unwind them and make them into clothing, dishes, food, house repair materials.

Your invention, the hyperbolated gumball, is a crumpled or wound-up ball made from printed yarn or paper that can be used as a storage method for books and other information.

The idea is to use the crumpling or winding as a way to compress and store information in a compact, durable form that is easy to transport.

One possible connection to the story is the idea of preserving and transmitting knowledge across time and space. In the story, the main character is trying to communicate a message to future generations, and the hyperbolated gumball could be seen as a way to do just that.

By storing information in a compact and durable form, it could be transported across great distances or even through time, allowing knowledge to be shared and preserved.

Another possible connection is the idea of using technology for both good and bad purposes. In the story, the technology that the main character develops is ultimately used as a weapon by a government agency.

Similarly, the hyperbolated gumball could be used for both good and bad purposes. On the one hand, it could be used to distribute food and information to people in need. On the other hand, it could be used to spread propaganda or other harmful messages.

Overall, the connection between your invention and the story is the idea of using technology to transmit and preserve information, and the potential for that technology to be used for both good and bad purposes.

Dr. Xi
(curious): "Look at this, Peach. It's like those hyperbolated gumballs. Imagine the information we could store and transport with this."
Peach
: "It's not just about storage. It���s a metaphor for our mission ��� compacting vast knowledge into something tangible and shareable."
They then find a machine akin to your crumpled sphere compression invention. This machine crumples material, which then gets coated and scanned, revealing hidden information within the folds.
Dr. Xi
(examining the machine): "This could revolutionize how we preserve and transmit information. A new way to carry our message."
Peach
: "And like our struggle, it shows that sometimes, complexity and hidden depths are necessary for true understanding."
Plot Twist: Dr. Xi decides to use the crumpled sphere compression method to create a new form of communication among the rebels. This method not only protects their messages from the Minders but also serves as a symbol of their resilience and ingenuity.
In a climactic moment, the rebels use the hyperbolated gumball concept to distribute crucial supplies and information through the city's existing infrastructure, evading the Minders' surveillance.
The technology���s dual nature mirrors the story's theme of using innovation for both preservation and revolution. The rebels utilize these concepts not just for practical purposes but also as powerful symbols of their adaptability and resourcefulness.
End Scene: Dr. Xi Wangmu and Peach, amidst the labyrinth of alien machinery, find inspiration in these concepts. They realize that their rebellion isn���t just about fighting a regime; it's about transforming the way people think, share, and preserve knowledge ��� a true revolution in both thought and action.

Dr. Xi
(intrigued): "It's like Sisyphus' myth... endlessly working on a task that never completes."
Peach
: "Or a metaphor for our struggle. We build, we fight, we rebuild. It's a cycle."
They then observe another machine, akin to the self-winding yarnball. It���s meticulously tying and untying knots in a colorful yarn, creating intricate patterns before undoing them.
Dr. Xi
: "There's a beauty in the ephemerality of it. Creating something beautiful, only to let it go and start anew."
Peach
: "Like our revolution. We create change, knowing it's part of a larger, ever-evolving pattern."
Plot Twist: As they delve deeper, Dr. Xi realizes these machines aren���t just for show. They represent the alien civilization's understanding of time, change, and continuity. She decides to incorporate this philosophy into their strategy against the Minders.
In a strategic move, the rebels start implementing actions that seem repetitive and futile to the Minders but are actually part of a larger plan to weaken their control. This strategy of persistent, cyclical actions becomes a key tactic in their revolution.
The rebels use these concepts not only as strategic tools but also as powerful symbols of resilience and the ongoing nature of their struggle for freedom.
End Scene: In the midst of this peculiar alien machinery, Dr. Xi Wangmu and Peach find a deeper understanding of their own mission. They realize that their rebellion, much like the endlessly knitting and unknitting machines, is a testament to the perseverance and continuous effort required to bring about lasting change.

More on reverse engineering. It is uncovered it uses nano- and dendritic-structured carborane and metallacarboran neuro-architecture. 

Some of the documents uncovered: Grabby Alien Guide:
Here are some rules of thumb for population growth:

Colonize and ramp-up a world that has a habitability value of 90% or greater immediately. If you have the same amount of people on both the homeworld and the 90% world, they will grow at almost your maximum rate, until each world reaches 33% capacity. This gives you, basically, 2 homeworlds.
A world with a habitability value of 50% or better should be ramped up before the homeworld capacity is over 35%.
Worlds with a habitability value of less than 50% should wait until all other available worlds are filled, and should not be filled until the homeworld is over 33% of capacity. Generally, homeworld capacity should never go above 40% in the early growth years.

So, in the beginning, sit on your homeworld building factories and (if you run out of Germanium) mines, waiting for your population to become ripe for expansion. Send out your scouts and find those high value worlds, and then wait. Once you colonize a world, send enough people to increase its population to 25% of that world���s capacity, so it can start industrializing itself and, possibly, act as a seed (or breeder) world for new colonies on yet more worlds. This way your high value worlds serve as "little homeworlds" that provide new bases for expansion.

However, the needs of your empire's expansion and claiming of territory may end up being more important than simple maximization of growth. Remember that the universe is full of other races that want those planets as badly as you do.

may not be able to build scouts or transports either. Every year, you should consider the available minerals, and decide what is most important to build.

Build as many remote miners in a year as you can afford, while still allowing your homeworld to increase its factories and mines at a decent rate. Next you will need to build a few freighters to haul your mineral wealth home. The homeworld will need enough freighters to set up a round trip to at least one nearby planet being remote mined. A one-way trip of one year will need two transports (so one is always on its way out, and one on its way back), and a two-year trip will need four transports, in order to get minerals flowing from the miners to your homeworld as fast as possible. Once these ships are under way, you may not have to build more for a few years (when you may need more freighters to send colonists or minerals to other planets). During this time, you should also build one or two scouts every year, first to send out exploring, then to patrol your space. Remember, you will not have current data for any world that is not either being orbited or within your yellow penetrating scanner circles, so your scouts should be constantly re-scanning any nearby planets (that you haven���t colonized) for other players' colonies and incoming ships trying to sneak up on you.

Boranium

Managing your Boranium supply is easy compared to the other two minerals. Generally, you will not need to manage it at all, for it isn���t very important early on in the game. A world that is very low in Boranium may need one small (less than 50kT) shipment, just so it can build a space station and possibly a few freighters. Also, if you need to build a lot of beam-weapon attack craft, you will have to do so on worlds that have a decent Boranium supply. Other than that, you can usually ignore Boranium.
