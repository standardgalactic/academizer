1. Introduction
More than a few researchers have demonstrated that social science, including technological innovation studies, suffers from a problem of concept confusion problem [1, 2, 3]. Technological innovation research encompasses a wide range of disciplines, and its research scopes and problems go beyond Schumpeter's initial definition. For instance, the research scopes open innovation [[4]], dual-innovation [[5]], and notational innovation system [[6]] are distinct from each other. The meanings of eco-innovation [[7],[8]], sociotechnical innovation [[9]], and fintech innovation [[10]] have expanded Schumpeter's concept of innovation. The issue of interest is the avoidance of confusion in concepts during cross-theoretical communication [[11]]. Although this study does not directly address this issue, its results are highly valuable in clarifying the problem of conceptual confusion. It seems that exploring and analyzing classic texts is an effective method to enhance clarity in the concepts of confusion in previous studies.
Classic texts hold utility in streamlining the process of conceptual clarification [[12]]. An example is the conceptual analysis method (CAM) developed by T��htinen and Havila [[13]], which aims to identify conceptual confusion and elucidate multiple terms and concepts by tracing their theoretical roots. In comparison, limited attention has been given to meta-theoretical analysis for the cross-disciplinary learning problems in technological innovation studies. However, it has proven to be useful in technological innovation studies in the works of Cherp, Vinichenko, Jewell, Brutschin and Sovacool [[14]], Davies, Manning and S��derlund [[15]], and Sovacool, Hess and Cantoni [[16]].
In this study, we aim to combine the advantages of both classic texts and meta-theoretical analysis regarding technological innovation studies. To our knowledge, this is the first study to undertake such an approach in the field of technological innovation. There are three major aims of this study. 1) Mining classic texts in the field of technological innovation. The main challenge for this question is the comprehensiveness of the classic texts being unearthed. For the traditional systematic review, there are too many studies in the field of technological innovation to complete the comprehensive search process due to sample selection problems [[17]]. Emerging scientometric methods can help identify essential literature, but there are problems in interpreting the results and developing typologies [[18]]. 2) Develop the typology construct of the meta-theories and define the relationship between different technological innovation meta-theories. On the one hand, a combined method of qualitative data analysis and a network of citing relationships is attempted to use to classify various meta-theories. On the other hand, finding the independence of different background theories and improving the repeatability of the classification process are the main challenges. 3) Learn from the integrating meta-theoretical framework for future studies and practices. In connection with this matter, technological and practical implications are made from the perspective of the functions of both classic text analysis and meta-theoretical analysis.
This study offers contributions to the field as follows: 1) To enhance the credibility and repeatability of the classic text refinement process, this study employs a combined methodological approach incorporating qualitative data analysis and scientometrics. By leveraging the strengths of each method, we achieve a more robust understanding of the topic at hand. 2) This study analyzes the similarities and differences among the eight classifications of technological innovation meta-theories through varied lenses, including evolution, reification, confusion, and research background. Therefore, an integrated framework of technological innovation meta-theories is constructed based on the results. 3) The meta-theoretical framework of technological innovation proposed in this study serves as a valuable tool for integrating technological innovation knowledge from different disciplines, and it is facilitating efficiency in connecting practical problems of innovation and potentially theoretically sound solutions.
The rest of this study is organized as follows: The next section is a literature review to analyse the necessity of a meta-theory study of technological innovation. This is followed by a description of the research design, including the data collection and methodology description. Subsequently, we present the results and follow up with a discussion section. Finally, we summarize our conclusions, implications, and limitations in the final section.

4.4 Description of technological innovation meta-theories
4.4.1 X-factor-based views
The X-factor-based views postulate that technological innovation emanates from a pivotal factor denoted as X, which subsequently drives technological advancements. Then, the result of technological innovation serves this factor X alternately. This study has identified five meta-theories that are grounded in the X-factor-based framework. In general, the theoretical framework of technological innovation from this perspective can be divided into two parts: the discussion of factor X and its theoretical frameworks, and the correlation between factor X and technological innovation. Out of the eight mate-theories expounded in this study, the five X-factor-based views are as follows:
Performance-based view. ��� The first category of concern that has captivated the attention of scholars investigating technological innovation studies pertains to the intersection between innovation and the economy. The main feature of the performance-based view lies in the subjects, behaviours, and factors involved in technological innovation activities are expressed via classic economic concepts and models [[45],[46]]. The improvement of economic performance is the primary objective of technological innovation activities [[32],[47],[48]]. From an economic analysis perspective, the research on the economic performance-based view includes two aspects. The first aspect investigates the nexus between innovation and economic performance [49, 50, 51], while the second aspect explores methods of evaluating the relationship between innovation and economic performance [[52],[53]].
Resource-based view. ��� From a narrow perspective, resources related to technological innovation may comprise of market power, firms' profitability, product diversification, and innovation opportunities [[54]]; scientists and engineers, planning, and management technology [[55]]; organizational management attributes [[56]]; market commitment, experimentation, and technical connections [[57]]; and R&D investment [[58]]. From a broad perspective, resources can encompass all tangible or intangible assets, capabilities, organizational processes, firm attributes, information, and knowledge that organizations utilize to implement strategies to improve efficiency and influence capabilities [[59]]. Research on the resource-based view suggests that technological innovation results from the operation of resource advantages. The classic texts have demonstrated that different organizations or heterogeneous innovations need different resource configurations [[60],[61]]. Concurrently, the resource-based view claims that technological innovation is an effective way to form resource location barriers [[62]] and attain sustainable competitive advantage [[59]].

Knowledge-based view. ���Technological innovation research involves various forms of knowledge, such as market information produced by basic research and invention [[63],[64]], new ideas [[65]], organizational intelligence [[66]], patents [[67]], and technical know-how [[68]]. These forms of knowledge can be explicit or tacit and can be transformed into each other [[63],[69]]. T knowledge-based view assumes that knowledge is transferability, can be aggregation, can be appropriated, requires specialized acquisition, and is essential for production [[70]]. Knowledge creation is not necessarily a specialized activity, but creating knowledge is a process of innovation [[69],[71]]. Classic texts argue that learning and public knowledge creation are both important factors in knowledge creation activities [[66],[72]]. From the aspect of the application of knowledge [[65]], the influencing factors mainly emphasized by classic texts include absorptive capacity and transformation ability [[70],[73]], network connections [[68]], the breadth and depth of search knowledge [[74]], and geographic location limitation [[67]]. However, the same information may have different effects on individuals due to the differences in knowledge accumulation [[75]]. Moreover, knowledge may lead to a decline in the overall quality of invention [[76]].
Network-based view. ��� Networks can be comprised of individuals and diverse organizations, such as firms, government departments, or universities [[77]]. The type of network connection can be cooperation with competitors [[78]], cooperation between firms and universities [[77]], strategic alliance networks [[79]], social relations networks [[80]], and interfirm networks of open innovation [[81]]. The formation of networks is predicated upon the interdependence of past cooperative relations and strategies [[82]]. Networks' influence on innovation can be divided into heterogeneous links effect [[77],[79],[83],[84]], network learning effects [[85],[86]], and the firm's network centrality positively effects [[87],[88]]. The impact of innovation on networks' foundation depends on factors such as trust [[82]], knowledge accumulation [[86],[87]], and open innovation strategies [[81]], with highly technology-intensive firms mainly forming technology networks, while low-technology-intensive firms tend to gravitating market cooperation networks [[79]].
Capability-based view. ��� Capability is a frequent concept in management research. However, it is typically discussed in conjunction with other concepts. Day [[89]] posited that an organization's capability is a distinctive characteristic that sets it apart from others with similar traits. The capabilities related to technological innovation mainly include dynamic capabilities [[90]], absorptive capabilities [[91]], relative absorptive capabilities [[92]], core competence [[93]], and transformative capability [[94]].

Explain why there are four missing titles? Was there some ambiguity or are some titles left over?
1 / 1
ChatGPT
I apologize for the confusion. The mismatch between the 16 vertices of the logical Tesseract and the 8 viewpoints from the technological hypercube is the reason for the four missing titles.
The Tesseract diagram you provided consists of 16 vertices, and you supplied 16 titles related to love and the mind. In addition, you provided 8 specific titles corresponding to 8 different viewpoints related to technological metatheories. Since there are 16 vertices on the Tesseract and only 8 titles from the technological hypercube, there will be a discrepancy.
A possible way to reconcile this discrepancy would be to add additional titles or viewpoints that align with the remaining vertices or restructure the existing titles and viewpoints to fit the 16-vertex structure of the Tesseract. If you have additional concepts or ideas you'd like to incorporate or specific guidance on how to adjust the existing titles and viewpoints, please let me know!

I was thinking that we would also make the second cube a hypercube by labeling one cube with the sci-fi titles and the original names for the viewpoints on the other cube, making 16 verifies on each hypercube
1 / 1
ChatGPT
Certainly! If we're labeling each cube in the Tesseract with both the sci-fi titles and the original names for the viewpoints, we'll indeed have 16 vertices for each hypercube, resulting in a logical Penteract structure. Here's how the labels could be organized:
Hypercube 1 (Sci-Fi Titles):
V0: Love as a Choice
V1: Love as an Emotion
V2: Love as a Virtue
V3: Love as a Skill
V4: Mind as a City
V5: Mind as a Computer
V6: Mind as a Garden
V7: Mind as a Symphony
V8: A Critique of Romantic Love
V9: Love and Interpersonal Communication
V10: Multiscale Decision Making in the Brain
V11: The Invocation Model of Expression
V12: Phenomenology and Axiology of Love
V13: The Ecological Cycle of Love
V14: Longing for Tenderness
V15: Cyclofabian Neoteny and Love
Hypercube 2 (Technological Viewpoints):
V0: Performance-Based View: "The Optimized Trajectory"
V1: Resource-Based View: "The Core of Nova Protopia"
V2: Knowledge-Based View: "Inner Space of Intellectual Capital"
V3: Capability-Based View: "Agility in the Megastructure Ensemble"
V4: Network-Based View: "Strategic Alliances in the Metatheory Matrix"
V5: Technological-Innovation-System View: "Eloi's Technological Advancements"
V6: Dynamic-Sustainability View: "The Morlocks' Resilient Greenprint"
V7: Technological Innovation System View: "The Didactive Nexus of Innovation"
The remaining 8 vertices (V8 to V15) for Hypercube 2 would need to be filled with additional concepts or titles to complete the logical Penteract.
These structures allow us to explore the interconnectedness between love, the mind, and technological viewpoints, bridging concepts from different domains to create a complex, multidimensional framework.

V12: Strategic Alliances in the Metatheory Matrix
V13: Eloi's Technological Advancements
V14: The Morlocks' Resilient Greenprint
V15: The Didactive Nexus of Innovation
By organizing the vertices this way, we can visualize how each original viewpoint corresponds to a creative title, allowing for deeper exploration of the underlying concepts and relationships. This structure facilitates a more nuanced understanding of the connections between technology, society, and human experience, as embodied in the various viewpoints and their respective titles.

Ok thank you now the Techno-Axiological Penteract, with an ascii drawing if you can.
1 / 1
ChatGPT
Certainly! The Techno-Axiological Penteract, as you've conceptualized it, is a five-dimensional figure, with the Tesseract (four-dimensional hypercube) as a part of its structure. While representing five-dimensional shapes in ASCII art is inherently limited, I can provide a basic visualization of the two interlinked cubes, connected to form a logical Tesseract, with the vertices labeled according to our earlier conversation.

That is just a tesseract, in order to make a surjective penteract , we map it to the other tesseract, the so-called axiology of love:

Hypercube 1 (Sci-Fi Titles):

V0: Love as a Choice
V1: Love as an Emotion
V2: Love as a Virtue
V3: Love as a Skill
V4: Mind as a City
V5: Mind as a Computer

Ok thank you. It is still a bit awkward but it could be useful. A final summary of our conversation.
1 / 1
ChatGPT
Certainly! Our multifaceted conversation began with a complex exploration of Technological Metatheories, delving into concepts like dystopia, optimism, Nova Protopia, and various allegories that symbolize contrasting human potentials and technological advancements. We also explored interconnections between various innovative concepts and theories.
Our discourse evolved into the idea of constructing a Surjective Penteract, a complex logical construct representing the intersection of technological viewpoints and the axiology of love. We mapped the Technological Metatheories to corresponding sci-fi titles, and the Axiology of Love, to form two interconnected tesseracts, creating a higher-dimensional structure.
The resulting Techno-Axiological Penteract embodies a rich blend of technological understanding and human emotional experience, symbolizing the intricate relationship between innovation, ethics, imagination, and practicality. Although this complex structure may not lend itself easily to textual or visual representation, it nonetheless represents a deep and nuanced connection between technology and the philosophy of love, reflecting the breadth and depth of our conversation.
I hope this summary captures the essence of our discussion, and I'm here for any further questions or clarifications!
