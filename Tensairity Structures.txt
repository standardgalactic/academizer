Tensairity is a trademarked term[1] for a light weight structural concept that uses low pressure air to stabilize compression elements against buckling.[2] It employs an ancient foundational splinting structure using inflated airbeams and attached stiffeners or cables that gains mechanical advantages for low mass.[3][4] The structure modality has been particularly developed by Mauro Pedretti.[5][6]


Comparison of (a) a normal steel framework girder and (b) a tensairity girder. When the load applies from the top directing downward (trying to bend the girder), force acts on upper rods of girders as compression stress yet as tension stress on lower parts. This stress tends to decrease girder width making it less rigid. (A girder of zero width has zero flexural strength.) To prevent this upper and lower rods must be separated. Classical framework girders ensure this using triangular space frames. In the tensairity girder strong airbags pressurized with a gas is used instead. The pure tension on the lower rod load may be replaced by rope or the strong airbag membrane itself. This results in a much better strength-to-weight ratio.

A related structure modality is tensegrity. Conceivably, an ultralightweight structure evacuated of air would float in the atmosphere, much as a buoy floats in water A crushing load is present destabilizing such structures. However, enclosed-air structures perhaps made of tensairity beams in a tensegrity format holding an enveloping skin could be heated by solar energy and interior activity and then become lighter than air, like hot-air balloons. A torus of 72 inch major diameter and 27 inch minor diameter displaces about 5 pounds of atmosphere, so if the torus weighed less than 5 pounds, and was evacuated, it would be buoyant. Buckminster Fuller designed floating cities (air-filled) so lightweight that they would be buoyant only by the effect of solar heat warming the air within to slightly less density than the surrounding air. As domes, they were about 1/2 mile diameter. As floating spheres, the cities would not experience earthquakes

Abstract. Tensairity is a new light weight structural concept. The key principle of Tensairity 
is to use low pressure air to stabilize compression elements against buckling. The basic 
Tensairity structure is a beam with the properties of a simple airbeam as light weight, fast set 
up and compact storage volume but with the load bearing capacity of conventional steel 
girders. Ideal applications of the Tensairity technology are wide span roof structures, 
temporary buildings and footbridges.

1 INTRODUCTION 
Compression: From the pyramids in Egypt, the columns of Greek temples, the arches and 
domes of the Romans to the gothic cathedrals of the Middle Ages, the history of civil 
engineering is full of astonishing buildings. The masters of these pieces relied all on the same 
structural principle, compression. Stones were laid on each other to build up the structure, 
essentially hold together by gravity. As an impressive and monumental demonstration of the 
power of the owner, these buildings used up incredible resources both in terms of money, 
material and human power. From a structural point of view, the compression principle of 
these buildings has a severe disadvantage: buckling. Buckling couples the load bearing 
capacity of a structure with its length. The longer the column, either the less load it can bear, 
or the larger the diameter needs to be. Larger cross sections mean more material which often 
cannot be utilized to the yield limit, thus a waste of resources. 
Tension: On the other extreme, ancient nomadic tribes developed tent structures for their 
housing. Light and deployable as these shelters are, they are ideally adapted to the moving life 
of these autonomous peoples. Fabrics and ropes, the important elements of tent structures, 
rely on tension, structurally the most efficient use of a material. The load bearing capacity of 
e.g. a cable is independent of its length and solely determined by the material properties and 
the cross sectional area. Today, fabric structures have become more and more attractive, 
where light weight, cost efficiency, fast set up time and mobility in most cases rule out 
extravagance, pomposity and eternity. Fabric structures with more than hundred meter span 
have been built including covers for stadiums and airport halls. The design of new high tech 
fabrics and the ever improving computational possibilities are key factors for the progress of 
these tension structures in the 20th century. 
Tension and compression: Where tension is, there is compression, too. Tent structures need 
poles. And these poles have to withstand buckling. The goal of good light weight structural 
engineering is to find the optimal interplay between tension and compression. 
Tension and compression are evenly balanced in the new structural concept Tensairity. In 
combination with the extraordinary feature of buckling free compression highly efficient light 
weight structures can be realized based on Tensairity with a tremendous potential for 
applications e.g. in civil engineering.

Abstract
Tensairity is a novel lightweight structural concept that employs low-pressure air to stabilize compression elements against buckling. A Tensairity structure behaves like a simple airbeam���lightweight, fast to set up, and compact for storage���while possessing the load-bearing capacity of conventional steel girders. This technology is particularly suited for wide-span roof structures, temporary buildings, and footbridges.
Introduction
Historical Context
Compression Structures
: Historically, monumental buildings like pyramids, Greek temples, Roman domes, and Gothic cathedrals relied on compression. Despite their grandeur, these structures had a severe disadvantage: buckling. Buckling limits the load-bearing capacity relative to the structure's length, requiring larger cross sections and often leading to inefficient use of materials.
Tension Structures
: In contrast, ancient nomadic tribes used tension-based tent structures, which were lightweight and portable. Modern fabric structures have capitalized on the efficiency of tension, creating large-span covers for stadiums and airports using high-tech fabrics and advanced computational design.
Tension and Compression
Interdependence
: Both tension and compression are crucial in structural design. Tent structures, for instance, require poles that must resist buckling.
Balanced Approach
: Tensairity harmonizes tension and compression, creating buckling-free, highly efficient lightweight structures. This innovative approach holds significant potential for applications in civil engineering.
Key Principles of Tensairity
Low-Pressure Air
: Used to stabilize compression elements, preventing buckling.
Combination of Materials
: Integrates inflatable airbeams with stiffening elements such as cables or rods.
Efficiency
: Achieves a balance between tension and compression, leading to structures that are both lightweight and strong.
Applications
: Ideal for wide-span roofs, temporary buildings, and footbridges due to its excellent strength-to-weight ratio and ease of deployment.
Conclusion
Tensairity represents a significant advancement in lightweight structural engineering. By leveraging low-pressure air to stabilize compression elements, it achieves a remarkable balance between tension and compression. This results in efficient, buckling-free structures with broad applications in civil engineering, offering a promising alternative to traditional building methods.

2 BASIC TENSAIRITY 
In its most basic form, a Tensairity beam consists of a simple airbeam (a cylindrical 
membrane filled with pressured air), a compression element tightly connected to the airbeam 
and two cables running in helical form around the airbeam (Fig. 1). The cables are connected 
at both ends with the compression element. The basic theory of Tensairity has been described 
elsewhere [LUC04]. However, to understand the structural principle of Tensairity, a 
comparison with a truss girder is instructive (Fig. 2). The truss girder consists of a horizontal 
compression element with length L, vertical struts with length up to the height D and a cable 
which is connected at both ends with the horizontal compression element. The set-up of both 
structures is very similar. However, instead of the vertical struts of the truss an airbeam is 
fitted between cables and compression element in the Tensairity structure with important 
consequences. 
Figure 2 Tensairity girder (left) compared to a truss girder (right). Basically, the vertical struts of the truss are 
replaced by an airbeam in the Tensairity structure with important consequences. 
Under distributed load q, the tension in the cable increases in both structures to compensate 
the bending moment. For slender structures (�� ���= L/D >> 1), the total cable tension T has 
approximately the same value for the truss and the Tensairity girder [LUC04] 
�����������=LqT 
8 
1 . (1) 
Due to the connection of the cables with the compression element, the cable force is 
transferred to the compression element, acting there as a compressive force P. The 
compression element becomes prone to buckling. For the truss, the buckling length of the 
horizontal compression element is L /(n+1) for n vertical struts. The horizontal buckling load 
in the truss is therefore 2

with E the modulus of elasticity and I the moment of inertia of the compression element. The 
buckling load decreases with the inverse square of the span and is therefore strongly span 
dependent. In general, the buckling load is much smaller than the yield load meaning an inefficient use of the material and extra weight for the compression element. The situation is 
analogue for the vertical struts which are also prone to buckling and therefore not used in the 
most efficient way. By increasing the number of vertical struts, the buckling length of the 
horizontal compression element decreases. However, the resulting decrease in weight of the 
horizontal compression element needs to be carefully balanced with the increase in weight 
given by the added vertical struts. Even in the optimal case, the dimension of all elements 
under compression is determined by buckling restrictions and thus the truss is not the most 
efficient structure. 
The situation of the compression element is different in the case of Tensairity. The 
compression element is tightly connected with the membrane of the airbeam. Instead of the n 
supports of the truss, the compression element of Tensairity is continuously supported by the 
membrane. In fact, the membrane acts as a continuous elastic support for the compression 
element. The stiffness of this support is determined by the membrane stress, which itself is 
proportional to the overpressure inside the membrane tube. The different situations for the 
compression element in the truss and in Tensairity are shown in Figure 3. From the theory of 
beams on an elastic foundation, the buckling load is given by [SZA77].
