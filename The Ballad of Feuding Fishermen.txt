The Ballad of Feuding Fishermen

By Flyxion

[Verse]
Oh the sun rose high on Newfoundland's shore
Two fishermen battled on the ocean's floor
One hauled cod while the other stood sore
"You're stealing my luck" the other did roar

[Verse 2]
The lines were cast the nets were spread wide
One's boat filled heavy while the other had pride
"You bawl too loud making fish slide"
A punch flew quick rocking the tide

[Chorus]
Oh row boys row the waves won't mind
But fights on the sea leave trouble behind
Salt on their brows and anger unkind
Two stubborn hearts with their captains blind

[Verse 3]
His fist swung hard but missed by a hair
"You think I'm a fool?" he shouted in the air
The gulls circled by with their silent stare
As tempers broke in the ocean's glare

[Bridge]
Now the sea's their keeper it'll swallow your sin
A quarrel like this no one will win
They traded more words let their pride begin
As the tide sang the truth they would never pin

[Verse 4]
"My nets are my own they don’t cross your wake
It's not my yell and no bait I take"
One’s boat nearly tipped with every mistake
Two prideful lads left no more fish to rake
