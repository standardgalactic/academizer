Abstract 
Continuous normalizing l ows (CNFs) are an attractive generative modeling tech- 
nique, but they have been held back by limitations in their simulation-based maxi- 
mum likelihood training. We introduce the generalized conditional l ow matching 
(CFM) technique, a family of simulation-free training objectives for CNFs. CFM 
features a stable regression objective like that used to train the stochastic l ow in 
diffusion models but enjoys the eff i cient inference of deterministic l ow models. In 
contrast to both diffusion models and prior CNF training algorithms, CFM does not 
require the source distribution to be Gaussian or require evaluation of its density. A 
variant of our objective is optimal transport CFM (OT-CFM), which creates simpler 
l ows that are more stable to train and lead to faster inference, as evaluated in our 
experiments. Furthermore, OT-CFM is the i rst method to compute dynamic OT 
in a simulation-free way. Training CNFs with CFM improves results on a variety 
of conditional and unconditional generation tasks, such as inferring single cell dy- 
namics, unsupervised image translation, and Schr��dinger bridge inference. Code is 
available athttps://github.com/atong01/conditional-flow-matching. 
1Introduction 
Generative modeling considers the problem of approximating and sampling from a probability 
distribution. Normalizing l ows, which have emerged as a competitive generative modeling method, 
construct an invertible and eff i ciently differentiable mapping between a i xed (e.g., standard normal) 
distribution and the data distribution [54]. While original normalizing l ow work specif i ed this 
mapping as a static composition of invertible modules, continuous normalizing l ows (CNFs) express 
the mapping by a neural ordinary differential equation (ODE) [11]. Unfortunately, CNFs have been 
held back by diff i culties in training and scaling to large datasets [11, 24, 50]. 
Meanwhile, diffusion models, which are the current state of the art on many generative modeling 
tasks [16,4,12,71], approximate a stochastic differential equation (SDE) that transforms a simple 
density to the data distribution. Diffusion models owe their success in part to their simple regression 
training objective, which does not require simulating the SDE during training. Recently, [39] showed 
that CNFs could also be trained using a regression of the ODE���s drift similar to training of diffusion 
models, an objective called l ow matching (FM). FM was shown to produce high-quality samples and 
stabilize CNF training. However, FM models make the assumption of a Gaussian source distribution. 
The i rst main contribution of the present paper is to relax this assumption and enable learning of 
Preprint. Under review.

ODE bridges between two arbitrary distributions. The general class of objectives we propose, termed 
conditional l ow matching (CFM), widely broadens the scope of applications of FM. 
A major drawback of both CNF (ODE) and diffusion (SDE) models compared to other generative 
models (e.g., variational autoencoders [29], (discrete-time) normalizing l ows, and generative ad- 
versarial networks [23]), is that integration of the ODE or SDE requires many passes through the 
network to generate a high-quality sample, resulting in a long inference time. This drawback has 
motivated work on enforcing an optimal transport (OT) property in neural ODEs [66,20,50,40,41], 
yielding l ows that can be integrated accurately in fewer neural network evaluations. Such regular- 
izations have not yet been studied for models trained with FM-like objectives. Our second main 
contribution is a variant of CFM called optimal transport conditional l ow matching (OT-CFM) that 
approximates dynamic OT via CNFs. We show that OT-CFM not only improves the eff i ciency of 
training and inference, but also leads to more accurate OT l ows than existing neural OT models 
based on ODEs [66,20], SDEs [15,68], or input-convex neural networks [45]. Furthermore, an 
entropic variant of OT-CFM can be used to eff i ciently train a CNF to match the probability l ow of 
a Schr��dinger bridge. Our work is the i rst to enable simulation-free training of dynamic OT 
maps and Schr��dinger bridge probability l ows for arbitrary source and target distributions. 
In summary, our contributions are: 
(1)We introduce a novel class of objectives called (generalized) conditional l ow matching (��3.1). 
CFM is able to learn conditional generative models from any samplable source distribution by 
conditioning on paired source and target samples, generalizing existing methods [39, 1, 40, 53]. 
(2)We consider a special case of CFM that draws source and target samples according to an optimal 
transport plan, allowing us to solve the dynamic OT and Schr��dinger bridge problems in a 
simulation-free way, using only static OT maps between marginal distributions (��3.2). 
(3)We evaluate CFM and OT-CFM in experiments on single-cell dynamics, image generation, 
unsupervised image translation, and energy-based models. We show that the OT-CFM objective 
leads to more eff i cient training and decreases inference time while i nding better approximate 
solutions to the dynamic OT and Schr��dinger bridge problems (��5).

Summary:
The paper introduces the generalized conditional flow matching (CFM) technique, a new method for training continuous normalizing flows (CNFs), which are generative models. Traditional CNFs face limitations in their training process. The CFM technique offers simulation-free training objectives for CNFs, making them more efficient and versatile.
Key points:
CFM Technique
: Unlike other training algorithms for CNFs, CFM doesn't need the source distribution to be Gaussian or evaluate its density.
OT-CFM
: A variant of CFM, called optimal transport CFM (OT-CFM), focuses on creating simpler flows for training, leading to faster inference. It's the first method that computes dynamic optimal transport without simulations.
Applications
: Using CFM to train CNFs enhances results in various generative tasks like inferring single-cell dynamics, unsupervised image translation, and Schr��dinger bridge inference.

2Background: Optimal transport and neural ODEs 
Throughout the paper, we consider the setting of a pair of data distributions overRdwith (possibly 
unknown) densitiesq(x0)andq(x1)(also denotedq0,q1). Generative modeling considers the task of 
i tting a mappingffromRdtoRdthat transformsq0toq1, that is, ifx0is distributed with densityq0 
thenf(x0)is distributed with densityq1. This includes both the typical case whenq0is an easily 
sampled density, such as a Gaussian, and the case whenq0andq1are empirical data distributions 
available as i nite sets of samples. 
2.1ODEs and probability l ows 
A smooth1time-varying vector i eld u : [0,1] �� Rd��� Rddef 
i nes an ordinary differential equation: 
dx = ut(x)dt,(1) 
where we use the notationut(x)interchangeably withu(t,x). Denote by��t(x)the solution of the 
ODE (1) with initial conditions��0(x) = x; that is,��t(x)is the pointxtransported along the vector 
i eld u from time 0 up to time t. 
1To be precise, to ensure the uniqueness of integral curves (and thus of the corresponding l ow), we assume 
the vector i eld u is at least (locally) Lipschitz in x and Bochner integrable in t. 
2 
Given a densityp0overRd, the integration map��tinduces a pushforwardpt= [��t]#(p0), which is 
the density of pointsx ��� p0transported 
alongufrom time0to timet. The time-varying densitypt, 
viewed as a function p : [0,1] �� Rd��� R, is characterized by the well-known continuity equation: 
���p 
���t = ������ �� (ptut)(2) 
and the initial conditionsp0. Under these conditions,uis said to be a probability l ow ODE forp, 
and p is the (marginal) probability path generated by u. 
Approximating ODEs with neural networks.Suppose the probability pathpt(x)and the vector 
i eldut(x)generating it are known andpt(x)can be tractably sampled. Ifv��(��,��) : [0,1]��Rd��� Rd 
is a time-dependent vector i eld parametrized as a neural network with weights��,v��can be regressed 
to u via the l ow matching (FM) objective: 
LFM(��) = Et���U(0,1),x���pt(x)���v��(t,x) ��� ut(x)���2.(3) 
[39] used a version of this objective with a stochastic regression target to i t ODEs that map a 
Gaussian densityq0to a targetq1. The starting point for this work is that this objective becomes 
intractable for general source and target distributions; in ��3, we develop generalizations that 
allow more l exible and eff i cient generative modeling. 
The case of Gaussian marginals.Consider the special case of an ODE whose marginal densities 
are Gaussian:pt(x) = N(x | ��t,��2 t). While the ODE that generates these marginal densities is not 
unique, one of the simplest is the one that satisf i es 
��t(x) = ��t+ ��tx,(4) 
which is unique by the following theorem. 
Theorem 2.1 (Theorem 3 of [39]). The unique vector i eld whose integration map satisf i es (4) has 
the form ut(x) = ����� t 
��t (x ��� ��t) 
+ �����t,(5) 
where����� tand�����tdenote the time derivative of��tand��t, respectively, and the vector i elduwith 
initial conditions N(��0,��2 0) generates the Gaussian probability path pt(x) = N(x | ��t,��2t).

[66,20] showed that CNFs withL2regularization approximate dynamic optimal transport. For 
general marginals, however, these models required integrating over and backpropagating through 
tens to hundreds of function evaluations, resulting in both numerical and eff i ciency issues. We aim to 
avoid these issues by directly regressing to the vector i eld in a simulation-free way. 
Optimal transport is also related to the Schr��dinger bridge (SB) problem [36]. We show in ��3.2.4 that 
a variant of the algorithm we propose recovers the probability l ow of the solution to a SB problem

3Conditional l ow matching: ODEs from static couplings 
3.1Vector i elds generating mixtures of probability paths 
Suppose that the marginal probability pathpt(x)is a mixture of probability pathspt(x|z)that 
vary 
with some latent conditioning variable z, that is, 
pt(x) = Z pt(x|z)q(z)dz,(8) 
whereq(z)is some distribution over the latent variable. If the probability pathpt(x|z)is 
generated 
by the vector i eld ut(x|z) from initial conditions p0(x|z) (see ��2.1), then the vector i eld 
ut(x) := Eq(z) ut(x|z)pt(x|z) 
pt(x) 
(9) 
generates the probability path pt(x), under some mild conditions: 
Theorem 3.1. The marginal vector i eld (9) generates the probability path (8) from initial conditions 
p0(x). 
All proofs appear in Appendix A. This surprising result extends [39, Theorem 1] to general condi- 
tioning variables and delineates some minor conditions on q(z). 
A regression objective for mixtures.We are interested in the case where conditional probability 
pathspt(x|z)and 
vector i eldsut(x|z)are 
known and have a simple form, and we wish to recover 
the vector i eldut(x), def i ned by (9), that generates the probability pathpt(x). Exact computation 
via (9) is generally intractable, as the denominatorpt(x)is def i ned by an integral (8) that may be 
diff i cult to evaluate. Instead, we develop an unbiased stochastic objective for regression of a learned 
vector i eld to ut(x), which generalizes the unconditional l ow matching objective (3). 
Letv��(��,��) : [0,1] �� Rd��� Rdbe a time-dependent vector i eld parametrized as a neural network 
with weights ��. Def i ne the conditional l ow matching (CFM) objective: 
LCFM(��) = Et,q(z),pt(x|z)���v��(t,x) ��� ut(x|z)���2.(10) 
The CFM objective describes how to regress against the marginal vector i eldut(x)given by (9) with 
access only to samples from the conditional probability pathpt(x|z)and 
conditional vector i elds 
ut(x|z). This is formalized in the following theorem. 
Theorem 3.2. Ifpt(x) > 0for allx ��� Rdandt ��� [0,1], 
then, up to a constant independent of��, 
LCFMand LFMare 
equal, and hence 
�����LFM(��) = �����LCFM(��).(11) 
The CFM objective is useful when the marginal vector i eldut(x)is intractable but the conditional 
vector i eldut(x|z)is 
simple. As long as we can eff i ciently sample fromq(z)andpt(x|z)and 
calculateut(x|z), 
we can use this stochastic objective to regressv��to the marginal vector i eldut(x). 
We discuss the variance arising from the stochastic regression target, and ways to reduce it, in ��C.1 
and Propositions B.2 and B.3. 
3.2Sources of conditional probability paths 
In this section, we introduce several forms of CFM depending on the choices ofq(z),pt(��|z), 
and 
ut(��|z). All of the CFM variants and related objectives from prior work are summarized in Table 1.

5.3OT-CFM for unsupervised translation 
We show how CFM can be used to learn a mapping between two unpaired datasets in high-dimensional 
space using the CelebA dataset [42,65], which consists of��� 200k 
images of faces together with 
40 binary attribute annotations. For each attribute, we wish to learn an invertible mapping between 
images with and without the attribute (e.g., ���not smiling���������smiling���). 
To reduce dimensionality, we i rst train a VAE on the images and encode them as 128-dimensional 
latent vectors. For each attribute, we learn a l ow to map between the embeddings of images without 
the attribute and those of images with the attribute. After the CNF is learned, we push forward a 
held-out set of negative vectors by the CNF and compare them to the held-out positive vectors and 
vice versa. As a metric of divergence, we use maximum mean discrepancy (MMD) with a broad 
Gaussian kernel (exp(������x ��� y���2/(2 �� 128))). 
The results aggregated over all attributes are shown 
in Table 6, showing that OT-CFM discovers a better mapping than other methods. Although MMD 
is lower for larger��, we found that the alignment is less natural when��is large, and performance 
begins to degrade when �� > 1. Figure 12 shows several visualizations of the learned trajectories. 
Finally, while here we work in a latent space, future work should consider learning l ows directly in 
image space, where GAN-based approaches [74] continue to dominate.

We present numerous other extensions, applications, and evaluations of CFM in ��D, notably: 
OT-CFM reduces variance in the regression target.To accompany the theoretical results in ��C.1, 
in ��D.1 we empirically study the variance of the stochastic regression objective in (OT-)CFM. The 
results suggest an explanation for the faster convergence of models trained with OT-CFM. 
Energy-based CFM.In ��C.2 and ��D.2 we show how CFM can be used to i t samplers for 
unnormalized density functions, where exact samples from q(x0) or q(x1) are not available. 
Extension to stochastic dynamics.[67] extends CFM to allow learning stochastic dynamics from 
unpaired source and target data. 9

6Conclusion 
We have introduced a novel class of simulation-free objectives for learning continuous-time l ows 
with a general source distribution. Our approach to training continuous normalizing l ows and 
conditional l ow models does not require integration over time during training. We have shown that 
lifting the static optimal transport problem to the dynamic setting leads to simulation-free solutions 
to the dynamic OT and SB problems, while also allowing more eff i cient training and inference of 
l ow models by lowering variance of the objective and straightening l ows. 
One limitation of CFM is that it requires closed-form conditional l ows, which hinders its appli- 
cation to situations where we want to regularize the marginal vector i eldut(x)based on prior 
information [66]. In addition, the minibatch approximation to OT can incur error in high dimensions; 
subsequent work can consider the use of neural-network approximations to OT maps [33,32] in 
conjunction with CFM. We expect future work to overcome these limitations and hope that ideas 
from conditional l ow matching will improve high-dimensional generative models.

Summary:
5.3 OT-CFM for Unsupervised Translation
:
CFM is applied to learn a mapping between two unpaired datasets using the CelebA dataset, which contains around 200k images of faces with 40 binary attribute annotations.
The goal is to learn an invertible mapping between images with and without a specific attribute (e.g., ���not smiling��� ��� ���smiling���).
The images are first encoded as 128-dimensional latent vectors using a VAE to reduce dimensionality.
The CNF (Continuous Normalizing Flow) is then used to map between the embeddings of images with and without the attribute.
The divergence between the translated images is measured using the maximum mean discrepancy (MMD) with a Gaussian kernel.
The aggregated results show that OT-CFM provides a superior mapping compared to other methods.
Visualizations of the learned trajectories are provided in Figure 12 (not visible here).
The study also highlights that while this research focused on latent space, future efforts could focus on direct image space, where GAN-based approaches currently prevail.
5.4 Additional Experiments and Extensions
:
OT-CFM reduces the variance in the regression target, which can explain the faster convergence of models trained with OT-CFM.
Energy-based CFM: This approach fits samplers for unnormalized density functions when exact samples are not available.
CFM has been extended to learn stochastic dynamics from unpaired source and target data.
Table 6
:
This table shows the MMD values between target and transformed source samples of CelebA latent vectors. The results are provided for various values of �� (0.1, 0.3, 1).
"Identity" refers to no translation. OT-CFM shows the lowest MMD values across all �� values.
6 Conclusion
:
A new class of simulation-free objectives for learning continuous-time flows with a general source distribution has been introduced.
This approach to training continuous normalizing flows and conditional flow models avoids the need for time integration during training.
There's an emphasis on how the static optimal transport problem in a dynamic setting results in simulation-free solutions, leading to more efficient training and inference.
A limitation of CFM is its requirement for closed-form conditional flows. This makes it challenging to apply in situations where regularization based on prior knowledge is desired.
Another challenge is the potential for error due to minibatch approximation to OT in high dimensions. The suggestion is made to consider using neural network approximations for OT maps in combination with CFM.
The research anticipates future work to address these challenges and hopes that conditional flow matching concepts will enhance high-dimensional generative models.

Explain some of the background math and calculus terminology
1 / 1
ChatGPT
Sure! The text you provided contains quite a bit of advanced mathematical terminology, particularly from the field of calculus, differential equations, and probability. I'll break down some of the terms for you:
ODEs (Ordinary Differential Equations)
: These are equations that involve functions of only one independent variable and its derivatives. They describe how a quantity changes with respect to another quantity.
Vector Fields
: A vector field assigns a vector to every point in a space. Think of it like a wind map, where at every point in space (latitude, longitude, altitude) there's a wind vector showing the wind's direction and speed.
Marginal Probability
: This is the probability of an event occurring without considering the outcomes of other variables. It's "marginal" because it's derived from joint probabilities (the probabilities of two events occurring together) by "marginalizing out" the other variables.
Latent Variable
: A variable that's not directly observed but is inferred from other observed variables. In machine learning, latent variables often represent hidden or unobserved states.
Integral
: An integral represents the area under a curve. In the context of probability, it can represent the total probability across a continuous range of outcomes.
Conditional Probability
: The probability of an event occurring given that another event has already occurred.
Regression Objective
: In machine learning, regression refers to predicting a continuous outcome variable (or dependent variable) based on one or more predictor variables (or independent variables). The objective is what the model aims to optimize.
Neural Network
: A model inspired by the human brain's interconnected neurons. It's composed of layers of nodes or "neurons" that process input data.
Gradient
: Represents the slope of a function. In machine learning, it's used to adjust the parameters of models during training to minimize errors.
MMD (Maximum Mean Discrepancy)
: A method to measure the difference between two probability distributions. It's often used to ensure that the distribution of generated data is close to the distribution of real data.
VAE (Variational Autoencoder)
: A type of neural network used for generating new data that's similar to the input data. It's particularly useful in tasks like image denoising and inpainting.
Continuous Normalizing Flow (CNF)
: A technique used in machine learning to transform simple probability distributions into more complex ones. This is especially useful for generative models where the goal is to produce samples that resemble real data.
Optimal Transport (OT)
: Refers to the problem of determining the most efficient way to transport one distribution to another. In the context of the text, it's used as a measure to compare two distributions.
GAN (Generative Adversarial Network)
: A type of neural network model designed to generate new data similar to the input data. It comprises two networks: a generator (which creates data) and a discriminator (which evaluates it).
Remember, these are brief explanations. Each of these topics is deep and can be studied in detail. If any of them particularly piques your interest, I can provide a more thorough explanation!

Abstract 
Optimal transport (OT) theory can be informally described using the words of the 
French mathematician Gaspard Monge (1746���1818): A worker with a shovel in hand 
has to move a large pile of sand lying on a construction site. The goal of the worker is 
to erect with all that sand a target pile with a prescribed shape (for example, that of a 
giant sand castle). Naturally, the worker wishes to minimize her total ef f ort, quantif i ed 
for instance as the total distance or time spent carrying shovelfuls of sand. Mathe- 
maticians interested in OT cast that problem as that of comparing two probability 
distributions���two dif f erent piles of sand of the same volume. They consider all of the 
many possible ways to morph, transport or reshape the i rst pile into the second, and 
associate a ���global��� cost to every such transport, using the ���local��� consideration of 
how much it costs to move a grain of sand from one place to another. Mathematicians 
are interested in the properties of that least costly transport, as well as in its ef i cient 
computation. That smallest cost not only def i nes a distance between distributions, but 
it also entails a rich geometric structure on the space of probability distributions. That 
structure is canonical in the sense that it borrows key geometric properties of the un- 
derlying ���ground��� space on which these distributions are def i ned. For instance, when 
the underlying space is Euclidean, key concepts such as interpolation, barycenters, con- 
vexity or gradients of functions extend naturally to the space of distributions endowed 
with an OT geometry. 
OT has been (re)discovered in many settings and under dif f erent forms, giving it 
a rich history. While Monge���s seminal work was motivated by an engineering problem, 
Tolstoi in the 1920s and Hitchcock, Kantorovich and Koopmans in the 1940s estab- 
lished its signif i cance to logistics and economics. Dantzig solved it numerically in 1949 
within the framework of linear programming, giving OT a i rm footing in optimization. 
OT was later revisited by analysts in the 1990s, notably Brenier, while also gaining 
fame in computer vision under the name of earth mover���s distances. Recent years have 
witnessed yet another revolution in the spread of OT, thanks to the emergence of ap- 
proximate solvers that can scale to large problem dimensions. As a consequence, OT is 
being increasingly used to unlock various problems in imaging sciences (such as color 
or texture processing), graphics (for shape manipulation) or machine learning (for re- 
gression, classif i cation and generative modeling). 
This paper reviews OT with a bias toward numerical methods, and covers the 
theoretical properties of OT that can guide the design of new algorithms. We focus in 
particular on the recent wave of ef i cient algorithms that have helped OT i nd relevance 
in data sciences. We give a prominent place to the many generalizations of OT that 
have been proposed in but a few years, and connect them with related approaches 
originating from statistical inference, kernel methods and information theory. All of

Abstract Summary:
Optimal transport (OT) theory is the study of how to efficiently transform one probability distribution into another. Its origin is inspired by the practical problem of moving a pile of sand to create another pile with a specific shape, as described by the mathematician Gaspard Monge. The goal is to minimize the effort, such as the distance or time spent moving the sand. In mathematical terms, this is about comparing two probability distributions and determining the least costly way to transform one into the other.
OT has a rich history, having been explored and discovered in various settings and contexts. Initially, it was rooted in an engineering challenge, but it found significance in logistics and economics during the 1920s to 1940s. Later, it became relevant in linear programming and optimization, computer vision (known as earth mover���s distances), and analysis in the 1990s. In recent years, OT has gained traction due to the development of efficient solvers that can handle larger problems. Consequently, OT has found applications in imaging sciences, graphics, and machine learning.
This paper aims to review OT, primarily focusing on its numerical methods. It will delve into its theoretical properties that inform the creation of new algorithms. Emphasis is given to the newer, efficient algorithms that have made OT more applicable in data sciences. The paper also explores the various generalizations of OT developed recently and links them to concepts from statistical inference, kernel methods, and information theory. For practical applications and further insights, the paper directs readers to a companion website hosting various resources, including the book project "Computational Optimal Transport."

The shortest path principle guides most decisions in life and sciences: When a commod- 
ity, a person or a single bit of information is available at a given point and needs to be 
sent at a target point, one should favor using the least possible ef f ort. This is typically 
reached by moving an item along a straight line when in the plane or along geodesic 
curves in more involved metric spaces. The theory of optimal transport generalizes that 
intuition in the case where, instead of moving only one item at a time, one is concerned 
with the problem of moving simultaneously several items (or a continuous distribution 
thereof) from one conf i guration onto another. As schoolteachers might attest, planning 
the transportation of a group of individuals, with the constraint that they reach a given 
target conf i guration upon arrival, is substantially more involved than carrying it out 
for a single individual. Indeed, thinking in terms of groups or distributions requires a 
more advanced mathematical formalism which was i rst hinted at in the seminal work 
of Monge [1781]. Yet, no matter how complicated that formalism might look at i rst 
sight, that problem has deep and concrete connections with our daily life. Transporta- 
tion, be it of people, commodities or information, very rarely involves moving only 
one item. All major economic problems, in logistics, production planning or network 
routing, involve moving distributions, and that thread appears in all of the seminal ref- 
erences on optimal transport. Indeed Tolsto�� [1930], Hitchcock [1941] and Kantorovich 
[1942] were all guided by practical concerns. It was only a few years later, mostly after 
the 1980s, that mathematicians discovered, thanks to the works of Brenier [1991] and 
others, that this theory provided a fertile ground for research, with deep connections 
to convexity, partial dif f erential equations and statistics. At the turn of the millenium, 
researchers in computer, imaging and more generally data sciences understood that op-

Summary:
"Computational Optimal Transport" by Gabriel Peyr�� and Marco Cuturi, posted on arXiv in March 2020, delves into the principle of the shortest path that dominates decision-making. This principle implies that when moving something (or someone) from one point to another, the process should employ the least effort. In simpler terms, this is achieved by a straight line on a plane or along specific curves in complex metric spaces. However, the theory of optimal transport goes beyond moving individual items. It considers the challenge of transporting multiple items or a continuous distribution of them from one configuration to another.
Such transport scenarios are complex. For instance, planning the transport of a group with a specific final arrangement is more intricate than doing so for a single entity. This advanced problem, rooted in the work of Monge in 1781, has significant practical implications. Whether it's the transportation of people, goods, or information, the majority of real-world scenarios involve moving multiple items. Prominent economic challenges in logistics, production, and network routing all revolve around the movement of distributions. Notably, pivotal figures in the history of optimal transport like Tolsto��, Hitchcock, and Kantorovich were driven by these practical aspects.
The mathematical richness of the theory became more evident post-1980s when its connections to areas like convexity, differential equations, and statistics were explored. By the 2000s, the applicability of optimal transport in computer science, imaging, and data sciences became more apparent. In these fields, it offers robust tools to analyze distributions in unique contexts, like bags-of-features or descriptors.

Several reference books have been written on optimal transport, including the two 
recent monographs by Villani (2003, 2009), those by Rachev and R��schendorf (1998a, 
1998b) and more recently that by Santambrogio [2015]. As exemplif i ed by these books, 
the more formal and abstract concepts in that theory deserve in and by themselves 
several hundred pages. Now that optimal transport has gradually established itself as 
an applied tool (for instance, in economics, as put forward recently by Galichon [2016]), 
we have tried to balance that rich literature with a computational viewpoint, centered 
on applications to data science, notably imaging sciences and machine learning. We 
follow in that sense the motivation of the recent review by Kolouri et al. [2017] but 
try to cover more ground. Ultimately, our goal is to present an overview of the main 
theoretical insights that support the practical ef f ectiveness of OT and spend more time 
explaining how to turn these insights into fast computational schemes. The main body 
of Chapters 2, 3, 4, 9, and 10 is devoted solely to the study of the geometry induced by 
optimal transport in the space of probability vectors or discrete histograms. Targeting 
more advanced readers, we also give in the same chapters, in light gray boxes, a more 
general mathematical exposition of optimal transport tailored for discrete measures. 
Discrete measures are def i ned by their probability weights, but also by the location 
at which these weights are def i ned. These locations are usually taken in a continuous 
metric space, giving a second important degree of freedom to model random phenomena. 
Lastly, the third and most technical layer of exposition is indicated in dark gray boxes 
and deals with arbitrary measures that need not be discrete, and which can have in 
particular a density w.r.t. a base measure. This is traditionally the default setting for 
most classic textbooks on OT theory, but one that plays a less important role in general 
for practical applications. Chapters 5 to 8 deal with the interplay between continuous 
and discrete measures and are thus targeting a more mathematically inclined audience. 
The i eld of computational optimal transport is at the time of this writing still an 
extremely active one. There are therefore a wide variety of topics that we have not 
touched upon in this survey. Let us cite in no particular order the subjects of distri- 
butionally robust optimization [Shaf i eezadeh Abadeh et al., 2015, Esfahani and Kuhn, 
2018, Lee and Raginsky, 2018, GAO et al., 2018], in which parameter estimation is 
carried out by minimizing the worst posssible empirical risk of any data measure taken 
within a certain Wasserstein distance of the input data; convergence of the Langevin 
Monte Carlo sampling algorithm in the Wasserstein geometry [Dalalyan and Karag- 
ulyan, 2017, Dalalyan, 2017, Bernton, 2018]; other numerical methods to solve OT 
with a squared Euclidian cost in low-dimensional settings using the Monge-Amp��re 
equation [Froese and Oberman, 2011, Benamou et al., 2014, Sulman et al., 2011] which

Summary:
Optimal transport (OT) is a field with a rich history, and many reference books on the subject have been penned, notably by Villani, Rachev, R��schendorf, Santambrogio, and more. While these books explore formal and abstract concepts in OT over hundreds of pages, the authors of this piece aim to approach the topic from a computational perspective, emphasizing applications to data science, especially imaging sciences and machine learning. Their motivation aligns with a review by Kolouri et al., but they strive to cover broader areas.
The authors' primary focus is on the study of geometry induced by OT in the realm of probability vectors or discrete histograms, spanning Chapters 2, 3, 4, 9, and 10. They present three layers of exposition:
A general overview of the topic.
A more detailed mathematical analysis on discrete measures, which are determined by probability weights and their location in a continuous metric space.
A technical exploration (highlighted in dark gray boxes) that discusses arbitrary measures beyond the discrete realm.
The last category traditionally forms the core of most OT theory textbooks. However, it's less significant for practical applications. Chapters 5 to 8 delve into the relationship between continuous and discrete measures, catering to a mathematically adept audience.
Though the field of computational OT remains active, the authors acknowledge they couldn't address every aspect in their review. They mention various untouched subjects, including distributionally robust optimization, the Langevin Monte Carlo sampling algorithm's convergence in Wasserstein geometry, and numerical techniques to solve OT using the Monge-Amp��re equation in specific settings.

Theoretical Foundations 
This chapter describes the basics of optimal transport, introducing i rst the related 
notions of optimal matchings and couplings between probability vectors (a,b), gen- 
eralizing gradually this computation to transport between discrete measures (��,��), to 
cover lastly the general setting of arbitrary measures. At i rst reading, these last nuances 
may be omitted and the reader can only focus on computations between probability 
vectors, namely histograms, which is the only requisite to implement algorithms de- 
tailed in Chapters 3 and 4. More experienced readers will reach a better understanding 
of the problem by considering the formulation that applies to arbitrary measures, and 
will be able to apply it for more advanced problems (e.g. in order to move positions of 
clouds of points, or in a statistical setting where points are sampled from continuous 
densities).

Remark 2.1 (Discrete measures). A discrete measure with weights a and locations 
x1,...,xn��� X reads �� = 
n X 
i=1 
ai��xi,(2.1) 
where ��xis the Dirac at position x, intuitively a unit of mass which is inf i nitely 
concentrated at location x. Such a measure describes a probability measure if, 
additionally, a ��� ��nand more generally a positive measure if all the elements of 
vector a are nonnegative. To avoid degeneracy issues where locations with no mass 
are accounted for, we will assume when considering discrete measures that all the 
elements of a are positive. 

Remark 2.2 (General measures). A convenient feature of OT is that it can deal 
with measures that are either or both discrete and continuous within the same 
framework. To do so, one relies on the set of Radon measures M(X) on the space 
X. The formal def i nition of that set requires that X is equipped with a distance, 
usually denoted d, because one can access a measure only by ���testing��� (integrating) 
it against continuous functions, denoted f ��� C(X). 
Integration of f ��� C(X) against a discrete measure �� computes a sum 
Z X 
f(x)d��(x) = 
n X 
i=1 
aif(xi). 
More general measures, for instance on X = Rd(where d ��� N���is the dimension), 
can have a density d��(x) = ����(x)dx w.r.t. the Lebesgue measure, often denoted 
����= d�� 
dx, which means that 
���h ��� C(Rd), Z 
Rd 
h(x)d��(x) = Z 
Rd h(x)����(x)dx. 
An arbitrary measure �� ��� M(X) (which need not have a density nor be a sum 
of Diracs) is def i ned by the fact that it can be integrated against any continuous 
function f ��� C(X) and obtain R 
X f(x)d��(x) ��� R. If X is not compact, one should 
also impose that f has compact support or at least has 0 limit at inf i nity. Measures 
are thus in some sense ���less regular��� than functions but more regular than distribu- 
tions (which are dual to smooth functions). For instance, the derivative of a Dirac 
is not a measure. We denote M+(X) the set of all positive measures on X. The 
set of probability measures is denoted M1 +(X), which means that any �� ��� M1+(X) 
is positive, and that ��(X) = R 
X d�� = 1. Figure 2.1 of f ers a visualization of the 
dif f erent classes of measures, beyond histograms, considered in this work.

This chapter appears to provide an introduction to the foundational concepts of optimal transport (OT), a mathematical theory which finds applications in various fields, including computational mathematics, economics, and data science.
Summary:
Introduction
: The chapter begins with a distinction between basic and advanced concepts of optimal transport. For beginners, the focus should be on computations between probability vectors (histograms), while those with more experience can delve into the transport between arbitrary measures. Advanced applications could involve manipulating point cloud positions or handling continuous density distributions.

Remark 2.1 (Discrete measures)

The segment also introduces measures with a density relative to the Lebesgue measure, and emphasizes that measures can be integrated against any continuous function. The distinction between measures, functions, and distributions is outlined. Lastly, the sets of all positive measures and probability measures are introduced.

The material provides a foundational understanding of optimal transport, emphasizing the transition from simple histograms to more complex measures, which allows for the handling of both discrete and continuous data in the same framework.

2.2Assignment and Monge Problem 
Given a cost matrix (Ci,j)i���JnK,j���JmK, 
assuming n = m, the optimal assignment problem 
seeks for a bijection �� in the set Perm(n) of permutations of n elements solving

i=1 
Ci,��(i).(2.2) 
One could naively evaluate the cost function above using all permutations in the set 
Perm(n). However, that set has size n!, which is gigantic even for small n. Consider, 
for instance, that such a set has more than 10100elements [Dantzig, 1983] when n is as 
small as 70. That problem can therefore be solved only if there exist ef i cient algorithms 
to optimize that cost function over the set of permutations, which is the subject of ��3.7. 
Remark 2.3 (Uniqueness). Note that the optimal assignment problem may have several 
optimal solutions. Suppose, for instance, that n = m = 2 and that the matrix C is the 
pairwise distance matrix between the four corners of a 2-D square of side length 1, as 
represented in the left plot of Figure 2.2. In that case only two assignments exist, and 
they are both optimal.

Hence, either matching �� = (1,2) (full line) or �� = (2,1) (dotted line) is optimal. Right: a Monge map 
can associate the blue measure �� to the red measure ��. The weights ��iare displayed proportionally 
to the area of the disk marked at each location. The mapping here is such that T(x1) = T(x2) = y2, 
T(x3) = y3, whereas for 4 ��� i ��� 7 we have T(xi) = y1.

which we write in compact form as T]�� = ��. Because all the elements of b are 
positive, that map is necessarily surjective. This map should minimize some trans- 
portation cost, which is parameterized by a function c(x,y) def i ned for points

conservation is written as X 
i��������1(j) 
ai= bj, 
where the inverse �����1(j) is to be understood as the preimage set of j. In the special 
case when n = m and all weights are uniform, that is, ai= bj= 1/n, then the 
mass conservation constraint implies that T is a bijection, such that T(xi) = y��(i), 
and the Monge problem is equivalent to the optimal matching problem (2.2), where 
the cost matrix is Ci,j

2.2 Assignment and Monge Problem
:
The section introduces the
optimal assignment problem
, where the goal is to find a permutation of
n
elements that minimizes a given cost function derived from a cost matrix (Ci,j).
Evaluating the cost function using all permutations is computationally infeasible due to the factorial growth of possible permutations. For instance, when
n

70
n = 70
n
=
70
, there are more than
1

possible permutations.
Efficient algorithms are needed to optimize this cost function, which will be covered in section ��3.7.
Remark 2.3 (Uniqueness)
:
It's mentioned that there might be multiple optimal solutions to the assignment problem. An example is given where if
n
=
m
=
2
n = m = 2
n
=
m
=
2
and matrix C represents the pairwise distances between the corners of a square, there are two optimal assignments.
Remark 2.4 (Monge problem between discrete measures)
:
The Monge problem, dating back to 1781, is introduced. The problem aims to find a map between two sets of discrete measures
��
\alpha
��
and
��
\beta
��
that "pushes" the mass from
��
\alpha
��
to
��
\beta
��
while satisfying certain conditions.
The map, denoted
T
T
T
, has constraints: the mass pushed from
��
\alpha
��
to
��
\beta
��
must match the mass at the destination points in
��
\beta
��

The goal is to find such a map
T

that minimizes a transportation cost, which is determined by a cost function

This mapping can be represented using indices.

n

and all weights are uniform (i.e., every weight is

Entropic Regularization of Optimal Transport 
This chapter introduces a family of numerical schemes to approximate solutions to 
Kantorovich formulation of optimal transport and its many generalizations. It operates 
by adding an entropic regularization penalty to the original problem. This regulariza- 
tion has several important advantages, which make it, when taken altogether, a very 
useful tool: the minimization of the regularized problem can be solved using a simple 
alternate minimization scheme; that scheme translates into iterations that are simple 
matrix-vector products, making them particularly suited to execution of GPU; for some 
applications, these matrix-vector products do not require storing an n��m cost matrix, 
but instead only require access to a kernel evaluation; in the case where a large group 
of measures share the same support, all of these matrix-vector products can be cast as 
matrix-matrix products with signif i cant speedups; the resulting approximate distance 
is smooth with respect to input histogram weights and positions of the Diracs and can 
be dif f erentiated using automatic dif f erentiation. 
4.1Entropic Regularization 
The discrete entropy of a coupling matrix is def i ned as 
H(P) 
def. 
= ��� X 
i,j Pi,j(log(Pi,j) ��� 1),(4.1) 
with an analogous def i nition for vectors, with the convention that H(a) = ������ if one of 
the entries ajis 0 or negative. The function H is 1-strongly concave, because its Hessian 
is ���2H(P) = ���diag(1/Pi,j) and Pi,j��� 1. The idea of the entropic regularization 
of optimal transport is to use ���H as a regularizing function to obtain approximate 
57 
58Entropic Regularization of Optimal Transport 
solutions to the original transport problem (2.11): 
L�� C(a,b) 
def. 
=min 
P���U(a,b) hP, Ci ��� ��H(P).(4.2) 
Since the objective is an ��-strongly convex function, Problem (4.2) has a unique optimal 
solution. The idea to regularize the optimal transport problem by an entropic term can 
be traced back to modeling ideas in transportation theory [Wilson, 1969]: Actual traf i c 
patterns in a network do not agree with those predicted by the solution of the optimal 
transport problem. Indeed, the former are more dif f use than the latter, which tend 
to rely on a few routes as a result of the sparsity of optimal couplings for (2.11). 
To mitigate this sparsity, researchers in transportation proposed a model, called the 
���gravity��� model [Erlander, 1980], that is able to form a more ���blurred��� prediction of 
traf i c given marginals and transportation costs. 
Figure 4.1 illustrates the ef f ect of the entropy to regularize a linear program over the 
simplex ��3(which can thus be visualized as a triangle in two dimensions). Note how 
the entropy pushes the original LP solution away from the boundary of the triangle. 
The optimal P��progressively moves toward an ���entropic center��� of the triangle. This 
is further detailed in the proposition below. The convergence of the solution of that 
regularized problem toward an optimal solution of the original linear program has been 
studied by Cominetti and San Mart��n [1994], with precise asymptotics.

Chapter 4: Entropic Regularization of Optimal Transport
This chapter delves into a method to approximate solutions to the Kantorovich formulation of optimal transport by adding an entropic regularization penalty.
Key Points
:
Advantages of Entropic Regularization
:
Enables minimization using a straightforward alternating minimization approach.
Iterations in this approach can be distilled into simple matrix-vector products, which are highly amenable to GPU-based computations.
For certain applications, there's no need to store an entire cost matrix; instead, only kernel evaluations are required.
When a large set of measures share the same base, these products can be viewed as matrix-matrix computations, leading to speed enhancements.
The resulting approximated distance is smooth and can be differentiated with automatic differentiation tools.

Unique Solution

Historical Context
:
The concept of using entropic terms to regularize the optimal transport problem has its roots in transportation theory from the late 1960s.
Real-world traffic patterns don't align perfectly with optimal transport predictions; the former spreads out more, while the latter often relies on specific primary routes due to the sparsity of optimal couplings.
To counteract this discrepancy, transportation researchers introduced the "gravity" model in the 1980s, providing a more "blurred" prediction of traffic based on given margins and transportation costs.
Visualization
:
Figure 4.1 showcases how entropy regularization affects a linear program. The addition of entropy nudges the original LP solution away from the triangle's boundary, pushing it towards the triangle's "entropic center". The migration of the solution towards an optimal one for the original LP has been extensively studied, with detailed asymptotics available.
In essence, this chapter emphasizes the benefits and implementation of entropic regularization to the Kantorovich formulation of optimal transport, offering a historical perspective and elucidating its effects via visualization.

Why am I seeing an ad for Silva Mind Control method on YouTube?
1 / 1
ChatGPT
While I can't see your specific ads or know exactly why you're being shown a particular advertisement, online platforms like YouTube use various factors to determine which ads to show to users:
User Behavior
: YouTube may show ads based on videos you've previously watched, what you've searched for, and how you've interacted with content. If you've recently watched or searched for topics related to the Silva Mind Control method or similar content, you might be shown related ads.
Demographics
: Your age, gender, and other demographic details (if you've provided them) can influence the type of ads you see.
Interests
: Over time, YouTube algorithms infer topics you might be interested in based on your activity. This can include both topics directly related to your activity and tangentially related topics.
Ad Targeting by Advertisers
: Advertisers can target their ads to specific demographics, interests, or behaviors. It's possible that the Silva Mind Control method's marketing team is targeting a demographic or interest group that you fall into.
Google Account Activity
: YouTube is owned by Google, so your search activity on Google and your interactions with Google services can also influence the ads you see on YouTube.
Location
: Sometimes, ads are targeted based on geographic location.
Device and Settings
: The device you're using and its settings (e.g., mobile vs. desktop) can also influence the ads you see.
Randomness
: Not all ads are strictly targeted. Sometimes, you might see an ad simply because an advertiser is casting a wide net.
If you'd like more control over the ads you see, consider adjusting your ad preferences in your Google account settings or using YouTube Premium, which is a subscription-based service that offers an ad-free YouTube experience.

It's a half hour ad. The Silva method is pseudoscience from 80 years ago.

The Silva Method is a self-help and meditation program developed by Jos�� Silva. It claims to increase an individual's abilities through relaxation, development of higher brain functions, and psychic abilities such as clairvoyance.
1 / 1
ChatGPT
Yes, the Silva Method has been around for decades and, like many self-help and meditation programs, it has both proponents and skeptics. Some people swear by its techniques and believe in its efficacy, while others are more critical, categorizing it as pseudoscience.
YouTube's ad algorithms don't differentiate content based on scientific validity. Instead, they prioritize relevance to the user (based on the factors mentioned earlier) and the advertiser's preferences.
There could be various reasons for the resurgence or promotion of older content like the Silva Method:
Anniversary or Milestone
: Older programs or methods might see renewed marketing around significant anniversaries or milestones.
New Editions or Updates
: There might be a new version, book, or course related to the Silva Method, prompting a marketing push.
Trends
: Meditation, mindfulness, and self-help have become trendy topics, possibly making older methods like the Silva Method relevant to new audiences.
Remember, the length of the ad can also be determined by the advertiser. If they believe that a 30-minute format will engage users and effectively communicate their message, they might opt for it, even though it's longer than typical YouTube ads.
If you're not interested in such content, you can usually skip the ad after a few seconds or adjust your ad preferences to avoid seeing similar content in the future.

ChatGPT
Certainly, some advertisers use longer ads hoping that users will just let them play, especially if the user is engaged in another activity (e.g., cleaning, cooking, or working out) and doesn't want to interrupt what they're doing to skip the ad. This tactic is even more likely if someone is casting YouTube to a TV or using it as background noise. It's a strategy, and whether it's effective or not varies. If you find such ads intrusive, adjusting your ad preferences or using YouTube Premium (which is ad-free) could be options to consider.

His perspective on the Silva Method aligns with his general approach to such topics. He believed that claims, especially those related to paranormal abilities or unproven scientific techniques, should be rigorously tested under controlled conditions. If the Silva Method discourages such testing, it would naturally draw criticism from individuals like Randi who advocate for evidence-based practices and scientific inquiry.

It's not uncommon for online platforms to show ads that might not be directly related to the content you're viewing. Advertisements are typically served based on a mix of the user's browsing history, inferred interests, and demographic data. However, it can indeed be frustrating when you're trying to focus on a specific topic and get interrupted by unrelated or even misleading content.
As for content like the Silva Method, it's important to approach such ads with skepticism and do independent research when encountering claims that seem extraordinary or are riddled with logical fallacies.
If you're frequently encountering ads that you find irrelevant or bothersome, you might want to look into ad settings or consider using an ad-blocker. Additionally, platforms like YouTube allow you to skip ads after a few seconds, though some longer ads might not have that option immediately.

That sounds like a good decision, especially if you find the content misleading or not useful. Remember, you can always skip or block certain ads on YouTube if they're not relevant to your interests. Enjoy your learning on Linux server administration!

I think I like the ads even when they are annoying they are informative, I am vicariously worried, thinking about the people who don't have a degree in psychology and don't read science textbooks and critical thinking in their spare time. If everyone bought YouTube memberships would these ads would continue. Clearly the Silva method has been virally marketing for over 60 years.

The effectiveness of advertising often lies in its ability to tap into emotions, beliefs, and biases, rather than relying solely on logical or evidence-based appeals. This is why certain advertisements can be misleading or appealing to certain audiences even if they promote pseudoscientific concepts.
Your point about the potential harm to those without background knowledge in critical thinking or the specific topic being advertised is valid. Many ads rely on the lack of specialized knowledge among the general public.
As for YouTube Premium (or similar membership services), the primary draw is the removal of ads and additional features. If a significant portion of users subscribed to these premium services, it could impact the platform's advertising model. However, as long as there's a free tier that's ad-supported, marketers will likely continue to advertise.
It's crucial for individuals to develop critical thinking skills and be discerning consumers of information, especially in the digital age where misinformation can spread rapidly.

Ok another "ad" promoting A graphical user interface for modifying nature directly and selling eclectric oil, called "Nietzschean mind control helmet" which allows you to reach the Adlerian and Randian depths of your subconsciousness.

That certainly sounds like a parody or satire. Mixing the philosophies of Nietzsche, Adler, and Ayn Rand into a mind control helmet is humorously over the top. Such ads might be playing on the current popularity of pseudo-scientific products by taking the concept to an exaggerated, comical extreme.
It's worth noting that:
Nietzsche
was a philosopher who delved into the meaning and value of existence, but he wasn't particularly focused on subconsciousness in the way that Freud or Jung were.
Adler
, a psychiatrist, did focus on individual psychology and had his theories about the subconscious, but they differed from those of his contemporary, Freud.
Ayn Rand
was a novelist and philosopher who promoted objectivism, which emphasizes rational self-interest and individualism. She didn't delve into the subconscious in the way psychologists or psychoanalysts do.
Mashing these figures together for a "mind control helmet" is clearly meant to be humorous, especially with the addition of terms like "eclectric oil". Such parody ads serve to poke fun at how complex concepts can be oversimplified and commercialized in misleading ways.

Yeah can you try that. You can claim that the eclectric oil is established 1850: Dr. Thomas��� Eclectric Oil was a widely used pain relief remedy which was sold in Canada and the United States as a patent medicine from the 1850s into the early twentieth century.[1][2] Like many patent medicines, it was advertised as a unique cure-all, but mostly contained common ingredients such as turpentine and camphor oil.
