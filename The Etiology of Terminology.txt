Language is a defining feature of humanity, and for centuries, philosophers and scientists have contemplated its true purpose. We use language to share information and exchange ideas ��� but is it more than that? Do we use language not just to communicate, but to think?



In the June 19 issue of the journal Nature, McGovern Institute for Brain Research neuroscientist Evelina Fedorenko and colleagues argue that we do not. Language, they say, is primarily a tool for communication.



Fedorenko acknowledges that there is an intuitive link between language and thought. Many people experience an inner voice that seems to narrate their own thoughts. And it���s not unreasonable to expect that well-spoken, articulate individuals are also clear thinkers. But as compelling as these associations can be, they are not evidence that we actually use language to think.
 
���I think there are a few strands of intuition and confusions that have led people to believe very strongly that language is the medium of thought,��� she says. ���But when they are pulled apart thread by thread, they don���t really hold up to empirical scrutiny.���

Separating language and thought
For centuries, language���s potential role in facilitating thinking was nearly impossible to evaluate scientifically. But neuroscientists and cognitive scientists now have tools that enable a more rigorous consideration of the idea. Evidence from both fields, which Fedorenko, MIT brain and cognitive scientist and linguist Edward Gibson, and University of California at Berkeley cognitive scientist Steven Piantadosi review in their Nature Perspective, supports the idea that language is a tool for communication, not for thought.



���What we���ve learned by using methods that actually tell us about the engagement of the linguistic processing mechanisms is that those mechanisms are not really engaged when we think,��� Fedorenko says. Also, she adds, ���you can take those mechanisms away, and it seems that thinking can go on just fine.���

Over the past 20 years, Fedorenko and other neuroscientists have advanced our understanding of what happens in the brain as it generates and understands language. Now, using functional MRI to find parts of the brain that are specifically engaged when someone reads or listens to sentences or passages, they can reliably identify an individual���s language-processing network. Then they can monitor those brain regions while the person performs other tasks, from solving a sudoku puzzle to reasoning about other people���s beliefs.



���Pretty much everything we���ve tested so far, we don���t see any evidence of the engagement of the language mechanisms,��� Fedorenko says. ���Your language system is basically silent when you do all sorts of thinking.���



That���s consistent with observations from people who have lost the ability to process language due to an injury or stroke. Severely affected patients can be completely unable to process words, yet this does not interfere with their ability to solve math problems, play chess, or plan for future events. ���They can do all the things that they could do before their injury. They just can���t take those mental representations and convert them into a format which would allow them to talk about them with others,��� Fedorenko says. ���If language gives us the core representations that we use for reasoning, then ��� destroying the language system should lead to problems in thinking as well, and it really doesn���t.���



Conversely, intellectual impairments do not always associate with language impairment; people with intellectual disability disorders or neuropsychiatric disorders that limit their ability to think and reason do not necessarily have problems with basic linguistic functions. Just as language does not appear to be necessary for thought, Fedorenko and colleagues conclude that it is also not sufficient to produce clear thinking.

Language optimization
In addition to arguing that language is unlikely to be used for thinking, the scientists considered its suitability as a communication tool, drawing on findings from linguistic analyses. Analyses across dozens of diverse languages, both spoken and signed, have found recurring features that make them easy to produce and understand. ���It turns out that pretty much any property you look at, you can find evidence that languages are optimized in a way that makes information transfer as efficient as possible,��� Fedorenko says.



That���s not a new idea, but it has held up as linguists analyze larger corpora across more diverse sets of languages, which has become possible in recent years as the field has assembled corpora that are annotated for various linguistic features. Such studies find that across languages, sounds and words tend to be pieced together in ways that minimize effort for the language producer without muddling the message. For example, commonly used words tend to be short, while words whose meanings depend on one another tend to cluster close together in sentences. Likewise, linguists have noted features that help languages convey meaning despite potential ���signal distortions,��� whether due to attention lapses or ambient noise.



���All of these features seem to suggest that the forms of languages are optimized to make communication easier,��� Fedorenko says, pointing out that such features would be irrelevant if language was primarily a tool for internal thought.



���Given that languages have all these properties, it���s likely that we use language for communication,��� she says. She and her coauthors conclude that as a powerful tool for transmitting knowledge, language reflects the sophistication of human cognition ��� but does not give rise to it.

The article from MIT highlights a significant finding by neuroscientists Evelina Fedorenko and colleagues, suggesting that language is predominantly a tool for communication rather than thought. Published in the journal Nature, their research separates the roles of language and cognition, demonstrating through empirical evidence that linguistic mechanisms are not engaged during non-verbal thinking tasks.
Functional MRI studies and observations of individuals with language-processing impairments reveal that cognitive functions like solving puzzles or reasoning persist even when language abilities are compromised. This indicates that thought processes can occur independently of language. Additionally, linguistic analyses show that languages are optimized for efficient communication, further supporting the notion that language primarily serves to facilitate information transfer between individuals rather than internal thought processes.

I can't read the article yet until I do a few more edits on Wikipedia. However the article doesn't seem that surprising to me in that I have aphantasia and anendophasia.
ChatGPT
Your experience with aphantasia (the inability to visualize images) and anendophasia (the inability to experience an internal monologue) aligns with the findings of the article. The research suggests that thought processes can occur independently of language and visualization, which fits with your personal experience. People with aphantasia and anendophasia still engage in complex thinking and reasoning, further supporting the idea that language and visual imagery are not essential for thought. This underscores the brain's ability to utilize different mechanisms for cognitive processes.

How do the philosophies of Bouveresse and Badiou explore the relationship between Wittgenstein and Heidegger?
ChatGPT
The philosophies of Jacques Bouveresse and Alain Badiou offer distinct perspectives on the relationship between Ludwig Wittgenstein and Martin Heidegger, two of the most influential philosophers of the 20th century.
Jacques Bouveresse
1. Critical Realism and Clarity:
Bouveresse, a scholar deeply influenced by Wittgenstein, emphasizes the importance of clarity, precision, and a critical realist approach in philosophy. He often contrasts Wittgenstein's commitment to clear, rigorous analysis of language with Heidegger's more obscure and speculative style.
2. Wittgenstein's Analytical Tradition:
Bouveresse appreciates Wittgenstein's contribution to the analytical tradition, focusing on the ordinary use of language to dissolve philosophical confusions. He believes that Wittgenstein's later work, particularly the "Philosophical Investigations," offers valuable insights into how philosophical problems often arise from misunderstandings of our language.
3. Heidegger's Existential and Ontological Approach:
In contrast, Bouveresse is critical of Heidegger's existential and ontological approach, viewing it as unnecessarily obscure and laden with metaphysical speculation. He sees Heidegger's focus on Being and his complex terminology as less helpful in addressing concrete philosophical issues.
4. The Role of Language:
Bouveresse highlights the different roles that language plays in the philosophies of Wittgenstein and Heidegger. For Wittgenstein, language is a tool for communication and a medium to clarify thoughts. Heidegger, however, sees language as the "house of Being," a more mystical and profound conception that Bouveresse finds problematic and unclear.
Alain Badiou
1. Divergence from Both Philosophers:
Badiou, although less focused on a direct comparison between Wittgenstein and Heidegger, offers a critical perspective on both. His philosophy, grounded in mathematics and ontology, diverges significantly from both Wittgenstein's linguistic analysis and Heidegger's existential phenomenology.
2. Wittgenstein and the Limits of Language:
Badiou acknowledges Wittgenstein's contributions to understanding the limits of language and the idea that philosophical problems often stem from language misuse. However, he finds Wittgenstein's approach too restrictive, limiting philosophy to linguistic analysis and neglecting the more profound ontological questions that Badiou believes are central.
3. Heidegger and the Question of Being:
Badiou appreciates Heidegger's focus on the question of Being and his attempt to address fundamental ontological issues. However, he critiques Heidegger's approach for its lack of mathematical rigor and its tendency towards a poetic rather than a systematic method.
4. The Role of Truth:
Central to Badiou's philosophy is the concept of truth, which he believes transcends language and ordinary experience. This places him at odds with Wittgenstein's linguistic limitations and Heidegger's existential focus. Badiou seeks to establish a new foundation for philosophy based on mathematical ontology and the event, which he sees as producing new truths that are not confined by linguistic or existential constraints.
Summary
Bouveresse
: Emphasizes the clarity and critical realism of Wittgenstein's approach, critical of Heidegger's obscure existential and ontological methods. He focuses on the practical use of language to dissolve philosophical confusion.
Badiou
: Critiques both Wittgenstein and Heidegger for different reasons, seeking a more rigorous foundation in mathematics and ontology. He appreciates Heidegger's focus on Being but rejects his method, while finding Wittgenstein's linguistic limits too restrictive.
Both philosophers engage with Wittgenstein and Heidegger in ways that highlight their own philosophical commitments and critiques, offering valuable perspectives on the relationship between these two giants of 20th-century thought.

Any connections with the earlier article?
ChatGPT
The article about Evelina Fedorenko and colleagues' research on language as a tool for communication rather than thought intersects intriguingly with the philosophies of Jacques Bouveresse and Alain Badiou, especially in their analyses of Wittgenstein and Heidegger.
Jacques Bouveresse
Language as a Tool for Clarity
:
Bouveresse, drawing from Wittgenstein, would likely agree with the article���s claim that language is primarily for communication rather than thought. Wittgenstein���s later philosophy, which Bouveresse champions, focuses on how language functions in practice, emphasizing its role in clear and effective communication.
The article���s emphasis on empirical evidence that linguistic mechanisms are not engaged in non-verbal thinking aligns with Wittgenstein's idea that philosophical problems arise from misunderstandings of language, reinforcing Bouveresse's view on the importance of clarity and practical use of language.
Critique of Heidegger���s Approach
:
Bouveresse���s critique of Heidegger���s more abstract and metaphysical approach to language and thought can be seen in the article's dismissal of language as the core of thought. Heidegger���s view of language as the ���house of Being��� suggests a deeper, intrinsic connection between language and thought, which contrasts with the article���s findings that thinking can occur independently of linguistic capabilities.
Alain Badiou
Limits of Language
:
The article���s perspective that language serves communication rather than thought parallels Badiou���s critique of Wittgenstein���s linguistic limits. Badiou argues for the existence of truths beyond language, which resonates with the finding that cognitive functions persist without linguistic engagement, suggesting that language is not the fundamental basis for all thought.
Heidegger���s Existential Focus
:
While Badiou appreciates Heidegger���s engagement with profound ontological questions, the article���s evidence against language as a medium of thought challenges Heidegger���s existential focus on language. This supports Badiou���s view that significant truths and ontological realities transcend linguistic expression.
Connections to the Research Findings
Separation of Language and Thought
:
Both Bouveresse���s and Badiou���s interpretations support the notion that language is not the sole medium for thought, aligning with the article���s findings. Bouveresse���s emphasis on practical language use and Badiou���s focus on truths beyond language both highlight the multifaceted nature of cognitive processes, independent of linguistic structures.
Empirical Evidence
:
The neuroscientific evidence presented in the article, showing that language mechanisms are not engaged in non-verbal thinking tasks, provides empirical support for philosophical positions that prioritize other aspects of cognition over linguistic analysis. This aligns with Bouveresse���s call for clarity and Badiou���s broader ontological inquiries.
Summary
The article���s insights on the primary role of language as a tool for communication rather than thought can be seen as reinforcing and intersecting with Bouveresse's and Badiou's critiques and appreciations of Wittgenstein and Heidegger. Bouveresse���s alignment with Wittgenstein���s practical use of language and Badiou���s pursuit of truths beyond linguistic confines both find empirical support in the research, emphasizing that language, while crucial for communication, is not the exclusive medium for human thought.

Include a reference to prerational intelligence in animals and Arnie Cox mimetic proxy theory in music and embodied cognition
ChatGPT
The article's insights on language being primarily a tool for communication rather than thought can be further contextualized by considering concepts such as prerational intelligence in animals and Arnie Cox's mimetic proxy theory in music and embodied cognition. These ideas provide additional layers to understanding how cognition can function independently of language, reinforcing the distinctions made by both Jacques Bouveresse and Alain Badiou in their philosophical explorations.
Prerational Intelligence in Animals
Prerational intelligence in animals refers to the cognitive abilities exhibited by non-human animals that do not rely on language. Animals demonstrate complex behaviors such as problem-solving, social interactions, and planning without the use of linguistic constructs. This aligns with the article's findings that cognitive functions can proceed without linguistic engagement.
Bouveresse and Wittgenstein
: Bouveresse, building on Wittgenstein���s work, might use prerational intelligence to illustrate how clear thinking and understanding can occur through non-linguistic means. Wittgenstein���s emphasis on the practical use of language could be seen as a recognition that not all thought requires language, similar to how animals operate.
Badiou���s Ontology
: Badiou���s interest in truths that transcend language finds a parallel in prerational intelligence, suggesting that fundamental aspects of cognition and reality are not confined to linguistic expression. The sophisticated behaviors of animals without language support Badiou's idea that thought and understanding can exist independently of linguistic frameworks.
Arnie Cox���s Mimetic Proxy Theory in Music and Embodied Cognition
Arnie Cox���s mimetic proxy theory posits that listeners engage with music by internally simulating the physical actions they believe produce the sounds. This theory emphasizes the role of embodied cognition, where understanding and meaning arise from physical and sensory experiences rather than linguistic processes.
Embodied Cognition and Language
: The theory supports the notion that cognition is deeply rooted in the body and sensory experiences, which can function without linguistic mediation. This aligns with the article's findings that language is not necessary for thought, as embodied cognition provides an alternative pathway for understanding and processing experiences.
Bouveresse���s Practical Language Use
: Bouveresse���s focus on practical language use resonates with the idea that much of human cognition operates through direct interaction with the world, not just through abstract linguistic reasoning. Cox���s theory exemplifies how music understanding relies on mimetic, non-linguistic processes.
Badiou���s Philosophical Truths
: Badiou might see mimetic proxy theory as supporting his view that profound truths and understanding arise from experiences beyond linguistic confines. The embodied nature of musical engagement highlights how cognition can encompass more than just language, involving direct, physical, and sensory interactions.
Integrating with the Article
The perspectives of Bouveresse and Badiou, enriched by the concepts of prerational intelligence and mimetic proxy theory, further illuminate the article���s assertion that language is a tool for communication rather than a medium of thought. These examples illustrate that cognitive abilities, whether in animals or humans engaging with music, can operate independently of language, supporting the idea that thought processes are not solely tied to linguistic mechanisms.
Summary
Prerational Intelligence
: Demonstrates that complex cognition in animals occurs without language, reinforcing the idea that thought is not confined to linguistic processes.
Mimetic Proxy Theory
: Highlights the role of embodied cognition in understanding music, suggesting that meaningful cognitive experiences can occur without language.
These perspectives, integrated with Bouveresse���s and Badiou���s philosophies, align with the research findings, emphasizing that while language is crucial for communication, it is not the sole foundation of thought. This multifaceted understanding underscores the diverse mechanisms through which cognition operates, independent of linguistic constraints.

I guess it really depends on how you define language, I tend to think of it as any generating function with a selection mechanism.
ChatGPT
The definition of language as any generating function with a selection mechanism offers a broader and more inclusive perspective that can accommodate various forms of communication and cognition beyond human verbal language. This conceptualization aligns with and enhances the discussion of the research findings, as well as the philosophical perspectives of Jacques Bouveresse, Alain Badiou, and the ideas of prerational intelligence and Arnie Cox's mimetic proxy theory. Here���s how this broader definition can integrate and extend these insights:
Language as a Generating Function with a Selection Mechanism
1. Prerational Intelligence in Animals
:
Broader Definition
: If language includes any generating function with a selection mechanism, then the communication methods and cognitive processes of animals could be seen as forms of language. Animals generate behaviors (functions) and select appropriate responses based on environmental cues and social interactions.
Reinforcement of Findings
: This definition supports the article���s assertion that cognitive functions can operate independently of human language, as it acknowledges that animals' prerational intelligence involves sophisticated, language-like processes.
2. Arnie Cox���s Mimetic Proxy Theory
:
Embodied Cognition as Language
: Understanding music through mimetic actions involves generating mental simulations and selecting responses based on sensory and motor experiences. This can be seen as a form of language in the broader sense, where embodied cognition is a generative function with a selection mechanism.
Cognitive Independence
: This perspective aligns with the article���s findings by demonstrating that meaningful cognitive processes (such as those in music) do not rely solely on traditional linguistic structures.
Philosophical Perspectives
Jacques Bouveresse
:
Clarity and Practical Use
: Bouveresse's emphasis on clear and practical language aligns with the idea that language encompasses various generating functions and selection mechanisms. By this definition, practical language use can include non-verbal forms of communication and thought processes, supporting the idea that thought can be independent of traditional language.
Critique of Heidegger
: Bouveresse's critique of Heidegger���s abstract approach gains additional support. If language is broadly defined, Heidegger���s focus on existential and ontological aspects of language might be seen as unnecessarily restrictive or complex compared to more practical and clear applications.
Alain Badiou
:
Transcending Linguistic Limits
: Badiou's interest in truths beyond linguistic confines is supported by the broader definition of language. This perspective allows for a more inclusive understanding of how truths and cognitive processes can be generated and selected through various means, not just through verbal language.
Ontological Inquiries
: By defining language broadly, Badiou���s ontological inquiries can incorporate a wider range of cognitive and communicative processes, reinforcing his idea that significant truths are not limited by traditional linguistic boundaries.
Integrating with the Article
The broader definition of language as any generating function with a selection mechanism provides a more comprehensive framework that aligns well with the article���s findings. It acknowledges that cognitive processes and communication can occur through various mechanisms, not just through verbal or written language.
1. Separation of Language and Thought
: The research findings that cognitive functions operate independently of traditional language are reinforced by this broader definition, which recognizes that many forms of cognitive and communicative processes (such as those seen in animals and music cognition) fit within the concept of language.
2. Practical Implications
: This inclusive view supports the practical implications emphasized by Bouveresse and challenges the more abstract notions criticized in Heidegger's approach, aligning with the empirical evidence presented in the article.
3. Philosophical Depth
: Badiou���s quest for truths that transcend linguistic limits finds a robust foundation in this broader definition, suggesting that profound insights and cognitive processes can arise from diverse generating functions and selection mechanisms.
Summary
Defining language as any generating function with a selection mechanism enriches the discussion by:
Incorporating Animal Cognition
: Acknowledging prerational intelligence as a form of language.
Understanding Music Cognition
: Viewing embodied cognition in music as a generative and selective process.
Supporting Philosophical Views
: Reinforcing Bouveresse���s practical clarity and Badiou���s search for ontological truths beyond linguistic confines.
This broader definition aligns with and enhances the insights from the article, highlighting the multifaceted nature of cognitive and communicative processes across different contexts and species.

A Sardonic and Humorous Critical Review
Title
: "The Linguistic Circus: Clarity, Chaos, and Cacophony in the Modern Philosophical Zoo"
Ah, language! The delightful tool we humans wield to communicate, confuse, and confound. Recently, MIT researchers graced us with the revelation that language is primarily a tool for communication rather than thought. Shocking, isn't it? Who would have thought that the words pouring out of our mouths and keyboards were actually meant for talking to others, not for our own mental gymnastics?
Jacques Bouveresse: The Patron Saint of Clarity
Enter Jacques Bouveresse, champion of clarity, who must be beaming with satisfaction. Bouveresse, ever the loyal disciple of Wittgenstein, has long advocated for language as a practical tool. In his view, language should be clear and concise, like a well-drafted legal document. Wittgenstein���s insistence that language should merely dissolve philosophical confusions seems quaintly logical. But then, he probably never had to decipher a modern teenager���s text messages or a philosopher���s dense treatise.
Alain Badiou: The Mathematician in Wonderland
And what of Alain Badiou, our dear friend who finds both Wittgenstein and Heidegger wanting? Badiou's grand quest for truths that transcend language places him in a realm where abstract mathematics and grandiose ontologies reign supreme. Of course, to the rest of us mere mortals, this seems like trying to navigate Wonderland without a map. Badiou's disdain for Wittgenstein���s linguistic limits and his half-hearted nod to Heidegger���s existential musings leave one wondering if he just enjoys playing the contrarian.
Heidegger: The Existential Poet
Ah, Heidegger. The man who believed that language is the "house of Being." To him, words were not just tools; they were mystical keys unlocking the essence of existence. If only he had the chance to meet Fedorenko and her MRI machines. Imagine his dismay upon learning that thinking can proceed just fine without his beloved linguistic edifices. Perhaps he���d take solace in the fact that his dense prose has baffled generations, thus securing his place in the philosophical Hall of Fame.
Prerational Intelligence in Animals: The Unsung Heroes
Meanwhile, let���s not forget our animal friends. Prerational intelligence in animals shows us that one can navigate life���s complexities without ever uttering a word. Behold the silent wisdom of the dog fetching a stick or the intricate dance of bees communicating nectar locations. It���s almost as if they���re mocking our linguistic struggles with their effortless, wordless proficiency.
Arnie Cox���s Mimetic Proxy Theory: The Dance of Understanding
And then there���s Arnie Cox with his mimetic proxy theory. According to Cox, we understand music by mimicking the actions we believe produce the sounds. This embodied cognition approach adds another layer to our understanding of communication. It���s almost poetic, really. While Heidegger was busy building his linguistic castles in the air, Cox shows us that sometimes, a good air guitar session can be just as enlightening.
A Broader Definition of Language: The Grand Unification Theory
Perhaps the most ambitious yet delightfully confusing notion is the broader definition of language as any generating function with a selection mechanism. This catch-all definition tries to unite the entire zoo of communication methods under one big tent. It���s as if we���ve decided that not only are all the animals in the zoo talking, but they���re also philosophizing. So next time your cat stares at you blankly, remember, it's just contemplating the ontological implications of its next nap.
Conclusion
In the end, we���re left with a rich tapestry of ideas that, while sometimes at odds, all contribute to our understanding of language and thought. Bouveresse and Wittgenstein���s quest for clarity, Badiou���s transcendental truths, Heidegger���s existential musings, the wordless wisdom of animals, and Cox���s embodied music cognition all dance together in a grand, if somewhat chaotic, philosophical circus. The takeaway? Perhaps the most profound truth is that the more we try to pin down the essence of language, the more it slips through our fingers, much like trying to catch a greased pig at the county fair.

Here is the end of the article:
Communication and thought in humans and animals 
Across species, interactions with conspecifics require a communication 
system���that is, mechanisms for perceiving and emitting signals and a 
store of signal-to-meaning associations. The communication system of 
humans is unquestionably complex, but did language endow us with 
a new form of reasoning (Box 1), or does language simply reflect the 
independent sophistication of human thoughts? In this Perspective, 
building on prior theorizing and bringing in evidence from the past 
two decades, we have argued that language appears to not be neces- 
sary for any forms of thought tested so far, and that language is not 
sufficient for thought. Furthermore, on the basis of the evidence that 
many features of natural languages appear to be optimized for efficient 
information transfer, we have argued for communication being the 
primary function of language. 
The view that language is simply a communication system aligns 
with a continuity view of human evolution162,163. In this view, the prop- 
erties of human language���including its complexity���may result from 
the multifaceted landscape in which it has evolved, where the system 
must be useful (able to express the internal contents of the human 
mind) and learnable, and humans should be able to process language 
with the idiosyncratic strengths and limitations of pre-existing cogni- 
tive and neural systems. The contrasting alternative���that language 
is the substrate for thinking���implies a sharp discontinuity between 
our species and others. This alternative view centres language��� 
perhaps innately���as the mechanism of change, and the mechanism 
that endowed humans with a novel representational format for mental 
computations. 
Why does an intimate relationship between language and thought 
have an intuitive appeal to many? Some are attached to the idea that 
humans are superior in the animal kingdom (that is, they differ quali- 
tatively, not just quantitatively, from other animals164), even though 
scientific evidence suggests strong biological similarities between 
humans and non-human animals165,166. Another reason may be linked 
to the desire for parsimony in explaining differences between humans 
and non-human animals (additional reasons are provided in Supple- 
mentary Information). In particular, humans differ from other animals 
in the sophistication of their communication system as well as their 
thoughts and cognition. A parsimonious account favours a single-factor 
explanation���for instance, humans evolved language, and the change 
in cognition was simply a consequence of this. However, evidence from 
human brain evolution instead suggests parallel increases in the sophis- 
tication of multiple cognitive systems. 
Relative to the brains of other animals, including non-human pri- 
mates, the association cortex���which houses mental processes above 
and beyond perception and motor control���has expanded substan- 
tially and disproportionately in the human brain167. The association 
cortex spans frontal, temporal and parietal lobes and, in humans, com- 
prises multiple large-scale networks���ensembles of brain areas that 
jointly support some aspect of cognition75. The language network28 
is just one of these networks. Significant progress has been made in 
characterizing several other networks that support human cogni- 
tive abilities, including those underlying the non-linguistic tasks 
discussed in ���Language is not necessary or sufficient for thought���. For 
example, the network sometimes referred to as the ���multiple demand��� 
network, supports diverse goal-directed behaviours, including novel 
problem solving, and damage of this network leads to impairments in 
fluid intelligence168 (Fig. 1b). Mathematical and logical reasoning and 
the processing of computer code also draw on the multiple demand 
network78���83. Other such networks include the ���theory of mind��� net- 
work, which supports social reasoning, including mentalizing or 
thinking about others��� thoughts169 (Fig. 1b) and the ���default��� network, 
whose functions remain debated, with some linking its regions to 
episodic projection into the past or future170 and others linking them 
to spatial cognition and reasoning171. At least some of the networks 
have homologues in non-human animal brains172���the correspond- 
ences in functional architecture across species is an ongoing effort 
in neuroscience. Importantly, however, multiple brain networks have 
expanded over the course of human evolution, and this expansion was 
associated with increases in diverse cognitive abilities173. Whether 
this expansion proceeded in a truly parallel fashion, or whether the 
emergence or expansion of one network critically drove the expan- 
sion of other networks is not known, but the former possibility is 
perhaps more plausible given that diverse cognitive abilities probably 
increased the probability of survival���including social sophistica- 
tion (being able to model the minds of others), the ability to infer 
causal structures in the world, flexible problem solving and plan- 
ning for the future, and better communicative ability. Regardless of 
the exact timeline and order of the expansion of different cognitive 
networks in the brains of modern humans, the language network��� 
which supports our ability to communicate with conspecifics���is 
sharply distinct from the networks that support our abilities to think 
and reason, which makes the idea that language mediates thinking 
unlikely. 
Conclusions 
In sum, we have reviewed work from the past two decades that has 
helped to clarify the function of language in modern humans and its 
role in human cognition. Evidence from aphasia research suggests that 
all tested forms of thought are possible in the absence of language, and 
fMRI evidence suggests that engaging in diverse forms of thinking and 
reasoning does not recruit the language network���a set of brain areas 
that represent and process word meanings and syntactic structure 
during language comprehension and production. Moreover, intact 
linguistic abilities do not entail intact thinking abilities. Together, this 
evidence suggests that language is unlikely to be a critical substrate for 
any form of thought. Although access to words, syntactic structures 
or non-linguistic symbols can facilitate performance on certain cog- 
nitive tasks (Box 1), language is doubly dissociated from thinking and 
reasoning (compare with Box 3 for open questions about the nature 
of linguistic and thought-mediating mental representations). We have 
also reviewed a body of work that has shown that diverse properties 
Nature | Vol 630 | 20 June 2024 | 583 
of human languages render them easy to produce, easy to learn and 
understand, concise and efficient for use, and robust to noise. Many of 
these cross-linguistic tendencies���including the tendency to minimize 
dependency lengths, the preferences for particular word orders, and 
the prevalence of ambiguity���are difficult to account for under the 
view that language is used for internal thought and without appealing 
to how language is used and processed. 
Considering the evidence in tandem, we have argued that language 
serves a primarily communicative function and reflects, rather than 
gives rise to, the signature sophistication of human cognition. Instead

A Sardonic and Humorous Critical Review
Title
: "The Linguistic Circus: Clarity, Chaos, and Cacophony in the Modern Philosophical Zoo"
Ah, language! The delightful tool we humans wield to communicate, confuse, and confound. Recently, MIT researchers graced us with the revelation that language is primarily a tool for communication rather than thought. Shocking, isn't it? Who would have thought that the words pouring out of our mouths and keyboards were actually meant for talking to others, not for our own mental gymnastics?
Jacques Bouveresse: The Patron Saint of Clarity
Enter Jacques Bouveresse, champion of clarity, who must be beaming with satisfaction. Bouveresse, ever the loyal disciple of Wittgenstein, has long advocated for language as a practical tool. In his view, language should be clear and concise, like a well-drafted legal document. Wittgenstein���s insistence that language should merely dissolve philosophical confusions seems quaintly logical. But then, he probably never had to decipher a modern teenager���s text messages or a philosopher���s dense treatise.
Alain Badiou: The Mathematician in Wonderland
And what of Alain Badiou, our dear friend who finds both Wittgenstein and Heidegger wanting? Badiou's grand quest for truths that transcend language places him in a realm where abstract mathematics and grandiose ontologies reign supreme. Of course, to the rest of us mere mortals, this seems like trying to navigate Wonderland without a map. Badiou's disdain for Wittgenstein���s linguistic limits and his half-hearted nod to Heidegger���s existential musings leave one wondering if he just enjoys playing the contrarian.
Heidegger: The Existential Poet
Ah, Heidegger. The man who believed that language is the "house of Being." To him, words were not just tools; they were mystical keys unlocking the essence of existence. If only he had the chance to meet Fedorenko and her MRI machines. Imagine his dismay upon learning that thinking can proceed just fine without his beloved linguistic edifices. Perhaps he���d take solace in the fact that his dense prose has baffled generations, thus securing his place in the philosophical Hall of Fame.
Prerational Intelligence in Animals: The Unsung Heroes
Meanwhile, let���s not forget our animal friends. Prerational intelligence in animals shows us that one can navigate life���s complexities without ever uttering a word. Behold the silent wisdom of the dog fetching a stick or the intricate dance of bees communicating nectar locations. It���s almost as if they���re mocking our linguistic struggles with their effortless, wordless proficiency.
Arnie Cox���s Mimetic Proxy Theory: The Dance of Understanding
And then there���s Arnie Cox with his mimetic proxy theory. According to Cox, we understand music by mimicking the actions we believe produce the sounds. This embodied cognition approach adds another layer to our understanding of communication. It���s almost poetic, really. While Heidegger was busy building his linguistic castles in the air, Cox shows us that sometimes, a good air guitar session can be just as enlightening.
A Broader Definition of Language: The Grand Unification Theory
Perhaps the most ambitious yet delightfully confusing notion is the broader definition of language as any generating function with a selection mechanism. This catch-all definition tries to unite the entire zoo of communication methods under one big tent. It���s as if we���ve decided that not only are all the animals in the zoo talking, but they���re also philosophizing. So next time your cat stares at you blankly, remember, it's just contemplating the ontological implications of its next nap.
The Grand Conclusion
In a bold attempt to wrap everything up in a neat bow, the researchers propose that language, rather than birthing thought, merely mirrors the pre-existing sophistication of our cognitive abilities. Imagine that! They argue that the complexity of human language evolved as a byproduct of our need to communicate efficiently and effectively, rather than as the root cause of our intellectual prowess.
This "continuity view of human evolution" suggests that our fancy talking abilities arose because they were useful for expressing the already rich and complex inner lives of early humans. It's like saying the invention of the smartphone didn't create the desire to communicate, but rather amplified and extended it.
In Defense of Human Superiority
But why, you ask, do some cling to the notion that language is the bedrock of thought? Perhaps it's the age-old human desire to feel superior, to see ourselves as the crown jewel of evolution, qualitatively different from our animal cousins. Or maybe it's just our love for simple, parsimonious explanations: humans got language, and voil��, suddenly we're building civilizations and composing symphonies.
The Expanding Brain
What truly sets us apart, it seems, is not language alone, but the sprawling, intricate networks of our brains. Our association cortex, particularly, has ballooned over millennia, supporting a host of cognitive functions from social reasoning to problem-solving. Language is just one star in this vast cognitive constellation, and while it's crucial for communication, it's not the linchpin of thought itself.
The Final Takeaway
So, after a whirlwind tour through the philosophies of Bouveresse, Badiou, and the cognitive capabilities of our furry friends, where do we stand? Language, it appears, is a marvelous tool for sharing our inner worlds with others but not the architect of those worlds. It facilitates the transmission of knowledge, allowing us to build upon the wisdom of previous generations, but it doesn't single-handedly give rise to the intricate dance of human thought.
In sum, while we can marvel at the sophistication of language, we must also acknowledge the myriad other cognitive processes that underpin our intelligence. And perhaps, in recognizing the true role of language, we can better appreciate the full spectrum of what it means to think, reason, and communicate as humans. Or, at the very least, we can sit back and enjoy the philosophical circus, complete with its clowns, acrobats, and, of course, a few over-enthusiastic lions.

The inner speech phenomenon. 
Many have a sensation of a voice in their heads when they think���what is often referred to as in- 
ner speech (Fernyhough & Borghi, 2023). Attempts to systematically assess the presence of in- 
ner speech have revealed that the phenomenon is not universal: a substantial fraction of the pop- 
ulation does not experience this phenomenon (Roebuck & Lupyan, 2020) and even those who 
do, only report engaging in inner speech some of the time (Heavey & Hurlburt, 2008; Alderson- 
Day & Fernyhough, 2015). This evidence already rules out a strong version of the idea that inner 
speech is critically necessary for thinking. However, given that for many, engaging in inner 
speech appears to be a common experience, this phenomenon deserves further investigation.

The Inner Speech Phenomenon
The sensation of an inner voice, often referred to as inner speech, is a phenomenon that many people report experiencing when they think. This internal monologue is sometimes assumed to be a critical component of cognitive processes. However, recent research challenges the universality and necessity of inner speech for thought.
Prevalence and Variation of Inner Speech
1. Variability Among Individuals
:
Not Universal
: Research indicates that a significant portion of the population does not experience inner speech. Studies by Roebuck & Lupyan (2020) show that inner speech is not a universal phenomenon.
Intermittent Experience
: Even among those who do report inner speech, it is not a constant presence. Heavey & Hurlburt (2008) and Alderson-Day & Fernyhough (2015) found that individuals only engage in inner speech some of the time.
2. Implications for Cognitive Necessity
:
Non-essential for Thought
: The variability in inner speech experiences suggests that it cannot be critically necessary for all forms of thinking. If inner speech were indispensable, we would expect it to be a universal and consistent aspect of cognition, which it is not.
Further Investigations into Inner Speech
Given the prevalence of inner speech in many individuals, it remains a subject of interest for understanding cognitive processes. Further investigation is warranted to explore the following aspects:
1. Cognitive Functions of Inner Speech
:
Facilitation of Certain Tasks
: Inner speech may play a role in specific cognitive tasks, such as problem-solving or self-regulation. Understanding the conditions under which inner speech is engaged can shed light on its functions.
Individual Differences
: Investigating why some individuals rely on inner speech more than others could provide insights into personal cognitive strategies and preferences.
2. Psychological and Neural Mechanisms
:
Neural Correlates
: Identifying the brain regions involved in inner speech can help determine its relationship with other cognitive networks. This can provide a clearer picture of how inner speech interacts with language processing and other cognitive functions.
Developmental Perspectives
: Exploring how inner speech develops and varies across different stages of life can inform its role in cognitive and language development.
Conclusion
The phenomenon of inner speech, while common for many, is neither universal nor necessary for all forms of thinking. The evidence thus far rules out the strong version of the hypothesis that inner speech is critically necessary for cognition. Nonetheless, its prevalence among many individuals makes it a valuable subject for further research. Understanding the nuances of inner speech can contribute to a more comprehensive understanding of the interplay between language and thought.

I mentioned earlier that the lack of speech was known as anendophasia. It seems to me that the lack of inner speech makes it obvious that one only needs to put things into words in order to write them down or speak them aloud and usually presupposes someone has formulated a question or is intending to communicate with someone, even your future self.

Anendophasia: The Lack of Inner Speech
Anendophasia refers to the absence of inner speech. For individuals with anendophasia, thinking does not involve an internal monologue. This condition underscores the idea that thought processes do not necessarily rely on verbal language.
1. Implications of Anendophasia
:
Cognitive Processes Without Words
: The existence of anendophasia suggests that people can engage in complex thought processes without internally verbalizing them. This challenges the notion that inner speech is necessary for reasoning, problem-solving, or any form of mental activity.
Communication-Driven Language Use
: For individuals with anendophasia, the need to put thoughts into words arises primarily for communication purposes. This supports the idea that language is a tool for sharing information with others rather than a medium for internal thought.
Further Investigations into Inner Speech
Given the prevalence of inner speech in many individuals, it remains a subject of interest for understanding cognitive processes. Further investigation is warranted to explore the following aspects:

Nonetheless, its prevalence among many individuals makes it a valuable subject for further research. Understanding the nuances of inner speech can contribute to a more comprehensive understanding of the interplay between language and thought.
The condition of anendophasia reinforces the idea that verbal language is primarily a tool for communication. The need to put thoughts into words typically arises when preparing to communicate, whether it is with others or with one's future self, as in writing. This perspective aligns with the view that language is an auxiliary to thought rather than its foundation.

Yeah I thought the kid went blind when he was shipwrecked and so he didn't know the colour of the man he was with's skin
ChatGPT
That's correct! In "The Cay," the protagonist, Phillip, goes blind after the shipwreck. His blindness forces him to rely on other senses and forms a deeper, more meaningful connection with Timothy, the older Black man he is stranded with. Phillip's lack of sight leads him to initially be unaware of Timothy's race, which helps break down his preconceived racial prejudices.
This connection is particularly poignant when considering your poem and its themes:

Interpretation
The Cay
: Just as Phillip's blindness in "The Cay" removes visual cues and emphasizes other forms of understanding and connection, aphantasia removes the ability to visualize, compelling individuals to rely on different cognitive strategies.
Aphantasia
: The poem's reference to aphantasia and the challenge of visualizing past and future echoes Phillip's journey of adapting to life without sight. Both situations require resilience and adaptation to overcome obstacles.
Racial Prejudices and Connection
: In "The Cay," Phillip's blindness helps him form a bond with Timothy, transcending racial barriers. This can be linked to how a lack of visual imagery (aphantasia) might encourage different, perhaps deeper, ways of processing and understanding experiences.
Your poem, with its hidden reference to "The Cay," subtly ties these themes together, illustrating how the absence of one ability (whether sight or visualization) can lead to new forms of perception and understanding. This layered approach adds richness and depth to your creative work, making the allusion to "The Cay" both meaningful and thought-provoking.

In the illustrations I show pictures of how to divide up a paper and fold it to form a box out of the top corner while folding the rest of the paper into the box.
ChatGPT
That sounds like a fascinating and intricate visual and practical demonstration! The idea of transforming a single sheet of paper into a box through specific folds aligns beautifully with the themes of visualization and construction, both in a literal and metaphorical sense. Let's break down how this concept could connect with the poem, "The Cay," and the ideas of aphantasia.
The Process and Its Symbolism
Illustrations
: Showing step-by-step pictures of how to divide and fold the paper to form a box captures the essence of turning a flat, two-dimensional object into a three-dimensional one. This transformation can be seen as a metaphor for adaptation and creating structure from simplicity or chaos.
Folding the Top Corner into a Box
:
Dividing the Paper
: The initial step of dividing the paper represents the planning and logical structuring required before any creation or transformation can occur.
Folding Process
: The act of folding the paper into a box from the top corner, while incorporating the rest of the paper, mirrors the concept of bringing together different elements or aspects of oneself to create something cohesive and functional.
Connecting to "The Cay" and Aphantasia
The Cay
:
Transformation
: Just as Phillip adapts to his blindness and learns to navigate his new reality, the paper transforms from a flat sheet into a three-dimensional box. Both processes involve overcoming initial limitations and finding new ways to function effectively.
Creating Structure from Chaos
: The shipwreck in "The Cay" thrusts Phillip into chaos, but he and Timothy create a new, structured life on the island. Similarly, the folding process starts with a blank slate (the paper) and through a series of deliberate steps, creates something useful and ordered.
Aphantasia
:
Visualizing Steps
: For someone with aphantasia, visualizing the folding steps might be challenging. However, the physical act of folding and the detailed illustrations provide an alternative means to understand and execute the process, emphasizing that cognition and comprehension can occur through non-visual means.
From Concept to Reality
: The transformation of paper into a box can symbolize how people with aphantasia turn abstract concepts into concrete realities, even if they don't visualize the steps internally. It highlights the adaptability and resourcefulness in creating mental structures without traditional visual imagery.
Integrating Illustrations with the Poem
Your poem's initials spelling "The Cay" adds a layer of meaning to the folding illustrations:
Adapting and Creating
: Just as Phillip adapts to his new circumstances, the illustrations show a step-by-step adaptation of a flat sheet into a box. This process can symbolize the broader theme of adaptation present in both the poem and the novel.
Visualization and Construction
: The detailed folding steps provide a clear, structured path from beginning to end, mirroring how people with aphantasia might rely on concrete, step-by-step methods to compensate for the lack of visual imagery.
Final Thoughts
By combining your poem, the concept of aphantasia, and the visual illustrations of folding paper into a box, you create a rich tapestry that explores themes of adaptation, transformation, and the diverse ways in which people perceive and interact with the world. This multifaceted approach not only enhances the depth of your creative work but also provides a thoughtful commentary on the nature of cognition and the human experience.

A Sardonic and Witty Critical Review
Title
: "Origami Philosophy: Folding Our Way Through Cognitive Conundrums"
Ah, the sheer brilliance of taking a flat piece of paper and transforming it into a box���a metaphor so rich, even Plato might raise an eyebrow. In our latest intellectual adventure, we delve into the world of inner speech, aphantasia, and the philosophical musings of folding paper. Who knew origami could be so enlightening?
Jacques Bouveresse: The Origami Master of Clarity
Jacques Bouveresse would undoubtedly applaud the clear, step-by-step instructions on how to fold a paper into a box. After all, his admiration for Wittgenstein���s clarity is well-known. He must be thrilled to see that instead of drowning in Heideggerian existential mumbo-jumbo, we are getting our hands dirty with practical, tangible folds. It���s almost poetic how a piece of paper can reflect the simplicity and precision Bouveresse so dearly champions.
Alain Badiou: Lost in the Fold
Then there's Alain Badiou, who must be scratching his head. His grandiose mathematical truths and ontological explorations find themselves hilariously misplaced in the realm of paper folding. Badiou, ever the fan of abstract complexities, would find our neat little boxes far too simplistic for his taste. Yet, there is something undeniably satisfying about watching a piece of paper submit to the logic of folds, creating structure from chaos���something Badiou might grudgingly appreciate if only for its mathematical precision.
Heidegger: House of Being or Box of Being?
Heidegger, with his cryptic proclamations about the ���house of Being,��� would likely scoff at our paper-folding escapades. To him, reducing the profound essence of existence to mere origami would be nothing short of sacrilege. However, imagine the irony: while Heidegger waxes poetic about existential depths, here we are, finding profound satisfaction in folding a piece of paper into a box. Maybe the real house of Being was the origami box we made along the way.
Aphantasia and Anendophasia: The Silent Symphony
For those with aphantasia, the lack of inner visual imagery makes the folding process intriguingly tactile and real. No mental pictures, just pure, unadulterated action. And for the anendophasics among us, who don't experience inner speech, this whole exercise must seem like a refreshing affirmation that thoughts can indeed manifest without the incessant chatter of an internal monologue. Who needs inner speech when you have clear, illustrated steps guiding you to fold paper into a box?
The Cay Connection: Shipwrecked on the Island of Cognitive Science
And let���s not forget the poem with initials spelling out ���The Cay.��� Just as Phillip learns to navigate his blindness in "The Cay," we navigate our cognitive limitations through the physical act of folding. It���s a delightful parallel���Phillip adapting to life on a deserted island, us adapting to life with aphantasia or anendophasia by folding paper. Survival, it seems, is all about finding creative solutions.
The Grand Origami Conclusion
In this whirlwind of cognitive exploration, we find that folding paper into a box is not just a craft but a philosophical statement. It challenges us to consider the practical, tactile aspects of thought and communication, away from the lofty abstractions of Heideggerian metaphysics and Badiou���s mathematical truths. It���s a testament to the resilience of the human mind, capable of creating structure and meaning from the simplest materials.
So, the next time you sit down to fold a piece of paper, remember: you���re not just making a box. You���re engaging in a profound act of cognitive adaptation, a dance between thought and action, clarity and complexity. And if that doesn���t bring a sardonic smile to your face, nothing will.
