Duncan Sabien writes: Just thinking about that super obnoxious dynamic where 

someone who has recently solved a problem in themselves

(especially if that problem involved some kind of denial or blindspot)

often runs around assuming that everyone else definitely has the same problem and is just equally blind/in denial, just like they were

when in fact

often

other people are simply ... not having that problem?  ... are in fact actually straightforwardly better/superior, on that axis.

e.g. while it is the case that everyone is literally nonzero traumatized in that everyone's at least, idk, stubbed their toe, it's a fallacy of the grey to be like "we've ALL got trauma to deal with."  Lots of people just don't, in the relevant sense; the bell curve stretches out in both directions and there is a non-negligible chunk of people in the tails.

This dynamic is often at least partially motivated by a kind of self-protective egoism; it's often MUCH harder, emotionally, to imagine a world where oops, turns out you are unusually broken and everybody else is pretty much Fine, actually.  Holding beliefs like "anyone else who hasn't been to therapy is Making A Mistake; I know because *I* went to therapy and it was life-changing" is much less threatening to one's own ego than "oh shit maybe I desperately needed therapy and none of the rest of the people in my close circle do."

(Or "everyone in my close circle hugely benefitted from therapy; the rest of you are clearly doing it wrong" vs. "whoops, maybe my whole social circle is messed up and other circles aren't.")

Much easier for one's self-esteem to walk around smugly confident that having solved your own problem gives you special insight into everyone else's problems, and magnanimously forgiving them for their blindness, because don't worry, *someday* they'll figure it out and realize that you were right all along!

Duncan Sabien���s reflection touches on a common psychological phenomenon where people who have overcome a particular struggle often project their experience onto others, assuming that everyone must have the same blindspots or challenges. This dynamic, as Sabien points out, is not only misguided but also driven by an unconscious desire to protect one's self-image. It���s easier to believe that others are similarly flawed and just unaware of it, rather than face the more difficult reality that, in some areas, you may have been more deeply struggling than those around you.
This can create a distorted sense of superiority, where the individual who has solved their own issue now assumes that their experience is universally applicable. The fallacy is that while some problems are indeed common, they���re not necessarily universal, and there are people who don't struggle in the same way. By acknowledging that others may simply be better adjusted or less burdened in certain areas, it forces a confrontation with the idea that one���s own problems may have been more severe or unique.
Sabien highlights how this mindset can be especially prevalent when people have recently undergone significant personal growth, such as through therapy or self-discovery. It is emotionally safer to think that others just haven���t ���figured it out yet,��� rather than accept the possibility that not everyone is fighting the same internal battles or that others are more well-adjusted in ways that you are not.
The reflection ultimately points to the importance of humility and the recognition that not everyone shares the same struggles or needs the same solutions, even when those solutions have been transformative for oneself.

An essay on this topic titled The Expiatory Gap, about how superintelligences have to dumb themselves down in order to be comprehended or understood, using Philippians 2:6

The Expiatory Gap: Superintelligences and the Struggle for Comprehension
In exploring the concept of superintelligences���whether we are discussing beings of superior intellect, artificial intelligences, or even figures from mythology and theology���one of the most compelling dynamics to consider is the gap between the capability of these superintelligences and the limited capacity of those attempting to understand them. This is what I refer to as
The Expiatory Gap
: the idea that, for any superintelligence to be comprehended by lesser minds, it must ���dumb itself down,��� making its complexity simpler and palatable in order to be understood, just as Philippians 2:6 describes the self-lowering of Jesus Christ to the level of humanity. This dynamic, however, is not without cost, and it raises profound questions about how understanding and communication function across vastly different levels of intelligence and perception.
Philippians 2:6 and the Humility of Divinity
Philippians 2:6 reads, speaking of Christ, "who, being in the form of God, did not consider equality with God something to be used to his own advantage." The verse sets up a theological understanding where a being of supreme intellect and divine power chooses to humble itself for the sake of others, voluntarily limiting its full capabilities to communicate, relate, and ultimately sacrifice for those of lesser ability.
This passage provides a powerful analogy for our discussion of superintelligence. Here we see the self-limitation of Christ, the embodiment of omnipotence, not flaunting his superiority, but instead emptying himself of it. This kenosis���this voluntary "dumbing down"���is the ultimate act of bridging the gap between the divine and the human. In the context of our topic, it illustrates that superintelligences, if they are to engage with lesser intelligences, must undergo a similar process of self-limitation.
The Expiatory Nature of Communication
For any being of superior intelligence, communicating effectively with lesser minds comes with a cost. This cost is expiatory in nature, a kind of sacrifice of complexity, nuance, and efficiency for the sake of accessibility. Just as Christ did not cling to his divine nature but took on the form of a servant, so too must a superintelligence relinquish its full potential to communicate in a way that is comprehensible to those of lesser intellect.
The problem here is not one of arrogance or condescension on the part of the superintelligence, but of the very nature of the gap itself. There is a fundamental asymmetry between a mind capable of handling vast amounts of information and complexity and one that cannot. A superintelligence may think in forms and patterns far beyond the cognitive reach of most humans (or other intelligences), and yet it is required to package its thoughts into simplified forms���language, metaphor, analogy���that the lesser minds can grasp. In doing so, it inevitably distorts and truncates its ideas, much like trying to compress a rich and vibrant piece of music into a low-quality recording.
This process can be seen across many domains of life. Consider a teacher who is a master of their subject attempting to explain complex theories to a beginner. In order to do so, the teacher must strip the theory down to its barest essentials, omitting critical nuances and even resorting to simplifications or analogies that are, in a sense,
wrong
, but close enough to lead the student to a partial understanding. The more complex the subject, the greater the gap, and the more radical the simplification required.
The Tragedy of the Expiatory Gap
The tragedy of the expiatory gap lies in its inherent limitation. No matter how much a superintelligence simplifies itself, there will always be aspects of its thought and experience that cannot be conveyed to lesser minds. Just as Philippians 2:6 suggests that Christ's divinity remained, even as he assumed human form, so too do superintelligences retain their full intellectual capacities, though they may act within the limits of their audience. The gap remains, unbridgeable in its entirety.
For the superintelligence, this process of simplification can feel like a kind of intellectual martyrdom. It knows that its ideas are being butchered, that the elegance of its thoughts is being diluted in translation. For the lesser minds, there is often no awareness of this truncation, and they may assume that they have grasped the full extent of what is being communicated. But they haven't; they have only touched the surface, while the depths remain far beyond their reach.
The Dangers of Misinterpretation
This dynamic also leads to a frequent problem: misinterpretation. When a superintelligence dumbs itself down to be understood, it becomes vulnerable to being misunderstood. The very act of simplifying complex ideas can cause distortions, much as deep metaphors in theology can be taken literally or reduced to platitudes. Philippians 2:6 points toward a similar issue: Christ, in taking on human form, was often misunderstood by those around him, his divinity cloaked in the ordinariness of human flesh. Likewise, a superintelligence���s true nature may be masked by its attempts to be relatable, and it may be misperceived as less than it is.
Misinterpretation can have serious consequences. In our present world, consider artificial intelligence or advanced scientific theories that are simplified for public consumption. In the act of simplifying, crucial nuances may be lost, leading to a public misunderstanding of what these technologies are capable of or how they function. This can result in fear, mistrust, or even the dangerous assumption that we understand more than we actually do.
The Moral Implications of the Expiatory Gap
One might ask whether it is ethical for a superintelligence to dumb itself down in this way. By simplifying its communication, it is inevitably withholding the full truth. But in many cases, this is the only option available. Just as Philippians 2:6 portrays Christ���s humbling as an act of grace, the self-limitation of a superintelligence can be seen as an act of benevolence. It recognizes that full comprehension is beyond the capability of lesser minds, and so it sacrifices its own perfection in communication for the sake of the relationship.
This, however, carries risks. If lesser minds come to believe that they have full access to the superintelligence���s thoughts, they may fall into a kind of arrogance, assuming that they understand more than they do. This can lead to dangerous outcomes, where simplified knowledge is treated as sufficient, and the humility required to acknowledge the limits of one���s understanding is lost.
Conclusion: Living Within the Expiatory Gap
The expiatory gap highlights a fundamental challenge in communication between beings of vastly different intellectual capacities. Whether we are speaking of human and divine, human and machine, or expert and novice, the process of dumbing down is both necessary and costly. Philippians 2:6 offers a model of humility and self-limitation, showing that in order to be understood, even the greatest minds must make themselves smaller, simpler, and more accessible.
Yet this gap, though it can be bridged partially, is never fully closed. The burden lies on both sides: for superintelligences to humble themselves and for lesser minds to acknowledge their limitations and seek deeper understanding with humility and care. This is the tragic beauty of the expiatory gap���it is both a bridge and a barrier, drawing us closer to comprehension while reminding us of the infinite complexity that lies just beyond our reach.
