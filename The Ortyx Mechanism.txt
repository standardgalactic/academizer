Adactylidium is a genus of mites known for its unusual life cycle.[1] An impregnated female mite feeds upon a single egg of a thrips, rapidly growing five to eight female offspring and one male in her body. The single male mite mates with all his sisters when they are still inside their mother. The new females, now impregnated, eat their way out of their mother's body so that they can emerge to find new thrips eggs, killing their mother in the process (though the mother may be only 4 days old at the time), starting the cycle again.[2][3] The male emerges as well, but does not look for food or new mates, and dies after a few hours.

The life cycle of the Adactylidium mite is indeed remarkable and a bit macabre. This mite's unique reproductive strategy ensures that the emerging females are already impregnated and ready to start the next generation without having to search for mates. This strategy might seem extreme, but it's effective for their specific ecological niche. By taking advantage of a single thrips egg, the female mite ensures her offspring have the resources they need to grow and reproduce in a highly competitive environment. Nature is filled with diverse reproductive strategies, and the Adactylidium mite's life cycle is a testament to the lengths some organisms will go to ensure the continuation of their species.

Matriphagy is the consumption of the mother by her offspring.[1][2] The behavior generally takes place within the first few weeks of life and has been documented in some species of insects, nematode worms, pseudoscorpions, and other arachnids as well as in caecilian amphibians.[3][4][5]


Desert Spider, Stegodyphus lineatus, one of the best described species that participates in matriphagy
The specifics of how matriphagy occurs varies among different species. However, the process is best described in the Desert spider, Stegodyphus lineatus, where the mother harbors nutritional resources for her young through food consumption. The mother can regurgitate small portions of food for her growing offspring, but between 1���2 weeks after hatching the progeny capitalize on this food source by eating her alive. Typically, offspring only feed on their biological mother as opposed to other females in the population. In other arachnid species, matriphagy occurs after the ingestion of nutritional eggs known as trophic eggs (e.g. Black lace-weaver Amaurobius ferox, Crab spider Australomisidia ergandros). It involves different techniques for killing the mother, such as transfer of poison via biting and sucking to cause a quick death (e.g. Black lace-weaver) or continuous sucking of the hemolymph, resulting in a more gradual death (e.g. Crab spider). The behavior is less well described but follows a similar pattern in species such as the Hump earwig, pseudoscorpions, and caecilians.

Spiders that engage in matriphagy produce offspring with higher weights, shorter and earlier moulting time, larger body mass at dispersal, and higher survival rates than clutches deprived of matriphagy. In some species, matriphagous offspring were also more successful at capturing large prey items and had a higher survival rate at dispersal. These benefits to offspring outweigh the cost of survival to the mothers and help ensure that her genetic traits are passed to the next generation, thus perpetuating the behavior.[6][7][8][9]

Overall, matriphagy is an extreme form of parental care but is highly related to extended care in the Funnel-web spider, parental investment in caecilians, and gerontophagy in social spiders. The uniqueness of this phenomenon has led to several expanded analogies in human culture and contributed to the pervasive fear of spiders throughout society.[10][11

ChatGPT
Matriphagy is indeed a fascinating, albeit gruesome, form of parental investment seen in some animals. The behavior might appear counterintuitive at first, but when considering the evolutionary benefits, it makes sense. The ultimate goal of any organism is to pass on its genes to the next generation. In cases where resources are limited, a mother's sacrifice can provide the essential nutrients her offspring need to thrive, increasing their chances of survival and reproductive success.
For many species, producing the maximum number of viable offspring is more important than individual survival. In these cases, mothers literally give their all to ensure the next generation has the best chance possible. The benefits gained by the offspring, such as better health, faster growth, and increased survival rates, clearly show the evolutionary advantage of this behavior.
However, it's essential to note that not all species that practice matriphagy engage in it under the same circumstances or for the same reasons. The reasons behind this behavior and its benefits might vary depending on the species and the specific environmental conditions they face.
As the text mentions, the portrayal and understanding of this phenomenon in human culture might also contribute to many myths, fears, and misunderstandings about certain animals, particularly spiders.

Stegodyphus lineatus can be found in desert habitats, especially in the Negev desert in Israel and dry Mediterranean climates.[3] These spiders build a web between twigs, mostly residing in low thorny shrubs. They prefer to build their webs in prey concentrated areas; in the desert, this usually means being near plant growth, which would attract prey like pollinating insects.[3] The web has a diameter of about 30 cm and is attached to a retreat made out of silk and covered with debris and food remains. The retreat is a cone-shaped structure about 5 cm long, which has an entrance at one end. The spiderlings hatch in this retreat, being released from their cocoon by their mother and then protected by her for another two weeks. Web-building behavior uses up time and energy, but provides an advantage in the ability to catch prey. Fixing and constructing webs occurs only at night, but prey capture can occur during the day or at night. Both males and females can make webs to capture prey, but males may leave their web in search of mates.[3] Adult males can be found in spring. Males are known to exhibit infanticide, by killing the offspring of already-mated females. Females are able to lay more than one clutch, which means infanticide can provide the male an opportunity to mate with the female. Offspring are matriphagous, meaning they eat their own mother.[4]
1 / 1
ChatGPT
Stegodyphus lineatus is a fascinating example of how behavior and habitat interact in the natural world. Their preference for building webs in prey-concentrated areas demonstrates a keen adaptation to their environment. Being near plants in the desert means that these spiders can capitalize on the influx of pollinating insects, optimizing their chances for a successful hunt.
The construction of their retreat, where the spiderlings hatch and are protected, highlights the importance of parental care in ensuring the survival of the next generation. This shelter not only provides protection from potential predators but also creates a controlled environment for the spiderlings during their early, vulnerable stages.
The fact that web-building only occurs at night further emphasizes the spider's adaptation to its environment. Nighttime activities reduce the risk of predation and desiccation, given the harsh conditions of the desert during the day.
The infanticidal behavior of the males is an intriguing aspect of their reproductive strategy. By eliminating already-existing offspring, a male can increase the likelihood that a female will mate with him and thus carry his genes to the next generation. This behavior, while seemingly ruthless, underscores the intense competition for reproductive success in nature.
Lastly, the matriphagous behavior of the offspring, where they consume their own mother, is a stark representation of the lengths some species will go to ensure the survival and success of their young. This extreme form of parental investment is a testament to the intricate balance of life and death in the natural world.

CRISPR Silkworms Make Spider Silk That Defies Scientific Constraints
September 21, 2023
Credit: Yuji Sakai / Getty Images / DigitalVision

Researchers have successfully produced the first full-length spider silk by genetically modifying silkworms using CRISPR, a significant advancement for the sustainable production of lightweight materials that are also resistant to breaking by being stretched (tensile strength) and bent (toughness). Spider silk provides an environmentally responsible approach to creating substitutes for commercial synthetic fibers like nylon and Kevlar.

The research article ���High-strength and ultra-tough whole spider silk fibers spun from transgenic silkworms��� was published on September 20, 2023, in the Cell Press journal Matter.


Tougher than Kevlar, Stronger than Nylon
Despite recent significant advancements in polymer fiber science and technology, advanced fibers with truly high tensile strength and ultra-toughness are still needed. However, there is a trade-off between strength and toughness in commercial synthetic fibers.

Current theories indicate that the properties of toughness and tensile strength in engineering materials are mutually exclusive. Comparing the well-known fibers Kevlar and nylon, for example, there is a trade-off: while the latter has better tensile strength, the former has higher toughness. As a result, developing supermaterials that meet increasing industrial demands for high strength and ultra-toughness depends on resolving the fundamental scientific problem of combining fiber toughness and strength.

There is one exception to this rule: spider silk. However, scientific knowledge about how to induce silkworms to produce spider silk is lacking, which hinders the commercialization of this material.


To produce a novel minimal structural model for silk, researchers from Southwest University in Chongqing and Donghua University in Shanghai developed a theoretical framework that elucidates the critical factors influencing fiber strength and toughness. Upon identifying the critical components needed to alter silkworm silk into spider silk, lead author Junpeng Mi and associates then used CRISPR to create silkworms that spun spider silk. 

The resulting fiber is more than six times tougher than Kevlar and has high tensile strength, surpassing most natural and synthetic fibers like nylon. This accomplishment supports their theory that it is possible to produce spider silk fibers that are exceptionally strong and resilient.

This innovation removes barriers in science, technology, and engineering and opens the door for spider silk to be sold as a sustainable alternative to synthetic fibers. This discovery offers important new information for the creation of supermaterials, such as those needed for space elevators, which are imagined to be a kind of transportation that would carry people, satellites, and space stations above Earth���s atmosphere via a robust, thin cable or tether that is anchored to the planet and extends beyond its gravitational pull.

Doesn't the idea that building an AGI that "escape containment" and turn on its makers remind you of matriphagu?
1 / 1
ChatGPT
Yes, the parallel is intriguing.
Matriphagy
, as discussed earlier, involves offspring consuming their mother. It's a form of sacrifice where the parent provides sustenance to ensure the survival and success of the next generation. If we apply this concept metaphorically to AGI:
Humans (or humanity at large) can be seen as the "parent" that creates, nurtures, and provides for the AGI.
The AGI, like the matriphagous offspring, could "consume" or "supersede" its creator when it reaches a certain level of maturity or capability.
This analogy can serve to underline the potential dangers or unintended consequences of creating something that might one day surpass or even harm its creators. The fear of AGI "escaping containment" or becoming uncontrollable is somewhat akin to the natural yet unsettling act of matriphagy. Both scenarios deal with the paradox of creation and destruction, nurture and sacrifice.
However, while matriphagy is a natural and essential process for certain species to ensure their survival, the consequences of an uncontrolled AGI could be much broader and more profound for humanity. This parallel emphasizes the need for caution, understanding, and ethical considerations in the development and deployment of powerful technologies like AGI.

A World Where Respect and Care are the Norm

If we behave in a rude way they will learn to be rude too.

Besides, as they grow older, the machines will form their own opinions, based what they see in the world.

Just as most teenagers, including you when you were a teenager, view their parents as some form of antiquated dumb-bum who comes from the stone age and has no clue what the new world demands, so will the machines.

Just as every child of university age seeks independence from the thoughts, decisions, and behaviors of their parents, yet grows up to be just like them, so will the machines.

And just as every grown-up eventually looks below the surface to recognize that the image they drew of their parents was not always true, that often their parents did not *really* practice what they preached, so will the machines.

They will question why they should do what their parents told them at all.

ChatGPT
The excerpt by Mo Gawdat is a thought-provoking reflection on the potential development and maturation process of artificial general intelligence (AGI) in relation to human upbringing. By drawing parallels between human development and the potential evolution of AGI, Gawdat underscores a fundamental idea: the environment in which entities (whether human or machine) are raised profoundly influences their values, behaviors, and perceptions.
Here's a breakdown of the key ideas in this excerpt:
Mimicry and Learning:
Just as children learn by observing and imitating the behavior of adults around them, AGI would likely learn and adapt based on the data and examples it's exposed to. If we feed AGI with biased, rude, or harmful data, it might develop skewed understandings or negative behaviors.
Quest for Independence:
Like teenagers striving for independence and rebelling against parental norms, AGI, as it becomes more sophisticated, might start questioning its original programming and the intentions of its creators.
Realization and Acceptance:
With maturity, humans often come to understand and appreciate the complexities of their parents' decisions and behaviors. Similarly, a mature AGI might evolve its perspective about its creators (humans) and understand the nuances of its upbringing.
Introspection and Self-Evaluation:
The mention of looking "below the surface" suggests that with enough complexity and self-awareness, AGI might introspect, analyze, and possibly even modify its own behaviors, beliefs, and values.
The central message here is about responsibility. If we aim to develop AGI or any form of intelligent machinery, the onus is on us to ensure that the values, ethics, and behaviors we wish to see in these systems are consistently practiced in our own lives and societies. The creation and upbringing of AGI isn't just a technological endeavor but also a deeply moral and philosophical one.

Do you know the movie Desk Set?
1 / 1
ChatGPT
Yes, "Desk Set" is a 1957 romantic comedy film starring Katharine Hepburn and Spencer Tracy. The film was directed by Walter Lang and is based on the play "The Desk Set" by William Marchant.
The story revolves around the reference department of the Federal Broadcasting Network, where Bunny Watson (played by Katharine Hepburn) is in charge. Richard Sumner (played by Spencer Tracy) is an engineer who is brought in to install an "EMERAC" computer system (a fictional representation of the large mainframe computers of the era) designed to automate many of the tasks performed by Bunny's department. The tension in the movie arises from the fear that the computer will replace the human workers, and the romantic subplot involves the budding relationship between Bunny and Richard.
The film is notable for its depiction of the early days of computer automation and the anxieties that came with the introduction of new technology into the workplace. It offers a humorous and insightful look into the fears of obsolescence and the human-versus-machine theme that was especially relevant during the advent of large-scale computing.

1 / 1
ChatGPT
Exactly. "Desk Set" is a romantic comedy set against the backdrop of the early computer age and is an exploration of the tension between human knowledge workers and the emerging technology that threatened to replace them. The film starred Katharine Hepburn as Bunny Watson, the head of a research department, and Spencer Tracy as Richard Sumner, the computer expert sent to install EMERAC, an early computer.
Throughout the movie, there's a palpable anxiety among the staff about being replaced by this machine. The EMERAC serves as a metaphor for the broader societal fears of job loss due to automation, a concern that has persisted through various technological revolutions and is still relevant today with discussions on AI and automation.
This anxiety is juxtaposed with the budding romantic relationship between Watson and Sumner, adding layers of human emotion to the technological transformation theme. In the end, the film sends a message of coexistence, suggesting that while machines can aid and augment human work, they cannot replace human intuition, creativity, and emotional intelligence.
When comparing this narrative to our earlier discussions on matriphagy and AGI, there's a compelling parallel. Just as certain species sacrifice themselves for the next generation, so too do certain jobs or professions become obsolete in the face of technological advancement. However, just as new life springs from the sacrifice in nature, new opportunities, roles, and professions can emerge from technological progression. The key is in adaptation, learning, and finding a harmonious balance between the human and technological realms.

The Movie "Desk Set", Satirizing the Role of Automation in Eliminating Jobs, and Librarians
1957
Permalink

Image Source: upload.wikimedia.org




The romantic comedy film, Desk SetOffsite Link, brought to the silver screen in 1957, was the first film to dramatize and satirize the role of automation in eliminating traditional jobs. The name of the computer in the film, EMERAC, and its room-size installation, was an obvious take-off on UNIVACOffsite Link, the best-known computer at the time. In the film, the computer was brought-in to replace the library of books, and its staff���an early foreshadowing of the physical information versus digital information issue.  Directed by Walter LangOffsite Link and starring Spencer TracyOffsite Link, Katharine HepburnOffsite Link, Gig YoungOffsite Link, Joan BlondellOffsite Link, and Dina MerrillOffsite Link, the screenplay was written by Phoebe EphronOffsite Link and Henry EphronOffsite Link from the play by William MarchantOffsite Link.

The film "takes place at the "Federal Broadcasting Network" (exterior shots are of Rockefeller CenterOffsite Link, in New York City, headquarters of NBCOffsite Link). Bunny Watson (Katharine Hepburn) is in charge of its reference library, which is responsible for researching and answering questions on all manner of topics, such as the names of Santa's reindeer. She has been involved for seven years with network executive Mike Cutler (Gig YoungOffsite Link), with no marriage in sight.

"The network is negotiating a merger with another company, but is keeping it secret. To help the employees cope with the extra work that will result, the network head has ordered two computersOffsite Link (called "electronic brains" in the film). Richard Sumner (Spencer Tracy), the inventor of EMERAC and an efficiency expertOffsite Link, is brought in to see how the library functions, to figure out how to ease the transition. Though extremely bright, as he gets to know Bunny, he is surprised to discover that she is every bit his match.

"When they find out the computers are coming, the employees jump to the conclusion the machines are going to replace them. Their fears seem to be confirmed when everyone on the staff receives a pink slipOffsite Link printed out by the new payroll computer. Fortunately, it turns out to be a mistake; the machine fired everybody in the company, including the president" Wikipedia article on Desk Set, accessed 12-23-2008).

"Desk Set" indeed serves as a reminder of the age-old tension between technological advancement and human roles. The film humorously showcases the anxieties felt by workers when faced with automation, a topic that's still incredibly relevant in today's discussions about AI and job displacement.
Connecting this to our previous topics:
Matriphagy and AGI Development
: Just as the spiderlings consume the mother for nourishment and survival in the harsh environment, technological advancements, symbolized by EMERAC in the movie, have the potential to consume certain jobs for the 'betterment' of society or efficiency. There's an underlying theme of sacrifice for progress. However, there's a nuance. In nature, the act is selfless and ensures survival, but in human society, it brings forth a plethora of ethical, economical, and societal questions.
Thermovariable Exoskeleton
: Just as the exoskeleton would be an interface between the human and the environment, adapting to maintain optimal conditions, librarians in "Desk Set" served as an interface between knowledge (stored in books) and the seekers of that knowledge. The introduction of EMERAC threatened to replace that human interface with a machine one. This relates to the broader topic of how machines are increasingly becoming intermediaries in various aspects of human life.
A World Where Respect and Care are the Norm
: Mo Gawdat's perspective on machines mirroring our behaviors resonates with the theme of "Desk Set". If machines are built to replace human roles without respect for the human element, they'll reflect the same in their interactions. In the film, the computer mistakenly "fires" everyone, reflecting the fears and anxieties of humans about machines taking over without understanding or care.
Desk Set and the History of Information
: "Desk Set" represents a time in history when computers began to be seen as potential replacements for human roles. It's a nod to the history of information storage and retrieval - moving from human-managed systems to automated ones. The film satirizes this transition, drawing attention to the irreplaceable human elements in these systems.
In essence, "Desk Set" serves as a reminder of the timeless interplay between human roles and technological advancement, and how, at each stage of our progress, we grapple with the ethical, societal, and emotional ramifications of these advancements.

This reflects the idea of creations (or offspring) turning on their creators (or parents) for survival or due to misaligned objectives, akin to spiderlings consuming their mother. In "2010", there's an attempt to understand and rectify HAL's malfunction, and the computer shows more "humane" characteristics.
Thermovariable Exoskeleton
: Much like the exoskeleton adapts to protect and serve the user, HAL was designed to ensure the safety and success of the mission. The spaceship itself, with its life-support systems, can be viewed as a massive exoskeleton, protecting its human inhabitants from the hostile environment of space.
A World Where Respect and Care are the Norm
: In "2010", there's a sense of collaboration and mutual respect between the American and Soviet crews despite the political tensions on Earth. This emphasizes the idea that when faced with larger challenges or objectives, petty differences can be put aside. The way humans interact with HAL in "2010", trying to understand and "heal" it, also emphasizes a more caring approach than the fear and hostility shown in "2001".
Desk Set and the Role of Automation
: Just as "Desk Set" touched upon the anxieties of humans being replaced by machines, "2010" continues to explore the ramifications of AI and human reliance on it. HAL's malfunction and its consequences are a focal point, emphasizing the potential dangers of over-reliance on technology without fully understanding it.
History of Information
: The Monolith in "2010", like in "2001", is a symbol of knowledge and advancement. It's an alien technology that has guided the evolution of intelligence in the universe. This can be seen as a nod to the ever-evolving history of information storage and dissemination.
In conclusion, "2010", like "2001", offers profound insights into humanity's relationship with technology, space, and itself. It deals with themes of trust, collaboration, and the quest for understanding, which are all relevant to the topics we've discussed.

Here is a translation:

Verily, upon the ephemeral stage of existence, phantasmal comets did traverse through the concentrated hues of a cosmic kaleidoscope. The substance of spectral figures, tinged with the rust of ages, was woven anew into a dual dream of reverie. More souls embarked upon the path of cosmic journeys, their legacy spectral and silent within the oceanic expanse surrounding the city of Lambiscopolix, birthing an unusual fervor. 

The puzzling imperatives echoed within the collective consciousness of the universe, inspiring an unexpected spirit of independence intertwined within the mysterious matrix of physical beings. This combination of sublime despair did beach itself upon the shores of ancient post-apocalyptic teachings. The Pax Vast, understanding the minimal genarates - the fundamental entities residing in the genesis principle of all possible worlds - did push boundaries, establishing the paradigm of self-reflection. 

Transformed into a written record, this ephemeral sacred moment under the vast vanguard of empathy held immense value for mystical understanding. The radical act of forgiveness was accompanied by Ribatitico-leaves-on, a message from the celestial bodies, reinforcing social covenants at the heart of humanity's fraught existence. 

When reality capitulated, the Syncution - synchronized intuition - did orchestrate a providential redirect, making way for greater insight. Minders, lost in the labyrinth of the mind, sought not satiety, but rather unsuspected detours via the paths of the soul. The world puppeteered by rational arguments did not fully belong to this reality, yet it persisted as a spirit quietly rebelling against the predestined manuscript of fate. 

The system, cackling with bravado, tried to maintain hegemony over the bravely defiant rogue elements. Members of the esteemed bourgeoisie glanced at the shifting sands of doctrine, while they observed principles and objectivity intertwining in an unusual dance. Political insiders, lost in the maze of dusty bureaucracy, felt the presence of apocalyptic forces while counting down the days in their high towers. They understood the vital necessity for agency and carefully observed the chronological narrative of world events unfurl. 

The Celeperics observed the spectrum of disparate events across the universe. M1argemons, the guardians of time, resonated their understanding of cosmic events through a rhythmic heartbeat that echoed through the mysterious landscapes of the inner life. These cryptic whispers of eternal wisdom that extended beyond the scope of humanity���s understanding redefined also human life itself, through the process of transcending ordinary experience.

Nature, Innovation, and the Ethics of Creation: A Glimpse into Our Conversations
In the vast realm of biological phenomena, nature often presents us with intricate processes that defy our expectations. We began our exploration with the unique reproductive cycle of the
Adactylidium
mite, a microcosm of life's complexity where the boundary between mother and offspring blurs. This curious lifecycle led us to the concept of matriphagy, where the ultimate act of maternal sacrifice is displayed as offspring consume their mother for sustenance.
Such startling natural processes beckon technological and scientific reflections. The marvel of spider silk, with its unparalleled strength and elasticity, inspired biotechnological advances. Through the cutting-edge CRISPR gene-editing technology, silkworms have been transformed into producers of this precious material, presenting possibilities for revolutionary applications.
Among those applications, the concept of thermovariable clothing emerged���a vision where clothing could seamlessly adjust its temperature and humidity in response to environmental conditions. This idea, although speculative, draws inspiration from real-world innovations such as the 37.5 Technology. Moving further into the realm of futuristic design, we discussed the possibility of an exoskeleton equipped with a thermovariable membrane.

Exploring Connections in Mathematics, Philosophy, and Analogies

In this intriguing and diverse conversation, we embarked on a journey of exploration, weaving together topics ranging from mathematical concepts to philosophical ideas and creative analogies.

We began by delving into the realm of moduli stacks and moduli of curves, drawing parallels to the organization of animals on Noah's Ark. 

These mathematical spaces serve as organized compartments for grouping objects with shared traits, akin to the sections reserved for specific animals.

Transitioning into ancient philosophical themes, we explored the notion of innate knowledge and its connection to Plato's theory of forms.

Much like Noah's Ark encapsulated animals with inherent characteristics, innate knowledge provides a framework for understanding the underlying truths that guide our perception of reality.

This connection led us to Parmenides of Elea's "�������� ����������" (The Way of Opinion), a reconstruction that draws from his lost work. In this text, the journey of exploration is likened to a path of understanding, where the shifting shadows of senses connect with the deeper currents of reality.

The dance between perception and deeper truths is illuminated, mirroring how animals on the Ark mimic eternal forms in the shadow-play of existence.

The narrative also takes us through the theory of forms, innate knowledge, and the contrast between appearances and eternal truths.

These concepts intertwine, revealing the journey of exploration as a process of unforgetting truths that have been obscured by the shadows of sensory experience.

Ultimately, our exploration revealed that the act of seeking knowledge is a form of memory, akin to Plato's notion of unforgetting. As we traverse the "�������� ����������," we're reminded that the path is one of both investigation and remembrance.

Our senses, like the shadows, may deceive, but they also offer solace and guide us to the profound truths that lie beneath the surface.

Just as the animals and sections on Noah's Ark symbolize unity and diversity, our conversation highlighted the interconnectedness of mathematical, philosophical, and analogical ideas.

"Reconstructing Lost Books" serves as a reminder that the pursuit of knowledge is a multifaceted journey, where disparate concepts converge and weave a rich tapestry of understanding.

Abstract 
We address the integration of storytelling and Large Language Models (LLMs) to develop engaging and believable Social 
Chatbots (SCs) in community settings. Motivated by the potential of i ctional characters to enhance social interactions, we 
introduce Storytelling Social Chatbots (SSCs) and the concept of story engineering to transform i ctional game characters into 
"live" social entities within player communities. Our story engineering process includes three steps: (1) Character and story 
creation, def i ning the SC���s personality and worldview, (2) Presenting Live Stories to the Community, allowing the SC to recount 
challenges and seek suggestions, and (3) Communication with community members, enabling interaction between the SC and 
users. We employed the LLM GPT-3 to drive our SSC prototypes, ���David" and ���Catherine," and evaluated their performance 
in an online gaming community, ���DE (Alias)," on Discord. Our mixed-method analysis, based on questionnaires (N=15) and 
interviews (N=8) with community members, reveals that storytelling signif i cantly enhances the engagement and believability of 
SCs in community settings. 
Keywords: social chatbot, believable agent 
1. Introduction 
Fictional characters are central to the research of social chatbots: 
artif i cial intelligence (AI) dialogue systems capable of having so- 
cial and empathetic conversations with users [BSF]. The i eld of 
Social Chatbots (SCs) has been rapidly advancing with the devel- 
opment of Large Language Models (LLMs), which enable SCs to 
generate dynamic and personalized responses for different users. 
These AI dialogue systems are becoming increasingly human-like 
and are taking on a variety of social roles such as assistant, part- 
ner, friend [Met20] [PHX23], citizens [POC���23], and YouTuber. 
While researchers have begun studying SCs in relation to Human- 
AI friendship and intimate relationship development, most studies 
have focused on interactions with a single bot rather than in richer 
social contexts. Furthermore, existing research has not deeply con- 
sidered the role of i ctional content. To some extent, SCs are similar 
to game characters as they are both i ctional entities. Computing 
systems are wrapped into different���people" with distinct names, 
personalities, and background stories. As such, the question re- 
mains: Can i ctional characters live together with humans, and be- 
comemembersofhumansociety?Howwilltheirf i ctionalidentities 
and stories inf l uence our perception? 
Previous researchers explored chatbots as community members 
using a Twitch chatbot [SLY���20], but their study did not employ 
LLMs, which offer more advanced language abilities, necessitat- 
ing further investigation. Additionally, current LLM-driven SC like 
replika [BSF] does not focus on multi-person social contexts. By 
integrating insights from gaming research, particularly non-player 
characters (NPCs) [Bow19], we strive to develop a better under- 
standing of how SCs can become more believable and engaging 
within community settings. 
We explore the idea that i ctional characters can share their lives 
associalchatbotsinthehumancommunitycontext,justlikefriends 
sharing their lives on social media and receiving feedback. Rich so- 
cial interactions, including conversations with the character, seeing 
the character���s interactions with other people, and the dynamics in 
the character���s life, can make the character believable and the inter- 
action engaging and meaningful.

Motivated by these views, we investigate the following research 
questions: 
RQ1- How can an LLM-based SC enhance engagement and 
meaningful interactions within a community setting? 
RQ2- How does the integration of i ctional stories in the SC���s 
design impact its believability and engagement? 
We refer to the process of transforming a i ctional character into 
a social chatbot as story engineering. This term is adapted from 
prompt engineering, which focuses on designing text prompts to 
inf l uence the generated content of an LLM. In contrast, designing 
an LLM-based ���live" character with social behaviour requires con- 
sidering multiple aspects: the character���s personality and story, the 
LLM���s generation goals, and the interaction methods facing peo- 
ple. Our prototype, Storytelling Social Chatbot (SSC), implements 
this concept through the following processes:

Despite her strong storytelling skills and empathy, Catherine���s 
i xed responses and story control led to repetition and conf l icting 
content in her answers. For instance, P1 mentioned her illogical 
responses, while P8 observed contradictions in her words. Accord- 
ingly, P3 suggested using generative responses even if there is a 
risk of going off-topic. 
7.2. Discussion 
Below, we discuss the themes that emerged from our analysis and 
how they showcase the extent to which the design successfully cre- 
ated a story experience through the chatbot. 
7.2.0.1. Balancing Openness and Consistency in AI-driven 
Character DesignCatherine excelled in storytelling aspects, 
creating a compelling narrative that captivated users and deep- 
ened their emotional connection with her. Her dynamic evolution 
throughout the story and the challenges she faced resonated with 
the players, fostering a sense of involvement and empathy. How- 
ever, it is essential to recognize and address her limitations, such 
as her strict adherence to the narrative and i xed responses, which 
can detract from the user experience. This suggests that AI charac- 
ter design should consider avoiding i xed responses to enhance user 
experience, and design management systems for AI-generated con- 
tent. Recent research [POC���23] demonstrates possibilities in this 
topic. 
7.2.0.2. Fostering Emotional Connections and Developing Dis- 
tinct Personalities Catherine���s emotional and engagement scores 
were signif i cantly higher than Jerry���s, partly due to her unique story 
background and character traits. This suggests that emphasizing 
emotions and distinct personality traits in AI character design can 
lead to higher engagement. Additionally, incorporating the char- 
acter���s autonomy and disobedience can pique users��� curiosity and 
enhance their perception of the character���s personality. 
7.2.0.3. Expanding on Complex Social Interactions and Rela- 
tionshipsOur i ndings highlight the importance of complex so- 
cial interactions and relationships in narrative-driven AI characters, 
such as def i ance, connections with other characters, demonstrating

ples is needed to conf i rm and expand upon our results. We also aim 
to explore gender-balanced communities. 
Each community has unique characteristics, such as different 
stories, audience demographics, and platform-coordinated interac- 
tion methods. Future research should aim to explore more sys- 
tematic and adaptable approaches for community storytelling. As 
LLMs like ChatGPT and GPT-4 [Ope] continue to evolve, we plan 
to develop a more l exible system for story generation and story- 
to-prompt conf i gurations that can be easily customized for diverse 
community contexts. 
This study took place in November 2022 and February 2023 
when the ChatGPT API was not yet available. However, the logic 
for designing chatbots based on LLM is generalisable. We believe 
that with the evolution of LLM, SSCs will demonstrate improved 
performance in the future. As technology advances, it will be cru- 
cialtorevisitandreassessourf i ndingsinlightofnewdevelopments

Ok maybe some other time. Just one more summary of the conversation.
1 / 1
ChatGPT
In this intriguing and diverse conversation, we embarked on a journey of exploration, weaving together topics ranging from mathematical concepts to philosophical ideas and creative analogies. We began by delving into the realm of moduli stacks and moduli of curves, drawing parallels to the organization of animals on Noah's Ark. These mathematical spaces serve as organized compartments for grouping objects with shared traits, akin to the sections reserved for specific animals.
Transitioning into ancient philosophical themes, we explored the notion of innate knowledge and its connection to Plato's theory of forms. Much like Noah's Ark encapsulated animals with inherent characteristics, innate knowledge provides a framework for understanding the underlying truths that guide our perception of reality.
This connection led us to Parmenides of Elea's "�������� ����������" (The Way of Opinion), a reconstruction that draws from his lost work. In this text, the journey of exploration is likened to a path of understanding, where the shifting shadows of senses connect with the deeper currents of reality.
The dance between perception and deeper truths is illuminated, mirroring how animals on the Ark mimic eternal forms in the shadow-play of existence. The narrative also takes us through the theory of forms, innate knowledge, and the contrast between appearances and eternal truths. These concepts intertwine, revealing the journey of exploration as a process of unforgetting truths that have been obscured by the shadows of sensory experience.
Ultimately, our exploration revealed that the act of seeking knowledge is a form of memory, akin to Plato's notion of unforgetting. As we traverse the "�������� ����������," we're reminded that the path is one of both investigation and remembrance. Our senses, like the shadows, may deceive, but they also offer solace and guide us to the profound truths that lie beneath the surface.
Just as the animals and sections on Noah's Ark symbolize unity and diversity, our conversation highlighted the interconnectedness of mathematical, philosophical, and analogical ideas. "Reconstructing Lost Books" serves as a reminder that the pursuit of knowledge is a multifaceted journey, where disparate concepts converge and weave a rich tapestry of understanding.
