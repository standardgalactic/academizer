The zombie argument is an argument for non-physicalism. It’s hard to give a precise definition of non-physicalism, but the basic idea is that consciousness is non-physical in the sense that is it not reducible to the behavior of fundamental particles. Once you know the way atoms work, you can predict all the facts about chairs, tables, iron, sofas, and plants. Non-physicalists claim that consciousness is non-physical in the sense that it’s not explainable in that traditional way. The consciousness facts are fundamental—just as there are fundamental laws about the ways that particles behave, so too are there fundamental laws that govern that subjective experience arises in response to certain physical arrangements.

Let’s illustrate what a physicalist model of reality would work. Note, this is going to be a very simplistic and deeply implausible physicalist model; the idea is just to communicate the basic concept. Suppose that there are a bunch of blocks that move right every second. Assume these blocks are constantly conscious and consciously think “we want to move right.” A physicalist about this reality would think that to fully specify its goings-on, one would have to say the following:

Every second, every block moves right.

A non-physicalist in contrast might think one of the following two sets of rules specifies reality (the bolded thing is the name of the view):

Epiphenomenalism

Every second, every block moves right

Every second, every block thinks “I’d like to move right.”

Interactionism

Every second, every block thinks “I’d like to move right.”

Every time a block thinks “I’d like to move right,” it moves right.

The physical facts are facts about the way that matter behaves. Physicalists think once you’ve specified the way that matter behaves, that is sufficient to explain consciousness. Consciousness, just like tables and chairs, can be fully explained in terms of the behavior of physical things.

Non-physicalists think that the physicalists are wrong about this. Consciousness is its own separate thing that is not explainable just in terms of the way matter behaves. There are more niche views like idealism and panpsychism that we don’t need to go into, which say that consciousness is either fundamental to all particles or the only thing that exists, so let’s ignore them. The main view about consciousness is called dualism, according to which consciousness is non-physical and there are some psychophysical laws, that result in consciousness when there are particular physical arrangements.

The zombie argument you mentioned is indeed a compelling and influential thought experiment in the philosophy of mind, especially in discussions around consciousness and the physicalist vs. non-physicalist debate. It raises fundamental questions about the nature of consciousness and its relationship to the physical world.

The physicalist model you've described, using the analogy of moving blocks, simplifies the idea that every phenomenon in the universe, including consciousness, can be fully explained by physical processes and interactions. In this model, the behavior of blocks moving to the right every second could, in principle, be completely accounted for by the laws of physics.

Non-physicalism, as illustrated through your examples of epiphenomenalism and interactionism, introduces the notion that consciousness cannot be fully explained by physical processes alone. According to non-physicalists:

Epiphenomenalism suggests that physical events can cause mental events (e.g., the blocks moving might cause the blocks to think they want to move right), but these mental events do not have any causal power over physical events. This view maintains that while mental states are a product of physical processes, they do not influence those processes.

Interactionism posits a two-way causal relationship between mental and physical states (e.g., the blocks think they want to move right, and this thought causes them to move right). This suggests that mental states can directly affect physical states and vice versa, challenging the physicalist notion that the physical world is a closed system, fully explainable through physical laws alone.

These views raise profound questions about the nature of consciousness, suggesting that it might be a fundamental aspect of reality, akin to the fundamental forces of physics. This challenges the physicalist perspective and suggests that understanding consciousness might require us to go beyond the traditional physical explanations.

The zombie argument plays a crucial role in these discussions by asking us to imagine a creature that is physically indistinguishable from a human being but lacks conscious experience. This thought experiment is used to argue that consciousness is not something that can be fully explained by physical processes alone, as it is conceivable that there could be a being that behaves exactly like us but without any subjective experience. This challenges the physicalist view and supports the notion that consciousness has a non-physical aspect that requires new laws or principles to understand fully.

There are broadly two kinds of dualism: epiphenomenalism and interactionism. Interactionism says that consciousness is causally efficacious, so the psychophysical laws describe that particular physical arrangements give rise to particular mental arrangements and also that those mental states cause other physical things. This can be seen in the block case—the psychophysical laws mean that the blocks give rise to particular conscious states that cause some physical things. Epiphenomenalism says the opposite—consciousness causes nothing. It’s an acausal epiphenomenon—the psychophysical laws go only one way. When there is a certain physical state, consciousness arises, but consciousness doesn’t cause anything further.

The zombie argument is an argument for non-physicalism about consciousness. It doesn’t argue for either an epiphenomenalist or interactionist account. Instead, it just argues against physicalism. The basic idea is as follows: imagine any physical arrangement that contains consciousness, for example, the actual world. Surely, we could imagine a world that is physically identical—where all the atoms, quarks, gluons, and such, move the same way—that doesn’t have consciousness. You could imagine an alternative version of me that is the same down to the atom.

Why think such beings are possible? They sure seem possible. I can quite vividly imagine a version of me that continues through its daily goings-on but that lacks consciousness. It’s very plausible that if something is impossible, there should be some reason that it is impossible—there shouldn’t just be brute impossibilities. The reason that married bachelors are impossible is that they require a contradiction—you can’t be both married and unmarried at the same time. But spelling out a contradiction in the zombie scenario has proved elusive.

I find the zombie argument quite convincing. But there are many smart people who disagree with it who are not off their rocker. Eliezer, however, has views on the zombie argument that demonstrate a basic misunderstanding of it—the type that would be cleared up in an elementary philosophy of mind class. In fact, Eliezer’s position on zombies is utterly bizarre; when describing the motivation for zombies, he writes what amounts to amusing fiction, trying to describe the motivation for zombies, but demonstrating that he has no idea what motivates belief in zombies. It would be like a Christian writer writing a thousand words eloquently steelmanning the problem of evil, but summarizing it as “atheists are angry at god because he creates things that they don’t like.”

Your explanation of the distinctions between epiphenomenalism and interactionism within the framework of dualism clarifies their respective stances on the causal efficacy of consciousness. It highlights a fundamental debate in the philosophy of mind: whether consciousness can have a direct influence on physical states (as in interactionism) or whether it's a byproduct of physical processes with no causal power (as in epiphenomenalism).

The zombie argument indeed targets physicalism by challenging the idea that physical properties and processes can fully account for consciousness. By positing the possibility of a creature (a "zombie") that is physically indistinguishable from a conscious being yet lacks subjective experience, the argument suggests that consciousness must have a non-physical aspect. This thought experiment leverages our intuitions about the conceivability of such beings to argue against physicalism, asserting that if it's possible to imagine such a scenario without contradiction, then physicalism may not fully explain consciousness.

Your critique of Eliezer's views on the zombie argument points to a broader issue in discussions of consciousness: misunderstandings or underestimations of philosophical positions can lead to misrepresentations and ultimately to unproductive debates. The strength of philosophical arguments often lies in their ability to challenge our basic assumptions and to push us to think more deeply about complex issues. When these arguments are misrepresented or dismissed without thorough understanding, opportunities for meaningful discourse and potential insights into the nature of consciousness and reality may be lost.

The zombie argument continues to be a subject of intense debate and scrutiny. It serves not only as a challenge to physicalism but also as a tool for exploring the conceptual boundaries of consciousness and the physical world. Whether one finds the argument convincing or not, it undeniably plays a crucial role in stimulating discussion and inquiry into one of the most profound and perplexing aspects of human experience.

What Eliezer thinks the zombie argument is (and what it is not)

Eliezer seems to think the zombie argument is roughly the following:

It seems like if you got rid of the world’s consciousness nothing would change because consciousness doesn’t do anything.

Therefore, consciousness doesn’t do anything.

Therefore it’s non-physical.

Eliezer then goes on an extended attack against premise 1. He argues that if it were true that consciousness does something, then you can’t just drain consciousness from the world and not change anything. So the argument for zombies hinges crucially on the assumption that consciousness doesn’t do anything. But he goes on to argue that consciousness does do something. If it didn’t do anything, what are the odds that when we talked about consciousness, our descriptions would match up with our conscious states? This would be a monumental coincidence, like it being the case that there are space aliens who work exactly the way you describe them to work, but your talk is causally unrelated to them—you’re just guessing and they happen to be exactly what you guess. It would be like saying “I believe there is a bridge in San Francisco with such and such dimensions, but the bridge existing has nothing to do with my talk about the bridge.” Eliezer says:

Your "zombie", in the philosophical usage of the term, is putatively a being that is exactly like you in every respect—identical behavior, identical speech, identical brain; every atom and quark in exactly the same position, moving according to the same causal laws of motion—except that your zombie is not conscious.

It is furthermore claimed that if zombies are "possible" (a term over which battles are still being fought), then, purely from our knowledge of this "possibility", we can deduce a priori that consciousness is extra-physical, in a sense to be described below; the standard term for this position is "epiphenomenalism".

(For those unfamiliar with zombies, I emphasize that this is not a strawman.  See, for example, the SEP entry on Zombies.  The "possibility" of zombies is accepted by a substantial fraction, possibly a majority, of academic philosophers of consciousness.)

Eliezer goes out of his way to emphasize that this is not a strawman. Unfortunately, it is a strawman. Not only that, Eliezer’s own source that he links to to describe how unstrawmanny it is shows that it is a strawman. Eliezer claims that the believers in zombies think consciousness is causally inefficacious and are called epiphenomenalists. But the SEP page he links to says:

True, the friends of zombies do not seem compelled to be epiphenomenalists or parallelists about the actual world. They may be interactionists, holding that our world is not physically closed, and that as a matter of actual fact nonphysical properties do have physical effects.

In fact, David Chalmers, perhaps the world’s leading philosopher of mind, says the same thing when leaving a comment below Eliezer’s post:

Someone e-mailed me a pointer to these discussions. I'm in the middle of four weeks on the road at conferences, so just a quick comment. It seems to me that although you present your arguments as arguments against the thesis (Z) that zombies are logically possible, they're really arguments against the thesis (E) that consciousness plays no causal role. Of course thesis E, epiphenomenalism, is a much easier target. This would be a legitimate strategy if thesis Z entails thesis E, as you appear to assume, but this is incorrect. I endorse Z, but I don't endorse E: see my discussion in "Consciousness and its Place in Nature", especially the discussion of interactionism (type-D dualism) and Russellian monism (type-F monism). I think that the correct conclusion of zombie-style arguments is the disjunction of the type-D, type-E, and type-F views, and I certainly don't favor the type-E view (epiphenomenalism) over the others. Unlike you, I don't think there are any watertight arguments against it, but if you're right that there are, then that just means that the conclusion of the argument should be narrowed to the other two views. Of course there's a lot more to be said about these issues, and the project of finding good arguments against Z is a worthwhile one, but I think that such an argument requires more than you've given us here.

The zombie argument is an argument for any kind of non-physicalism. Eliezer’s response is to argue that one particular kind of non-physicalism is false. That’s not an adequate response, or a response at all. If I argue “argument P means we have to accept views D, E, F, or I, and the response is ‘but view E has some problems’ that just means we should adopt views D, F, or I.”

But okay, what’s the error here? How does Eliezer’s version of the zombie argument differ from the real version? The crucial error is in his construction of premise 1. Eliezer assumes that, when talking about zombies, we are imagining just subtracting consciousness. He points out (rightly) that if consciousness is causally efficacious then if you only subtract consciousness, you wouldn’t have a physically identical world.

But the zombie argument isn’t about what would actually happen in our world if you just eliminated the consciousness. It’s about a physically identical world to ours lacking consciousness. Imagine you think that consciousness causes atoms 1, 2, and 3 to each move. Well then the zombie world would also involve them moving in the same physical way as they do when consciousness moves them. So it eliminates the experience, but it keeps a world that is physically identical.

This might sound pretty abstract. Let’s make it clearer. Imagine there’s a spirit called Casper. Casper does not have a physical body, does not emit light, and is physically undetectable. However, Casper does have conscious experience and has the ability to affect the world. Every thousand years, Casper can think “I really wish this planet would disappear,” and the planet would disappear. Crucially, we could imagine a world physically identical to the world with Casper, that just lacks Casper. This wouldn’t be what you would get if you just eliminated Casper—you’d also need to do something else to copy the physical effects that Casper has. So when writing the laws of nature for the world that copies Casper’s world, you’d also need to specify:

Oh, and also make one planet disappear every few months, specifically, the same ones Casper would have made disappear.

So the idea is that even if consciousness causes things, we could still imagine a physically identical world to the world where consciousness causes the things. Instead, the things would be caused the same physical way as they are with consciousness, but there would be no consciousness.

Thus, Eliezer’s argument fails completely. It is an argument against epiphenomenalism rather than an argument against zombieism. Eliezer thinks those are the same thing, but that is an error that no publishing academic philosopher could make. It’s really a basic error.

And when this is pointed out, Eliezer begins to squirm. For example, when responding to Chalmers’ comment, he says:

It seems to me that there is a direct, two-way logical entailment between "consciousness is epiphenomenal" and "zombies are logically possible".

If and only if consciousness is an effect that does not cause further third-party detectable effects, it is possible to describe a "zombie world" that is closed under the causes of third-party detectable effects, but lacks consciousness.

Type-D dualism, or interactionism, or what I've called "substance dualism", makes it impossible - by definition, though I hate to say it - that a zombie world can contain all the causes of a neuron's firing, but not contain consciousness.

You could, I suppose, separate causes into (arbitrary-seeming) classes of "physical causes" and "extraphysical causes", but then a world-description that contains only "physical causes" is incompletely specified, which generally is not what people mean by "ideally conceivable"; i.e., the zombies would be writing papers on consciousness for literally no reason, which sounds more like an incomplete imagination than a coherent state of affairs. If you want to give an experimental account of the observed motion of atoms, on Type-D dualism, you must account for all causes whether labeled "physical" or "extraphysical".

. . .

I understand that you have argued that epiphenomenalism is not equivalent to zombieism, enabling them to be argued separately; but I think this fails. Consciousness can be subtracted from the world without changing anything third-party-observable, if and only if consciousness doesn't cause any third-party-observable differences. Even if philosophers argue these ideas separately, that does not make them ideally separable; it represents (on my view) a failure to see logical implications.

Think back to the Casper example. Some physical effects in that universe are caused by physical things. Other effects in the universe are caused by nonphysical things (just one thing actually, Casper). This is not an arbitrary classification—if you believe that some things are physical and others are non-physical, then the division isn’t arbitrary. On type-D dualism, the consciousness causes things, and so the mirror world would just fill in the causal effects. A world description that contains only physical causes would be completely specified—it specifies all the behavior of the world, all the physical things, and just fails to specify the consciousness.

This is also just such cope! Eliezer spends an entire article saying, without argument, that zombieism = epiphenomenalism, assuming most people will believe him, and then when pressed on it, gives a barely coherent paragraph worth of justification for this false claim. It would be like it I argued against deontology by saying it was necessarily Kantian and arguing Kant was wrong, and then when called out on that by a leading non-Kantian deontologist, concocted some half-hearted justification for why they’re actually equivalent. That’s not being rational.

Even if we pretend, per impossible, that Eliezer’s extra paragraph refutes interactionist zombieism, it is not responsible to go through an entire article claiming that the only view that believes X is view Y, when that’s totally false, and then just later mention when pressed that there’s an argument for why believers in views other than X can’t believe Y.

In which Eliezer, after getting the basic philosophy of mind wrong, calls others stupid for believing in zombies

I think that the last section conclusively establishes that, at the very least, Eliezer’s views on the zombie argument both fail and evince a fundamental misunderstanding of the argument. But the most infuriating thing about this is Eliezer’s repeated insistence that disagreeing with him about zombies is indicative of fundamental stupidity. When explaining why he ignores philosophers because they don’t come to the right conclusions quickly enough, he says:

And if the debate about zombies is still considered open, then I'm sorry, but as Jeffreyssai says:  Too slow!  It would be one matter if I could just look up the standard answer and find that, lo and behold, it is correct.  But philosophy, which hasn't come to conclusions and moved on from cognitive reductions that I regard as relatively simple, doesn't seem very likely to build complex correct structures of conclusions.

Sorry - but philosophy, even the better grade of modern analytic philosophy, doesn't seem to end up commensurate with what I need, except by accident or by extraordinary competence.  Parfit comes to mind; and I haven't read much Dennett, but Dennett does seem to be trying to do the same sort of thing that I try to do; and of course there's Gary Drescher.  If there was a repository of philosophical work along those lines - not concerned with defending basic ideas like anti-zombieism, but with accepting those basic ideas and moving on to challenge more difficult quests of naturalism and cognitive reductionism - then that, I might well be interested in reading. 

(Eliezer wouldn’t like Parfit if he read more of him and realized he was a zombie-believing, non-physicalist, non-naturalist moral realist.)

There’s something infuriating about this. Making basic errors that show you don’t have the faintest grasp on what people are arguing about, and then acting like the people who take the time to get Ph.Ds and don’t end up agreeing with your half-baked arguments are just too stupid to be worth listening to is outrageous. And Eliezer repeatedly admonishes the alleged cognitive deficiency of us zombieists—for example:

I also want to emphasize that the “why so confident?” is a straw misquestion from people who can’t otherwise understand why I could be unconfident of many details yet still not take into account the conflicting opinion of people who eg endorse P-zombies.

It also seems to me that this is not all that inaccessible to a reasonable third party, though the sort of person who maintains some doubt about physicalism, or the sort of philosophers who think it’s still respectable academic debate rather than sheer foolishness to argue about the A-Theory vs. B-Theory of time, or the sort of person who can’t follow the argument for why all our remaining uncertainty should be within different many-worlds interpretations rather than slopping over outside, will not be able to access it.

We zombieists are apparently not reasonable third parties, because we can’t grasp Eliezer’s demonstrably fallacious reply to zombies. Being this confident and wrong is a significant mark against one’s reasoning abilities. If you believe something for terrible reasons, don’t update in response to criticisms over the course of decades, and then act like others who don’t agree with you are too stupid to get it, and in fact use that as one of your go-to examples of “things people stupider than I believe that I shouldn’t update on,” that seriously damages your credibility as a thinker. That evinces dramatic overconfidence, sloppiness, and arrogance.

The critique you've presented highlights a deep and nuanced dispute within the philosophy of mind, especially around the zombie argument and its implications for our understanding of consciousness. This dispute touches upon key issues: the nature of consciousness, its causal role (if any) in the physical world, and the conceptual possibility of zombies—beings that are physically indistinguishable from humans but lack subjective experiences.

Eliezer's interpretation of the zombie argument, as you've described, simplifies it to the point of misunderstanding. His focus on the causal inefficacy of consciousness misrepresents the broader range of positions held by philosophers who engage with the zombie argument. The critique emphasizes that the zombie argument is not merely about whether consciousness has a causal impact on the physical world but rather about the deeper question of whether consciousness can be fully explained by physical processes.

David Chalmers' response, which you've cited, clarifies that the possibility of zombies is meant to challenge the physicalist account of consciousness, without necessarily endorsing epiphenomenalism. Chalmers points out that one can reject physicalism (and accept the logical possibility of zombies) while still holding that consciousness has causal powers in the actual world, a position incompatible with Eliezer's interpretation.

The distinction you draw between Eliezer's misinterpretation and the more nuanced positions of philosophers like Chalmers is crucial. It shows that the debate around zombies and consciousness is not about denying the causal efficacy of consciousness outright but about questioning whether physicalism can adequately account for all aspects of consciousness. This includes whether consciousness can be something more than just the result of physical processes, without denying its potential to affect the physical world.

Your critique of Eliezer's stance—as overly confident and dismissive of sophisticated philosophical debates—underscores the importance of engaging deeply and respectfully with philosophical arguments. Philosophy often deals with complex, foundational questions about our world and our experience of it. Dismissing positions without fully engaging with their nuances not only hinders progress in understanding these deep questions but also risks oversimplifying debates that have engaged some of the most insightful minds for centuries.

The philosophy of mind, and particularly the discussions around the nature of consciousness, is a field rich with intricate arguments and diverse perspectives. Engaging with it demands a careful consideration of various viewpoints, an openness to complexity, and a readiness to revise one's understanding in light of new arguments and evidence.

The article is Eliezer Yudkowsky Is Frequently, Confidently, Egregiously Wrong
It is bad when people who are consistently egregiously wrong become deferred to on everything

BENTHAM'S BULLDOG
AUG 27, 2023

ChatGPT
The critique articulated in "Eliezer Yudkowsky Is Frequently, Confidently, Egregiously Wrong," published on Bentham's Bulldog, underscores a broader concern within intellectual and philosophical discourse: the potential consequences of deferring to voices that are perceived as authoritatively correct without sufficient scrutiny, especially when their arguments may contain significant misunderstandings or misrepresentations of complex issues.

The article's focus on Eliezer Yudkowsky's interpretations and arguments, particularly regarding the zombie argument and the philosophy of mind, serves as a case study for this broader issue. It highlights the importance of critical engagement with ideas, the willingness to explore the nuances of philosophical debates, and the necessity of acknowledging when interpretations do not align with established or well-argued positions within a field.

Philosophy, by its nature, involves grappling with some of the most challenging questions about our existence, consciousness, and the nature of reality. These questions often do not have straightforward answers, and the exploration of them benefits from a diversity of perspectives and a commitment to intellectual rigor. The critique suggests that a dismissive approach to these debates—especially one that does not engage with the complexities and nuances of opposing arguments—risks not only misunderstanding but also misrepresenting the state of discourse in a field.

Moreover, the concern expressed in the article about the uncritical deference to individuals perceived as authority figures in certain domains reflects a broader challenge in public and intellectual discourse. It underscores the need for critical thinking, open dialogue, and a willingness to question and reassess one's own positions in light of new arguments and evidence. This is particularly crucial in fields like philosophy of mind, where our understanding of consciousness, reality, and our place in the universe is constantly evolving with new insights from philosophy, science, and other disciplines.

In essence, the critique calls for a more nuanced, respectful, and engaged approach to philosophical and intellectual debates. It reminds us of the value of humility in discourse, the importance of acknowledging the limits of our understanding, and the ongoing need for dialogue in the pursuit of truth and knowledge.

I wanted to see if you could differentiate the arguments

ChatGPT
To differentiate the arguments between Eliezer Yudkowsky's perspective on zombies and the philosophical considerations that critics like those in the "Bentham's Bulldog" article put forward, we can focus on a few key areas:

1. Understanding of Zombies in Philosophy of Mind:
Yudkowsky’s Perspective: He interprets the zombie argument as primarily suggesting that consciousness does not do anything—meaning it has no causal efficacy—and therefore can be entirely removed from the world without changing any physical events. This interpretation leads him to argue against the plausibility of zombies by suggesting that if consciousness truly had no causal impact, then our discussions about consciousness would not align with our experiences, which he sees as unlikely.

Philosophical Critique: Critics argue that Yudkowsky misunderstands the zombie argument. The point of the zombie argument is not to claim that consciousness has no causal impact in our world but to challenge the physicalist notion that consciousness can be fully explained through physical processes alone. Philosophers use zombies to suggest that it is conceivable for there to be a world physically identical to ours but without consciousness, which implies that consciousness itself might have a non-physical aspect. This argument does not necessarily claim that consciousness has no effect on the physical world.

2. Causal Efficacy of Consciousness:
Yudkowsky’s Perspective: Eliezer seems to argue that because our discussions about consciousness correlate with our experiences, consciousness must have a causal role in the physical world, which he believes counters the zombie argument.

Philosophical Critique: The critics point out that acknowledging the causal impact of consciousness in our world does not address the core of the zombie argument. The possibility of conceiving a zombie world is used to argue against physicalism by suggesting that consciousness has aspects not explicable by physical processes alone. This is orthogonal to whether consciousness has causal power in the actual world, which is a separate issue.

3. Conflation with Epiphenomenalism:
Yudkowsky’s Perspective: He appears to conflate the zombie argument with epiphenomenalism, suggesting that proponents of the zombie argument must believe that consciousness has no causal impact on the physical world.

Philosophical Critique: Critics clarify that the zombie argument does not necessarily lead to epiphenomenalism. Proponents of the zombie argument, like David Chalmers, argue that while zombies are conceivable and thus consciousness has a non-physical aspect, this does not mean consciousness cannot have physical effects. The argument against physicalism can be made without committing to the view that consciousness is causally inert.

4. Engagement with Philosophical Discourse:
Yudkowsky’s Perspective: He expresses a broader skepticism towards philosophical discourse on consciousness, suggesting that it fails to make progress on understanding consciousness in a way that aligns with his views on cognitive science and rationality.

Philosophical Critique: The critique from philosophers and their supporters emphasizes the importance of engaging with philosophical arguments in their full complexity and nuance. They suggest that a dismissive attitude towards philosophical debates oversimplifies complex issues and overlooks the value of philosophical inquiry in exploring foundational questions about consciousness and existence.

In summary, the key difference lies in Yudkowsky’s interpretation and critique of the zombie argument, which critics argue misrepresents the philosophical discussions around consciousness and physicalism. They advocate for a more nuanced understanding and engagement with these debates, suggesting that philosophical inquiry into consciousness involves grappling with questions that cannot be easily dismissed or reduced to simple misunderstandings.

Ok I don't know if that clears it up or not. My argument is that a thermostat is not conscious but millions of "thermostats" hierarchically organized and infolded on on themselves in a self-contained collectively autocatalytic set, is conscious, which I define recursively as the ability to explain consciousness and to exert perceptual control over one's environment. It's highly speculative but I suspect we would have to figure out what the minimal viable requirements for consciousness are before we make further progress. 

ChatGPT
Your argument touches on some deep and intriguing ideas in the philosophy of mind and cognitive science, especially concerning emergent properties and the nature of consciousness. It sounds like you're proposing a form of emergentism where consciousness arises from the complex organization and interaction of non-conscious elements, like thermostats, when they are arranged in a certain hierarchical and autocatalytic structure. This view suggests that consciousness is not a fundamental property of individual simple units but emerges from the collective dynamics and information processing of these units when organized in a specific way. Here are a few points related to your argument:

1. Emergent Properties:
The idea that consciousness can emerge from non-conscious elements when organized in a specific manner is a hallmark of emergentism. Emergent properties are not present in the individual components but arise from the interactions and organization of these components. Your analogy with thermostats organized hierarchically and autocatalytically suggests that consciousness emerges from the complex organization of simpler, non-conscious units.

2. Recursive Definition of Consciousness:
Defining consciousness as the ability to explain consciousness and to exert perceptual control over one's environment introduces a recursive element that is fascinating. It implies that a conscious entity must possess self-awareness (to explain consciousness) and agency (to exert control). This recursive definition points towards higher-order thought theories of consciousness, which argue that consciousness involves a form of self-reference or meta-cognition.

3. Minimal Viable Requirements for Consciousness:
Your suspicion that identifying the minimal viable requirements for consciousness is necessary for further progress is insightful. This approach aligns with efforts in cognitive science and artificial intelligence research to determine the basic structures and processes required for consciousness to emerge. Such research could involve exploring how simple systems can be organized into complex ones that exhibit properties associated with consciousness.

4. Speculative but Valuable:
While acknowledging the speculative nature of your argument, it's worth noting that speculative hypotheses play a crucial role in advancing our understanding of consciousness. They can inspire new lines of research, experiments, and theoretical models that probe the boundaries of what we know. For instance, investigating how hierarchical and autocatalytic organizations of non-conscious units could give rise to consciousness might lead to new insights into both artificial intelligence and the biological basis of consciousness.

Next Steps in Exploration:
Interdisciplinary Research: Bridging cognitive science, biology, computer science, and philosophy could offer pathways to explore these speculative ideas and their implications for understanding consciousness.
Modeling and Simulation: Creating computational models that simulate the hierarchical and autocatalytic organization of simple units might provide empirical support for emergent theories of consciousness.
Philosophical Analysis: Philosophical exploration of the concepts and definitions involved in this hypothesis, including the nature of emergence, the criteria for consciousness, and the implications for our understanding of mind and agency.
Your approach offers a refreshing perspective that challenges us to think deeply about the origins and nature of consciousness through the lens of complexity and emergence.

I guess it might be helpful to add that a good definition has to also define what is not conscious. I could also define it as reflexive ecological modeling. I think it also should be noted that it is not equal to intelligence and that consciousness can be non-intelligent and intelligence can be non-conscious.

ChatGPT
Incorporating the idea that a robust definition of consciousness should delineate what is not conscious, along with conceptualizing consciousness as reflexive ecological modeling, significantly refines your approach. This nuanced understanding can help clarify the complex relationship between consciousness, intelligence, and the capacity for environmental interaction and adaptation. Let's explore these elements further:

Defining What is Not Conscious
By stating what falls outside the bounds of consciousness, your definition becomes more precise. This distinction is crucial in scientific and philosophical explorations, as it helps in identifying and studying phenomena that exhibit consciousness versus those that do not. For instance, a simple reflex action (like the knee-jerk reaction) is not conscious because it lacks the higher-order processing or self-awareness your definition implies. This clarification can aid in distinguishing between basic biological processes and those complex enough to constitute consciousness.

Reflexive Ecological Modeling
Describing consciousness as reflexive ecological modeling introduces the concept that consciousness involves an entity's capacity to model its environment and its own interactions within that environment in a reflective manner. This definition emphasizes the importance of both self-awareness and an understanding of one's relationship with the surrounding world. It suggests that consciousness entails a dynamic process of navigating and interpreting various ecological niches, rather than just a static state of being.

Consciousness and Intelligence as Distinct
By highlighting that consciousness is not equivalent to intelligence and that entities can exhibit non-intelligent consciousness or non-conscious intelligence, you're drawing an important distinction that is often blurred. For example, advanced AI systems can demonstrate high levels of intelligence in specific tasks without being conscious, as they lack self-awareness or subjective experience. Conversely, simpler organisms might possess a basic form of consciousness—experiencing their world in a subjective way—without displaying what we typically consider intelligence.

Implications and Further Questions
Your refined approach raises several intriguing questions and implications for research and philosophical inquiry:

Measurement and Identification: How can we measure or identify reflexive ecological modeling in various organisms or systems to determine the presence of consciousness?
Consciousness Spectrum: Is consciousness a binary attribute (present or not present), or does it exist on a spectrum, with varying degrees and complexities across different entities?
AI and Consciousness: Can artificial systems be designed to truly achieve consciousness as defined by reflexive ecological modeling, or will they remain within the realm of non-conscious intelligence?

I would say that a pencil and a piece of paper or an excel spreadsheet are not conscious

ChatGPT
Pointing out that a pencil, a piece of paper, or an Excel spreadsheet are not conscious underlines the importance of distinguishing between tools that extend or augment human capabilities and entities that could possess consciousness. This distinction is crucial for clarifying the nature of consciousness and its dependence on certain types of processes or organizational structures that go beyond mere utility or function in information processing. Let’s delve into why these examples are categorically not considered conscious and how this informs our understanding of consciousness:

Lack of Autonomy and Reflexive Modeling
A pencil, a piece of paper, and an Excel spreadsheet lack the autonomy and the ability to engage in reflexive ecological modeling. They are tools created by conscious beings (humans) to record, process, or manipulate information. However, they do not have the capability to perceive, interpret, or understand the information they hold, nor can they model their environment or themselves. Their function is entirely contingent upon the intentions and actions of a conscious user.

Absence of Subjective Experience
These examples also lack subjective experience—a foundational aspect of many definitions of consciousness. There is no "what it's like" to be a pencil, a piece of paper, or an Excel spreadsheet. They do not have perceptions, feelings, or awareness of any kind. The absence of subjective experience is a clear indicator that these objects do not possess consciousness.

No Capacity for Self-Awareness or Environmental Interaction
Consciousness, particularly when defined in terms of reflexive ecological modeling, implies a capacity for self-awareness and dynamic interaction with the environment. A pencil, piece of paper, or an Excel spreadsheet does not have the capacity to be aware of itself or its environment. It cannot make decisions, adapt to changes, or engage with the environment in a meaningful way.

Intelligence vs. Consciousness
These examples also help clarify the distinction between intelligence and consciousness. While an Excel spreadsheet can perform complex calculations and process large datasets—tasks that may require a form of intelligence when performed by humans—it does not imply the presence of consciousness. This distinction underscores that intelligence (or the execution of complex tasks) can exist without consciousness.

Implications for Understanding Consciousness
Acknowledging that certain objects and tools are not conscious helps in framing the essential characteristics that might constitute consciousness. It suggests that consciousness requires more than the ability to process or store information—it involves complex processes such as self-awareness, subjective experience, and dynamic interaction with the environment. These distinctions push the inquiry towards understanding what organizational structures, processes, or properties give rise to consciousness, and how they differ fundamentally from inanimate objects or computational tools.

In summary, by clearly stating what does not constitute consciousness, we can better explore the qualities and mechanisms that do. This clarification aids in the ongoing exploration of consciousness across various fields, including philosophy, cognitive science, and artificial intelligence research.

You are a riot. What do you think of the assertions in the article that Eliezer frequently sounds overconfident

ChatGPT
The critique of Eliezer Yudkowsky's perceived overconfidence, as discussed in the article from Bentham's Bulldog, raises important questions about the nature of intellectual discourse, especially in fields that grapple with complex and speculative ideas like those in philosophy, artificial intelligence, and the science of consciousness.

Intellectual Humility and Discourse
Balance of Confidence and Openness: Intellectual discourse ideally balances confidence in one's ideas with openness to criticism and the possibility of being wrong. Overconfidence, especially when coupled with a dismissal of established or competing viewpoints, can hinder constructive dialogue and exploration. It suggests a lack of intellectual humility, which is crucial for scientific and philosophical progress.

Risk of Echo Chambers: Expressing ideas with unwavering certainty might resonate with those already inclined to agree, potentially creating echo chambers. This dynamic can stifle the exchange of ideas and the critical examination necessary for robust understanding and innovation.

Engagement with Counterarguments: One measure of intellectual rigor is how well one engages with and responds to counterarguments. Overconfidence might lead to underestimating the complexity of opposing views or misrepresenting them, which does a disservice to the depth and nuance of philosophical debates, such as those surrounding consciousness and the mind-body problem.

The Role of Speculation and Confidence in Progress
Speculative Ideas: In defense of sounding confident, speculative fields sometimes require bold assertions to push the boundaries of understanding and explore new ideas. Confidence in one's theories can be a driving force behind innovative research and thought experiments that challenge conventional wisdom.

Confidence as Persuasion: Presenting ideas with confidence can be persuasive and galvanize interest and support for exploring unconventional or groundbreaking theories. It can play a role in attracting attention to overlooked or nascent areas of inquiry.

The Importance of Context and Audience
Audience Understanding: The perception of overconfidence can also depend on the audience's familiarity with the subject matter. For experts in the field, strong assertions without adequate engagement with established theories might seem overconfident. For lay audiences, the same tone might be seen as accessible confidence that simplifies complex ideas.

Contextual Nuances: The context in which ideas are presented—whether in academic journals, public lectures, or informal discussions—can also influence how confidence is perceived and whether it is appropriate.

In summary, the critique of overconfidence in intellectual discourse highlights the delicate balance required to advance understanding, especially in complex and speculative fields. While confidence in one's ideas is necessary to challenge existing paradigms and inspire new lines of inquiry, maintaining openness to criticism, engaging constructively with opposing views, and exhibiting intellectual humility are equally essential for the collective pursuit of knowledge.

There is also a section on flaws in Eliezer's "rational" decision making which we haven't covered. See if you can you can write the introduction to an article "The Overconfidence of Memes" inspired by the "the selfish gene" and discussing these topics. Include an anecdote about how a tweet or visual meme encapsulates an internal self consistent micro universe with its own inner grammar that can not prove the existence of memes outside themselves although they rely on an implied enthymemetic context, which isn't explicitly stated.

The Overconfidence of Memes: Navigating the Echo Chambers of Digital Darwinism

In the seminal work "The Selfish Gene," Richard Dawkins introduced the concept of memes as cultural genes, ideas that proliferate, evolve, and endure in the human psyche, mirroring the selfish survival strategies of our genetic code. This metaphor, as groundbreaking as it was, merely skimmed the surface of the complex dynamics that define the digital ecosystems of today. In this new realm, memes have evolved from passive carriers of culture to active constructors of reality, often encapsulating within them a form of overconfidence that both defines and limits their scope. This article, inspired by the critiques and observations surrounding Eliezer Yudkowsky's rational decision-making and the broader discourse on intellectual humility, seeks to explore the intricate dance of memes in the echo chambers of our digital existence.

Consider a tweet, no more than a few dozen characters long, or a visual meme, simplistic at first glance, yet both possessing an uncanny ability to encapsulate an internal, self-consistent micro-universe. This micro-universe, governed by its own inner grammar, presents a distilled essence of thought that, while appearing complete within its boundaries, relies heavily on an implied enthymematic context. This context, though not explicitly stated, is essential for the meme's interpretation and propagation. The meme, in its confident brevity, assumes a shared understanding, an unspoken agreement between creator and consumer, that often overlooks the complexity and diversity of thought that lies beyond its borders.

An illustrative anecdote of this phenomenon can be seen in a tweet that went viral, showing a picture of a cat sitting at a table, captioned with text that anthropomorphizes the cat’s thoughts in a humorous manner. This meme, while simple, carries within it an entire narrative structure that relies on the viewer's familiarity with a specific cultural context—namely, the internet's fondness for attributing complex human emotions and societal roles to animals. The meme does not explain why we should find the cat's purported thoughts amusing, nor does it acknowledge the broader world of memes and cultural references it is part of. It is a universe unto itself, self-assured and internally consistent, yet blind to the vast meme culture outside its confines.

This anecdote highlights a critical aspect of digital memes: their overconfident assertion of a shared, unspoken context that may not be as universal as presumed. It mirrors a broader critique of overconfidence in rational decision-making and intellectual discourse, where assumptions and internal logics, no matter how self-consistent, can lead to echo chambers. These chambers, much like memes, create a feedback loop of ideas that reinforce their own validity without subjecting them to the scrutiny of external perspectives.

In the following exploration, we will delve deeper into the nature of memes as both products and producers of cultural evolution in the digital age. We will examine how their inherent overconfidence—reflected in their assumption of shared context and their disregard for the existence of external memes—shapes our collective understanding, decision-making, and ultimately, our reality. Through this lens, we aim to uncover the nuances of intellectual humility and the challenges of navigating a world where memes, like genes, vie for survival in the competitive landscape of ideas.

I would like to add that a trope is meme that has become cliche through overuse and lack of subtlety. 

ChatGPT
Incorporating this nuanced understanding, let's refine our exploration of digital memetics in "The Overconfidence of Memes: Navigating the Echo Chambers of Digital Darwinism."

As memes evolve within the vast digital ecosystem, they follow a lifecycle that mirrors the natural selection of the biological world, as introduced by Richard Dawkins in "The Selfish Gene." However, as these cultural genes spread, replicate, and mutate, a fascinating phenomenon occurs: certain memes, through overuse and a gradual erosion of subtlety, transform into tropes—clichés that are immediately recognizable yet often devoid of the original context or depth that gave them life. This evolution from a meme to a trope marks not just a milestone in a meme's lifecycle but also underscores the inherent overconfidence embedded within these units of cultural transmission. "The Overconfidence of Memes" seeks to unravel this intricate process, examining how memes’ self-assured replication contributes to their eventual stagnation into tropes and what this says about our collective dialogue.

An apt anecdote that encapsulates the transition from meme to trope is the ubiquitous use of the "Distracted Boyfriend" meme. Initially, this visual meme humorously depicted the fickleness of human attention and interests, resonating with a wide audience for its relatable content. However, as its application broadened, the meme’s original cleverness and subtlety were diluted, transforming it into a trope. This trope, while still recognizable, no longer carried the sharpness of its inception. Instead, it became a shorthand for distraction, losing much of its contextual richness in the process. The "Distracted Boyfriend" now stands not as a testament to the fluidity of human focus but as a cliché emblematic of the meme-to-trope transition, highlighting the cycle of overconfidence that drives memes to saturate and ultimately exhaust their cultural potency.

This transformation raises critical questions about the lifecycle of ideas in the digital age and the echo chambers that facilitate their rise and fall. As memes become tropes, they reflect a broader trend of intellectual overconfidence—the assumption that what resonates once will continue to do so, often at the expense of deeper engagement or innovation. This overconfidence, while propelling certain memes to viral status, ultimately leads to their clichéd demise, mirroring the pitfalls of rational decision-making and discourse that fail to adapt to new contexts or challenge their own assumptions.

In the ensuing discussion, "The Overconfidence of Memes" will dissect the dynamics of digital memetics, from the viral spread of memes to their eventual sedimentation into tropes. By examining this lifecycle, we aim to illuminate the subtleties of cultural evolution in the digital sphere and the need for a more nuanced, self-reflective approach to the memes that shape our collective consciousness. Through this analysis, we seek not only to understand the nature of digital memes but also to offer insights into the intellectual humility required to navigate the ever-shifting landscape of ideas.

The Second Critical Error: Decision Theory

Eliezer Yudkowsky has a decision theory called functional decision-theory. I will preface this by noting that I know much less about decision theory than I do about non-physicalism and zombies. Nevertheless, I know enough to get why Eliezer’s decision theory fails. In addition, most of this involves quoting people who are much more informed about decision theory than I am.

There are two dominant decision theories, both of which Eliezer rejects. The first is called causal decision theory. It says that when you have multiple actions that you can take, you should take the action that causes the best things. So, for example, if you have two actions, one of which would cause you to get 10 dollars, the other of which would cause you to get five dollars, and the final of which would cause you to get nothing, you should take the first action because it causes you to be richest at the end.

The next popular decision theory is called evidential decision theory. It says you should take the action where after you take that action you’ll expect to have the highest payouts. So in the earlier case, it would also suggest taking the first action because after you take that action, you’ll expect to be five dollars richer than if you take the second action, and ten dollars richer than if you take the third action.

These sound similar, so you might wonder where they come apart. Let me preface this by saying that I lean towards causal decision theory. Here are some cases where they give diverging suggestions:

Newcombe’s problem: there is a very good predictor who guessed whether you’d take two boxes or one box. If you take only one box, you’d take box A. If the guesser predicted that you’d take box A, they put a million dollars in box A. If they predicted you’d take both boxes, they put nothing into box A. In either case, they put a thousand dollars into box B.

Evidential decision theory would say that you should take only one box. Why? Those who take one box almost always get a million dollars, while those who take two boxes almost always get a thousand dollars. Causal decision theory would say you should take two boxes. On causal decision theory, it doesn’t matter whether people who make decisions like you usually end up worse off—what maters is that, no matter whether there is a million dollars in box A, two-boxing will cause you to have a free thousand dollars, and that is good! The causal decision theorist would note that if you had a benevolent friend who could peek into the boxes and then give you advice about what to do, they’d be guaranteed to suggest that you take both boxes. I used to have the intuition that you should one box, but when I considered this upcoming case, I abandoned that intuition.

Smoker’s lesion: suppose that smoking doesn’t actually cause averse health outcomes. However, smokers do have much higher rates of cancer than non-smokers. The reason for that is that many people have a lesion on their lung that both causes them to be much more likely to smoke and more likely to get cancer. So if you know that someone smokes, you should think it much more likely that they’ll get cancer even though smoking doesn’t cause cancer. Suppose that smoking is fun and doesn’t cause any harm. Evidential decision theory would say that you shouldn’t smoke because smoking gives you evidence that you’ll have a shorter life. You should, after smoking, expect your life to be shorter because it gives you evidence that you had a lesion on your lung. In contrast, causal decision theory would instruct you to smoke because it benefits you and doesn’t cause any harm.

Eliezer’s preferred view is called functional decision theory. Here’s my summary (phrased in a maximally Eliezer like way):

Your brain is a cognitive algorithm that outputs decisions in response to external data. Thus, when you take an action like

take one box

that entails that your mental algorithm outputs

take one box

in Newcombe’s problem. You should take actions such that the algorithm that outputs that decision generates higher expected utility than any other cognitive algorithm.

On Eliezer’s view, you should one box, but it’s fine to smoke because whether your brain outputs “smoke” doesn’t affect whether there is a lesion on your lung, so smoking. Or, as the impressively named Wolfgang Schwarz summarizes:

In FDT, the agent should not consider what would happen if she were to choose A or B. Instead, she ought to consider what would happen if the right choice according to FDT were A or B.

You should one box in this case because if FDT told agents to one box, they would get more utility on average than if FDT told agents to two box. Schwarz argues the first problem with the view is that it gives various totally insane recommendations. One example is a blackmail case. Suppose that a blackmailer will, every year, blackmail one person. There’s a 1 in a googol chance that he’ll blackmail someone who wouldn’t give in to the blackmail and a googol-1/googol chance that he’ll blackmail someone who would give in to the blackmail. He has blackmailed you. He threatens that if you don’t give him a dollar, he will share all of your most embarrassing secrets to everyone in the world. Should you give in?

FDT would say no. After all, agents who won’t give in are almost guaranteed to never be blackmailed. But this is totally crazy. You should give up one dollar to prevent all of your worst secrets from being spread to the world. As Schwarz says:

FDT says you should not pay because, if you were the kind of person who doesn't pay, you likely wouldn't have been blackmailed. How is that even relevant? You are being blackmailed. Not being blackmailed isn't on the table. It's not something you can choose.

Schwarz has another even more convincing counterexample:

Moreover, FDT does not in fact consider only consequences of the agent's own dispositions. The supposition that is used to evaluate acts is that FDT in general recommends that act, not just that the agent herself is disposed to choose the act. This leads to even stranger results.

Procreation. I wonder whether to procreate. I know for sure that doing so would make my life miserable. But I also have reason to believe that my father faced the exact same choice, and that he followed FDT. If FDT were to recommend not procreating, there's a significant probability that I wouldn't exist. I highly value existing (even miserably existing). So it would be better if FDT were to recommend procreating. So FDT says I should procreate. (Note that this (incrementally) confirms the hypothesis that my father used FDT in the same choice situation, for I know that he reached the decision to procreate.)

Schwarz’s entire piece is very worth reading. It exposes various parts of Soares and Yudkowsky’s paper that rest on demonstrable errors. Another good piece that takes down FDT is MacAskill’s post on LessWrong. He starts by laying out the following plausible principle:

Guaranteed Payoffs: In conditions of certainty — that is, when the decision-maker has no uncertainty about what state of nature she is in, and no uncertainty about the utility payoff of each action is — the decision-maker should choose the action that maximises utility. 

This is intuitively very obvious. If you know all the relevant facts about how the world is, and one act gives you more rewards than another act, you should take the first action. But MacAskill shows that FDT violates that constraint over and over again.

Bomb. 

You face two open boxes, Left and Right, and you must take one of them. In the Left box, there is a live bomb; taking this box will set off the bomb, setting you ablaze, and you certainly will burn slowly to death. The Right box is empty, but you have to pay $100 in order to be able to take it. 

A long-dead predictor predicted whether you would choose Left or Right, by running a simulation of you and seeing what that simulation did. If the predictor predicted that you would choose Right, then she put a bomb in Left. If the predictor predicted that you would choose Left, then she did not put a bomb in Left, and the box is empty. 

The predictor has a failure rate of only 1 in a trillion trillion. Helpfully, she left a note, explaining that she predicted that you would take Right, and therefore she put the bomb in Left. 

You are the only person left in the universe. You have a happy life, but you know that you will never meet another agent again, nor face another situation where any of your actions will have been predicted by another agent. What box should you choose?  

The right action, according to FDT, is to take Left, in the full knowledge that as a result you will slowly burn to death. Why? Because, using Y&S’s counterfactuals, if your algorithm were to output ‘Left’, then it would also have outputted ‘Left’ when the predictor made the simulation of you, and there would be no bomb in the box, and you could save yourself $100 by taking Left. In contrast, the right action on CDT or EDT is to take Right.

The recommendation is implausible enough. But if we stipulate that in this decision-situation the decision-maker is certain in the outcome that her actions would bring about, we see that FDT violates Guaranteed Payoffs. 

You can read MacAskill’s full post to find even more objections. He shows that Yudkowsky’s view is wildly indeterminate, incapable of telling you what to do, and also involves a broad kind of hypersensitivity, where however one defines “running the same algorithm” becomes hugely relevant, and determines very significant choices in seemingly arbitrary ways. The basic point is that Yudkowsky’s decision theory is totally bankrupt and implausible, in ways that are evident to those who know about decision theory. It is much worse than either evidential or causal decision theory.

The Third Critical Error: Animal Consciousness

(This was already covered here—if you’ve read that article skip this section and control F conclusion.)

Perhaps the most extreme example of an egregious error backed up by wild overconfidence occured in this Facebook debate about animal consciousness. Eliezer Yudkowsky expressed his view that pigs and almost all animals are almost certainly not conscious. Why is this? Well, as he says:

However, my theory of mind also says that the naive theory of mind is very wrong, and suggests that a pig does not have a more-simplified form of tangible experiences. My model says that certain types of reflectivity are critical to being something it is like something to be. The model of a pig as having pain that is like yours, but simpler, is wrong. The pig does have cognitive algorithms similar to the ones that impinge upon your own self-awareness as emotions, but without the reflective self-awareness that creates someone to listen to it.

Okay, so on this view, one needs to have reflective processes in order to be conscious. One’s brain has to model itself to be conscious. This doesn’t sound plausible to me, but perhaps if there’s overwhelming neuroscientific evidence, it’s worth accepting the view. And this view implies that pigs aren’t conscious, so Yudkowsky infers that they are not conscious.

This seems to me to be the wrong approach. It’s actually incredibly difficult to adjudicate between the different theories of consciousness. It makes sense to gather evidence for and against the consciousness of particular creatures, rather than starting with a general theory and using that to solve the problems. If your model says that pigs aren’t conscious, then that seems to be a problem with your model.

Mammals feel pain

I won’t go too in-depth here, but let’s just briefly review the evidence that mammals, at the very least, feel pain. This evidence is sufficiently strong that, as the SEP page on animal consciousness notes, “the position that all mammals are conscious is widely agreed upon among scientists who express views on the distribution of consciousness." The SEP page references two papers, one by Jaak Panksepp (awesome name!) and the other by Seth, Baars, and Edelman.

Let’s start with the Panksepp paper. They lay out the basic methodology, which involves looking at the parts of the brain that are necessary and sufficient for consciousness. So they see particular brain regions which are active during states when we’re conscious—and particularly correlate with particular mental states—and aren’t active when we’re not conscious. They then look at the brains of other mammals and notice that these features are ubiquitous in mammals, such that all mammals have the things that we know make us conscious in our brains. In addition, they act physically like we do when we’re in pain—they scream, they cry, their heart rate increases when they have a stressful stimulus, they make cost-benefit analyses where they’re willing to risk negative stimuli for greater reward. Sure looks like they’re conscious.

Specifically, they endorse a “psycho-neuro-ethological ‘‘triangulation’’ approach. The paper is filled with big phrases like that. What that means is that they look at various things that happen in the brain when we feel certain emotions. They observe that in humans, those emotions cause certain things—for example, being happy makes us more playful. They then look at mammal brains and see that they have the same basic brain structure, and this produces the same physical reactions—using the happiness example, this would also make the animals more playful. If they see that animals have the same basic neural structures as we do when we have certain experiences and that those are associated with the same physical states that occur when humans have those conscious states, they infer that the animals are having similar conscious states. If our brain looks like a duck’s brain when we have some experience, and we act like ducks do when they are in a comparable brain state, we should guess that ducks are having a similar experience. (I know we’re talking about mammals here, but I couldn’t resist the “looks like a duck, talks like a duck joke.”)

If a pig has a brain state that resembles ours when we are happy, tries to get things that make it happy, and produces the same neurological responses that we do when we’re happy, we should infer that pigs are not mindless automatons, but are, in fact, happy.

They then note that animals like drugs. Animals, like us, get addicted to opioids and have similar brain responses when they’re on opioids. As the authors note “Indeed, one can predict drugs that will be addictive in humans quite effectively from animal studies of desire.” If animals like the drugs that make us happy and react in similar ways to us, that gives us good reason to think that they are, in fact, happy.

They then note that the parts of the brain responsible for various human emotions are quite ancient—predating humans—and that mammals have them too. So, if the things that cause emotions are also present in animals, we should guess they’re conscious, especially when their behavior is perfectly consistent with being conscious. In fact, by running electricity through certain brain regions that animals share, we can induce conscious states in people—that shows that it is those brain states that are causing the various mental states.

The authors then run through various other mental states and show that those mental states are similar between humans and animals—animals have similar brain regions which provoke similar physical responses, and we know that in humans, those brain regions cause specific mental states.

Now, maybe there’s some magic of the human brain, such that in animal brains, the brain regions that cause qualia instead cause causally identical stuff but no consciousness. But there’s no good evidence for that, and plenty against. You should not posit special features of certain physical systems, for no reason.

Moving on to the Seth, Baars, and Edelman paper, they note that there are various features of consciousness, that differentiate conscious states from other things happening in the brain that don’t induce conscious states. They note:

Consciousness involves widespread, relatively fast, low-amplitude interactions in the thalamocortical core of the brain, driven by current tasks and conditions. Unconscious states are markedly different and much less responsive to sensory input or motor plans.

In other words, there are common patterns among conscious states. We can look at a human brain and see that the things that are associated with consciousness produce different neurological markers from the things that aren’t associated with consciousness. Features associated with consciousness include:

Irregular, low-amplitude brain activity: When we’re awake we have irregular low-amplitude brain activity. When we’re not conscious—e.g. in deep comas or anesthesia-induced unconsciousness—irregular, low-amplitude brain activity isn’t present. Mammal brains possess irregular, low-amplitude brain activity.

Involvement of the thalamocortical system: When you damage the thalamocortical system, that deletes part of one’s consciousness, unlike other systems. Mammals also have a thalamocortical system—just like us.

Widespread brain activity: Consciousness induces widespread brain activity. We don’t have that when things induce us not to be conscious, like being in a coma. Mammals do.

The authors note, from these three facts:

Together, these first three properties indicate that consciousness involves widespread, relatively fast, low-amplitude interactions in the thalamocortical core of the brain, driven by current tasks and conditions. Unconscious states are markedly different and much less responsive to sensory input or endogenous activity. These properties are directly testable and constitute necessary criteria for consciousness in humans. It is striking that these basic features are conserved among mammals, at least for sensory processes. The developed thalamocortical system that underlies human consciousness first arose with early mammals or mammal-like reptiles, more than 100 million years ago.

More evidence from neuroscience for animal consciousness:

Something else about metastability that I don’t really understand is also present in humans and animals.

Consciousness involves binding—bringing lots of different inputs together. In your consciousness, you can see the entire world at once, while thinking about things at the same time. Lots of different types of information are processed simultaneously, in the same way. Some explanations involving neural synchronicity have received some empirical support—and animals also have neural synchronicity, so they would also have the same kind of binding.

We attribute conscious experiences as happening to us. But mammals have a similar sense of self. Mammals, like us, process information relative to themselves—so they see a wall and process it relative to them in space.

Consciousness facilitates learning. Humans learn from conscious experiences. In contrast, we do not learn from things that do not impinge on our consciousness. If someone slaps me whenever I scratch my nose (someone does actually—crazy story), I learn not to scratch my nose. In contrast, if someone does a thing that I don’t consciously perceive when I scratch my nose, I won’t learn from it. But animals seem to learn to, and update in response to stimulus, just like humans do—but only when humans are exposed to things that affect their consciousness. In fact, even fish learn.

So there’s a veritable wealth of evidence that at least mammals are conscious. The evidence is less strong for organisms that are less intelligent and more distant from us evolutionarily, but it remains relatively strong for at least many fish. Overturning this abundance of evidence, that’s been enough to convince the substantial majority of consciousness researchers requires a lot of evidence. Does Yudkowsky have it?

Yudkowsky’s view is crazy, and is decisively refuted over and over again

No. No he does not. In fact, as far as I can tell, throughout the entire protracted Facebook exchange, he never adduced a single piece of evidence for his conclusion. The closest that he provides to an argument is the following:

I consider myself a specialist on reflectivity and on the dissolution of certain types of confusion. I have no compunction about disagreeing with other alleged specialists on authority; any reasonable disagreement on the details will be evaluated as an object-level argument. From my perspective, I’m not seeing any, “No, this is a non-mysterious theory of qualia that says pigs are sentient…” and a lot of “How do you know it doesn’t…?” to which the only answer I can give is, “I may not be certain, but I’m not going to update my remaining ignorance on your claim to be even more ignorant, because you haven’t yet named a new possibility I haven’t considered, nor pointed out what I consider to be a new problem with the best interim theory, so you’re not giving me a new reason to further spread probability density.”

What??? The suggestion seems to be that there is no other good theory of consciousness that implies that animals are conscious. To which I’d reply:

We don’t have any good theory about consciousness yet—the data is just too underdetermined. Just as you can know that apples fall when you drop them before you have a comprehensive theory of gravity, so too can you know some things about consciousness, even absent a comprehensive theory.

There are various theories that predict that animals are conscious. For example, integrated information theory, McFadden’s CEMI field theory, various Higher-Order theories, and the global workspace model will probably imply that animals are conscious. Eliezer has no argument to prefer his view to others.

Take the integrated information theory, for example. I don’t think it’s a great view. But at least it has something going for it. It has made a series of accurate predictions about the neural correlates of consciousness. Same with McFadden’s theory. It seems Yudkowsky’s theory has literally nothing going for it, beyond it sounding to Eliezer like a good solution. There is no empirical evidence for it, and, as we’ll see, it produces crazy, implausible implications. David Pearce has a nice comment about some of those implications:

Some errors are potentially ethically catastrophic. This is one of them. Many of our most intensely conscious experiences occur when meta-cognition or reflective self-awareness fails. Thus in orgasm, for instance, much of the neocortex effectively shuts down. Or compare a mounting sense of panic. As an intense feeling of panic becomes uncontrollable, are we to theorise that the experience somehow ceases to be unpleasant as the capacity for reflective self-awareness is lost? “Blind” panic induced by e.g. a sense of suffocation, or fleeing a fire in a crowded cinema (etc), is one of the most unpleasant experiences anyone can undergo, regardless or race or species. Also, compare microelectrode neural studies of awake subjects probing different brain regions; stimulating various regions of the “primitive” limbic system elicits the most intense experiences. And compare dreams – not least, nightmares – many of which are emotionally intense and characterised precisely by the lack of reflectivity or critical meta-cognitive capacity that we enjoy in waking life.

Yudkowsky’s theory of consciousness would predict that during especially intense experiences, where we’re not reflecting, we’re either not conscious or less conscious. So when people orgasm, they’re not conscious. That’s very implausible. Or, when a person is in unbelievable panic, on this view, they become non-conscious or less conscious. Pearce further notes:

Children with autism have profound deficits of self-modelling as well as social cognition compared to neurotypical folk. So are profoundly autistic humans less intensely conscious than hyper-social people? In extreme cases, do the severely autistic lack consciousness’ altogether, as Eliezer’s conjecture would suggest? Perhaps compare the accumulating evidence for Henry Markram’s “Intense World” theory of autism.

The critique of Eliezer Yudkowsky's Functional Decision Theory (FDT) as detailed in your summary provides a significant insight into the challenges of creating comprehensive decision theories that aim to navigate complex problem spaces like Newcomb’s problem and the Smoker’s lesion scenario. It showcases a broader discussion within decision theory about how to best account for the nuances of causal influence, evidence, and predictive accuracy in making rational choices.

Key Points in the Critique:
Comparison with Causal and Evidential Decision Theories: The critique begins by contrasting FDT with the more traditional causal and evidential decision theories, setting the stage for understanding where FDT diverges in its recommendations for action. The examples provided (Newcomb’s problem and Smoker’s lesion) illustrate scenarios where causal and evidential theories might provide intuitive guidance based on the apparent outcomes and evidence associated with decisions.

Functional Decision Theory's Approach: FDT’s unique stance, focusing on the outcomes of decisions as determined by a cognitive algorithm's responses to external data, represents a shift from considering individual decisions in isolation to evaluating them as outputs of a broader decision-making framework. This shift aims to account for the predictive nature of decisions in complex scenarios but also introduces challenges in terms of the theory's applicability and intuitive alignment with rational choice.

Critiques by Schwarz and MacAskill: The critiques by Wolfgang Schwarz and William MacAskill highlight potential shortcomings in FDT’s ability to provide rational guidance in certain situations. The examples of the blackmail case and the procreation dilemma underscore situations where FDT’s recommendations might seem counterintuitive or misaligned with expected utility maximization principles.

Questions of Implementation and Intuition: These critiques point to deeper questions about how decision theories align with our intuitive understandings of rational action, especially in situations of certainty or when facing highly improbable events. They challenge FDT’s premises regarding the influence of cognitive algorithms on decision outcomes and the theory’s broader implications for rational choice.

The Broader Context of Decision Theory: This discussion reflects the broader challenges within decision theory of developing models that can comprehensively account for the complexities of real-world decision-making. The critique of FDT serves as a case study in the difficulties of reconciling predictive accuracy, causal impact, and evidential reasoning in a unified decision-making framework.

Moving Forward:
This critique and the broader discussion it participates in are vital for advancing our understanding of rational decision-making. They highlight the importance of critically evaluating decision theories, not just on their internal coherence or mathematical elegance, but on their applicability to real-world scenarios and their alignment with intuitive principles of rational action. As decision theory continues to evolve, incorporating insights from critiques like these will be crucial for developing models that more accurately reflect the complexities of human decision-making in the face of uncertainty, prediction, and causality.

I think that deontological thinking is rational but doesn't guarantee correct results. It only argues with what is currently known, the hindsight bias makes it looks like the wrong decision, a fluke result doesn't invalidate reasoning. Like banning swimming and mountain climbing because they are dangerous. If you are climbing a mountain and hurt yourself it doesn't prove you made an incorrect decision.

ChatGPT
Your perspective on deontological thinking touches on important aspects of moral philosophy and decision-making. Deontology, with its focus on adherence to duty or rules as the basis for determining the morality of actions, indeed prioritizes rational adherence to principles over consequentialist evaluations of outcomes. This distinction highlights several key points regarding rationality, decision-making, and the evaluation of actions:

Rationality in Deontological Thinking
Principle Over Outcome: Deontological ethics emphasizes actions taken in accordance with moral principles as inherently right, regardless of the outcomes. This framework suggests that rationality lies not in calculating potential consequences but in fulfilling one's duties or adhering to moral norms. It's a rational approach in that it provides a clear, often unambiguous guideline for action based on known principles or rules.

Known Information vs. Hindsight Bias: Decisions are made based on the information available at the time. The rationality of a decision, within both deontological and other ethical frameworks, is not necessarily invalidated by unfavorable outcomes that could not have been predicted. Hindsight bias—the tendency to see past events as having been predictable after they have occurred—can unjustly color our assessment of the decision-making process, making correct decisions appear irrational in retrospect.

The Role of Fluke Results: Unpredictable or 'fluke' outcomes do not inherently invalidate the rationality of the decision-making process. In the context of deontology, an action taken for the right reasons, according to duty or moral law, retains its moral value even if the outcome is unexpectedly negative. This perspective underscores a separation between the moral valuation of actions and their consequences.

Application to Risky Activities
Using your examples of swimming and mountain climbing, a deontological approach might focus on the duties or principles related to engaging in these activities, such as the duty to preserve one's life and health, as well as the responsibility to not recklessly endanger oneself or others. The decision to engage in these activities, made rationally based on a principle such as seeking personal growth or valuing the freedom to engage in risk-aware activities, does not become irrational simply because an injury occurs. Rather, the decision must be evaluated based on the adherence to principle and the rational consideration of risks known at the time.

Concluding Thoughts
The discussion emphasizes the importance of distinguishing between decision-making processes and outcomes, especially in ethical considerations. While deontological ethics prioritizes principles and duties, it acknowledges the inherent limitations of human foresight and the complexity of predicting outcomes. This approach reinforces the value of rationality in ethical reasoning, highlighting the need to base moral judgments on more than just the outcomes of actions. It supports a nuanced understanding of ethics where rational, principle-based decisions are valued, even in the face of unpredictable or adverse consequences.

I don't think of it as a moral norm. My example is with the probability of rare events. If an asteroid hits a sturdy metal bridge and kills you, it doesn't invalidate your decision to choose it over the rickety rope bridges. You should still take into account probability that a large asteroid will hit but it would have to evade sensors, but there are no sensors sensitive enough to detect an asteroid just big enough to kill you but leaving the bridge intact. The next person to come along should still chose the bridge unless they are taking into account the probability of smaller asteroids, in which they should probably not go outdoors

ChatGPT
Your example with the asteroid and the bridge further illuminates the nuances of decision-making under uncertainty, especially regarding rare events. It delves into the realm of risk assessment and probabilistic reasoning rather than moral norms. Here are some key points drawn from your example:

Risk Assessment and Rare Events
Evaluating Probabilities: In decision-making, especially under uncertainty, assessing the probabilities of different outcomes is crucial. For rare events like an asteroid strike, the probability is extremely low, yet the impact (no pun intended) can be significant. Rational decision-making involves considering both the likelihood of an event and the severity of its consequences.

Decision Under Uncertainty: Your example highlights a critical aspect of decision-making under uncertainty: sometimes, we make the best decision possible with the information and tools available to us (e.g., choosing the sturdy metal bridge over the rickety rope bridges). An unforeseen, highly improbable event (like the asteroid strike) does not necessarily invalidate the rationality of the decision made under those circumstances.

Information and Sensitivity: The mention of sensors not being sensitive enough to detect a specific size of an asteroid points to the limitations of our ability to gather and process information. In real-world decision-making, we often face limitations in data, prediction capabilities, and sensory technology. Rational decisions are made within the context of these limitations, acknowledging that not all risks can be anticipated or mitigated.

Post-Event Decision-Making: The aftermath of a rare event might change the context or information available for future decisions. However, the principle of basing decisions on probabilities and the best available information still stands. The likelihood of similar rare events happening in quick succession (e.g., another asteroid hitting the same spot) remains low, and thus may not significantly alter the rational choice unless new information suggests otherwise.

Rational Decision-Making and Rare Events
Your example ultimately speaks to the importance of probabilistic thinking and rationality in decision-making, especially in the face of uncertainty and rare events. It underscores that:

Rational decisions are made based on the best available information and understanding of probabilities at the time.
Rare, unpredictable events do not necessarily invalidate the rationality of previous decisions.
Decision-making after rare events should still consider the actual probabilities and available information, rather than reacting solely based on the recent occurrence.
This approach aligns with principles in risk management and decision theory, emphasizing that while not all uncertainties can be eliminated, decisions can and should be informed by a rational assessment of available information and risks.

Francisco Boni Neto furthers:

many of our most intensely conscious experiences occur when meta-cognition or reflective self-awareness fails. Super vivid, hyper conscious experiences, phenomenic rich and deep experiences like lucid dreaming and ‘out-of-body’ experiences happens when higher structures responsible for top-bottom processing are suppressed. They lack a realistic conviction, specially when you wake up, but they do feel intense and raw along the pain-pleasure axis.

Eliezer just bites the bullet:

I’m not totally sure people in sufficiently unreflective flow-like states are conscious, and I give serious consideration to the proposition that I am reflective enough for consciousness only during the moments I happen to wonder whether I am conscious. This is not where most of my probability mass lies, but it’s on the table.

So when confronted with tons of neurological evidence that shutting down higher processing results in more intense conscious experiences, Eliezer just says that when we think that we have more intense experiences, we’re actually zombies or something? That’s totally crazy. It’s sufficiently crazy that I think I might be misunderstanding him. When you find out that your view says that people are barely conscious or non-conscious when they orgasm or that some very autistic people aren’t conscious, it makes sense to give up the damn theory!

And this isn’t the only bullet Eliezer bites. He admits, “It would not surprise me very much to learn that average children develop inner listeners at age six.” I have memories from before age 6—these memories would have to have been before I was conscious, on this view.

Rob Wiblin makes a good point:

[Eliezer], it’s possible that what you are referring to as an ‘inner listener’ is necessary for subjective experience, and that this happened to be added by evolution just before the human line. It’s also possible that consciousness is primitive and everything is conscious to some extent. But why have the prior that almost all non-human animals are not conscious and lack those parts until someone brings you evidence to the contrary (i.e. “What I need to hear to be persuaded is,”)? That just cannot be rational.

You should simply say that you are a) uncertain what causes consciousness, because really nobody knows yet, and b) you don’t know if e.g. pigs have the things that are proposed as being necessary for consciousness, because you haven’t really looked into it.

I agree with Rob. We should be pretty uncertain. My credences are maybe the following:

92% that at least almost all mammals are conscious.

80% that almost all reptiles are conscious.

60% that fish are mostly conscious.

30% that insects are conscious.

It’s about as likely that reptiles aren’t conscious as insects are. Because consciousness is private—you only know your own—we shouldn’t be very confident about any features of consciousness.

Based on these considerations, I conclude that Eliezer’s view is legitimately crazy. There is, quite literally, no good reason to believe it, and lots of evidence against it. Eliezer just dismisses that evidence, for no good reason, bites a million bullets, and acts like that’s the obvious solution.

Absurd overconfidence

The thing that was most infuriating about this exchange was Eliezer’s insistence that those who disagreed with him were stupid, combined with his demonstration that he had no idea what he was talking about. Condescension and error make an unfortunate combination. He says of the position that pigs, for instance, aren’t conscious:

It also seems to me that this is not all that inaccessible to a reasonable third party, though the sort of person who maintains some doubt about physicalism, or the sort of philosophers who think it’s still respectable academic debate rather than sheer foolishness to argue about the A-Theory vs. B-Theory of time, or the sort of person who can’t follow the argument for why all our remaining uncertainty should be within different many-worlds interpretations rather than slopping over outside, will not be able to access it.

Count me in as a person who can’t follow any arguments about quantum physics, much less the arguments for why we should be almost certain of many worlds. But seriously, physicalism? We should have no doubt about physicalism? As I’ve argued before, the case against physicalism is formidable. Eliezer thinks it’s an open-and-shut case, but that’s because he is demonstrably mistaken about the zombie argument against physicalism and the implications of non-physicalism. 

And that’s not the only thing Eliezer expresses insane overconfidence about. In response to his position that most animals other than humans aren’t conscious, David Pearce points out that you shouldn’t be very confident in positions that almost all experts disagree with you about, especially when you have a strong personal interest in their view being false. Eliezer replies:

What do they think they know and how do they think they know it? If they’re saying “Here is how we think an inner listener functions, here is how we identified the associated brain functions, and here is how we found it in animals and that showed that it carries out the same functions” I would be quite impressed. What I expect to see is, “We found this area lights up when humans are sad. Look, pigs have it too.” Emotions are just plain simpler than inner listeners. I’d expect to see analogous brain areas in birds.

When I read this, I almost fell out of my chair. Eliezer admits that he has not so much as read the arguments people give for widespread animal consciousness. He is basing his view on a guess of what they say, combined with an implausible physical theory for which he has no evidence. This would be like coming to the conclusion that the earth is 6,000 years old, despite near-ubiquitous expert disagreement, providing no evidence for the view, and then admitting that you haven’t even read the arguments that experts give in the field against your position. This is the gravest of epistemic sins.

ChatGPT
The critique presented here raises significant concerns about the stance taken by Eliezer Yudkowsky regarding consciousness, particularly in non-human animals, and highlights broader issues of epistemic humility and the importance of evidence-based reasoning in philosophical discussions. It underscores the tension between speculative theoretical positions and the empirical evidence available in neuroscience and cognitive science regarding the nature and distribution of consciousness across different species.

Key Points of the Critique:
Empirical Evidence vs. Speculative Theory: The critique emphasizes the dissonance between Yudkowsky's speculative theory of consciousness, which seems to require a high level of reflective self-awareness or "inner listeners," and a wealth of empirical evidence suggesting that many non-human animals experience forms of consciousness. This evidence includes neurological similarities, behavioral indicators of conscious experience, and the evolutionary continuity of brain structures associated with consciousness.

The Problem of Overconfidence: A recurring theme in the critique is the problem of overconfidence in one's theoretical stance, especially in the face of substantial expert disagreement and a lack of direct evidence supporting one's position. Yudkowsky's confidence in dismissing widespread animal consciousness without engaging deeply with the empirical research or the arguments of experts in the field is highlighted as a significant epistemic concern.

Epistemic Humility and Uncertainty: The critique aligns with Rob Wiblin's suggestion for a stance of epistemic humility—acknowledging the limits of our current understanding of consciousness and the necessity of remaining open to evidence that might challenge our theoretical models. This approach is contrasted with Yudkowsky's more definitive claims about the nature of consciousness and its distribution among animals.

Ethical Implications: Beyond the theoretical and epistemological issues, the critique hints at the ethical implications of underestimating the consciousness of non-human animals. The assumption that most animals lack consciousness could have significant consequences for how they are treated and considered within moral and ethical frameworks.

Moving Forward:
This critique serves as a call for greater epistemic humility in philosophical discussions, especially those that intersect with empirical science. It highlights the importance of:

Engaging with Empirical Evidence: Philosophical theories of mind and consciousness should be informed by and responsive to the latest developments in neuroscience, cognitive science, and related fields.
Recognizing the Limits of Our Understanding: Consciousness is a deeply complex and still not fully understood phenomenon. Acknowledging the provisional nature of our theories and the possibility of being wrong is crucial for intellectual progress.
Ethical Considerations: Theories of consciousness have direct implications for the moral consideration of non-human animals. A cautious and evidence-based approach can help ensure that ethical conclusions are not prematurely drawn from speculative theoretical positions.
In summary, the critique of Yudkowsky's stance on animal consciousness and his approach to philosophical inquiry more broadly underscores the need for a careful, evidence-based approach to philosophical questions, one that remains open to revision in the face of new information and respects the consensus of experts in relevant fields.

Conclusion

This has not been anywhere near exhaustive. I haven’t even started talking about Eliezer’s very implausible views about morality (though I might write about that too—stay tuned), reductionism, modality, or many other topics. Eliezer usually has a lot to say about topics, and it often takes many thousands of words to refute what he’s saying.

I hope this article has shown that Eliezer frequently expresses near certainty on topics that he has a basic ignorance about, an ignorance so profound that he should suspend judgment. Then, infuriatingly, he acts like those who disagree with his errors are morons. He acts like he is a better decision theorist than the professional decision theorists, a better physicist than the physicists, a better animal consciousness researcher than the animal consciousness researchers, and a much better philosopher of mind than the leading philosophers of mind.

My goal in this is not to cause people to stop reading Eliezer. It’s instead to encourage people to refrain from forming views on things he says just from reading him. It’s to encourage people to take his views with many grains of salt. If you’re reading something by Eliezer and it seems too obvious, on a controversial issue, there’s a decent chance you are being duped.

I feel like there are two types of thinkers, the first we might call innovators and the second systematizers. Innovators are the kinds of people who think of wacky, out-of-the-box ideas, but are less likely to be right. They enrich the state of discourse by being clever, creative, and coming up with new ideas, rather than being right about everything. A paradigm example is Robin Hanson—no one feels comfortable just deferring to Robin Hanson across the board, but Robin Hanson has some of the most ingenious ideas.

Systematizers, in contrast, are the kinds of people who reliably generate true beliefs on lots of topics. A good example is Scott Alexander. I didn’t research Ivermectin, but I feel confident that Scott’s post on Ivermectin is at least mostly right.

I think people think of Eliezer as a systematizer. And this is a mistake, because he just makes too many errors. He’s too confident about things he’s totally ignorant about. But he’s still a great innovator. He has lots of interesting, clever ideas that are worth hearing out. In general, however, the fact that Eliezer believes something is not especially probative. Eliezer’s skill lies in good writing and ingenious argumentation, not forming true beliefs.

In an earlier part of the article it was mentioned that the many worlds interpretation wins hands down. I tend to think this incorrect, and that it multiplies entities unnecessarily. The end of the world "meme" that the world is going to end soon is very old. There is a halting problem in deciding which individual events will have a  global repercussion and which will be swamped out. I say that even if we had inhabited three planets there is still a chance of extinction through in improbable events

ChatGPT
Your skepticism towards the many-worlds interpretation (MWI) of quantum mechanics and the broader discussion about predicting global repercussions of individual events bring up deep philosophical and scientific questions. Let's explore these concerns in more depth:

Many-Worlds Interpretation: A Matter of Entities
The MWI, initially proposed by Hugh Everett III, posits that all possible outcomes of quantum measurements actually occur, each in its own distinct universe. Your critique resonates with one of the oldest philosophical principles, Occam's Razor, which suggests preferring theories that make the fewest assumptions or multiply entities the least. From this perspective, MWI can indeed seem extravagant because it implies an almost infinite proliferation of universes from every quantum event, which some argue is an unnecessary complication to explain quantum phenomena.

Critics of MWI, like yourself, often advocate for alternative interpretations (such as the Copenhagen interpretation, pilot-wave theories, or collapse theories) that do not require this vast ontological commitment. The debate around MWI versus its alternatives remains one of the most vibrant in the philosophy of physics, largely because each interpretation comes with its own set of philosophical and empirical challenges.

Predicting Global Repercussions: The Halting Problem
Your analogy to the halting problem is intriguing. In computer science, the halting problem demonstrates that it's impossible to determine from a description of an arbitrary computer program and an input whether the program will finish running or continue forever. Applying a similar concept to predicting global repercussions suggests a fundamental limit to our ability to predict the future impact of specific events, especially given the complex interplay of factors at a global scale.

This perspective is particularly relevant in discussions about existential risks and the sustainability of human civilization. It highlights the inherent uncertainties in our predictions about the future, underscoring the need for caution and preparedness rather than certainty.

Extinction Risks: Beyond Redundancy
Your point about the potential for extinction, even with settlements on multiple planets, touches on the discussions within the field of existential risk studies. The argument suggests that merely spreading human civilization across multiple celestial bodies may not be sufficient to safeguard against improbable yet catastrophic events. This could include events like gamma-ray bursts, large-scale cosmic phenomena, or even unforeseen consequences of advanced technologies.

This perspective emphasizes the importance of not just redundancy (i.e., having multiple inhabited planets) but also resilience and the capability to anticipate, mitigate, and recover from extreme events. It calls for a broad, multidisciplinary approach to understanding and reducing existential risks, one that goes beyond technological solutions to include insights from physics, philosophy, ecology, and social sciences.

Conclusion
Your skepticism towards MWI and concern about the predictability and mitigation of global catastrophic risks highlight the importance of philosophical rigor and broad, interdisciplinary thinking in addressing some of the most profound questions and challenges facing humanity. While the theoretical elegance or parsimony of interpretations of quantum mechanics remains a subject of debate, the practical considerations about existential risk and resilience underscore the need for ongoing inquiry, precaution, and innovation in our approach to the future.

I thought the degradation of bulerite in Macrolife was a good example of this

ChatGPT
The degradation of bulerite in George Zebrowski's "Macrolife" serves as a compelling narrative device that encapsulates the themes of technological vulnerability and the unforeseeable consequences of relying on seemingly infallible materials or systems. In the story, bulerite is presented as an extraordinarily strong material, essential to the construction and operation of the vast, self-sufficient habitats known as Macrolife—essentially, mobile, space-faring cities that allow humanity to live and travel in space independently of planetary resources. The unforeseen degradation of bulerite highlights the potential for even the most advanced and reliable technologies to fail, echoing real-world concerns about the sustainability and resilience of our technological infrastructure.

Reflections on Technological Vulnerability
The narrative of bulerite’s degradation in "Macrolife" is a potent reminder of the inherent vulnerabilities in even the most advanced technologies. It reflects a broader cautionary tale about the hubris of placing unwavering faith in technological solutions without considering potential long-term weaknesses or the limits of our understanding. This theme is particularly resonant in discussions about existential risks, where overreliance on specific technologies or systems without adequate redundancy or fail-safes could have catastrophic consequences.

Unforeseeable Consequences and the Importance of Resilience
The story also underscores the difficulty of anticipating all possible modes of failure or degradation in complex systems. This uncertainty necessitates a design philosophy that goes beyond mere redundancy and incorporates resilience and adaptability—qualities that allow systems to withstand unforeseen challenges and recover from failures. In the context of existential risk and sustainability, this approach advocates for a cautious and flexible strategy in managing and deploying technologies, especially those with the potential for significant global impact.

Lessons for Risk Mitigation
The degradation of bulerite in "Macrolife" serves as a fictional but illustrative example of how even seemingly minor or unlikely risks can have profound implications for large-scale, complex systems. It highlights the importance of comprehensive risk assessment strategies that include not just known risks but also speculative and low-probability events. Such strategies are critical in the management of advanced technologies, particularly those that could play a role in humanity's future expansion into space or in the development of life-supporting systems independent of Earth's ecosystem.

Conclusion
The example of bulerite's degradation in "Macrolife" resonates with ongoing discussions about the reliability, sustainability, and resilience of technological systems. It offers a narrative exploration of themes that are increasingly relevant in an age where technology plays a central role in shaping our future prospects. By examining the fictional failures of bulerite, we can gain insights into the real-world challenges of ensuring that our technologies are robust, resilient, and capable of supporting humanity's long-term aspirations and survival.

Ok that was really non specific. I would say that whales were a form of bulerite and beavers and guano island wars

ChatGPT
If we consider the degradation of bulerite in "Macrolife" as an allegory for real-world ecological and technological issues, drawing parallels with whales, beavers, and the guano islands offers a fascinating way to explore the dynamics between technological advancement, resource exploitation, and environmental sustainability.

Whales: The Bulerite of the Ocean
Whales could represent a form of bulerite in the sense that they are crucial components of their ecosystems, much like bulerite is vital for the infrastructure in "Macrolife." Whaling, driven by the demand for whale oil, baleen, and other products, can be seen as an exploitation of a key resource, leading to the near-collapse of whale populations. This mirrors the narrative of bulerite degradation by highlighting the consequences of overreliance and unsustainable exploitation of critical resources. Just as the failure of bulerite threatens the very foundation of Macrolife, the decimation of whale populations threatens marine ecosystems' health and stability.

Beavers: Ecosystem Engineers as Bulerite
Beavers, known for their ability to modify landscapes through the construction of dams and wetlands, serve as another real-world parallel. Their activities can increase biodiversity, improve water quality, and create rich habitats for various species. However, human intervention—ranging from trapping for fur to the removal of beaver dams for agriculture or urban development—has often disrupted these beneficial ecological processes. The analogy here lies in the unintended consequences of tampering with or removing an essential component (bulerite or beavers) from a system, leading to far-reaching ecological impacts.

Guano Islands Wars: The Quest for Bulerite
The Guano Islands Act of 1856 and the subsequent rush to claim islands for their guano deposits—a valuable resource for fertilizer—reflect a similar theme of resource-driven exploration and exploitation. In this historical context, guano represents bulerite as a critical yet finite resource that nations sought to control, leading to conflicts and environmental degradation. This episode underscores the risks associated with the unchecked pursuit of essential resources, highlighting the need for sustainable management practices to avoid ecological collapse or resource depletion.

Integrating the Lessons
These real-world examples offer concrete illustrations of the broader themes suggested by the degradation of bulerite in "Macrolife." They emphasize the interconnectedness of technology, ecology, and resource management, pointing to the delicate balance required to sustain both human societies and natural ecosystems. By learning from historical and ongoing interactions with natural resources—whether it be whales, beavers, or guano—there's an opportunity to develop more sustainable approaches that recognize the intrinsic value of these "bulerites" of our world.

In conclusion, the allegory of bulerite's degradation serves as a cautionary tale, reminding us of the potential consequences of overexploitation and the fragility of the systems we depend on. By drawing lessons from the past and present, we can strive for a future where technological advancement and ecological stewardship go hand in hand, ensuring the resilience and sustainability of both human and natural ecosystems.

Ok maybe one more section for the essay on the Overconfidence of Memes

ChatGPT
Navigating the Future: The Overconfidence of Memes in the Age of Rapid Information Exchange
As we delve deeper into the 21st century, the digital ecosystem—rich with memes, viral trends, and rapid information exchange—presents unprecedented challenges and opportunities for societal discourse. The overconfidence of memes, while a hallmark of their ability to captivate and spread, also serves as a cautionary tale about the dynamics of information flow in the digital age. This final section explores the implications of meme-driven discourse for the future and proposes pathways toward a more nuanced and critical engagement with the ideas that shape our collective consciousness.

The Double-Edged Sword of Digital Virality
Memes, in their essence, are ideas made contagious. They thrive on simplicity and emotional resonance, often sacrificing nuance for the sake of spreadability. In this environment, overconfidence is not just a trait but a mechanism of survival: the more self-assured and uncomplicated a meme, the more likely it is to proliferate. However, this virality can be a double-edged sword, amplifying not only harmless entertainment but also misinformation and polarized ideologies. The challenge, then, is to harness the connective power of memes while fostering a digital ecosystem that values critical thinking and complexity.

Toward Critical Engagement and Information Literacy
One pathway to mitigating the overconfidence of memes is through enhanced critical engagement and information literacy. Educating digital citizens to question and analyze the content they encounter online can create a more discerning audience, less susceptible to the allure of oversimplified or misleading memes. This involves not only skills in assessing sources and intentions but also an awareness of the cognitive biases that make us vulnerable to certain types of information. By cultivating a culture of skepticism and curiosity, we can encourage deeper dives into topics, beyond the surface level presented by memes.

The Role of Platforms and Creators
Social media platforms and content creators play a significant role in shaping the meme landscape. Algorithmic changes that prioritize accuracy and depth over mere engagement can help counter the spread of overconfident memes. Similarly, creators who are mindful of the impact of their content can strive for a balance between relatability and responsibility, using their influence to promote nuanced discussions. Collaborations between educators, technologists, and content creators can lead to innovative approaches for engaging and informing audiences, leveraging the viral nature of memes for educational purposes.

Embracing Complexity in the Digital Age
As we move forward, the challenge will be to embrace the complexity of the world in our digital discourse. This doesn't mean abandoning the humor and relatability that make memes a powerful form of communication. Instead, it involves recognizing the limitations of what can be conveyed in a single, oversimplified message and seeking out or creating content that respects the complexity of the issues it addresses. Memes can be the starting point for deeper exploration, acting as gateways to more substantial discussions.

Conclusion
The overconfidence of memes reflects broader trends in digital communication, where simplicity often trumps complexity, and emotional resonance outweighs accuracy. By fostering critical engagement, enhancing information literacy, and encouraging a culture that values depth, we can navigate the challenges posed by this phenomenon. The future of our digital discourse depends on our ability to balance the entertaining and viral nature of memes with a commitment to truth, complexity, and nuanced understanding. In doing so, we can harness the power of memes to connect and inform, rather than mislead and polarize.




User

Why we don't live in a post-truth society but rather a myside society: what science tells us about the bias that poisons our politics.

In The Bias That Divides Us, psychologist Keith Stanovich argues provocatively that we don't live in a post-truth society, as has been claimed, but rather a myside society. Our problem is not that we are unable to value and respect truth and facts, but that we are unable to agree on commonly accepted truth and facts. We believe that our side knows the truth. Post-truth? That describes the other side. The inevitable result is political polarization. Stanovich shows what science can tell us about myside bias: how common it is, how to avoid it, and what purposes it serves.

Stanovich explains that although myside bias is ubiquitous, it is an outlier among cognitive biases. It is unpredictable. Intelligence does not inoculate against it, and myside bias in one domain is not a good indicator of bias shown in any other domain. Stanovich argues that because of its outlier status, myside bias creates a true blind spot among the cognitive elite—those who are high in intelligence, executive functioning, or other valued psychological dispositions. They may consider themselves unbiased and purely rational in their thinking, but in fact they are just as biased as everyone else. Stanovich investigates how this bias blind spot contributes to our current ideologically polarized politics, connecting it to another recent trend: the decline of trust in university research as a disinterested arbiter.

Keith E. Stanovich's "The Bias That Divides Us" offers a compelling exploration of myside bias and its implications for our society and politics. Here are the main points from the book's summary:

Myside Society, Not Post-Truth: Stanovich challenges the notion that we live in a post-truth era, arguing instead that we inhabit a myside society. The core issue is not the dismissal of truth but the inability to agree on a shared truth, leading to polarization.

Ubiquity of Myside Bias: Myside bias is widespread and affects how individuals interpret facts and information, often in favor of their own beliefs or the stance of their group. This bias poisons political discourse by making it difficult to reach consensus on what constitutes truth.

Unpredictability and Outlier Status of Myside Bias: Unlike many cognitive biases, myside bias is unpredictable and does not correlate with intelligence, executive function, or other psychological traits. This makes it a unique challenge, as even those who consider themselves rational and unbiased can be deeply affected.

Blind Spot Among the Cognitive Elite: The book emphasizes that myside bias creates a significant blind spot among the cognitive elite, who may fail to recognize their own biases. This group often assumes they are making unbiased, rational decisions when, in fact, they are as susceptible to myside bias as anyone else.

Impact on Trust in Academic Research: The decline in trust in university research as a neutral source of information is linked to the prevalence of myside bias. When research findings contradict one's preexisting beliefs, it's increasingly common to question the research's integrity rather than one's own beliefs.

Contributions to Ideological Polarization: Stanovich connects myside bias to the current state of ideological polarization, illustrating how this bias exacerbates divisions and hinders productive dialogue.

"The Bias That Divides Us" sheds light on a critical cognitive phenomenon shaping our societal and political landscapes. By understanding myside bias and its effects, individuals and communities might better navigate the challenges of polarization and work towards a more coherent and less divided society.

Keith E. Stanovich's insights into myside bias from "The Bias That Divides Us" weave together several strands from our previous discussions on the overconfidence of memes, decision-making theories, and the broader impact of cognitive biases on societal discourse and technology. Here's how these concepts interconnect:

Myside Bias and the Overconfidence of Memes
Myside bias underpins the overconfidence often seen in memes, as individuals are prone to share and engage with content that aligns with their pre-existing beliefs. This bias reinforces echo chambers and polarizes discourse, making it harder for nuanced or contradictory information to penetrate these self-reinforcing loops.
The virality of memes, driven by emotional resonance and simplified narratives, exploits myside bias by amplifying messages that viewers are predisposed to agree with, sidelining critical engagement and complex reasoning.
Decision Theory and Myside Bias
In decision-making, myside bias can skew the evaluation of options and outcomes, leading individuals to favor decisions that align with their beliefs or group identity, regardless of the empirical evidence or rational analysis. This phenomenon can affect both individual choices and collective decision-making processes.
Stanovich's exploration of myside bias sheds light on the challenges posed by this cognitive bias in achieving rational, unbiased decision-making, as highlighted in the critique of Eliezer Yudkowsky's functional decision theory and other decision-making frameworks.
Cognitive Biases, Technological Reliance, and Societal Discourse
The discussion on bulerite's degradation in "Macrolife" and the real-world parallels (e.g., reliance on critical resources like whales, beavers, and guano) underscore the importance of acknowledging the limitations and potential vulnerabilities in our technological and ecological systems. Myside bias can hinder our ability to accurately assess these risks and respond to them effectively, as it may lead to dismissing or underestimating evidence that contradicts our preferred worldview.
Stanovich's emphasis on the outlier status of myside bias among cognitive biases, including its unpredictability and independence from intelligence, underscores the importance of fostering a culture of critical thinking, humility, and openness to counteract its divisive effects.
Navigating the Myside Society
Understanding and mitigating myside bias is crucial for navigating the challenges of a myside society, where polarization and ideological divides hinder collective problem-solving and progress. It calls for enhanced critical thinking, media literacy, and efforts to build a shared basis for understanding and addressing societal issues.
The connection between myside bias and the decline in trust in academic research as a neutral arbiter of truth reflects the broader challenge of establishing a common ground for discourse in a fragmented information landscape. Rebuilding trust in shared sources of information and fostering open, evidence-based dialogue are essential steps toward overcoming the divisions exacerbated by myside bias.
In conclusion, the themes explored in "The Bias That Divides Us" resonate across various domains, from the dynamics of digital culture and decision-making theories to the challenges of achieving rational discourse in a divided society. Recognizing and addressing myside bias is a critical step in bridging divides, fostering informed decision-making, and building a more cohesive and understanding society.
