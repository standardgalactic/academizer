The Weaver's Song

By Flyxion

[Verse]
By the hearth the weaver toils so bright
Spinning gold threads in the morning light
His laughter rolls where the warbler sings
Oh joy
Oh life
The springtime brings

[Verse 2]
The spindle dances with a gentle cheer
As rosy dawn spreads far and near
Through open doors the world feels wide
With shadows faint and hope as a guide

[Chorus]
Oh weave your tale
Oh threads of gold
A tapestry of dreams untold
From the morn to the eve we sing
For life is brief
A fleeting spring

[Verse 3]
But clouds now gather where sunshine lay
The gold threads pale to a ghostly gray
The weaver sighs as the wind grows cold
His hands grow heavy
His tale grows old

[Bridge]
Oh fleeting joy
Oh fading time
The spindle slows
The chime wonâ€™t chime
A shadow whispers where laughter flew
The hands of fate pull the fabric through

[Chorus]
Oh weave your tale
Oh threads of gold
A tapestry of dreams untold
From the morn to the eve we grieve
For life is brief
Gone like a leaf
