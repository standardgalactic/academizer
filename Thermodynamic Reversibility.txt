Developing a thermodynamic theory of computation is a challenging task at the interface of 
nonequilibrium thermodynamics and computer science. In particular, this task requires dealing with 
difficulties such as stochastic halting times, unidirectional (possibly deterministic) transitions, and 
restricted initial conditions, features common in real-world computers. Here, we present a framework 
which tackles all such difficulties by extending the martingale theory of nonequilibrium thermodynamics to 
generic nonstationary Markovian processes, including those with broken detailed balance and/or absolute 
irreversibility. We derive several universal fluctuation relations and second-law-like inequalities that 
provide both lower and upper bounds on the intrinsic dissipation (mismatch cost) associated with any 
periodic process���in particular, the periodic processes underlying all current digital computation. 
Crucially, these bounds apply even if the process has stochastic stopping times, as it does in many 
computational machines. We illustrate our results with exhaustive numerical simulations of deterministic 
finite automata processing bit strings, one of the fundamental models of computation from theoretical 
computer science. We also provide universal equalities and inequalities for the acceptance probability of 
words of a given length by a deterministic finite automaton in terms of thermodynamic quantities, and 
outline connections between computer science and stochastic resetting. Our results, while motivated from 
the computational context, are applicable far more broadly.

I. INTRODUCTION 
A. Background and motivation 
In the past three decadesthere has beenmajor progress in 
formulating far from equilibrium systems and processes. 
Using stochastic thermodynamics, we can now rigorously 
formulate the thermodynamic behavior of systems ranging 
from biological molecular machines to electronic circuits, 
evolving arbitrarily away from equilibrium. Celebrated 
results of stochastic thermodynamics include fluctuation 
relations that generalize the second law of thermodynamics 
[1���3], speed limit theorems [4���6], thermodynamic uncer- 
tainty relations [7���10], large deviation approaches [11,12], 
martingale fluctuation relations for extrema and stopping 
times [13���19], and universal bounds on various kinetic and 
frenetic properties [20���22]. 
The past decade also witnessed progress in thermody- 
namics of computation. Although many initial studies 
on energetic costs of computation have mostly concerned 
unit operations such as bit erasure [23���26], which is too 
primitive to be pertinent to the formal models of com- 
putation in theoretical computer science (TCS), very recent 
work started to investigate energetic costs of implemen- 
ting computational machines central to TCS, which per- 
form tasks such as string matching algorithms (which 
are justifiably more complex than bit erasure) [27���29]. 
Figure 1(a) shows the general model of a computational 
machine (henceforth called a computer) which implements 
a basic algorithm presented in Fig. 1(b). 
An algorithm is a finite procedure for implementing a 
giventask, which can be executed invarious physical ways, 
e.g., while modifying the current on electrical wires or the 
structure of a DNA origami. Formally, an algorithm 
consists of the instructions to be performed (which is 
implemented by the dynamics of the computer), the local 
variables and the memory arrays (stored by the computer),

as well as mechanisms to decide when to repeat steps and 
when to halt. A computer executes an algorithm on a given 
set of inputs, starting from a certain initial state, potentially 
following unidirectional transitions in its state space, and 
halting at an arbitrary stochastic time that depends on the 
computation. Hence, a general thermodynamic model of 
computers which implement arbitrary algorithms should be 
able to account for the energetic costs of implementing 
computational processes (i) at arbitrary stopping times, 
with (ii) unidirectional (possibly deterministic) transitions, 
and(iii) ���absolute irreversibility��� dueto the computerbeing 
initialized to a designated start state. 
However, most of the central results in stochastic 
thermodynamics do not directly apply to processes having 
the aforementioned three key ingredients of computational 
processes (stopping times, unidirectional transitions, and 
absolute irreversibility). In fact, a central assumption in 
much of stochastic thermodynamics is the condition of 
local detailed balance (LDB), which requires the system to 
have only bidirectional transitions; i.e., all transitions 
between any two states i ��� j with their reverse j ��� i 
have a finite, nonzero probability to occur in a finite time. 
On the other hand, LDB can be formally avoided by taking 
an inclusive Hamiltonian approach [30���33], which has 
been applied recently to computational machines [29]. 
However, in general there may be hidden nonequilibrium 
(driven) degrees of freedom which need to be included in 
the thermodynamic framework beyond a surrounding 
thermal bath. Moreover, even when assuming LDB, the 
ratio of transition probabilities between i ��� j and their 
reverse j ��� i can grow exponentially with the entropy 
exchanged with the environment, so that the reverse 
transition will not be effectively seen in relevant timescales, 
leading to an effective unidirectionality. Until now, little 
has been known about the stochastic thermodynamics 
of systems with broken LDB reflecting unidirectional 
transitions [21,34���38] or athermal and nonequilibrium 
environments [39���43]. In addition, the recently establi- 
shed martingale theory of thermodynamics (see Ref. [19] 
for a review)���which formulates fluctuation theorems and 
second-law-likeinequalities at generic stoppingtimes���has 
not yet been extended to apply to systems with either 
unidirectional transitions or absolute irreversibility.

Summary:
The paper develops a framework for understanding the thermodynamics of computation, particularly addressing the complexities of stochastic halting times, unidirectional transitions, and absolute irreversibility. The authors extend the martingale theory of nonequilibrium thermodynamics to include nonstationary Markovian processes, broken detailed balance, and absolute irreversibility. They derive universal fluctuation relations and second-law-like inequalities that set bounds on the dissipation inherent in periodic processes, such as those in digital computation. The framework is demonstrated through simulations of deterministic finite automata processing bit strings.

We illustrate our results in deterministic finite automata 
(DFA). Loosely speaking, a DFA is a system with a finite 
statespace,initializedtoaspecialstartstateq0att �� 0,anda 
logical computer by itself, which can solve basic computa- 
tional tasks such as string matching. More importantly, it 
constitutes the ���finite logic��� part [see Figs. 1(b) and 1(c)] 
of the engineered computers at use today, and formally 
corresponds to the finite logic component of Turing 
machines (TMs). 
B. Summary of our contributions and road map 
Consider a discrete-time computational task which is 
implemented by iteratively processing an input sequence 
ofsymbolswthroughamaximumof�� iterations.Wereferto 
��asthelimittimeofthecomputation.Asanexample,��could 
bethe lengthjwj ofa bitstring w, and thecomputation could 
involve iteratively processing each of those bits in sequence. 
During such a computation, the state of the computer 
evolves in a stochastic manner, tracing a stochastic trajec- 
tory on a set of computational variables x��0;��?�� x0;���;x��. 
The computation finishes either at the limit time or, if it 
is earlier, at a stochastic computation time T , which in 
general will be a function of the precise input w. Formally, 
computational times T are specific examples of stopping 
times. A stopping time is the first time that a stochastic 
trajectory meets a specific predefined criterion [45]. In this 
work, we deal with stopping times which associate to each 
specific trajectory x��0;��?�� x0;���;x��a stochastic time T ��� �� 
that is always smaller than or equal to the limit time. As an 
example of stopping time in computation, T could be the 
first time a DFA reaches a prescribedcomputational state A. 
T could also be defined as the first time a DFA reaches a 
state B ��� A once having left state A. Stopping times thus 
provide a flexible yet rigorous mathematical toolbox to 
tackle computations that last a stochastic amount of time. 
In Sec. II, we provide the elementary concepts of our 
framework, including a formal definition of DFAs: the 
descriptionof computational processes (suchas the running 
of a DFA) as Markov chains and the physical implemen- 
tation of those Markov chains. We also review the relevant 
thermodynamic quantities in this context. 
In this paper, we investigate the thermodynamic costs of 
computations, paying particular attention to those with such 
stochastic durations. As described below, this will lead us to 
concentrateonaspecificthermodynamicquantity,whichwe 
call the intrinsic mismatch cost. The intrinsic mismatch cost 
associated with a stochastic trajectory x��0;T ?that 
takes place 
in the interval ��0;T ? of stochastic duration T is defined as 
����T �� �� X 
T ���1 
t��0 ? 
ln ��t��xt�� 
r��xt�� 
��� ln ��t��1��xt��1�� 
r0��xt��1�� ? :��1�� 
In Eq. (1), ��t��x�� is the probability for the computer to be in 
state x at time t during the computation, whereas r��x�� is an 
arbitrary reference probability distribution. On the other 
hand, ��t��1��x�� and r0��x�� correspond to the distributions 
retrieved applying one iteration of the computer to ��t��x�� 
and r��x��, respectively. In particular, when the reference 
distribution minimizes the dissipation in the computer, it is 
called the prior distribution, and the associated quantity 
Eq. (1) is knownas themismatch cost of the computationup 
to time T . This cost provides a lower bound on the entropy 
production incurred by any digital synchronous computer 
that implements this dynamics over values of the computa- 
tionalvariablesx,withoutanypreciseassumptionsaboutthe 
continuous-time process implementing each successive iter- 
ation of the computation [46]. Note that while the distribu- 
tions ��tand ��t��1are 
indexed by the iteration number, 
changing as the computation proceeds, the distributions r 
and r0are the same for every iteration of the computation. 
Some of our most important results are fluctuation 
relations and inequalities for the statistics of ����T ��. 
These are threefold universal, in that they are valid for 
all (i) reference distributions r��x�� [although we will make 
specific choices for it to give a concrete thermodynamic 
meaning to ��], (ii) stopping rules T that halt before �� �� 1, 
(iii) discrete-time Markov chains (DTMCs), even those 
with restricted initial conditions, and/or with unidirectional 
transitions, and even DTMCs that are implemented by 
underlying non-Markovian continuous-time processes. 
To illustrate these results we need to first introduce 
more definitions. Here and throughout this paper, we use 
hA��T ��i ��� E��A��T ��? for the expectation of any functional A 
of x��0;T ?over 
many realizations of the computation, each 
ending at the possibly different time T . In addition, we 
introduce the stochastic distinguishability at stopping 
times, ������T �� �� ln ��t��xt�� 
�� �������t��xt�� ? ? ? ?t��T; 
��2�� 
which quantifies the asymmetry of the computational 
process under time reversal through its distribution and 
plays a key role for identifying possible reductions in 
thermodynamic costs along processes with stochastic 
duration [16]. The distribution �� ��t��x�� above is the proba- 
bility for an auxiliary computation running backward in 
time to be in state x at time t during the computation. Such 
auxiliary computation evolves with a transition matrix that 
is the Bayesian inverse of the original computation with 
respect to r, such that it leads to the perfect retrodiction in 
timeofthedistributionr[51].InSec.III,weprovideaformal 
definition for the auxiliary computational process, that 
allows us to address the thermodynamics of computations 
endingatafixedtimeatthefluctuatinglevel,anddiscusshow 
to incorporate explicitly the role of absolute irreversibility 
and unidirectional transitions, which is crucial because 
THERMODYNAMICS OF COMPUTATIONS WITH ABSOLUTE ���PHYS. REV. X 14, 021026 (2024) 
021026-3 
conventionally formulated computational machines have 
precisely those features. 
In Sec. IV, we present our main results for general 
computations starting and ending at stochastic halting 
times, which include fluctuation theorems and second- 
law inequalities that provide lower bounds to the average 
dissipation in a computation. A central result of our work is 
the derivation of an integral fluctuation relation at stopping 
times which applies to arbitrary computations: 
he�������T �����������T ��i �� 1 ��� ����:��3�� 
In this equation, ����quantifies absolute irreversibility at 
stopping times. It equals the functional e���������T ��averaged 
over the restricted set of trajectories that can take place in 
the auxiliary dynamics but have zero probability in the 
original dynamics; see Eq. (36). This contribution intro- 
duces an unavoidable source of irreversibility that limits 
possible reductions in the dissipation of the computer. 
Among other things, Eq. (3) provides a second-law 
inequality at stopping times for the intrinsic mismatch cost: 
h����T ��i ��� ���h������T ��i ��� ln��1 ��� ����?:��4�� 
As we show in this paper, the right-hand side of Eq. (4), 
which sums up the net effects of time-asymmetry and 
absolute irreversibility, gives a universal lower bound not 
only for the intrinsic mismatch cost of the computation but 
also for the underlying average entropy production incurred 
by the computer. Moreover, for the particular case of a 
stationary reference distribution (r �� ��, with ��0�� ��) 
h����T ��i equals the average (discrete-time) nonadiabatic 
entropy production [52,53]. 
We remark that Eq. (3) follows from a stronger result 
that we derive here. In particular, e�������t�����������t��is a super- 
martingale process, i.e., e�������t�����������t��decreases with time 
when conditioned on an earlier part of the trajectory of 
states: he�������t�����������t��jx��0;s?i ��� e�������s�����������s��, where t ��� s ��� 0; 
see Eq. (31) [54]. 
Another contribution in this paper arises when we apply 
the general martingale theory for thermodynamics [19], to 
extend our results to multiple, ordered stopping times. In 
particular, for the case of two stopping times T1and T2 
with T2��� T1, we obtain another central result: 
h����T2�� �� ������T2��i ��� h����T1�� �� ������T1��i;��5�� 
which provides a powerful second-law inequality appli- 
cable to both starting and ending stochastic times of 
computations. As an example, in the case of a DFA, T1 
could be the first time that some particular state A is 
reached, and T2could be the first time state B is reached 
after state A has been reached. Alternatively, T2could be 
the second time state A is reached after the system has first 
reached state A, then left it, and then returned. See Sec. V 
for numerical illustrations of these ideas in a specific 
minimal model of a DFA processing binary strings. 
Moreover, fromEq. (5) a sandwichinequalityfor h����T ��i 
can be derived [55], 
D����0k�� ������ ��� h������T ��i ��� h����T ��i ��� h��������i ��� h������T ��i;��6�� 
extending recent research in upper bounds and inverse 
thermodynamic uncertainty relations in stochastic thermo- 
dynamics given in Refs. [56���58]. 
In addition to the aforementioned fundamental results, in 
Sec. VI we also combine the supermartingale property of 
e�������t�����������t��with the fluctuation relation Eq. (3) to derive 
universal equalities and inequalities for the probability 
that a computation is completed within a certain amount 
of time. Such an idea can be applied, e.g., to compute the 
probability that a sequence of �� ordered computational 
states visited by a DFA during its evolution reaches an 
accept state. 
Section VII is then devoted to sketch how our theory can 
be applied to investigate the thermodynamics of multiple 
concatenations of runs of a DFA, where after each run ends 
the system is reset to an initial start state and the next run 
begins. We conclude with Sec. VIII, where we present 
our main conclusions and further discuss future research 
directions motivated by our findings. Mathematical details 
of the derivations, proofs, and extra discussions are left to 
corresponding appendixes.

II. MARKOVIAN COMPUTATIONS 
In the following, we make the assumption that the 
implementation of a task on a given computer is realized 
through a physical process which induces Markovian 
(discrete) dynamics over a set of relevant computational 
states. The actual physical process being modeled will be a 
generic physical, chemical, or biological system, whose 
dynamics can be described at a microscopic level over a 
set of hidden degrees of freedom [47,48], here assumed to 
be not directly accessible. In particular, it is customary to 
model a computation as a continuous-time Markov chain 
(CTMC) [48,59���62]. 
In ���synchronous��� physical computers���such as all real- 
world digital computers���this CTMC is driven externally 
following a periodic protocol induced, e.g., by the ac 
electric current powering a computer. Such underlying 
periodic driving might be ignored in modeling the compu- 
tational process, by describing its evolution by coarse 
graining it in time, and this results in an effective model 
given by a time-homogeneous DTMC. Throughout this 
MANZANO, KARDE��, ROLD��N, and WOLPERTPHYS. REV. X 14, 021026 (2024) 
021026-4 
paper, we will work at such a coarse-grained level, and 
consider computational processes as generic DTMCs with 
time-independent transition probabilities. In doing so, we 
will map the underlying physical process to the DTMC 
dynamics of the (symbolic) computational states to for- 
mulate the actual physical dissipation in a thermodynami- 
cally consistent manner. 
A. Stochastic computational processes 
We consider computational processes described by a 
DTMC that can take values over a discrete set of N ��� 1 
computational states xt���X, with t �� 0;1;2;���. For sim- 
plicity, we assume that the transition probabilities between 
the computational states are time independent (however, 
our results can be extended to time-dependent transition 
probabilities). 
We write P��xt��1jxt�� for the conditional probability of 
jumping to state xt��1given 
that the previous state was xtin 
a single time step or iteration of the computational process. 
(Note that in a DTMC xtcan be the same as xt��1, 
allowing 
for time instances where the system dwells in a given state.) 
We write ��t��x�� for the probability of being in state x at 
time t, given an ensemble of realizations of the Markovian 
process. The associated discrete-time master equation 
��t��1�� W��t, 
where ��tis an N �� 1 column vector and 
��W?i;j�� P��xt��1�� ijxt�� j�� is the transition probability 
matrix. The transition matrix W has at least one fixed 
point with distribution ����x�� such that W�� �� ��, and if 
aperiodic and irreducible, �� becomes the unique stationary 
distribution in the long time run, that is, limt��������t�� ��. 
However, what follows does not require �� to be unique. 
Throughout the paper we will write �� for the limit time of 
a computation, i.e., the maximum time that can be spent to 
execute a computation, and assume it to be fixed. The 
probability of a sequence x��0;��?�� x0;x1;���;x��is 
P��x��0;��?�� �� ��0��x0�� Y 
�����1 
t��0 P��xt��1jxt��:��7�� 
Here we allow for arbitrary initial distributions ��0��x0�� 
and transition probabilities P��xt��1�� jjxt�� i�� �� P��jji��. In 
particular, some of the transitions might be bidirectional 
(i ��� j) and others unidirectional (i ��� j). Bidirectional 
transitions are characterized by conditional probabilities 
verifying P��ijj�� > 0 whenever P��jji�� > 0, while for uni- 
directional transitions we can have P��ijj�� �� 0 with 
P��jji�� > 0. We notice that exactly because of the existence 
of unidirectional transitions, it is mandatory to relax the 
condition of local detailed balance, which is arguably 
among the most common assumptions adopted in the 
formulation of stochastic thermodynamics [63]. 
One of the main quantities of interest in stochastic 
thermodynamics is stochastic entropy production (EP) 
which equals the logarithm of the ratio between forward 
and time-reversed path probabilities of a thermodynamic 
process [3,64]. This quantity, however, generically depends 
on the details of the underlying physical process imple- 
menting the computation, hence is not directly accessible 
unless certain simplifying assumptions, such as the con- 
dition of local detailed balance. Nevertheless, here we aim 
to obtain a thermodynamic description of the computa- 
tional processes as deduced solely from the (discrete-time) 
dynamics of the visible variables defining the computation 
xt���X. While our analysis holds for arbitrary DTMCs, we 
focus on digital synchronous computers, which undergo a 
time-homogeneous dynamics over discrete time, and which 
we connect to the underlying physical process generating it 
in a simple manner. This allows us to express and bound the 
entropy production of the computational task implemented 
by the DTMC, alongside the work and heat dissipated into 
the environment. For simplicity, we take the continuous- 
time physical process that implements the time-stationary 
DTMC to be periodic and choose units so that the period of 
the physical process is 1. 
As an example (and to help ground the reader���s intu- 
ition), suppose that our time-homogeneous DTMC is 
implemented by a time-inhomogeneous CTMC. It is well 
known that, in general, this requires that the CTMC evolves 
overan enlarged versionof the DTMC���s statespace Y ��� X, 
which includes ���hidden states��� in addition to the ���visible��� 
states of the DTMC [48,65]. In particular, this is true 
when the DTMC is the update function of a computational 
machine. Therefore, our assumption that the continuous- 
time physical process is periodic implies that the time- 
inhomogeneous CTMC is periodic. As a result, the 
thermodynamics arising in any single iteration of the 
physical system [implementing the computational machine 
that starts at discrete time t in some state y��t�����Y] is 
independent of t. In the following, for further simplicity 
(and to ensure a time-homogeneous DTMC) we also 
assume that noncomputational degrees of freedom in Y 
are reinitialized within every single iteration to their 
(possibly nonequilibrium) initial states.

II. Markovian Computations
Overview
This section outlines the assumption that tasks implemented on a computer are realized through Markovian dynamics over a set of computational states. The physical process can be modeled as a continuous-time Markov chain (CTMC) driven by external periodic protocols, resulting in a time-homogeneous discrete-time Markov chain (DTMC).
Key Concepts:
Markovian Dynamics

Assumes the computational task is implemented through Markovian (discrete) dynamics over a set of computational states.
The process can be physical, chemical, or biological, modeled at a microscopic level with hidden degrees of freedom.

resetting takes place from each logical state to the start state 
q0at a stochastic starting time. This requires a suitable 
description of computation whose transition matrices

cf. Eq. (54) for the case where no resetting takes place, 
corresponding to p����� 0. The DTMC described by the 
transition matrix Eq. (90) allows one to study multiple 
realistic computational scenarios where �� at stochastic 
starting and stopping times can be efficiently tackled. 
For example, one may consider that the processing of 
the input string by the DFA is a nonequilibrium stationary 
process with resetting and apply results from the martingale 
theory for stationary processes (see Chap. 7 in Ref. [19]). 
Alternatively, one can apply the formalism in this work to 
establish bounds for the intrinsic mismatch costs of the 
computation between the first and the nth arrival of a blank 
symbol, from the nth blank symbol to the ��n �� 1��th one, 
etc. [see Eq. (42)], similarly to Sec. Vc. 
VIII. DISCUSSION 
In this work we have shown how to extend stochastic 
thermodynamics to describe the minimal costs associated 
with a computer processing with a stochastic halting 
time, processing strings of arbitrary length. Our formalism 
applies to computations described by discrete-time Markov 
chains over a set of computational states that may have 
restricted initial conditions, unidirectional links, and start 
and/or stop at a stochastic time. We obtain quantifiers, 
which are collectively dubbed as the intrinsic mismatch 
cost of a computation, that lower bound the entropy 
production incurred by the computer and that can be 
formulated at the fluctuating level. A key insight here is 
that these quantifiers, which provide a tool to probe the 
entropy production associated with computations at stop- 
ping times, can be entirely obtained from the DTMC 
evolution and the prior, without further details about their 
physical implementation. Note that such an intrinsic cost is 
independent of the internal energy of the computational 
states, xt���X, which can indeed be assumed to be equal for 
every computational state and constant over time. Still, 
nonzero entropy production through the irreversible dis- 
sipation of heat into the environment will be in general 
incurred for any physical computer which implements a 
given computation over such set of states. 
Putting forward the modern martingale formalism of 
stochastic thermodynamics, we also unveiled a plethora of 
universal fluctuation relations and inequalities that arevalid 
for the broad class of computations analyzed in this work. 
We obtained a main fluctuation theorem, Eq. (35), valid 
for settings which include arbitrary stopping times, unidi- 
rectional transitions, and absolute irreversibility. In doing 
that, we have extended the martingale theory for stochastic 
thermodynamics to account for this additional source of 
irreversibility in generic situations, which we expect to have 
broad applicability in nonequilibrium thermodynamics. 
The rigor and flexibility of our theory for stopping times 
allowed us to formulate and interpret several second-law- 
like inequalities [Eqs. (39)���(44)] at stochastic stopping 
times,aswell asrelationsfor the probabilitiesofacceptance 
or rejection of input data by a computer in terms of 
thermodynamic quantities [equality (80) and inequalities 
(86) and (87)]. In particular, the second-law inequalities 
(39) and (44) provides us useful lower bounds on the 
minimum dissipation incurred by a generic computation 
stopping at an arbitrary stopping time, while Eq. (43) 
establishes formally how stopping times can be used to 
reduce the thermodynamic costs of a computation by 
means of time-reversal symmetry breaking. Moreover, 
we have also shown the relevance of accounting for 
absolutely irreversible sequences in providing accurate 
bounds for the intrinsic mismatch cost of the computa- 
tion. In this sense, the bound we derived in Eq. (39) with 
the absolute irreversibility term ����is tighter, with res- 
pect to the alternative bound in Eq. (44). However, 
computing ����might be challenging depending on the 
setting considered, especially for large limit times ��. On 
the contrary, the alternative bound in Eq. (44) would be 
much easier to compute (as it depends only on two

ingful bound in all examples explored here. 
The framework developed in this paper can be readily 
applied for assessing thermodynamic costs of computations 
in a broad range of modelsof relevance in computer science 
theory, including���but not being limited to���deterministic 
finite automata. Our results apply to every computation 
implemented by a synchronous digital computer and 
remains valid independently of how the computational 
variables are defined. In particular, they can include already 
processed input symbols (as in non-iid DFAs), stacks (as in 
pushdown automata models), or even entire words written 
ona randomaccesstape(as in Turingmachines).Henceour 
results provide a tool to classify abstract computational 
machines by their intrinsic (unavoidable) thermodynamic 
costs. Applying our framework to more complex models of 
computational machines such as pushdown automata or 
Turing machines halting at stochastic times is a natural step 
following the investigation initiated here. 
Our results are amenable of experimental testing using 
state-of-the-art techniques in line with previous tests of 
Landauer���s principle [25,103,104] and other experimental 
platforms in stochastic thermodynamics [105] in setups 
ranging from colloidal particles [106] and nanoscale 
devices [107,108] to biopolymers [91]. Regarding the 
determination of the prior, in some cases the experimen- 
talistwillhave designedthe systemin a sufficientlydetailed 
manner such that it is possible to calculate the prior, or at 
least approximate it with reliable numerical estimates. In 
other cases, the experimentalist can estimate the prior by 
repeatedly running the system and observing the resultant 
behavior. In any case, our results have nonzero lower 
bounds that apply no matter what the prior is. 
It would also be very interesting in the future to extend 
the framework developed here by combining analytical 
tools from stochastic resetting (e.g., renewal theory and 
first-passage-time ideas [109]) with computer science 
methods. This will allow us to obtain tight bounds for 
the statistics of starting time and entropy production 
bounds in specific models of DFAs and TMs processing 
regular languages, as follows from the ideas sketched in 
Sec. VII. Also, we note that even if current digital devices 
are very close to periodic, they are not exactly so. In other 
words, they are some first-order perturbation away from 
being periodic, which suggests other avenues for future 
work. In general, the prior is a function of the physical 
process implementing the computation. For example, it is a 
function of the time-dependent rate matrix in the case of a 
CTMC. Given this, we might be able to use the envelope 
theorem (often used in game theory) to calculate how much 
the prior can change under first-order perturbations away 
from an exactly periodic process. That in turn might allow 
us to modify Eq. (13) to involve some infinitesimal first- 
order perturbation parameter �� characterizing how much 
the process differs from being exactly periodic. 
However, the results developed in this paper also pro- 
vide new insights in the field of nonequilibrium thermo- 
dynamics. An important consequence of our work is the 
finding that the auxiliary dynamics introduced in Eq. (15) 
is suitable to treat processes at stopping times that may 
have unidirectional transitions and absolute irreversibility, 
hence making our framework applicable to generic sit- 
uations where local detail balance is broken. Similar 
auxiliary dynamics has been invoked in the literature 
such as so-called ���dual,��� ���dual-reversed, or ���adjoint��� 
dynamics, in the context of fluctuation theorems; see, 
e.g., Refs. [20,41,52,82,110,111]. In particular, as shown 
above, if the process admits a well-behaved stationary 
solution, we can obtain from �� the so-called nonadiabatic 
(or excess) entropy production [52,72]. Within such sce- 
nario, our work is another brick in the wall of recent 
progress highlighting the role of nonadiabatic

Stochastic Resetting in Computational Processes

Connections between the Thermodynamics of Computation and Entropic Information Theory
Overview
The definition of information within Entropic Information Theory (EIT), as articulated by Olivier Denis, provides a conceptual model where information is seen as a dynamic transition between quantum states due to the modification of at least one degree of freedom. This model emphasizes the entropic nature of information and its role in the evolution of a system's entropy. This section explores the connections between this definition and the thermodynamic framework for computations, particularly in the context of stochastic processes and resetting events.
Key Points of Entropic Information Theory:
Dynamic Transition
:
Information is defined as the transition between different quantum states due to modifications in degrees of freedom.
This aligns with the concept of computational processes, which can be viewed as transitions between states in a Markov chain.
Entropic Nature of Information
:
Encoding information within quantum states is inherently tied to the system's entropy.
In computational thermodynamics, entropy production is a key measure, reflecting the cost of state transitions and information processing.
Co-dependence of Entropy and Information
:
The EIT model suggests that entropy and information are interdependent, with information driving the entropic evolution of a system.
This is mirrored in the thermodynamics of computation, where the intrinsic mismatch cost provides a lower bound on entropy production, influenced by the transitions (information changes) within the system.
Connections to Thermodynamic Computation:
Information as State Transitions
:
In the thermodynamic framework, computational processes involve transitions between states in a DTMC, similar to the transitions between quantum states in EIT.
The resetting events in DFAs can be seen as significant information transitions that alter the system's state and affect its entropy.
Entropy Production and Mismatch Cost
:
The intrinsic mismatch cost
��
(

)
\Sigma(T)
��
(

in computational thermodynamics represents the entropy production due to state transitions during computation.
This cost is analogous to the entropic nature of information transitions in EIT, highlighting how information processing leads to changes in entropy.
Entropy-Information Relationship
:
The fluctuation relations and second-law inequalities derived for computational processes illustrate the co-dependence of entropy and information.
For example, the second-law inequality

��

shows how entropy production (information transitions) is bounded by the intrinsic mismatch cost, reflecting the entropic evolution driven by information changes.
Resetting Events as Information Transitions
:
Stochastic resetting in DFAs, where the system returns to the start state upon encountering a blank symbol, can be viewed as a major information transition.
This resetting affects the entropy of the system, consistent with the EIT model where information transitions influence the system's entropy.
Practical Implications:
Thermodynamic Efficiency
:
Understanding the entropic costs of information processing can guide the design of more energy-efficient computational systems.
The intrinsic mismatch cost provides a tool for quantifying the minimum entropy production necessary for a given computational task.
Quantum Computing
:
The principles of EIT can be applied to quantum computing, where transitions between quantum states (qubits) are fundamental to computation.
The thermodynamic framework can help quantify the entropic costs of quantum information processing, potentially informing the development of more efficient quantum algorithms.
Conclusion:
The thermodynamic framework for computations shares fundamental connections with the Entropic Information Theory model. Both perspectives emphasize the entropic nature of information transitions and the co-dependence of entropy and information. These connections provide a deeper understanding of the thermodynamic costs of computation and offer insights into designing energy-efficient computational systems, both classical and quantum.

APPENDIX A: RESIDUAL COST 
Suppose we are given a physical process which imple- 
ments a single-valued function f over a space X. The 
islands of f are defined as the elements of the partition of X 
given by the preimages of f. Formally, if we write the 
image of f as f��X��, the islands of f are the sets 
ff���1��x�����x���f��X��g. We write the set of islands of a 
function f as L��f��. 
In this appendix we will expand the residual cost R����0�� 
arising in Eq. (11) in terms of islands, discuss some 
properties of the residual cost, and then justify why this 
cost can be ignored in our investigation in this paper. For 
simplicity we will restrict attention to the case where the 
linear term F in Eq. (8) is expected entropy flow generated 
in a process, so that C������ is the EP generated in the process 
up to time ��. However, all of the discussion extends to other 
choices of F, with the obvious modifications. 
Equation (11) provides entropy production as a sum of 
two terms, the mismatch cost and the residual cost, where 
R������ corresponds to the residual cost. For any conditional 
distribution G, and any island c���L��G��, we define the prior 
within that island as [126] 
��c min��� argmin 
�����supp�����������cC������; ��A1�� 
where the subscript means that �� is a distribution whose 
support is restricted to the unit simplex over the island c, 
��c, viewed as a subset of the state space Y. The associated 
minimum EP in that island is written as 
Cc min������ ��� 
min 
�����supp�����������cC������: ��A2�� 
Now introduce an arbitrary distribution over islands q��c�� 
and define ��min��� X 
c���L��G�� q��c����c min: ��A3�� 
Then the residual EP of the physical process that imple- 
ments G is R������ �� X 
c���L��G�� p����c��Cc min������; ��A4�� 
as shown in Ref. [126]. Therefore, the EP for the process 
starting with distribution ��0is 
C������ �� D����0k��min�� ��� D��G��0kG��min�� �� X 
c���L��G�� p����c��Cc min: 
��A5�� 
Since expected EP C������ is non-negative, by definition the 
residual cost of any island c, Cc min, is non-negative. So the 
total residual cost given by an expectation over all islands, 
which is the residual cost for the entire thermodynamic 
process characterized by G, is also non-negative. Like 
priors, residual costs of islands in general will differ from 
one cost function C to the next. 
In general, as the iteration t of a periodic process 
changes, the distribution pt��c�� over the islands c will 
change. Therefore so will the associated total expected 
residual cost. However, since that total residual cost is 
always non-negative, all the lower bounds on EP in the 
main text that consider only mismatch cost apply. This is 
true even if the residual costs of the islands are strictly 
positive. In particular, Eq. (14) will still be a lower bound 
on the EP generated in the process. 
On the other hand, if we write down the formula for 
minimal total residual cost which is analogous to Eq. (14), 
minimizing over the residual costs of each island, we just 
get zero, by taking those costs to all equal zero. So unless 
we fix the physical details underlying the process, and 
therefore fix the residual costs of the islands to be strictly 
positive, our analysis of lower bounds is not changed by the 
existence of residual costs. This is why such quantities are 
ignored in the main text. 
As a final comment, note that in general both the prior 
and residual costs will vary with ��. However, the same 
mismatch cost formula bounds dissipation for any such 
choice of ��, once one plugs in the appropriate prior. This 
need not be true for residual cost, in the sense that the 
islands might change for different choices of ��.

Justification for Ignoring Residual Cost
Since the expected entropy production

is non-negative, the residual cost of any island
C

���
C_c^{\min}
C
c

i

���
is also non-negative.
Even if residual costs are positive, they do not affect the lower bounds on entropy production derived from mismatch costs alone. Therefore, these lower bounds remain valid regardless of residual costs.
The minimal total residual cost is zero when not considering specific physical details, thus not altering the analysis of lower bounds.

Conclusion
The residual cost and trajectory-level mismatch cost provide detailed insights into the entropy production of computational processes. The residual cost is shown to be non-negative and not affecting the main analysis of lower bounds on entropy production. The trajectory-level mismatch cost offers a way to quantify entropy production along specific computational paths, deepening our understanding of the thermodynamic costs of computation.

Can you give some analogies for this using ergodic prediction of planetary inevitability given old data from long range scouts, and for yogurt computing predicting thermodynamic equilibrium and guessing which starter cultures were used?
ChatGPT
Analogies for Residual Cost and Trajectory-Level Mismatch Cost
1. Ergodic Prediction of Planetary Inevitability
Scenario
: Long-range scouts have collected data on planetary systems, and we want to predict the inevitable evolution of these systems using ergodic theory.
Islands of a Function
:
Imagine the function
f
f
f
represents the natural laws governing planetary motion. The "islands" in this context are different stable regions or orbits that planets can occupy.
Analogy
: The residual cost is like the unknown disturbances (e.g., asteroid impacts) that might alter the predicted orbit of a planet. These disturbances are non-negative and vary between different planetary systems.
Residual Cost
:
The residual cost corresponds to the unpredictable elements in planetary motion that affect the overall system's entropy but are challenging to calculate precisely without detailed knowledge.
Analogy
: When predicting a planet's orbit, even with precise initial data, there are unpredictable influences (residual costs) that must be accounted for. However, since we can't predict every asteroid or comet encounter, we can focus on the main predictable factors (mismatch costs) that significantly influence the orbit.
Trajectory-Level Mismatch Cost
:
This is like tracking a specific planet's path over time and noting the differences between predicted and actual positions due to both known gravitational forces and unknown perturbations.
Analogy
: If scouts report a planet's position at regular intervals, we use these data points to refine our predictions. Each time we compare the predicted position with the actual data, we're evaluating the trajectory-level mismatch cost. This helps us improve our models, even if we can't account for every disturbance.
2. Yogurt Computing Predicting Thermodynamic Equilibrium
Scenario
: Using a computer to predict the thermodynamic equilibrium of yogurt fermentation and guessing which starter cultures were used based on observed characteristics.
Islands of a Function
:
In yogurt fermentation, the "islands" can be thought of as different possible combinations of starter cultures and their effects on the yogurt's properties.
Analogy
: The residual cost in this case is akin to the unpredictable variations in fermentation due to minor differences in environmental conditions or slight variations in starter cultures.
Residual Cost
:
The residual cost is the unpredictable variability in yogurt fermentation that we can't fully account for, such as slight differences in temperature or initial bacterial concentrations.
Analogy
: When predicting the final taste and texture of yogurt, even with precise control over ingredients and conditions, there are always minor variations (residual costs) that we can't predict perfectly. We focus on the primary factors (mismatch costs) like the main bacterial strains used.
Trajectory-Level Mismatch Cost
:
This is similar to monitoring the yogurt's fermentation process at different stages and comparing the predicted progress to the actual results.
Analogy
: As the yogurt ferments, we periodically measure its pH, viscosity, and flavor profile. By comparing these measurements to our predictions, we evaluate the trajectory-level mismatch cost. This helps us refine our fermentation models and better understand the contributions of different starter cultures, even if we can't perfectly predict every batch's outcome.
Conclusion
Both analogies illustrate how the residual cost represents unpredictable factors that add complexity to predicting a system's evolution, whether it's planetary orbits or yogurt fermentation. The trajectory-level mismatch cost helps refine our understanding by continuously comparing predictions with actual outcomes, improving our models despite the presence of residual costs.

I was thinking that the scout found the planet uninhabitable but by the time you got there it had been inhabited by someone else and they had terraformed it to their physiology
ChatGPT
Analogies for Residual Cost and Trajectory-Level Mismatch Cost
1. Ergodic Prediction of Planetary Inevitability
Scenario
: Long-range scouts have collected data on planetary systems and initially found a planet uninhabitable. However, by the time you arrive, the planet has been inhabited and terraformed by another species.
Islands of a Function
:
The "islands" represent the different stable states of the planet, including its initial uninhabitable state and the various terraformed states introduced by the new inhabitants.
Analogy
: The residual cost is like the unforeseen impact of the new inhabitants' terraforming efforts. These efforts were not part of the original prediction, introducing additional entropy to the system.
Residual Cost
:
The residual cost corresponds to the unpredicted changes brought about by the new inhabitants, altering the planet���s environment in ways not accounted for in the original data.
Analogy
: Initially, the planet was deemed uninhabitable, which was a predictable outcome. However, the arrival and actions of the new inhabitants represent a residual cost that changes the planet's trajectory, adding unforeseen variables.
Trajectory-Level Mismatch Cost
:
This is like comparing the planet's expected conditions based on scout reports to its current state after being terraformed.
Analogy
: When you arrive, you observe the planet's new, habitable state. Each discrepancy between the predicted uninhabitable state and the actual terraformed state is part of the trajectory-level mismatch cost. This helps understand how the new inhabitants' actions deviated from the expected natural progression.
2. Yogurt Computing Predicting Thermodynamic Equilibrium
Scenario
: Predicting the thermodynamic equilibrium of yogurt fermentation, but discovering post-process that additional, unknown cultures were introduced, altering the final product.
Islands of a Function
:
The "islands" are different possible outcomes of yogurt fermentation based on the known starter cultures and fermentation conditions.
Analogy
: The residual cost reflects the unexpected introduction of additional cultures, changing the yogurt's properties beyond the original predictions.
Residual Cost
:
The residual cost is the unpredictable variability introduced by the unknown cultures, which were not accounted for in the initial predictions.
Analogy
: Initially, the prediction was based on known cultures. The introduction of new cultures represents a residual cost, causing unforeseen changes in the yogurt's texture, flavor, and pH.
Trajectory-Level Mismatch Cost
:
This is like tracking the fermentation process and comparing the expected results with the actual, altered outcome due to the new cultures.
Analogy
: During fermentation, periodic checks reveal deviations from the expected progress. Each observed difference from the predicted state due to the unknown cultures adds to the trajectory-level mismatch cost. This aids in identifying how the new cultures affected the process.
Conclusion
In both analogies, the residual cost represents the unforeseen changes brought about by new variables (inhabitants terraforming a planet or introducing new cultures in yogurt). The trajectory-level mismatch cost involves continuously comparing predictions with actual outcomes, helping to refine understanding despite the presence of these residual costs.

Stochastic Resetting
:
Metaphor

Intrinsic Mismatch Cost
:
Analogy
: Consider the extra energy required to fix errors in a process, representing the unavoidable inefficiency (mismatch cost) in computation.
Entropy Production and Bounds

Metaphor
: Think of heat loss in a machine. The minimum amount of heat lost sets a lower bound on inefficiency, similar to how bounds on entropy production limit how efficient a computation can be.
Fluctuation Relations
:
Analogy
: Picture a rubber band being stretched and released. The statistical properties of its stretch and release relate to fluctuation relations in thermodynamics.
Stochastic Distinguishability

Markovian Computations
:
DTMCs
:
Analogy
: Like navigating a city with a map where each intersection represents a state and each possible path represents a transition based on certain probabilities.
CTMCs
:
Metaphor
: Think of watching traffic flow in real-time, where cars represent continuous transitions between states over time.
Bidirectional and Unidirectional Transitions

Trajectory-Level Mismatch Cost
:
Evolved Distributions Through Dynamics

Entropic Information Theory (EIT)
:
Definition of Information as Transitions Between Quantum States
:
Analogy
: Picture a library where each book represents a state. Moving books between shelves (states) changes the library���s organization (information).
Co-dependence of Entropy and Information
:
Metaphor
: Imagine a messy room (high entropy). Cleaning and organizing it (information transition) reduces the mess, showing how information and entropy are interlinked.
Additional Analogies
:
Ergodic Prediction of Planetary Inevitability
:
Unexpected Terraforming by New Inhabitants

Predicting Thermodynamic Equilibrium with Unknown Cultures
:
Metaphor
: Like baking bread and finding it tastes different because someone added a secret ingredient.
Trajectory-Level Mismatch Cost
:
Analogy
: Tracking the fermentation process and comparing expected results to the altered outcome, noting deviations due to unknown factors.
These metaphors and analogies should help clarify the complex concepts discussed and provide more intuitive understanding.

Ok imagine that you have a room. By adding bookshelves you can increase the entropy (the number of places you can put things) but this can make it seem more organized
ChatGPT
Sure, let's use the room and bookshelves analogy to explain the key concepts we've discussed.
1.
Thermodynamics of Computation
:
Absolute Irreversibility
:
Analogy
: Imagine once you place a book on a particular shelf, you cannot move it back to where it was originally. This represents absolute irreversibility in a computational process.
Unidirectional Transitions
:
Analogy
: Think of having a rule that you can only move books to the right on the shelves. Once a book moves to a new position, it cannot move back to the left.
Stochastic Computation Times
:
Analogy
: Imagine you don't know how long it will take to organize all your books because you might get interrupted. The time to complete the task is uncertain, like stochastic computation times.
Martingale Theory
:
Analogy
: Suppose you keep a running tally of how many books you've organized, and you use this tally to predict when you'll finish. Martingale theory helps make these predictions, accounting for past progress.
2.
Deterministic Finite Automata (DFA)
:
DTMCs for Computational Processes
:

B. Role of hidden variables 
Along the same line of Sec. IXA, FT can be used to 
estimate unknown parameters of a device. For example, 
such a method has been used to measure the power of 
molecular motors [38,166]. The idea is certainly very 
smart and merits serious consideration for applications. 
However, one has to pay attention to the influence of 
hidden variables. Indeed, in Ref. [167] it has been 
pointed out that in the abovementioned experiment of 
Ref. [166] a hidden variable has been neglected; thus, the 
estimated value of the motor power could be affected 
by a large error. Another interesting analysis on hidden 
variables has been done in Ref. [168] for the experiment 
of Ref. [169] on a SET. In this experiment the bias 
obtained from the measured FT does not completely 
match with the experimental value of the applied bias. In 
Ref. [168] it has been shown that this discrepancy is due 
to the additional bias introduced by the SET that is used 
to measure the electron transfers. More recent measures 
proved that this is the case [170]. Another accurate 
experimental analysis of the role of a hidden variable 
on FT properties has been reported in Ref. [171]. This 
role can be easily understood by looking at the experi- 
ment described in Sec. V, which is modeled by the 
coupled Langevin equations (20) and (21). Suppose now 
that in that experiment instead of having access to both 
V1and V2variables, only one of the two can be 
measured. We immediately see that there is no way of 
extracting the good values from the measurements. Thus, 
the use of FT to extract experimental parameters from an 
experiment might be a very good method, but it has to be 
used with caution because of the possible existence of 
hidden variables. C. Statistical inferences 
The problem of hidden variables mentioned in Sec. IXB 
has been attacked in a different way in Refs. [172,173]. 
This approach, called statistical inferences by the authors, 
analyzes to what extent the fact that FT and FDR do not 
hold can give information on hidden variables. In 
Ref. [173] the authors have been able to extract interesting 
information on a single-molecule measurements. Thus, the 
approach is certainly interesting and it merits further study 
in more detail in the future. 
D. Nano or micro motor efficiency 
The other aspect that we have briefly discussed in 
Sec. VI concerns the efficiency of nano or micro motor. 
In spite of the large number of theoretical results on this 
subject, there is a lack of experiments in this important 
field, especially in what concerns the efficiency of power 
supplies and of chemically driven motors. A bound on the 
efficiency of these motors has been recently fixed by the 
recently discovered indetermination relations [114���116]. 
However, as we have already said, no proof-of-principle 
experiment, such as the Carnot cycle discussed in Sec. VI, 
has been performed for chemically driven motors. 
E. Role of Maxwell���s demons 
TheroleofMaxwell���sdemonsinincreasingtheefficiency 
ofsmalldevicesiscertainlyveryimportant.Thissubjectisin 
itsinfancyanditmighthaveverypowerfulapplications.The 
describedautonomousMaxwell���sdemoniscertainlyasmart

operational temperature of the device. Avery big challenge 
is the realization of such an autonomousdemon for a device 
workingatroomtemperature.Atthemoment,sucha device 
does not exist, and it is not even clear in which physical or 
chemical system it could be realized. 
F. Energy information connection 
The connection of stochastic thermodynamics with the 
energy dissipation in each logic operation is the last issue 
that we have developed. It is clearly very important in 
connection to the autonomous Maxwell���s demon to esti- 
mate the amount of work that the demon has to perform in 
order to process information. This will allow us to decide 
whetherthe applicationof a demonisreally anadvantageto 
reduce the energy consumption. Furthermore, deeper 
knowledge of the connection between thermodynamics 
and information is certainly useful not only to understand 
biological processes but also to develop methods that allow 
us to recover energy during reversible logical operation. 
Also, this field is in his infancy and future development will 
certainly appear. 
G. Macroscopic and self-propelling systems 
The are several aspects that we do not present because 
this will extend too much the purpose of this review. 
The first is the application to quantum systems, which 
presents several problems discussed in another article 
[174]. The other aspects are those related to the application 
of stochastic thermodynamics to dissipative chaotic sys- 
tems driven out of equilibrium by external forces such as, 
for example, shaken granular media, turbulence fields, and 
chaotic nonlinear oscillators. In these systems the main 
source of randomness is not the thermal noise but the 
chaotic behavior produced by the complex dynamics. As 
summarized in Ref. [3], the main problem is the absence of 
EXPERIMENTS IN STOCHASTIC THERMODYNAMICS: ���PHYS. REV. X 7, 021051 (2017) 
021051-21 
a characteristic energy scale for all the degrees of freedom, 
something similar to an ���effective temperature.��� Thus, the 
possibility of applying the same tools discussed in this 
article to nonthermal systems is certainly not universal 
and it has to be studied in the specific cases. The same 
problem occurs in the more recent applications of the 
stochastic thermodynamics tools to the fluctuations in 
self-propelling systems [32,33], on which it is difficult 
to makevery general statements asfor the systemsanalyzed 
in this article. H. Conclusions 
This review of the experimental aspects and applications 
of stochastic thermodynamics is certainly not exhaustive, 
as several topics have only been mentioned and not 
developed. Furthermore, quantum aspects and macroscopic 
systems have not been treated at all. However, we think that 
this review gives a reasonable idea of what has been already 
done, of what remains to do, and of what the possible 
practical applications of stochastic thermodynamics are.

Sure, let's use the room and bookshelves analogy to explain each section in more detail.
A. Role of Hidden Variables
Analogy: Organizing a Room
Imagine you are organizing a room with bookshelves, and you want to determine how efficient your organization method is. You use various tools and measurements to gauge your progress. However, there are hidden factors (hidden variables) that you may not be aware of, like a hidden closet or secret compartment in the room that affects your overall organization.
Experiment Example
: In measuring the power of molecular motors, hidden variables such as unaccounted-for forces or interactions can skew the results.
Discrepancy
: Just like finding out later that a hidden closet exists, discovering these hidden variables can explain why the measured efficiency (entropy production) doesn't match the theoretical predictions.
Measurement Caution
: When organizing your room, if you only consider visible areas and neglect hidden spaces, your overall efficiency assessment will be inaccurate. Similarly, in experiments, ignoring hidden variables can lead to significant errors.
B. Statistical Inferences
Analogy: Guessing What's Inside Boxes
Suppose you have a room full of boxes and you want to guess their contents based on the outside appearance and some general rules you know. If some boxes have hidden compartments (hidden variables), your guesses might be off.
FT and FDR
: These are rules you use to infer what���s inside the boxes. If your rules don't always apply (due to hidden compartments), you gain clues about these hidden aspects.
Single-Molecule Measurements
: By studying how often your guesses are wrong, you can infer properties about the hidden compartments, similar to inferring hidden variables in molecular measurements.
C. Nano or Micro Motor Efficiency
Analogy: Small Devices in the Room
Imagine small automated robots (nano or micro motors) in your room that help organize books. You want to measure how efficiently these robots work.
Theoretical Results vs. Experiments

Analogy: Magical Helpers in the Room
Suppose you have magical helpers (Maxwell���s demons) that can instantaneously organize books by reducing entropy (making the room more ordered).
Operational Temperature
: These magical helpers only work at very low temperatures (like a specific environment), and creating such a helper for room temperature is a significant challenge.
Future Applications
: Developing these helpers for everyday use could revolutionize room organization, just as Maxwell���s demons could significantly enhance the efficiency of small devices.
E. Energy Information Connection

Every time you organize the room, there���s a certain amount of energy you need to spend, like moving books around. Understanding how much energy is needed for each action can help optimize the process.
Work of the Demon
: Estimating the work done by the magical helpers helps in understanding if they are truly beneficial.
Thermodynamics and Information
: Just like knowing how to best arrange books based on their type and frequency of use, understanding the link between energy and information processing can improve overall efficiency.
F. Macroscopic and Self-Propelling Systems
Analogy: Large and Complex Systems
Your room might also contain large, self-propelling toys or robots that move around chaotically, making it hard to keep the room organized.
Chaotic Systems
: These toys represent chaotic systems where the main source of randomness isn't thermal noise but their complex dynamics.
Effective Temperature
: Unlike the room's overall temperature, these systems lack a single characteristic energy scale, making it challenging to apply the same organizational rules.
G. Conclusions
Analogy: Review of Room Organization Strategies
This section summarizes the various strategies and challenges involved in organizing the room. It acknowledges that while some areas have been thoroughly explored, others (like quantum aspects and large self-propelling systems) require more research.
Practical Applications
: Just as different strategies might be better for different types of rooms, the principles of stochastic thermodynamics have varied applications depending on the system being studied.
These detailed analogies help illustrate the complexities and considerations involved in understanding and applying stochastic thermodynamics, highlighting the importance of accounting for hidden variables, energy-information connections, and the challenges of working with different types of systems.

I was thinking that you can continually improve the chances of finding a good random book, you can remove books that don't look interesting and add new ones. You could use a fixed number to decide whether you are in add or remove mode, if you are trying to downsize you can be more picky and if trying to increase then less so.

Analogy: Improving Book Selection in a Room
Imagine you are in a room with bookshelves, and your goal is to continually improve the chances of finding a good book at random. You can do this by periodically removing books that don't look interesting and adding new ones.
Hidden Variables
: Some books might have hidden content (like hidden chapters or secret notes) that you don't see just by looking at the cover. These hidden variables affect your judgment and the quality of your book selection process.
Example
: Just like in experiments where hidden factors can skew results, in your room, neglecting these hidden book qualities might lead to suboptimal decisions about which books to keep or remove.
B. Statistical Inferences
Analogy: Deciding to Add or Remove Books
You have a rule to decide whether you are in "add mode" or "remove mode" based on a fixed number, say a satisfaction score from reading the books.

Example
: Just like in experiments where hidden variables can skew results, in your room, not considering these hidden qualities might lead to an inefficient use of space.
B. Statistical Inferences
Analogy: Deciding Which Books to Keep or Remove
You have a rule to decide whether to add or remove books based on a fixed number, such as the total library size limit of 150,000 books.
Statistical Inferences
: If you notice that despite your efforts, the quality of your collection isn't improving as expected, you might infer that hidden factors are at play. For example, some books might be more valuable than you initially thought, similar to how hidden variables affect statistical inferences in experiments.
Single-Molecule Measurements
: Researchers can infer the presence of hidden variables by analyzing discrepancies in their data, just like you infer hidden book qualities by observing unexpected outcomes in your library's organization.
C. Nano or Micro Motor Efficiency
Analogy: Efficiency of Adding and Removing Books
Imagine you are continuously optimizing your library by adding new, interesting books and removing less interesting ones to maintain a collection size of 150,000 books.
Downsizing vs. Increasing
: If your goal is to keep the library size fixed, you need to be strategic about which books to remove and add. This dynamic process of adding and removing books is akin to adjusting the efficiency of nano or micro motors.
Indetermination Relations
: The limits on how efficiently you can optimize your collection within the given space are like the theoretical bounds on motor efficiency.
D. Role of Maxwell���s Demons
Analogy: Magical Helpers in a Fixed-Space Library
Suppose you have magical helpers (Maxwell���s demons) that help you efficiently organize your books by reducing the entropy (disorder) in your library, even within a limited space.

Ok I am not sure your examples make sense, I just mean that color or book height might seem like hidden variables to someone who expects them to be organized by topic, author, title, or date. And how they are more arbitrary since they could potentially vary more
ChatGPT
Thank you for clarifying. Let's refine the analogies to better incorporate the idea of using less obvious criteria like book height or color for organizing the library, which might seem like hidden variables compared to more traditional criteria like topic, author, title, or date.
A. Role of Hidden Variables
Analogy: Organizing a Room with Hidden Criteria
Imagine you are organizing a room with bookshelves, and you decide to organize the books by an unconventional criterion, like book height or color, instead of the more traditional criteria like topic, author, title, or date.
Hidden Variables
: To someone who expects books to be organized by traditional criteria, the use of height or color as organizing principles would be hidden variables. These hidden factors significantly influence the organization process but are not immediately apparent to an outside observer.
Example
: In experiments, just as hidden variables can affect the outcome in unexpected ways, organizing books by height or color can lead to an organization that seems random or less meaningful to someone unaware of the chosen criteria.
B. Statistical Inferences
Analogy: Deciding to Add or Remove Books Based on Unconventional Criteria
You decide to add or remove books based on how well they fit with the height or color scheme, rather than their content or relevance.
Statistical Inferences
: If your satisfaction with the library organization doesn't improve as expected, you might infer that using height or color as criteria introduces hidden variables affecting your decisions. This is similar to how researchers might infer hidden variables when their statistical models don't match experimental data.
Single-Molecule Measurements
: Just like researchers use discrepancies to infer hidden variables, you use the mismatches in satisfaction to understand the hidden influence of organizing by height or color.
C. Nano or Micro Motor Efficiency
Analogy: Efficiency of Adding and Removing Books Based on Height or Color
Imagine you are continuously optimizing your library by adding or removing books to maintain a collection size while sticking to the height or color scheme.
Downsizing vs. Increasing
: If you aim to maintain a certain library size (e.g., 150,000 books), the decision to be more or less picky can be influenced by the height or color of the books, representing unconventional criteria affecting efficiency.

How about some unconventional definitions of entropy?
ChatGPT
Exploring unconventional definitions of entropy can offer new perspectives on how we understand systems, information, and disorder. Below are a few creative and non-traditional ways to conceptualize entropy:
1.
Entropy as a Measure of Surprise
Definition
: Entropy can be thought of as a measure of surprise in the outcome of a system. In this context, a high-entropy state is one where outcomes are unpredictable and surprising, whereas a low-entropy state has predictable, less surprising outcomes.
Application
: This definition is particularly useful in fields like information theory and cognitive science, where understanding the unpredictability or novelty of information is crucial.
2.
Entropy as Diversity or Variety
Definition
: Entropy can be defined as a measure of diversity or variety within a system. The greater the diversity of states or elements in a system, the higher its entropy.
Application
: This concept is applicable in ecology to describe biodiversity: diverse ecosystems are high-entropy systems because they contain a large variety of organisms, each contributing to the system���s overall unpredictability.
3.
Entropy as a Measure of Lost Opportunities
Definition
: Entropy can be considered a measure of the opportunities lost or the paths not taken in a system. High entropy indicates many missed alternatives, while low entropy suggests fewer alternatives or choices were bypassed.
Application
: In decision theory or economics, this interpretation can reflect the complexity of decision-making processes and the potential for decision entropy in markets or businesses.
4.
Entropy as Historical Information
Definition
: Entropy can be viewed as the amount of historical information required to describe the state of a system accurately. This definition focuses on the complexity and detail involved in reconstructing a system���s past state from its current state.
Application
: This interpretation is useful in fields like archaeology or forensic science, where reconstructing past states from limited present information is essential.
5.
Entropy as a Measure of Resilience
Definition
: Here, entropy is seen as a measure of a system���s resilience���the ability to absorb change and disturbance while maintaining relationships between elements.
Application
: In systems theory or urban planning, high entropy indicates a system that can endure or adapt to significant changes without losing its core functionality.
6.
Entropy as Dispersion of Energy
Definition
: In a more physical sense, entropy can be reimagined as the dispersion of energy within a system. High entropy occurs when energy is spread out evenly, and there are no gradients to exploit for work.
Application
: This concept is essential in renewable energy studies, where understanding how energy disperses in an environment can lead to more efficient energy capture and use strategies.
7.
Entropy as Cultural Diffusion
Definition
: Entropy can describe the degree of cultural diffusion within a society���the spread of cultural elements like language, customs, and norms from one society to another.
Application
: In anthropology and social sciences, this approach can help measure how cultures evolve over time through the mixing and dispersion of ideas and practices.
Each of these definitions offers a unique way of looking at entropy beyond the traditional thermodynamic or information-theoretic contexts. By applying these unconventional definitions, we can gain insights into various disciplines and phenomena, showcasing the broad applicability and relevance of entropy as a concept.

I like to say it is an increase in the number of ways to take a slice of a system and get the same result, that is, smoothness. Also it seems that my definition of learning as inoculation against surprise, has some commonalities with negentropy.
ChatGPT
Your definition of entropy and the concept of learning do indeed have interesting ties to broader themes in both thermodynamics and information theory. Let���s delve deeper into these connections and explore how they align with traditional and unconventional concepts of entropy and negentropy.
Entropy as Smoothness
Definition
: You���ve suggested entropy could be seen as an increase in the number of ways to slice a system and obtain the same result, which reflects a form of smoothness or uniformity across a system.
Philosophical Interpretation
: This definition aligns well with the philosophical view of entropy as a measure of disorder or randomness. Here, the "smoothness" implies a homogeneity in system states, where distinctions between different parts of the system become increasingly blurred, leading to a uniform distribution of properties.
Practical Application
: In materials science, for example, a high-entropy alloy is one composed of multiple principal elements, which are mixed to form a simple, solid solution that is highly uniform at the atomic level. This increases the number of ways the alloy's components can be arranged without affecting its overall properties, akin to your notion of "smoothness."
Learning as Inoculation Against Surprise
Definition
: Learning can be thought of as reducing one's susceptibility to being surprised by future events, thereby increasing predictability and reducing informational entropy.
Negentropy and Learning
: Negentropy, or negative entropy, often refers to things becoming more ordered and less uncertain. In the context of learning, gaining knowledge or skills could be seen as a process of increasing order within one's mental model of the world. As we learn, we effectively decrease the entropy related to our understanding of specific phenomena.
Cognitive and Educational Implications
: This concept can be particularly useful in educational psychology. Effective learning strategies might be those that systematically reduce informational entropy by clarifying and ordering knowledge, thereby making the information less surprising and more readily accessible.
Commonalities Between Smoothness and Learning
Reduction of Variability
: Both concepts involve reducing variability, whether it be in the possible outcomes of a physical process or the potential for surprise in learning. In physics, this might mean a state where energy is evenly distributed; in learning, it refers to a state where new information has less potential to disrupt existing knowledge.
State of Equilibrium
: Both ideas can be seen as striving toward a state of equilibrium���physical equilibrium in the case of entropy (where no macroscopic changes occur as microstates fluctuate) and a cognitive equilibrium in learning, where new information no longer significantly alters one's understanding.
Predictive Power
: In both cases, increased smoothness or effective learning improves predictive power. In systems with high entropy (smoothness), predictions about specific microstates become less certain, but macrostate behavior is predictable. In learning, as one reduces the entropy associated with their knowledge, their ability to predict and effectively respond to related challenges improves.
Implications and Extensions
Interdisciplinary Impact

How can we formulate learning as a dissipative structure?
ChatGPT
To formulate learning as a dissipative structure, we need to connect concepts from thermodynamics, particularly those related to dissipative systems, to the processes of learning and knowledge acquisition.
Dissipative structures
are systems that maintain their stability and structure by dissipating energy and increasing entropy in their surroundings. They are typically far from thermodynamic equilibrium, constantly exchanging energy and matter with their environment to sustain an ordered state.
Here's a step-by-step approach to conceptualize learning as a dissipative structure:
1.
Define the System and Environment
System
: The learner's cognitive system, which includes neural networks, cognitive processes, and knowledge structures.
Environment
: The external sources of information and stimuli, such as educational materials, interactions with teachers and peers, and experiences that provide learning opportunities.
2.
Energy and Matter Exchange
Input
: Information and sensory input are absorbed from the environment. This can be seen as the energy and matter input necessary for sustaining the system.
Output
: Responses, actions, and interactions with the environment that result from processing this information.
3.
Maintaining Far-from-Equilibrium Conditions
Continuous Learning
: To maintain the structure of knowledge (analogous to maintaining order in a physical system), continuous learning is necessary. This continual absorption and processing of information keep the cognitive system far from equilibrium, similar to how a dissipative structure operates.
Adaptive Changes
: Just as physical dissipative structures adapt and evolve in response to changes in their environment, the learning process involves adaptation and modification of cognitive structures in response to new information, maintaining cognitive stability and coherence.
4.
Dissipation of Energy
Entropy Increase in the Environment
: Learning involves not just the acquisition but also the reorganization of information, which increases the entropy of the surrounding environment. For example, discussing and teaching others can be viewed as a process of increasing the informational entropy around oneself.
Metabolic Energy Use
: The brain uses significant metabolic energy to process information and maintain the neural structures that represent knowledge. This energy use is analogous to the energy dissipated by physical dissipative structures.
5.
Emergence and Self-Organization
Formation of Knowledge Structures
: Learning leads to the formation of complex knowledge structures. These structures can be viewed as emergent properties of the cognitive system, analogous to the patterns or structures that emerge in physical dissipative systems (like B��nard cells or Belousov-Zhabotinsky reactions).
Feedback Loops
: Learning involves feedback mechanisms where previously acquired knowledge influences the processing of new information. This feedback can stabilize certain knowledge structures, enhancing learning efficiency and effectiveness, similar to how feedback mechanisms help maintain the structure of dissipative systems.
6.
Thermodynamic Analogies
Prigogine���s Theory
: Ilya Prigogine discussed how dissipative structures can develop in systems where the flux of energy and matter through the system increases disorder (entropy) in the environment but leads to ordered structures within the system. In a learning context, the influx of information increases the disorder of possible cognitive states but can lead to highly organized knowledge systems.
7.
Implications for Educational Practice
Enhanced Learning Environments
: Understanding learning as a dissipative structure suggests that environments rich in stimuli and opportunities for active engagement (input and output) may enhance the formation and maintenance of knowledge structures.
Sustainable Learning
: Just as dissipative structures require a continuous flow of energy to maintain their order, sustainable learning environments need ongoing, dynamic interactions with educational content and contexts to foster effective and lasting learning.
By viewing learning through the lens of dissipative structures, we gain insights into the dynamic, interactive, and energy-dependent nature of knowledge acquisition. This perspective highlights the importance of active engagement with learning materials and environments, continual adaptation and reorganization of knowledge, and the fundamental role of energy (cognitive effort) in sustaining educational processes.

How might be connect with Vygotsky and Wittgenstein's ladders?
ChatGPT
To connect the concept of learning as a dissipative structure with the educational theories of Lev Vygotsky and the philosophical ideas of Ludwig Wittgenstein, particularly "Wittgenstein's ladder," we can explore how these theories and metaphors illuminate the process of cognitive development and the dynamic, evolving nature of understanding and knowledge construction.
Vygotsky's Zone of Proximal Development (ZPD)
Lev Vygotsky's concept of the Zone of Proximal Development (ZPD) refers to the difference between what a learner can do without help and what they can achieve with guidance and encouragement from a skilled partner. This concept fits well with the idea of dissipative structures in several ways:
Energy and Interaction
: In the context of dissipative structures, the learner's cognitive system requires a continual influx of energy (information and interaction) to maintain and develop its structure. The ZPD represents the area where this energy can be most effectively applied ��� where instructional input (guidance) can catalyze learning and cognitive growth, keeping the cognitive system active and far from equilibrium.
Dynamic Stability
: Just as dissipative structures stabilize themselves through dynamic processes that consume energy and increase the system���s overall entropy, learners stabilize their cognitive development through dynamic interactions within their ZPD. These interactions help learners integrate new information into existing knowledge structures, reorganizing and adapting their cognitive framework to accommodate new learning.
Feedback Loops
: Vygotsky���s scaffolding within the ZPD can be seen as a form of feedback mechanism that helps learners remain in a state conducive to learning and cognitive restructuring. This guidance helps maintain the learner's cognitive structure as they assimilate new information and skills, analogous to how feedback mechanisms maintain the order in dissipative systems.
Wittgenstein's Ladder
Wittgenstein's ladder is a metaphor from Ludwig Wittgenstein���s "Tractatus Logico-Philosophicus," suggesting that once one has ascended to a certain level of understanding, they can discard the ladder (the statements or steps) used to reach that understanding. This metaphor can also be linked to the concept of learning as a dissipative structure:
Progressive Understanding
: In dissipative structures, the system evolves toward increasingly complex and ordered states. Similarly, Wittgenstein's ladder represents the idea of progressing through levels of understanding. As learners climb the ladder, they reach higher levels of cognitive complexity and order, integrating and then transcending initial concepts and instructional frameworks.
Transformation and Discarding
: As dissipative structures transform with the continuous input and dissipation of energy, learners transform their understanding as they ascend Wittgenstein's ladder. Once they achieve higher understanding, earlier, simpler or less accurate explanations can be discarded ��� they have served their purpose, much like transient structures in a dynamic system that are no longer needed once the system evolves.
Reorganization of Knowledge
: The act of discarding outdated or simplistic understandings as one ascends the ladder is akin to the reorganization of a dissipative structure as it adapts to new energy inputs and environmental conditions. This reorganization is critical for maintaining the efficiency and relevance of both cognitive and physical systems.
Educational Implications
Integrating these ideas into educational practices emphasizes creating learning environments that actively engage students in dynamic, scaffolded interactions that challenge and extend their cognitive frameworks. Teachers, like the skilled partners in Vygotsky���s theory, provide the necessary inputs (information, challenge, support) to help students climb their cognitive ladders. Meanwhile, encouraging students to discard outdated understandings as they develop deeper insights aligns with fostering a dynamic, evolving educational experience reflective of dissipative structures.
This interdisciplinary connection not only enriches our understanding of learning theories but also highlights the importance of active, continuous engagement and adaptation in education, mirroring the dynamic stability seen in natural systems.
