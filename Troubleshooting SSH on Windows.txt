Setting up SSH on Windows, whether through WSL (Windows Subsystem for Linux) Ubuntu or PowerShell, involves several steps. The fact that you can SSH out but not in suggests that your SSH client setup is fine, but your SSH server setup might need some attention. Here's a general guide to troubleshoot and set up SSH for incoming connections:
For WSL Ubuntu
Install SSH Server
: If you haven't already, install the SSH server in your Ubuntu instance on WSL.
sql
Copy code
sudo apt
update
sudo apt install openssh
-
server
Start SSH Service
: Make sure the SSH service is running.
sql
Copy code
sudo service ssh
start
Configure SSH
: Edit
/etc/ssh/sshd_config
to ensure it's configured properly. You can use
nano
or any other text editor.
Check that
PasswordAuthentication
is set to
yes
if you want to use password-based authentication.
Ensure the SSH server is listening on the correct port, the default is 22.
Check Firewall
: Ensure your firewall settings on Windows allow incoming connections on the SSH port (default is 22).
Get WSL IP Address
: Find out the IP address of your WSL instance.
Copy code
ip addr
Connect from External Device
: Use this IP address to connect from an external device. Remember, this IP can change after restarts.
For PowerShell (Windows SSH Server)
Enable OpenSSH Server
: Go to
Settings
���
Apps
���
Optional Features
���
Add a feature
, then find and install "OpenSSH Server".
Start SSH Service
: Make sure the service is running. You can check this in the Services app in Windows, looking for "OpenSSH SSH Server".
Configure SSH
: The configuration file is typically located in
C:\ProgramData\ssh\sshd_config
. Similar to WSL, check the settings here.
Firewall Settings
: Ensure that the Windows firewall allows incoming connections on the SSH port.
Connect to the Windows Machine
: Use your Windows machine's IP address to connect from an external device.
General Troubleshooting
Check SSH Server Status
: Ensure that the SSH server is actively running on the device you want to connect to.
Verify Network Settings
: Make sure that the network is not blocking SSH connections. This can be an issue in some corporate or educational networks.
SSH Client Configuration
: On the client side, ensure that the SSH client is configured to connect to the right port and IP address.
Test with Verbose Output
: When trying to connect, use the verbose option (
ssh -vvv user@host
) to get more detailed error messages.
Remember, when working with WSL, your Windows and WSL environments have different IP addresses. Ensure you're using the correct IP address when trying to connect.

How was I able to ssh in to my old computer? Can I check how I am doing this, is there a ssh server running?
ChatGPT
ChatGPT
If you were able to SSH into your old computer, it's likely that an SSH server was running and properly configured on that machine. To verify this and understand how it was set up, you can follow these steps:
Checking if SSH Server is Running
Access the Old Computer
: Log in to your old computer where you were able to SSH into.
Open Terminal or Command Prompt
:
For Linux or MacOS, open the Terminal.
For Windows, open Command Prompt or PowerShell.
Check SSH Service Status
:
On Linux or MacOS, run:
lua
Copy code
sudo service ssh
status
or for systems using
systemd
:
lua
Copy code
sudo systemctl
status
ssh
On Windows, you can check if the "OpenSSH SSH Server" service is running by going to the Services application.
Checking SSH Server Configuration
View SSH Configuration
:
On Linux or MacOS, the configuration file is typically located at
/etc/ssh/sshd_config
. View it using a command like
cat /etc/ssh/sshd_config
or open it in a text editor.
On Windows, if you have OpenSSH Server installed, the configuration file is usually in
C:\ProgramData\ssh\
.
Note Important Settings
:
Look for settings like
Port
(to see which port SSH is listening on),
PasswordAuthentication
,
PermitRootLogin
, and any other configurations that might be relevant.
Additional Steps
Check Network Settings
: Ensure the network settings on the old computer, like the firewall and router configuration, are allowing SSH connections.
Compare with New Setup
: Compare these settings and configurations with your new setup to identify any differences.
Firewall and Port Forwarding
: If you were accessing your old computer from a different network, you might have set up port forwarding on your router and allowed SSH through the firewall.
By comparing the working SSH setup on your old computer with your new setup, you should be able to identify what needs to be changed or configured on your new machine to allow SSH access. Remember, security is crucial when setting up SSH, especially if the machine is accessible from the internet. Ensure that you use strong passwords or, preferably, key-based authentication, and keep your software updated.

it says openssh server is running
ChatGPT
ChatGPT
If the OpenSSH server is running on your old computer, that explains why you were able to SSH into it. Now, to ensure you can replicate this setup on your new computer or troubleshoot any issues, you should verify a few key aspects:
1. Check SSH Configuration
Access SSH Config
: Look at the SSH configuration file on the old computer (
/etc/ssh/sshd_config
on Linux). Pay attention to settings like
Port
,
PasswordAuthentication
,
PermitRootLogin
, and any host-based access controls.
Replicate Settings
: Apply similar settings on your new computer's SSH configuration if they are not already set.
2. Confirm Network Settings
IP Address
: Make sure you know the correct IP address of the old computer. Use
ip addr
or
ifconfig
on Linux, or
ipconfig
in Windows Command Prompt.
Firewall Rules
: Ensure the firewall on the old computer allows incoming connections on the SSH port (usually port 22). You'll need to replicate similar rules on your new computer.
3. Test SSH Connection Locally
From another device on the same network, try to SSH into the old computer using its local IP address. This will confirm that the SSH server is accessible within your local network.
4. External Access Considerations
If you were accessing the old computer from outside your local network, check if there were any port forwarding rules set up on your router.
Ensure your new computer has a static IP within your local network, or set up a DHCP reservation in your router to ensure the IP doesn't change.
5. Replicate Setup on New Computer
Install OpenSSH Server on the new computer if it's not already installed.
Update the SSH configuration to match the old computer.
Adjust firewall settings to allow SSH traffic.
If necessary, set up port forwarding on your router.
6. Security Best Practices
Use Key-Based Authentication
: If you���re currently using password-based authentication, consider switching to SSH keys for enhanced security.
Regular Updates
: Keep your SSH server software up-to-date.
Monitor Access Logs
: Regularly check your SSH access logs for any unauthorized attempts to access your system.
By following these steps, you should be able to set up SSH on your new computer similarly to how it was set up on your old one. Remember, the exact steps may vary slightly depending on your operating system and network configuration.

I'm trying to install a go interpreter it says it added something to bin but doesn't find the command: bonobo@Memex:yaegi(master)$ ./install.sh
traefik/yaegi info checking GitHub for latest tag
traefik/yaegi info found version: 0.15.1 for v0.15.1/linux/amd64
traefik/yaegi info installed ./bin/yaegi
ChatGPT
ChatGPT
It seems like you have successfully installed the Go interpreter
yaegi
, and the installation script has placed the executable in a
bin
directory within your current working directory. However, the command is not found because this
bin
directory is not in your system's PATH. The PATH is an environment variable that tells the shell where to look for executable files.
To run
yaegi
, you have two main options:
1. Run Using Relative Path
You can run
yaegi
directly from the
bin
directory by specifying its path. Since the executable is in a directory named
bin
inside your current working directory, you can use:
bash
Copy code
./bin/yaegi
2. Add the Directory to PATH
If you want to run
yaegi
from any location without specifying the full path, you can add the
bin
directory to your PATH. Here���s how you can do it:
Temporary Addition
: To temporarily add the directory to your PATH for the current session, use:
bash
Copy code
export
PATH=
$PATH
:/path/to/your/bin
Replace
/path/to/your/bin
with the actual full path to the
bin
directory where
yaegi
is installed.
Permanent Addition
: For a more permanent solution, you can add the above export command to your shell's profile script (like
~/.bashrc
or
~/.bash_profile
for bash). Open the file in a text editor and add the line at the end:
bash
Copy code
export
PATH=
$PATH
:/path/to/your/bin
After editing the file, apply the changes by running
source ~/.bashrc
(or the appropriate file for your shell).
Verify Installation
After adding
yaegi
to your PATH, you can verify that it's correctly installed by running:
bash
Copy code
yaegi -version
This should display the version of
yaegi
that you have installed. Remember to replace
/path/to/your/bin
with the actual path to the
bin
directory where
yaegi
is located. If you are unsure of the path, you can find it by navigating to the directory where you ran the
install.sh
script and running the command
pwd
to print the working directory path.
You
yaegi: /lib/x86_64-linux-gnu/libc.so.6: version `GLIBC_2.32' not found (required by yaegi)
yaegi: /lib/x86_64-linux-gnu/libc.so.6: version `GLIBC_2.34' not found (required by yaegi)
ChatGPT
ChatGPT
The error message you're encountering indicates that the
yaegi
binary requires a version of GLIBC (the GNU C Library) that is newer than the one installed on your system. GLIBC is a core part of Linux systems, providing the C standard library used by almost all programs, including dynamic libraries and compiled binaries.
To resolve this issue, you have a couple of options:
1. Upgrade Your System
Check Your Current GLIBC Version
: First, find out the version of GLIBC you currently have by running:
bash
Copy code
ldd --version
Update Your System
: If your system is running an older Linux distribution, updating to a newer version might solve the issue as newer distributions usually come with more recent versions of GLIBC. Use your package manager to update your system. For Ubuntu or Debian-based systems, you can use:
bash
Copy code
sudo apt-get update
sudo apt-get upgrade
sudo apt-get dist-upgrade
After updating, check the GLIBC version again.
2. Install a Specific Version of GLIBC
Manually Install GLIBC
: This is more complex and can potentially cause system stability issues if not done correctly. It involves downloading the GLIBC source code for the required version, compiling it, and installing it alongside the current version.
3. Use an Older Version of Yaegi
Download Older Yaegi
: If upgrading GLIBC is not feasible, another solution is to download an older version of
yaegi
that is compatible with your current GLIBC version. You can find older releases on the
Yaegi GitHub releases page
.
4. Use a Docker Container
Docker Solution
: If you cannot upgrade your system or GLIBC and still need to run the latest version of
yaegi
, consider using Docker. You can pull a Docker image of a Linux distribution that has the required GLIBC version and run
yaegi
inside the container.
Caution
Be cautious when manually installing or upgrading GLIBC on your system, as it is a critical component. Incorrect changes can lead to an unstable or unbootable system. In many cases, using an older version of the software that is compatible with your current GLIBC, or using Docker, is a safer approach.
