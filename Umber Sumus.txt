ABSTRACT
In this article, we present a cognitive architecture that is built from powerful yet simple neural
models. Specifically, we describe an implementation of the common model of cognition grounded
in neural generative coding and holographic associative memory. The proposed system creates
the groundwork for developing agents that learn continually from diverse tasks as well as model
human performance at larger scales than what is possible with existant cognitive architectures.

1 Introduction
Modern machine learning techniques based on artificial neural networks (ANNs) are implemented through algebraic
manipulations of vectors, matrices, and tensors in high-dimensional spaces. While ANNs have an impressive
ability to process data to find patterns, they do not typically model high-level cognition. Furthermore, ANNs are
usually models of only a single task. Otherwise, when an ANN is trained to learn a series of tasks, catastrophic
interference occurs, with each new task causing the ANN to forget all previously learned tasks [8, 21, 22]. On the
other hand, symbolic cognitive architectures, such as the widely used ACT-R [1, 31], can capture the complexities
of high-level cognition but scale poorly to the naturalistic, non-symbolic data of sensory perception, e.g., images, or
to big data sets necessary for modelling learning over a lifetime, e.g., corpora with hundreds of millions of words.
Are symbolic and ANN approaches compatible? Symbolic and neural models can be understood as theories of
cognition operating at different levels of description [15]. Is it possible to provide a theory that bridges these two
levels, a reduction of the symbolic to the neural, while retaining the strengths and capabilities of each?
We propose a cognitive architecture that is built on two biologically plausible, neural models, namely a variant of
predictive processing known as Neural Generative Coding (NGC) [27] and holographic memory [13]. Desirably,
the use of these particular building blocks yields naturally scalable, local update rules (based on variants of
Hebbian learning [11]) to adjust the overall system’s synaptic weight parameters while facilitating robustness in
acquiring, storing, and composing distributed representations of tasks encountered sequentially. Our intent is to
advance towards a cognitive architecture capable of modeling human performance at all scales of learning, from
the half-hour lab experiment to skills acquired gradually over a lifetime. By combining predictive processing with
vector-symbolic models of human memory, we create a model of cognition that has the power of modern machine
learning techniques while retaining long-term memory, single-trial learning, transfer-learning, and other cognitive
capacities associated with high-level cognition.
2 The Common Model of Cognition
Since Newell [24] first argued that good empirical work and piecemeal theoretical work are insufficient to understand
the mind, researchers in cognitive science have sought to develop functional, testable theories of cognition as a
whole. Cognitive architectures serve as both unified theories of cognition and as computational frameworks for
implementing models of specific experimental tasks. Forty years of research has developed hundreds of cognitive
architectures, many with strong similarities to each other [17], suggesting an emerging consensus on the basic

principles of cognition. In [19], commonalities are found between three cognitive architectures, ACT-R [2], Soar
[18], and SIGMA [32]. On the basis of the similarities, Laird, Lebiere, and Rosenbloom [19] propose a Common
Model of Cognition, a high-level theory of the modules of the mind and how they interact (see Fig. 1).
The Common Model of Cognition consists of perceptual and motor modules that interact with the agent’s
environment, working memory buffers which hold the active data in the agent’s mind, a declarative or long-term
memory module that holds the agent’s world knowledge, and a procedural memory module that controls the flow
of information and evaluates possible actions [19]. An evaluation of fMRI data from 200 participants across seven
different tasks found correlations in patterns of activity across brain areas consistent with the Common Model of
Cognition’s modules and their interactions [36].
3 Neural Generative Coding (NGC)
Neural Generative Coding (NGC) is an instantiation of the predictive processing brain theory [30, 9, 6], yielding an
efficient and robust form of predict-then-correct learning and inference. We describe how neural circuits taken
from NGC framework can be used to design several key modules of our cognitive architecture.
3.1 Neural Generative Sensory Cortices
NGC can be used to design neural generative models responsible for processing a specific modality of data (e.g.,
image pixels or speech waveforms). In [25, 27], we show that NGC learns a good density estimator of data
(from which new samples can be sampled or “fantasized”), in conjunction with desired target functionality (e.g.,
classification, regression), in not only the cases of static input but also in cases of time-varying data series. This
ability of the NGC process modalities over time will form the sensory cortices of our architecture (see Fig. 2b).
3.2 Neural Generative Motor Cortex
Another key element of a functioning agent is one that demonstrates impetus, i.e., the agent must not merely react
to its environment but must also manipulate it. In line with this particular goal, the agent needs actuators that are
driven by neural circuits that exhibit motor control. In [26], we generalize NGC to the case of action-driven tasks,
common in reinforcement learning, which we call active neural generative coding (ANGC) given that it builds
upon concept of planning-as-inference [3]. This particular work provides promising evidence that NGC can be
used to build a coupled generative model and controller system that is capable of solving important reinforcement
learning problems, particularly those when the reward signal is sparse, or even non-existent. This model would
serve as the motor cortex in our architecture (see Fig. 2b).
3.3 Neural Generative Basal Ganglia
In [28], we model the functionality of the basal ganglia in suppressing/inhibiting neural activity for the purpose of
action selection and task switching [37, 4, 34], a behavior we argue is critical in facilitating effective continual

that multiplicatively gate the activities in the blue and red boxes respectively). In the first diagram (Left), the
basal ganglia model is shown inhibiting/suppressing the activities of one part of the sensory cortex (red box) while
permitting another region to play a role in processing the input (blue box). In the second diagram (Right), the
motor cortex, which is responsible for choosing actions, is depicted interacting with a sensory cortex – the motor

learning without catastrophic interference. The task selection model, which learns through competitive Hebbian
learning, will serve as the basis for part of the basal ganglia in our cognitive architecture, acting to coordinate
the exchange of information between the working memory and the sensory and long-term memory cortices (see
Fig. 2a). Note, as also depicted in Fig. 2a and Fig. 1, the basal ganglia is responsible for more than just interaction
with the sensory cortices – it is meant to interact with the working memory as well as modulate the transfer of
information between the working memory and long term memory.
4 Holographic Memory
Holographic memory [29], also known as vector-symbolic architectures [10] or hyper-dimensional computing
[12], is a formalism for capturing the capacity for humans to learn and recall arbitrarily complex associations
between stimuli in the environment. Holographic memory is immune to the catastrophic interference typical of
more conventional neural networks [21] allowing holographic memory to be used to create models that handle
multiple, unrelated tasks [5]. We propose to use holographic memory to implement the long-term declarative
memory and the working memory buffers.
4.1 Working Memory Buffers
We implement a working memory buffer as a single holographic vector. Holographic memory vectors have a long
established ability to account for benchmark memory phenomena such as serial and free recall of lists [7, 23].
4.2 Declarative Memory
In [13], we implement a holographic declarative memory consisting of many individual holographic vectors.
Each holographic vector represents a distinct concept, collectively serving as the basis vectors for the agent’s
conceptual space [20]. Our model is able accounts for human performance on a wide range of tasks, including recall,
probability judgement, and decision-making [13], as well as how humans learn the meaning and part-of-speech of
words from experience [14].

Preprint, Work in Progress
5 Validation
We intend to validate the architecture by comparing to human data on standard memory and learning tasks,
probability judgement tasks, and decision-making tasks. We will also test the architecture’s ability to solve
problems in environments starting with simple games that require agile adaptation, such as rock-paper-scissors
and mazes, graduating slowly to more complex environments, e.g., video game worlds, all the while comparing to
state-of-the-art statistical learning methods. Continual learning benchmarks such as Split MNIST, Fashion MNIST,
and NotMNIST would also provide a useful starting point in evaluating the systems’s performance when processing
overlapping and non-overlapping (in terms of input distribution) sets/groups of patterns sequentially [28].
6 Conclusions and Future Research
Humans are capable of (a) lifelong, continual learning and deep expertise, (b) single-trial learning and agile
adaptation to dynamic environments, and (c) transfer learning across multiple tasks. Conversely, conventional
neural networks struggle to replicate these human capabilities. Solving the problem of continual learning will aid
us both in understanding the brain processes that facilitate learning, inference, and memory storage in human minds
and in the development of intelligent agents that are better able to generalize to real world environments. Crucially,
our proposed instantiation of the common model of cognition is grounded in and composed of neuro-cognitively
plausible components, i.e., holographic memory, predictive processing circuits, and competitive learning. As a
result, several promising research directions open up but among them is the application of this architecture to
situations where the challenge of catastrophic interference is most prevalent – reinforcement lea

The abstract from Alexander Ororbia and M. Alex Kelly outlines a new cognitive architecture integrating neural generative coding and holographic associative memory within the framework of the common model of cognition. This architecture aims to overcome limitations of existing models by enabling continual learning from diverse tasks and modeling human performance on a larger scale. It leverages predictive processing and vector-symbolic models to create a system that combines the strengths of artificial neural networks and symbolic cognitive architectures, potentially solving the problem of catastrophic interference and enhancing the model's scalability and adaptability to real-world tasks.

That is pretty much the whole article. What was the definition and explanation of NGC?

ChatGPT
Neural Generative Coding (NGC) is described as an instantiation of the predictive processing theory of the brain, which emphasizes an efficient and robust form of learning and inference through a predict-then-correct mechanism. NGC is based on designing neural circuits that can model and process specific modalities of data, such as visual imagery or audio signals, over time. The approach allows for the learning of a good density estimator of data, enabling the generation of new data samples ("fantasized") while also handling desired functionalities like classification or regression. This is particularly effective in dynamic scenarios involving time-varying data series.

NGC is highlighted for its potential in sensory cortex modeling, enabling the processing of different types of sensory data in a way that mimics human cognitive abilities. The methodology is grounded in predictive processing, a concept that suggests the brain is continuously making predictions about incoming sensory information and then updating those predictions based on the actual sensory input received.

The paper suggests that NGC can serve as the foundation for several key modules within a cognitive architecture, including sensory cortices responsible for data processing, motor cortices for action, and even in the modeling of the basal ganglia for action selection and task switching. The inclusion of NGC in these areas is aimed at facilitating effective continual learning without the catastrophic interference that plagues traditional artificial neural networks, thus offering a pathway towards more human-like learning and adaptation capabilities.

Give some metaphors and analogies to explain how prediction can be thought of as planning. I was thinking how walking was setting of a chain of central pattern generators and something similar to walking was used in reaching, visual foraging, and the use of the phonological loop and other oscillatory muscle groups to use as proxies for diegetic sounds and abstract concepts with varying parameters.

ChatGPT
Thinking about prediction as planning can indeed draw from a rich palette of metaphors and analogies, especially from domains like locomotion, sensory exploration, and even the generation of speech or music. Here are a few ways to conceptualize this relationship:

Navigating a Familiar Path in the Dark: Imagine walking through your home in the dark. Your familiarity with the space allows you to anticipate the layout - where furniture is placed, where turns are needed, and where obstacles might be. This anticipation guides your movements, even without direct sensory input. Similarly, prediction in cognition can be seen as planning your mental 'steps' based on prior knowledge, anticipating what comes next and preparing accordingly.

Cooking a Meal from Memory: When you cook a familiar recipe from memory, you anticipate each step before you do it. You know when to start boiling water so it's ready for the pasta after you've chopped the vegetables. This sequence of anticipatory steps is akin to predictive processing in the brain, where prior experiences inform current actions, effectively planning the 'recipe' for cognitive tasks.

Playing Chess: In chess, players often think several moves ahead, anticipating their opponent's responses to their actions. Each move is not just a response to the current board state but is part of a broader plan aiming at victory. This strategic foresight mirrors how predictive processing involves planning - using current information to forecast future states and prepare appropriate responses.

Dancing to a Song: Dancing involves moving your body in rhythm with music, often anticipating the beat and melody changes. Even if you're improvising, your movements are not random; they're guided by the patterns and structures you expect in the music. This dance between expectation and action reflects how predictive planning operates, with the brain using patterns from past experiences to guide current and future actions.

Driving on a Familiar Route: When you drive on a route you know well, you anticipate certain landmarks, turns, and even the behaviors of other drivers at specific intersections. This anticipation allows you to prepare and adjust your driving without needing to consciously analyze every detail anew. Here, prediction functions as a form of mental planning, enabling efficient navigation through a complex environment by leveraging past experiences.

Conversing in a Noisy Room: Engaging in a conversation in a noisy environment requires you to anticipate what the other person might say next, based on the context of the conversation and your knowledge of the topic and the person. This anticipation helps you filter out irrelevant background noise and focus on relevant sounds, illustrating how predictive processes plan our focus and responses in dynamic auditory environments.

These metaphors illustrate the essence of predictive processing as a form of planning, where the brain uses models of the world (built from past experiences) to anticipate future states and prepare actions, much like how we navigate familiar physical, social, and cognitive terrains based on patterns we've learned to expect.

Neuroscientist Jaak Panksepp's theory of SEEKING offers a fundamental insight into why film spectators are engaged by what they see on screen. This article offers a new reading of Panksepp's SEEKING theory and how it applies to spectatorship, a reading informed by two months of the author's personal exchange with the scientist. The article states that the SEEKING impulse—defined as the emotional instinct to seek resources—applies not only to how the spectator identifies with the main character and his search for resources, but to how the spectator responds to visual and aural cues regardless of the story or characters. The article provides a corrective to spectator theories which focus too narrowly on narrative as a cue for viewer mental activity. An examination of two scenes from The Bicycle Thief and Stalker shows how SEEKING can occur on both the primary and tertiary level, thus breaking the emotion-cognition divide.

I couldn't directly access the article "A Dialogue with Neuroscientist Jaak Panksepp on the SEEKING System: Breaking the Divide between Emotion and Cognition in Film Studies" by Karin Luisa Badt in Projections, as it is behind a paywall. However, the summary suggests that the paper applies Jaak Panksepp's theory of the SEEKING system to understand film spectatorship. Panksepp's SEEKING system, an essential part of his affective neuroscience framework, is the brain's mechanism for seeking resources, which can drive both emotional and cognitive processes. According to the summary, this system not only explains how spectators engage with a film's characters and narrative but also how they respond to visual and auditory cues beyond the story itself.

The article seems to argue that the SEEKING system influences spectatorship at multiple levels, challenging theories that prioritize narrative as the primary driver of viewer engagement. By examining scenes from The Bicycle Thief and Stalker, the paper demonstrates how SEEKING operates in film viewing, engaging spectators in a quest for meaning or emotional resonance that transcends simple narrative comprehension. This approach offers a nuanced view of how emotion and cognition are intertwined in the experience of film, suggesting that our instinctual drives play a significant role in how we engage with and derive meaning from cinematic works.

SEEKING in Films: an Emotional Instinct
“My theory of the SEEKING system may indeed apply to fi lm spectatorship,”
neuroscientist Jaak Panksepp told me in a phone interview, when asked
whether his famous theory could account in part for our pleasure in watching
a fi lm. The SEEKING system is defi ned as the instinctual drive to seek resources
for survival. Panksepp, a pioneer in the fi eld of studying animal emotions, has
observed rats excessively sniffi ng as they “scan” their environment, driven by
this instinct. It follows that spectators, gripped attentively to the screen, saccades moving rapidly, may be spurred by the same biological urge to scour the environment for information. “[While watching a fi lm], the SEEKING drive
would be at the hig hest level of the urge to seek: the tertiary level,” Panksepp
continued. “At that level, SEEKING can become obsessive, seeking new information, question asking” (interview, 15 May 2013).
This neurobiological explanation for the hold that fi lms have on human
beings has already excited several fi lm scholars, the prime example being
the esteemed scholar Torben Grodal who incorporated Panksepp’s fi ndings
in his masterful tome, Embodied Visions: Evolution, Emotion, Culture, and Film
(2009). Citing Panksepp, Grodal (2009: 125) construes the excitement of spectator identifi cation with characters who “cope with adversity” as the SEEKING
system in alert. Similarly, in his subsequent study on detective fi ction, Grodal
explains the foraging for clues in detective fi lms as the mammalian SEEKING system at work: “The prime fascination provider in detector fi ction is, as
mentioned, an activation of what the neurologist Jaak Panksepp (1998: 148)
describes as the ‘seeking system,’ short for a ‘foraging/expectancy/SEEKING
system’” (Grodal 2010: 67). In arguing that spectator interest is rooted in neuroevolutionary instincts, Grodal’s groundbreaking work coincides with Panksepp’s mission to show how similar we are, in the basic way we process the
world, to rats and all other mammals

ChatGPT
Jaak Panksepp's SEEKING system theory provides a fascinating lens through which to view film spectatorship, proposing that the same neurobiological impulses that drive animals to explore their environment for survival also drive human engagement with films. The SEEKING system, defined as an instinctual drive to seek out resources necessary for survival, manifests in behavior such as the excessive sniffing and scanning observed in rats. Panksepp suggests that this drive operates at a tertiary level during film viewing, where it becomes an obsessive quest for new information and questioning, paralleling the way spectators are captivated by rapid visual scanning (saccades) across the screen.

This neurobiological perspective offers a compelling explanation for the magnetic pull of cinema, linking the pleasure we derive from watching films to deep-rooted survival instincts. According to Panksepp, the intense engagement and identification with characters, particularly as they navigate adversity, activates the SEEKING system, grounding the experience of cinema in fundamental neuroevolutionary processes.

Film scholar Torben Grodal builds on Panksepp's theory, applying it to the context of spectator identification and the allure of detective fiction within cinema. Grodal highlights how the SEEKING system underpins the excitement of following characters through challenges and the intrigue of piecing together clues in detective stories. This approach aligns with Panksepp’s broader aim to demonstrate the continuity between human and animal experiences of the world, suggesting that our enjoyment of films taps into the same primal urges that drive animals to explore and understand their environments.

Incorporating Panksepp's insights into film studies bridges the gap between emotion and cognition, offering a nuanced understanding of how instinctual drives shape our engagement with art and narrative. By recognizing the role of the SEEKING system in film spectatorship, scholars and filmmakers alike can appreciate the deep-seated, evolutionary roots of storytelling's appeal, illustrating how cinema taps into universal aspects of the mammalian experience.

Any connections to the topics we discussed earlier?

ChatGPT
Absolutely, there are intriguing connections between the topics we've discussed earlier—particularly around predictive processing, neural generative coding (NGC), and the SEEKING system theory by Jaak Panksepp in the context of film spectatorship and cognition-emotion interactions.

Predictive Processing and SEEKING System: Both concepts emphasize anticipation and the drive to resolve uncertainty. Predictive processing is fundamentally about the brain's attempt to predict sensory inputs and minimize prediction error, while the SEEKing system is driven by the instinct to explore and seek out new information or resources. In the context of film viewing, this translates to the audience's engagement being fueled by a desire to predict narrative outcomes and understand character motivations, which is stimulated by the film's visual and auditory cues.

Neural Generative Coding (NGC) and SEEKING in Films: NGC involves generating predictions about sensory inputs and adjusting based on received information. This is akin to the SEEKING system's role in spectatorship, where viewers are constantly generating expectations about the plot and character actions. The pleasure derived from film, then, could be partially attributed to this interplay between prediction, expectation, and the resolution or violation of these expectations, all underpinned by the SEEKING drive for new information and understanding.

Continual Learning and SEEKING System: Our earlier discussion on NGC touched on its application for continual learning without catastrophic interference, highlighting its potential for modeling human-like learning. The SEEKING system's drive for new information and understanding can be seen as a natural mechanism for continual learning in humans, driving us to accumulate knowledge over a lifetime. This mechanism's activation during film viewing suggests that films can be a medium through which viewers engage in a form of continual learning, exploring new narratives, concepts, and perspectives.

Emotion and Cognition Interplay: The discussion around Panksepp's SEEKING system and NGC both underscore the interconnectedness of emotion and cognition. While NGC and predictive processing provide frameworks for understanding cognitive aspects of learning and perception, the SEEKING system emphasizes the motivational and emotional drives underlying these cognitive processes. Films, by engaging the SEEKING system, elicit emotional responses that are deeply intertwined with cognitive processes like anticipation, memory recall, and empathy, illustrating the complex interplay between emotion and cognition in human experience.

In essence, the SEEKING system's role in film spectatorship exemplifies how our most basic neurobiological drives are not only fundamental to survival but also to the enjoyment and interpretation of complex cultural artifacts like cinema. This connection underscores the continuity between our biological imperatives and our most sophisticated cultural practices, highlighting the deep-seated evolutionary roots that underpin human creativity, learning, and emotional engagement.

In this article, I shift the terms of how we can apply Panksepp’s theory to
spectatorship, by returning more closely to the scientist’s defi nition of the
SEEKING instinct. My hypothesis is that the SEEKING system is engaged when
a human being watches any fi lm and not necessarily a fi lm
about adversity or a detective investigation—or any particular
story, for that matter. Grodal’s work focuses on the spectator’s
relationship to character and story, on a narrative (cognitive)
level. In contrast, my reading of Panksepp’s work suggests that
SEEKING may explain our emotionally charged attention to the
screen at a pre-story primary (emotional/sub-cortical) process
level as well as at the tertiary (cognitive) level. In offering this
reading, I challenge Grodal’s understanding and use of Panksepp, and offer a new slant on Grodal’s premise that “the emotional response
is just as much a part of the narrative as the ‘cognitive’” (Grodal 2009: 2). A
central aim in my argument is to overturn the presumed division between
“cognitive” and “emotional”: what Panksepp terms “the illusion of cognitive
autonomy from emotion” (2003: 115).
As Panksepp made very clear to me, during two months of back-and-forth
emails (a testimony to his commitment to exactitude), any valid use of his
theories must grapple fi rst with the basic science that informs his approach.
In our discussion, we refi ned each individual word of his SEEKING system
argument, with particular attention to the use of the words “emotion” and
“instinct.” To summarize: Panksepp is neuroevolutionary biologist, one who believes
that our mental processes, like those of all mammals, are rooted in what he
calls “emotional instincts,” located in the primordial area of the brain. The
word “emotional” linked to “instinct” is essential. Unlike behaviorists, whom
Panksepp notes are his antagonists in the fi eld, for Panksepp, emotions are
a primary instinctual response—that is not a consequence, afterthought, or
mere somato-sensorial symptom of a perception. Still the view of “emotion
as consequence”—which he opposes—is the prevalent theory among his
colleagues in the fi eld of emotion studies, he tells me, such as his esteemed
colleague Antonio Damasio (2003) who construes emotion as an after-effect
(at least in his early work, Looking for Spinoza) much as did the forefathers of
the behaviorist theory of emotion, William James and Carl Lange. Panksepp is
strongly against this dominant “behaviorist top-down model,” which posits
that cognition infl uences emotion (see James’s oft-cited example of the bear:
we see a bear—cognitive perception—hence we are afraid). Instead, for Panksepp, “the whole mental apparatus is premised on emotional feelings” (interview 2013). For Panksepp, we are emotionally driven, and this in turn affects our
thoughts and feelings. “All sustained cognition is affectively directed and motivated,” Panksepp states. “Often invisibly in a fashion that promotes the illusion
of cognitive autonomy from emotion” (2003: 115). We are driven by emotional
instincts, which in turn impact the cognitive mind.

ChatGPT
The perspective offered in this excerpt emphasizes a fundamental reevaluation of how Jaak Panksepp's theory of the SEEKING system can be applied to film spectatorship, moving beyond narrative-centric interpretations to a broader, more instinctual understanding. This shift challenges traditional divisions between cognitive and emotional processes in film viewing, arguing instead for a model where these processes are deeply interconnected, driven by primal emotional instincts.

SEEKING Beyond Narratives: The hypothesis presented suggests that the SEEKING system is activated not only by films that depict adversity or require detective-like investigation but by the act of watching any film. This broader application of Panksepp's theory posits that the engagement and pleasure derived from film spectatorship are rooted in an instinctual, emotional drive to seek and explore, which operates independently of narrative content.

Emotional and Cognitive Interplay: By focusing on the SEEKING system as a fundamental emotional instinct that influences attention and engagement at a pre-narrative level, the argument here positions emotional responses not as secondary to cognitive processes but as integral to them. This challenges views that prioritize cognitive engagement with narrative and character over emotional engagement, suggesting instead that our emotional instincts underpin and drive cognitive processing.

Challenging Cognitive Autonomy: Central to this discussion is the critique of the perceived division between emotion and cognition, often portrayed as separate processes with cognition influencing emotion. Panksepp's work, as interpreted in the excerpt, opposes this view, advocating for the primacy of emotional instincts in shaping mental processes. This stance is contrasted with behaviorist and some cognitive theories that view emotions as consequences of cognitive perceptions (e.g., seeing a bear and then feeling fear).

Emotional Instincts as Primary: The notion that emotional instincts are foundational to our mental apparatus and that all sustained cognition is motivated by affect challenges dominant perspectives in emotion studies. This view posits that our emotional responses are not mere aftereffects of cognitive processing but are instinctual and primary, fundamentally influencing how we think and feel.

Implications for Film Studies: Applying Panksepp's theory in this way to film studies suggests that the emotional engagement of the audience is not just a byproduct of narrative comprehension but a primary driver of the spectatorship experience. This reorientation towards understanding emotional instincts as the basis of cognitive engagement offers a more nuanced understanding of how films captivate and hold our attention, beyond the specifics of story and character.

This reinterpretation of Panksepp's SEEKING system in the context of film spectatorship enriches the dialogue between neuroscience and film studies. It underscores the complexity of the human mind's engagement with art, highlighting the deep-seated emotional instincts that drive our experiences of cinema. This approach not only broadens the application of Panksepp's work but also challenges us to reconsider the foundations of our engagement with narrative art forms.

User
“Instinct” is the operative word in Panksepp’s theory, a term that needs to
be discussed as well, as it is itself tricky and defi ned variably according to the
scientist. Panksepp’s defi nition is once again iconoclastic. For him, instincts
are “inborn behavioral and mental tendencies that are fundamental to the
reproductive fi tness of a particular type of animal” (interview 2013)—and
are, by defi nition (and here is the originality of his argument), emotionally
charged (Panksepp 2010: 257; emphasis added). Following this premise, Panksepp’s mission over the last thirty years has been, in his words, to fi nd the
neural correlates of “the part [of the brain] that is most emotional, deep in the
core-midbrain; the most ancient part of the brain, without which we cannot
be conscious” (interview 2013). This ancient part of the brain is so central to
conscious experience that it even “deserves a special name: the core self” (interview 2013).
The upshot: for Panksepp, the core self is an emotional self. This is his most
controversial view, one that even Grodal, who uses Panksepp, might disagree
with, given his construal of separate and distinct processes of cognition and
emotion in responses to fi lm story, and further, his assumption that what motivates our SEEKING in fi lm is not instinctual or emotional, but purely cognitive.1
 Grodal is not alone in dividing emotion from cognition. In fact, most of
Panksepp’s colleagues in the fi eld—as Panksepp told me with no small degree of emotion—argue against his premise of the “emotional self.” They also, Panksepp noted, disdain his approach to use animal models to understand
raw emotional feelings. In rebuttal, he holds that “what we really know right
now is that animals do have emotional systems that generate emotional feelings, even though hardly a neuroscientist yet acknowledges these facts, since
they are accustomed to thinking about the brain without understanding the
primary-emotional and other affective processes” (interview 2013). In sum, for
Panksepp, in contradistinction to his colleagues (and many fi lm scholars as
well) “emotional” instincts are primary and precede what he calls “cognitive
feelings.” Cognitive feelings occur at the tertiary level in the cerebral cortex,
motivated by sub-cortical emotional instincts. Primordial “emotional instincts”
drive human behavior.
Panksepp’s most signifi cant and original contribution to his fi eld is that he
has identifi ed seven such “emotional instincts,” or what he also calls “ancient
social-emotional systems”: SEEKING, ANGER, FEAR, PANIC/GRIEF, MATERNAL
CARE, PLEASURE/LUST, and PLAY. The premise, once more, is that emotions are
actually essential to our survival. “They allow animals to automatically anticipate survival concerns.” They are the “primary-process affective foundation of
the mind” (personal interview). As a Darwinian neuroevolutionist, Panksepp
holds that these seven instincts are evolutionary memories “built into the
nervous system at a fundamental level” (interview 2013), hence why he spells
them (insistently, I will note) in all CAPS.2
The SEEKING-EXPECTANCY system is the most important of all the systems. As noted at the outset of this article, it is what impels us to seek our
environment for information that will help us survive. “It allows animals to
go out in the world and enthusiastically look for the resources needed to live”
(interview 2013). Dopamine-energized, this mesolimbic SEEKING system, arising from the ventral tegmental area (VTA), encourages foraging, exploration,
investigation, curiosity interest and expectancy. Dopamine fi res each time the
rat (or human) explores its environment.

Jaak Panksepp's groundbreaking work on emotional instincts, particularly through the lens of the SEEKING system, challenges and expands the conventional boundaries between emotion and cognition. His definition of instincts as "inborn behavioral and mental tendencies" that are fundamentally linked to an animal's reproductive fitness and, crucially, are emotionally charged, sets a foundation for understanding the deep, evolutionary roots of human behavior and consciousness.

Emotional Instincts as the Core Self: Panksepp's concept that at our core, we are fundamentally emotional beings, proposes a shift in how we consider the structure of the mind. By locating the "core self" in the most ancient parts of the brain associated with primary emotional processes, he emphasizes the precedence of emotional instincts over cognitive processes. This perspective suggests that our most basic, instinctual responses are not just byproducts of cognitive functions but are central to the formation of our conscious experience and identity.

The Controversy of Emotional Primacy: This view diverges sharply from more traditional models in both neuroscience and film studies, which often treat emotion and cognition as distinct, if not hierarchical, with cognition usually preceding emotion. Panksepp's assertion that emotional instincts underlie and drive cognitive processes challenges the prevailing cognitive-first frameworks and suggests a more integrated approach to understanding mental processes.

Emotional Systems and Survival: The identification of seven primary emotional systems (SEEKING, ANGER, FEAR, PANIC/GRIEF, MATERNAL CARE, PLEASURE/LUST, and PLAY) underscores the role of emotions as evolutionary adaptations essential for survival. These systems, built into the nervous system, function to navigate survival concerns automatically, illustrating emotions' functional and foundational role in behavior and decision-making.

SEEKING-EXPECTANCY System: Among these, the SEEKING system is highlighted as particularly critical, energizing behaviors associated with exploration, curiosity, and the acquisition of necessary resources. This dopamine-driven system illustrates how the quest for knowledge and understanding, as well as the basic impulses to explore and interact with our environment, are deeply embedded in our neurobiological makeup.

Implications for Understanding Human Behavior and Film Spectatorship: By positioning emotional instincts at the heart of human behavior, Panksepp's work offers profound insights into the universality of certain emotional experiences and their evolutionary significance. In the context of film spectatorship, this approach provides a compelling framework to understand why and how audiences engage with narratives and characters. The SEEKING system, in particular, may explain our intrinsic motivation to engage with stories, driven by a deeper, evolutionary impetus to explore, understand, and find meaning in our surroundings.

Panksepp's contributions urge a reevaluation of the fundamental mechanisms that drive human behavior, suggesting that to fully understand cognitive and emotional experiences, including our engagement with art and media, we must recognize the primacy and integration of emotional instincts. This perspective not only enriches the dialogue between neuroscience and humanities but also invites a more holistic view of the human mind, one that appreciates the intricate dance between emotion and cognition as essential to our survival and flourishing.

The most obvious connection of this “emotional SEEKING instinct” to
fi lm is unarguably that one factor that drives a spectator’s interest in watching a fi lm is to learn what happens next in the story. This drive, as Panksepp suggested in an interview, would be at the tertiary level of SEEKING
(cognition), located in the neocortical area of the brain, and grounded in primary-process emotional networks. Here Panksepp’s theory of a tertiary level
of the SEEKING system would ground in a neurobiological reality not only
Grodal’s theory of cognitive pleasure in watching fi lms of adversity (the curiosity about how will the character cope?) and detective fi lms (what does
this clue mean?), but also other key spectator theories, such as Noel Carroll’s
theory of fi lm suspense and Joseph Anderson’s idea of “affordances.” Below I
outline these theories and show how they intersect with Panksepp’s neurobiological findings. Spectator Theories: Noël Carroll, Joseph Anderson, Torben Grodal
Carroll argues that fi lm suspense is based on raising expectations in the spectator: “Earlier narrative raises questions, issues or possibilities that are answered
or actualized by later scenes” (1996: 96). Using Panksepp’s theory, we can see
Carroll’s “erotetic” model as grounded in an instinctual urge to ask questions,
at a tertiary (cognitive) level. The primitive human forages his or her environment for the essentials to survival, possible food and mates, and asks questions constantly about where this food or mate can be located. In virtual form,
the fi lm spectator wonders constantly about where and how the characters
can meet their own needs, and whether it will work out in the end. Moreover,
Carroll’s theory correlates with Panksepp’s insistence that SEEKING is bottomup, not top-down—that is not at just the tertiary level. For Carroll, “not all
mental processes can be equated with consciously performed processes,” he
writes. “Clearly, I must say that [spectators] frame narrative questions tacitly
and they subconsciously expect answers to them” (Carroll 1996: 98).
Panksepp’s theory of SEEKING at a primary instinctual level (i.e., looking
for resources to survive) can be tremendously helpful here in explaining how
these subconscious processes work: why we are even driven to follow the outcome, good or bad, of characters in a fi lm. Our primary instincts would be engaged by the kind of story that provokes these instincts. For Carroll, suspense
is triggered by wondering about whether the character will meet a good (and
improbable) end: what can be interpreted (using Panksepp) as the expression
of our survival mechanism to seek “success” in our environment and beat the
odds. We instinctually are driven to fi nd answers, hooked into this Darwinian
process, whether our lives are at stake—or when connecting with a character’s
personal story. “Suspense in life as opposed to fi lm is not just anticipation, but
anticipation where something desired is at stake” (Carroll 1996: 101). Suspense
would hence be rooted in the biological need to survive, that which informs
the cognitive desire to know what happens next.
The fi lm scholar Joseph Anderson (1998) has also taken a biological approach
to fi lm spectatorship, in taking up what initially seems similar to Panksepp’s
SEEKING system—vision psychologist J.J. Gibson’s notion of “affordances”—
to develop what he calls “ecological fi lm theory.” “Affordances” are the “action
possibilities” in an environment: what the human being can perceive as useful
to his or her needs; hence the perception of an object depends on how we see
its use value. Anderson relates this idea of affordances to fi lm spectatorship in
that he claims that spectators respond to a shot based on what they think can
or will be done in that shot; directors, he claims, deliberately construct every
shot so as to gear spectators’ interest in its possible use-value—a close-up on
an open window will inspire the affordance of “leaving” through the window.
Anderson’s theory of affordances, like Carroll’s theory of suspense, connects to
Panksepp’s theory in that we seek what can be of use to us in our environment, albeit in Anderson’s case, like Grodal’s, this search is exclusively on a cognitive
level. Anderson does not discuss affordances as emotional instincts or subconscious processes, but rather as a series of cognitive assessments.

ChatGPT
The integration of Jaak Panksepp’s theory of the SEEKING system with key spectator theories in film studies enriches our understanding of film spectatorship by providing a neurobiological foundation to cognitive and emotional engagement with films. This connection across theories demonstrates how primary emotional instincts underpin and drive the cognitive processes involved in watching and engaging with films.

Film Suspense and the SEEKING System: Noël Carroll's theory of film suspense emphasizes the creation of narrative questions and expectations that the audience is eager to see resolved. Panksepp’s SEEKING system offers a neurobiological underpinning to this phenomenon, suggesting that the instinctual urge to seek answers and resolve uncertainty—rooted in our survival mechanisms—drives this engagement. The audience's anticipation and the pleasure derived from finding out what happens next in a story mimic the primal need to forage for resources or outcomes critical for survival. This illustrates how film suspense can be seen as a modern extension of ancient survival instincts, engaging both emotional and cognitive faculties.

Erotetic Narration and Instinctual Inquiry: Carroll’s erotetic model, which is based on the spectator's subconsciously formed narrative questions, aligns with Panksepp’s delineation of SEEKING at both the subconscious (primary) and conscious (tertiary) levels. This correlation suggests that the film viewer’s engagement is not solely a conscious cognitive process but is deeply rooted in instinctual emotional drives that propel us to seek out and anticipate narrative outcomes.

Biological Foundations of Spectatorship Theories: Joseph Anderson’s ecological film theory, inspired by J.J. Gibson's notion of "affordances," also finds resonance with Panksepp’s SEEKING system. While Anderson focuses on the cognitive level, identifying how spectators assess the utility of cinematic elements, the underlying drive to seek out these "action possibilities" can be linked back to the SEEKING system's foundational role in motivating exploration and interaction with our environment. This suggests that even cognitive assessments of film elements are ultimately motivated by deeper, instinctual processes.

Integration of Cognitive and Emotional Processes: The application of Panksepp’s SEEKING system to these film theories challenges the traditional separation of cognition and emotion in film spectatorship. It posits that our cognitive engagements with film—whether through suspense, erotetic narration, or assessing affordances—are deeply intertwined with, and indeed driven by, primary emotional instincts. This interplay highlights the complexity of the spectatorship experience, where emotional and cognitive processes are not distinct but are facets of the same fundamental drive to seek and understand our environment.

Expanding the Scope of Film Theories: By grounding film spectatorship theories in the neurobiological reality of the SEEKING system, we see how fundamental survival mechanisms are repurposed for engaging with cultural artifacts like films. This approach enriches traditional film theories by providing a deeper, more integrated understanding of why films captivate us—because they tap into the same ancient systems that govern our interactions with the physical world.

In summary, Panksepp’s SEEKING system offers a powerful framework for understanding film spectatorship, bridging the gap between the emotional and cognitive, the instinctual and the narrative. It suggests that our engagement with films is a complex, deeply rooted process that reflects broader principles of human behavior and brain function.

“Story” versus “Form”
Although these spectator theories are fascinatingly rich, I would like to be so
bold as to note a limitation to all three, beginning with Grodal and Carroll.
Grodal’s and Carroll’s theories concern spectators’ addiction to suspense in
fi lm narrative, an approach that overlooks the formal properties of the media.
The suspense Carroll notes is about story-suspense (i.e., moral or not moral
outcomes) and only about particular kinds of fi lms (suspense fi lms); the SEEKING Grodal discusses is the drive to follow the cues of a narrative, to satisfy
our curiosity on how a certain character copes with adversity or how a detective mystery plays itself out. Neither of these issues—suspense or following
cues—is uniquely germane to cinema. They can both be true when reading a
novel, hearing an aural story, or following a comic book. Suspense and SEEKING, at a tertiary level, happen when following text narratives too.
What is unique about fi lm is that it is a visually moving narrative, to a
soundtrack. Unlike a book, a fi lm is a sense-based experience, a phenomenon
which depends on and manipulates our visual and aural processing.3
 We are
responding to sight and sound, to a two-dimensional artifi cially created universe on a screen that we process as the real world. Moreover, as vision neuroscientist Lyle Graham observes, it is an unusual experience of sense processing:
Cinema is a fascinating medium because the change of frame is [artifi -
cially] monitored in cinema in a way it is not in “real life.” You’re looking
at a rectangle. The frame is fi xed. If there is a change in the frame, it is
not accompanied by head or eye movement. You cut off the loop: the
frame is changing; someone else is controlling the frame. The screen is a
novelty. (personal interview, 3 October 2014)
To put it simply, the “story” is not the only thing going on in fi lm viewing. If
we are gripped to the screen, it is not just because of the story, although of
course, that is determinative—as the cognitive theories of Grodal and Carroll
ably show—of a major part of our interest. Suffi ce to compare the experience
of reading a screenplay to watching the actual movie.4
 What is happening to
a fi lm spectator is qualitatively different than what is happening to a reader
of a text.

An entry into understanding this qualitative difference is provided by Edward Tan’s brilliantly coined term “artifact emotion.” Tan coined the term to
mean the kind of pleasure that spectators take in observing non-narrative aspects in a fi lm, such as “spectacular special effects . . . , superb acting talent, and/
or impressive photography or staging” (Tan 2006: 65). In a subsequent use of
PROJECTIONS
The novelty in my argument,
however: these shifts in
attention to visual (and
aural) cues connect to the
primary SEEKING urge. Our
eyes and ears are attracted
to what is perceived as new
or unusual information in
the environment.
this term, Carl Plantinga expanded “artifact emotion” further
to refer to spectator pleasure in stylistic choices or mise-enscène, that is in the fi lm’s construction tout court: “Artifact
emotions are all of the emotional responses that can be solicited directly by the artifactual status of fi lm as opposed to
the content of the fi ction” (Plantinga 2009: 74). If we think of
a fi lm viewing from this perspective, the emotional pleasure
of watching a fi lm comes not only from following the macrostory (the narrative frame or hook), but from anticipation of
what happens next in terms of aesthetic and formal properties: what we actually see and hear. We are searching, shot
by shot, not only for new “clues” about the story, but for new images, technical
feats, aural surprises, mise-en-scène delights, and this itself is inherently (and
biologically) exciting and addictive at a non-narrative level.
To bring this argument to a lower order scale: the most rudimentary reason that we are so attentive to these changes is that the screen engages our
senses, especially and foremost our visual processing. As vision scientist Tim
Smith has established, bottom-up visual factors in a fi lm (such as motion,
luminance, color, edges) as well as top-down visual factors (such as objects
we recognize) will attract our attention. “In the absence of editing, viewer
gaze will shift around objects of interest within a shot guided by their own
interest, low-level audiovisual features of the scene, and compositional features such as camera movements, lighting, focus, color, etc” (Smith 2012: 19).
A surprising fl ash of light, a new face, or particularly deft camerawork will
catch our eye.
The novelty in my argument is that these shifts in attention to visual (and
aural) cues connect to the primary SEEKING urge. Our eyes and ears are attracted to what is perceived as new or unusual information in the environment.
SEEKING on a Primary Level
At this point, it should be clear that this SEEKING for new visual and aural
information is actually quite different from seeking for “clues” (as in Grodal’s
argument) or “affordances” (as in Anderson’s). The affordances that Anderson
points out are on the level of the plot. They refer to the director’s conscious
manipulation of the mise-en-scène to inspire interest in the story: the window
the character may climb out of; the door that the hero may soon enter. The
choices of affordances, as Anderson describes them, are already built deliberately into the story, much like Umberto Eco’s “open stories” allow for only a
certain limited amount of possibilities, in a closed system. Anderson’s theory is
a top down approach to film spectatorship, in which the spectator’s attention
is controlled by the director’s narrative intention, as if the director’s choices
dictate precisely what “affordances” the spectator will experience.

A DIALOGUE WITH NEUROSCIENTIST JAAK PANKSEPP
The SEEKING
for artifact
emotions
is beyond
the level of
the story:
challenging
the basic
premise of
Grodal’s,
Anderson’s
and Carroll’s
spectatorship
theories.

What I am suggesting in this article is that the spectator SEEKS regardless
of what the director wants them to seek for narrative purposes. What Anderson, Grodal, and Carroll all have in common is that they do not allow for a free
spectator attentive to the frame for reasons beyond the story that the director
has manipulated and constructed for them. Anderson’s theory assumes a homogenous plot-bound spectator, with no freedom to see the fi lm as he or she
wishes, according to individual idiosyncratic urges. For Anderson, affordances
are predetermined by the storyline; the spectator will seek what the script has
programmed him or her to seek, not what he or she instinctually is drawn to
in the frame. Grodal’s theory assumes the same. But as the neurocinematic
studies of Uri Hasson have shown, while camera editing will infl uence where
the gaze goes, it is not—Hasson noted to me in an addendum to his argument—determinative of the entire spectator response (personal interview, 24
July 2014). The spectator’s interest in a fi lm can go well beyond the “storyline”
and the response the fi lm director “intends.”

The discussion emphasizes a significant expansion in understanding film spectatorship by distinguishing between narrative-driven engagement and the intrinsic appeal of film’s formal qualities. This perspective challenges traditional theories focused primarily on narrative, suggesting that spectator interest is not solely anchored in the storyline or character development but also deeply rooted in the film's sensory and formal elements. Here’s how this distinction enriches our understanding:

Beyond Narrative Suspense: While Grodal and Carroll focus on narrative suspense and the cognitive engagement with storylines, the critique highlights that films engage audiences beyond these elements. The visual and auditory experience of cinema, with its unique manipulation of sensory processing, offers a distinctive form of engagement that cannot be replicated by other narrative forms like novels or audio stories. This distinction underlines the multisensory nature of film as a medium that engages visual and auditory senses in ways that contribute significantly to the spectator's experience.

Artifact Emotion and Formal Appreciation: The concept of "artifact emotion" underscores the pleasure derived from the film's non-narrative aspects, such as cinematography, sound design, and special effects. These elements can evoke emotional responses independent of the story, suggesting that spectatorship involves a complex interplay between narrative and formal appreciation. This aspect of film viewing is particularly relevant in the context of Panksepp’s SEEKING system, as it suggests that the instinctual drive for novelty and exploration extends to the aesthetic and technical qualities of cinema, not just its narrative content.

Primary SEEKING and Sensory Engagement: The argument extends the application of Panksepp’s SEEKING system to the primary level of sensory engagement with films. This perspective suggests that the instinctual drive to seek out new or unusual information is engaged by the formal properties of cinema, including visual and auditory cues, independent of narrative-driven curiosity. This broadens the scope of SEEKING in the context of film spectatorship, indicating that our attraction to films involves a deep-seated biological drive towards exploring and making sense of the sensory information presented to us.

Spectator Autonomy and Individual Response: Highlighting the limitations of theories that focus solely on narrative-driven engagement respects the autonomy of the spectator. It recognizes that individual responses to a film can be influenced by personal preferences, experiences, and the instinctual draw to the film’s formal elements, suggesting that film viewing is a more idiosyncratic and personalized experience than previously acknowledged. This challenges the notion of a homogenous spectatorship solely directed by narrative intentions and opens up a more nuanced understanding of how people interact with films.

Implications for Film Theory and Analysis: This critique urges film theorists and practitioners to consider the full spectrum of filmic engagement, encompassing both story and form. It calls for a broader analytical framework that accounts for the complexity of film spectatorship, recognizing that films are designed to engage our primal instincts as much as they are to narrate stories. This approach encourages a more holistic view of cinema that appreciates the multifaceted ways in which films captivate and entertain, bridging the cognitive and emotional, the narrative and the sensory.

In summary, this expanded view of film spectatorship not only challenges existing theories but also enriches our understanding of cinema as a deeply engaging art form that activates our instinctual drives at multiple levels. It reaffirms the power of film to evoke a wide range of responses, from narrative curiosity to sensory delight, rooted in our fundamental SEEKING instinct.

When I am watching a movie at home I am constantly adjusting the lighting and contrast and volume, and sometimes skipping scenes that are overly intense

ChatGPT
Your actions while watching a movie at home—adjusting the lighting and contrast, volume, or skipping overly intense scenes—highlight a deeply personal and instinctual engagement with the cinematic experience. This behavior underscores several important aspects of how humans interact with media, especially in an environment where they have control over their viewing experience:

Sensory Regulation: By adjusting the lighting, contrast, and volume, you're engaging in sensory regulation, tailoring the audio-visual impact of the film to suit your comfort levels and preferences. This act mirrors the SEEKING system's drive for an optimal level of sensory stimulation, where you're instinctively modulating your environment to enhance pleasure or reduce discomfort.

Emotional Self-Regulation: Skipping scenes that are overly intense reflects an instinctual need for emotional self-regulation. Films often evoke strong emotional responses, and your decision to bypass certain parts can be seen as a protective measure, seeking to maintain emotional equilibrium. This behavior is aligned with the broader concept of the SEEKING system, as it involves avoiding negative stimuli or emotional states that are not conducive to your well-being.

Seeking Comfort in Familiarity: The adjustments you make might also indicate a preference for a certain kind of viewing experience, one that is closely aligned with your personal comfort zone. This ties back to the SEEKING system's role in guiding us toward familiar and safe environments, even within the context of a simulated reality like film.

Active Engagement and Control: Your interactive approach to watching a movie—where you actively make changes to the viewing setup—underscores a desire for control over your experience. This active engagement is a modern manifestation of the SEEKING system, where the drive to explore and manipulate one's environment extends to digital and media landscapes.

Personalization of Experience: Ultimately, these behaviors highlight the personalization of the film-watching experience in home settings. Unlike in a cinema, watching at home allows you to tailor the environment and the content to your specific preferences and needs, which can significantly alter the emotional impact and enjoyment of the film.

These actions and their underlying motivations offer a fascinating lens through which to view our relationship with media. They reflect the complex interplay between cognitive and emotional processes, sensory preferences, and instinctual drives, illustrating how deeply embedded our primal instincts are in even the seemingly mundane activities of daily life.

I put the subtitles in Standard Galactic and/or in Spanish. If it's a particularly boring or overly-dramatic it makes it more interesting or more tolerable.

ChatGPT
Adding subtitles in Standard Galactic (assuming you're engaging in a bit of playful customization) or Spanish for films that are boring or overly-dramatic reflects a creative and active approach to making the viewing experience more engaging or tolerable. This strategy highlights several key aspects of how people interact with media:

Enhancing Engagement through Novelty: By choosing subtitles in a different language or in a playful format, you're introducing a novel element to the viewing experience. This novelty can stimulate interest and attention, making the content more engaging. This ties back to the SEEKING system's drive for exploration and novelty, as encountering and deciphering subtitles in another language or in an unusual format can provide a new layer of stimulus that piques curiosity.

Cognitive and Linguistic Exercise: For films in languages you understand or are learning, using subtitles can serve as a cognitive and linguistic exercise, enhancing the educational value of the viewing experience. This not only makes the film more interesting but also aligns with the SEEKING system's role in learning and acquiring new skills or information.

Emotional Distance and Regulation: Altering the subtitles might also serve as a method of creating emotional distance from content that is overly dramatic or intense. By focusing on the subtitles, whether for their novelty value or linguistic content, you might find a way to moderate the emotional impact of the film, making it more tolerable to watch.

Personalization and Control: Similar to adjusting the film's audio-visual settings, choosing unique subtitles allows for a more personalized viewing experience. This level of control and customization reflects an active engagement with the media, tailoring it to fit personal preferences or to suit specific needs at the moment.

Cultural and Language Exploration: Using subtitles in Spanish or another language can also enhance cultural understanding and appreciation, making the film-watching experience more enriching. It can introduce viewers to different ways of expressing ideas and emotions, expanding their cultural and linguistic horizons.

These practices underscore the multifaceted relationship people have with media, where viewing becomes not just a passive consumption of content but an interactive experience that engages various cognitive, emotional, and sensory processes. It also highlights how individuals can employ creative strategies to enhance or modulate their media experiences, tapping into their instinctual drives for novelty, learning, and emotional regulation.

I was suggesting that these are less related to the narrative or plot then would be expected.

ChatGPT
Your approach to enhancing the film-watching experience by adjusting subtitles to Standard Galactic or Spanish, especially for films that you find boring or overly dramatic, indeed emphasizes engagement beyond the traditional narrative or plot. This method of interaction underscores a distinct aspect of media consumption that prioritizes experiential and sensory engagement over story-driven involvement. Here's how this perspective shifts the focus from narrative to a broader, more immersive engagement:

Sensory and Cognitive Stimulation: Altering subtitles introduces a layer of sensory and cognitive stimulation that operates independently of the film’s narrative content. This engagement is more about the act of reading and processing the subtitles in a different linguistic or stylistic context, which can transform the viewing experience into a more active cognitive exercise or a playful exploration.

Aesthetic and Formal Appreciation: By focusing on elements such as subtitles for enhancing the viewing experience, you're engaging with the film on an aesthetic and formal level rather than its narrative substance. This approach reflects an appreciation for the medium's properties—the visual text on screen, the act of reading as part of viewing, and the interplay between audio, visual, and textual elements—highlighting the multisensory complexity of film as an art form.

Interactive and Participatory Viewing: Adjusting subtitles for added interest or tolerance indicates a move towards a more interactive and participatory mode of media consumption. This method allows viewers to assert control over their experience, effectively co-creating the viewing experience by introducing elements that alter their engagement with the film.

Emotional and Psychological Regulation: Choosing to modify the viewing experience through subtitles can also be seen as a form of emotional and psychological regulation. It demonstrates how viewers can actively shape their emotional responses to a film, seeking ways to mitigate boredom or reduce the impact of dramatic content, thereby customizing their emotional journey through the film.

Diversifying Engagement: This strategy diversifies the ways in which viewers can engage with films, opening up avenues beyond narrative-driven enjoyment. It illustrates how films can serve as platforms for language learning, cultural exploration, or even just as backdrops for cognitive and sensory play.

Your approach points to a dynamic and multifaceted relationship with film, where the engagement transcends narrative absorption, embracing the medium's sensory, cognitive, and interactive potentials. It highlights how viewers can creatively leverage different aspects of the film-watching experience to suit their preferences, needs, or mood, suggesting that the richness of cinema lies not just in storytelling but in its capacity to stimulate, entertain, and engage on multiple levels.

I think there is a new genre of simultaneous video which could provide "alternate" views such as the same movie from different angles, x-ray sobel filter outlines, or giving the piano keys and chords of the music.

ChatGPT
The concept of simultaneous video presenting "alternate" views offers an innovative expansion of the cinematic experience, integrating additional layers of interaction and perception. This genre can enrich the audience's engagement with a film by providing diverse perspectives and deeper insights into its creation, potentially transforming traditional narrative consumption into a more multidimensional exploration. Here are several ways this new genre could redefine film-watching:

Enhanced Visual Exploration: Offering the same movie from different camera angles invites viewers to experience the narrative through multiple visual perspectives. This not only adds depth to the storytelling but also allows audiences to appreciate the directorial and cinematographic choices made in presenting the story from a particular viewpoint.

Technical and Artistic Insight: Incorporating visual filters like an X-ray or Sobel filter outlines can provide a unique aesthetic experience while also offering insights into the technical aspects of filmmaking. For instance, an X-ray view could highlight the complexity of action scenes or the intricacies of character interactions, whereas Sobel filter outlines might accentuate the composition and framing of each shot, enhancing the viewer's appreciation for the film's visual artistry.

Musical Engagement: Displaying the piano keys and chords of the music accompanying the film can significantly deepen the audience's connection to the soundtrack. For music enthusiasts or learners, this feature could offer an educational layer, allowing them to understand and appreciate the film's score in real-time, potentially even inspiring viewers to learn to play the themes themselves.

Interactive and Educational Potential: This genre inherently invites interaction, encouraging viewers to actively engage with the film beyond passive watching. By exploring different angles or focusing on the musical score, audiences can gain a deeper understanding of film production, storytelling techniques, and even music theory, making the viewing experience both entertaining and educational.

Personalized Viewing Experience: Simultaneous video with alternate views caters to diverse audience preferences and interests, allowing each viewer to tailor the experience to their liking. Whether one is more interested in cinematography, the technical aspects of filmmaking, or the musical score, this genre offers a personalized approach to film consumption.

Expanding Narrative Dimensions: Beyond enhancing visual and auditory engagement, this approach can introduce new narrative dimensions, revealing subtleties in character development or plot dynamics that may not be apparent from a single viewpoint. This could lead to richer interpretations and discussions among viewers, expanding the narrative experience beyond conventional storytelling.

The development of a simultaneous video genre represents a convergence of technology, art, and viewer engagement, opening new avenues for creative expression and audience participation in cinema. By integrating alternate views and interactive elements, filmmakers and content creators can offer audiences not just a story, but a multifaceted exploration of the cinematic craft, potentially setting a new standard for immersive and interactive film experiences.

I was thing of learn to speak videos that feature cutaway views showing the mouth movements

ChatGPT
The concept of "learn to speak" videos featuring cutaway views to show mouth movements is a brilliant idea that merges linguistic education with visual learning techniques. This approach can significantly enhance language learning by providing clear, visual cues that are essential for understanding the nuances of pronunciation, articulation, and mouth positioning. Here’s how this innovative educational tool could transform language learning:

Visualizing Pronunciation: Seeing the precise movements of the tongue, lips, and jaw during speech can greatly aid learners in replicating sounds accurately. Many languages have sounds that are unfamiliar or difficult for non-native speakers to produce, and visual aids can bridge the gap between hearing a sound and understanding how to make it.

Improving Articulation: Detailed visual guides can help learners refine their articulation, making it easier to distinguish between similar sounds and improving clarity in speech. This is particularly beneficial for languages with subtle sound variations that significantly alter meaning.

Enhancing Phonemic Awareness: Exposure to the physical mechanics of how sounds are produced can heighten phonemic awareness—the ability to hear, identify, and manipulate the phonemes (distinct units of sound) in spoken words. This awareness is crucial for language acquisition and literacy.

Engaging Multiple Learning Styles: Incorporating visual elements caters to visual learners who might struggle with auditory-only methods. By engaging multiple senses, this method can facilitate a deeper and more enduring understanding of the language.

Correcting Common Mistakes: Cutaway views can highlight common pronunciation errors made by learners, such as incorrect tongue placement or lip rounding, offering a direct way to demonstrate and correct these mistakes.

Facilitating Self-Learning: These videos would be an excellent resource for self-learners, providing detailed, practical guidance that can be difficult to obtain outside of a classroom setting or without a personal tutor.

Cultural and Linguistic Immersion: Beyond technical pronunciation, seeing mouth movements can convey nuances of expression and emotion that are integral to conversational speech. This can enhance cultural understanding and the ability to use the language naturally and expressively.

Implementing this concept could involve the use of high-definition video, possibly augmented by 3D animations or models, to provide clear, detailed views of mouth movements from various angles. Such resources would be invaluable not only for language learners but also for speech therapists, linguists, and vocal coaches, among others.

Incorporating cutaway views into language learning materials represents a confluence of educational content, technology, and cognitive science, offering a powerful tool for enhancing language acquisition and communication skills. By making the invisible aspects of speech visible, learners can achieve a more comprehensive and nuanced mastery of language.

I was thinking that there could be one of these delivering each of the characters lines, as a separate video stream with scrolling subtitles

ChatGPT
Incorporating separate video streams for each character's lines, complete with cutaway views showing mouth movements and scrolling subtitles, would be a highly innovative approach to language learning within the context of film or multimedia content. This method could revolutionize how audiences engage with and learn from visual media, offering a multi-dimensional educational experience. Here’s how this setup could function and its potential benefits:

Implementation:
Character-Specific Streams: For each character in a film or video segment, there would be a dedicated stream that focuses on their dialogue. When the character speaks, the stream would display a close-up or cutaway view of the character's mouth, detailing the articulation and movement necessary for each sound and word.

Synchronized Subtitles: Alongside the visual of the mouth movements, scrolling subtitles in the target language (and potentially a translation) would provide textual context for what is being spoken, reinforcing the learning experience by connecting spoken words with their written form.
