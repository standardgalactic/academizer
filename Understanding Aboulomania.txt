Aboulomania (from Greek a��� 'without', and boul�� 'will')[1] is a mental disorder in which the patient displays pathological indecisiveness.[2][3] The term was created in 1883 by the neurologist William Alexander Hammond, who defined it as: ���a form of insanity characterised by an inertness, torpor, or paralysis of the will���.[4][5] It is typically associated with anxiety, stress, depression, and mental anguish, severely affecting one's ability to function socially. In extreme cases, difficulties arising from the disorder can lead to suicide.[6] Although many people are indecisive at times, it is rarely to the extent of obsession.[7]

The part of the brain that is tied to making rational choices, the prefrontal cortex, can hold several pieces of information at any given time.[7] This may quickly overwhelm somebody when trying to make decisions, regardless of the importance of that decision. They may come up with reasons that their decisions will turn out badly, causing them to over-analyze every situation critically in a classic case of paralysis by analysis. Lack of information, valuation difficulty, and outcome uncertainty can become an obsession for those with aboulomania.[8]

Although it is a recognised and diagnosable[9] mental disorder, aboulomania is not recognised by the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental disorders (DSM-5).[10]

Symptoms
Aboulomania is characterised by great indecision and an inability to, or difficulty in, making any kind of choice in a person���s daily life.[11] This significantly affects functioning, specifically the ability to function socially, making it difficult to maintain family and personal relationships.[10][12]

There is a significant overlap between the symptoms of aboulomania and obsessive compulsive disorder (OCD).[13] With pathological doubt and significant impairment in decision-making being prevalent across both conditions.[13] Many OCD patients can be considered to have a form of pathological indecision,[citation needed] which is also displayed in aboulomania patients.[2][3]

Some aboulomania symptoms are:

Lack of self confidence[10][11]
Avoiding spending time alone[14]
High levels of uncertainty and anxiety[15]
Anticipatory anxiety regarding decisions, usually leading to mental blocks[11]
Avoiding personal responsibility, e.g making decisions[12]
Decision-making process takes a long time[citation needed]
Decision-making process is extremely difficult[citation needed]
Difficulty functioning independently or making decisions without support from others[6][16]
Over-analysis of situations[16]
Dysfunctional post-decision behaviour, e.g worry, re-assessing of decisions[8][16]
Obsessing over inability to make decisions[15]
Some level of indecision exists within normal psychopathology,[7][17] and it has been found that having extensive choice is demotivating to consumers in supermarkets, who prefer limited-choice contexts.[18] However, this indecision is rarely to the extent of obsession.[7] According to the DSM-IV definition, when symptoms become clinically significant, and associated with distress and impairment to the functioning of the individual, they can be considered part of a mental disorder.[19] When the symptoms are relating to indecision this disorder may be aboulomania.[6] It has also been found that indecision is a common characteristic in mental disorders like depression,[20] and is associated with OCD tendencies,[21] conditions both associated with aboulomania.[6]

Risk factors
The underlying causes of aboulomania have not been empirically proven.[16] The factors contributing towards the development of aboulomania are likely a combination of both environmental factors, taking place during development, and biological factors.[6]

Biological factors
The pre-frontal cortex of the brain, the cortex responsible for decision-making and making conscious decisions,[15] may be directly involved in the condition.[11][16] It has been found that human patients with damage to their pre-frontal cortex exhibit poor decision-making.[22] It is speculated that individuals suffering from aboulomania have an irregularly functioning pre-frontal cortex, and so develop and obsession with over-analysis and outcome uncertainty regarding decisions.[23]

o
Environmental factors
Some researchers believe that parenting styles can lead to the development of aboulomania, especially among individuals susceptible to the disorder due to biological factors.[6][15] Parenting styles that are overprotective or authoritarian, as well as over-involvement or intrusive behaviours from the primary caregiver, can encourage dependence in the child.[14][15] Parents will be seen to reward loyalty[citation needed] and reject or punish the child���s attempts to gain independence.[6] This creates significant doubts and uncertainty in the individual regarding their ability to function independently of others.[6][15] Parental over-involvement may arise from the caregiver���s own dependency needs, which are fulfilled by the child���s dependence.[6][12][14]

Individuals with aboulomania have often been socially humiliated by others in their developmental years.[12] Bullying among children is broadly associated with adverse mental health outcomes,[24] such as developing depression and anxiety,[25] conditions both closely associated with aboulomania.[6] Aboulomania development may also be triggered by the shame, insecurities and lack of self-trust which arise from the bullying.[16]

The child develops suspicions that they are incapable of living autonomously, which are then reinforced by the parenting style and behaviours of their primary caregiver.[6] In response to these feelings, they portray a helplessness that elicits caregiving behaviour by others in their lives.[6][12]

Diagnosis and treatment
For the diagnosis of aboulomania, a mental professional must initially eliminate physical illness or neurological damage as an explanation for the patient���s symptoms.[15] To do this, the medical professional must perform physical examinations and a complete medical history.[6][15] Then the patient can be referred to a psychiatrist who assesses the prevalence of aboulomania using a clinical interview relating to their symptoms.[6]

There are currently no laboratory tests to diagnose aboulomania specifically.[6] But, there are assessment tools available to psychiatrists to aid in the evaluation of aboulomania:[12]

The Minnesota Multiphasic Personality Inventory (MMPI)[6][12][15][16]
The Millon Clinical Multiaxal Inventory - Fourth Edition (MCMI-IV)[6][12][15][16]
The Rorschach Psychodiagnostic Test[6][12]
The Thematic Apperception Test (TAT)[6][12][15][16]
Psychotherapy is the preferred method for treating aboulomania, to reduce the adverse effects of patients��� symptoms, which may be similar to those of people suffering from OCD, anxiety or depression.[6][13] Therapy can be used to help the patient become more independent, one method for this may be assertiveness training to help develop self-confidence.[6][16]

Medication can also be used to treat patients with aboulomania if it is comorbid with other mental disorders, such as depression or anxiety.[6]

Criticisms
The majority of credible sources used are not specific to aboulomania but have been related to a specific aspect of the mental disorder. For example, the book ���Preventing Bullying Through Science, Policy, and Practice���[24] which was connected to the impacts of childhood upbringing on the later development of aboulomania.

This is a detailed article about aboulomania. The information provided seems to cover a wide range of topics related to the disorder, including its symptoms, risk factors, diagnosis and treatment, and some criticisms related to the study and classification of the disorder.
The detailed descriptions of the symptoms and factors that contribute to aboulomania provide a good understanding of what it is and how it affects people's lives. For instance, the discussion about the pre-frontal cortex and its role in decision-making gives some insight into the biological underpinnings of the disorder. Likewise, the section on environmental factors such as parenting styles and social humiliation in formative years provides a clear picture of the various influences that can contribute to the development of this condition.
It's also interesting to note the overlap between aboulomania and other mental health disorders such as OCD and depression, which provides additional context for understanding this condition. It can also help clinicians identify potential comorbid conditions that might influence the course of treatment.
The criticism section adds value to the article by highlighting the fact that much of the existing research about aboulomania is not specific to the disorder but is instead extrapolated from studies of related mental health conditions. This is a common issue in many areas of psychological research and can limit our understanding of unique conditions like aboulomania.

Ok well I think it sounds complicated. There are all kinds of reasons why someone might not be willing or able to take certain actions, it might be lack of funds, lack of support, risk mitigation, deontological and objectivist considerations, lack of priviledged access, communication skills, comprehension. It does sound a lot like learned helplessness, apathy, laziness, or depression.

You're correct that human behavior is complex and there can be a myriad of factors contributing to someone's inability or unwillingness to take certain actions. However, aboulomania is a specific mental health disorder characterized by extreme, pathological indecisiveness. While some symptoms may overlap with those of conditions like learned helplessness, apathy, laziness, or depression, it's essential to understand that these are distinct conditions.
In the case of aboulomania, the indecisiveness is typically beyond what one might experience due to ordinary circumstances or factors you mentioned like lack of funds, risk mitigation, ethical considerations, or other situational constraints. It is a chronic, debilitating condition that affects a person's daily functioning.
For example, someone experiencing learned helplessness might give up trying to influence their environment due to past failures, while someone with depression might lack the energy or motivation to make decisions due to feelings of hopelessness or sadness. In contrast, a person with aboulomania might be overwhelmed by the decision-making process itself, finding it impossible to make a choice even when they have the resources, motivation, and ability to do so.
While conditions like learned helplessness, apathy, laziness, or depression might respond to interventions targeting the underlying causes (e.g., changing one's environment, improving motivation, or addressing mood), treatment for aboulomania might need to focus specifically on improving decision-making skills and reducing anxiety around choices.
Still, it's important to note that mental health diagnoses are complicated and often overlap, and a thorough assessment by a mental health professional is needed to ensure accurate diagnosis and appropriate treatment.

Abstract
Depression in bipolar disorder has long been thought to be a state characterized by mental inactivity. However, recent research demonstrates that patients with bipolar disorder engage in rumination, a form of self-focused repetitive cognitive activity, in depressed as well as in manic states. While rumination has long been associated with depressed states in major depressive disorder, the finding that patients with bipolar disorder ruminate in manic states is unique to bipolar disorder and challenges explanations put forward for why people ruminate. We review the research on rumination in bipolar disorder and propose that rumination in bipolar disorder, in both manic and depressed states, reflects executive dysfunction. We also review the neurobiology of bipolar disorder and recent neuroimaging studies of rumination, which is consistent with our hypothesis that the tendency to ruminate reflects executive dysfunction in bipolar disorder. Finally, we relate the neurobiology of rumination to the neurobiology of emotion regulation, which is disrupted in bipolar disorder.

Introduction
Bipolar disorder is characterized by episodes of mania or hypomania, with or without one or more episode(s) of depression. By recent estimates, it affects between 1 and 2.5% of the general population in the United States [1]. Although mania/hypomania is the distinguishing feature of bipolar disorder, recurrent depressive episodes constitute the most frequent and functionally debilitating, unresolved aspect of the illness for individuals with bipolar disorder [2,3]. For example, over their lifetime, patients with bipolar disorder experience many more depressive episodes than manic or hypomanic episodes and spend longer amounts of time depressed than manic or hypomanic [4,5]. They are also more likely to consult a physician or psychiatrist for depression rather than for mania [6]. Likewise, depressive episodes are associated with comparatively greater occupational and psychosocial disruption then manic/hypomanic episodes. This includes impairments at work [6,7] as well as disruptions of patients' family and social life [6]. Unfortunately, despite the advancements in pharmacotherapy and the emergence of adjunctive psychosocial treatments, the diagnosis and management of bipolar depression remain significant challenges [8,9].

Melancholic depression in bipolar disorder
One of the earliest observations about bipolar depression is that it is more likely to be a melancholic depression. According to DSM-IV, the melancholic subtype is a depressed state characterized by anhedonia, excessive weight loss, psychomotor agitation or retardation, insomnia, worsening of symptoms in the morning, early morning awakening and excessive guilt. Although operational definitions of melancholia have varied over the years and across diagnostic systems (DSM III [10], DSMIII-R [11], Research Diagnostic Criteria [12], the World Health Organization Depression Scale [13], the Newcastle Scale - Versions I and II [13,14], Hamilton Depression Rating Scale [15]; see [16] for a review), the one consistent feature across the various definitions has been that of psychomotor retardation [16], described as a slowed or decreased rate of movement and/or speech.

In one of the early studies of the phenomenology of depressed states, Dunner and colleagues [17] found that in the midst of a depressive phase, inpatients with bipolar I disorder showed significantly less attention to personal appearance and exhibited greater psychomotor slowing than inpatients with major depressive disorder (MDD). Similarly, in a study looking at melancholic depression in patients who met criteria for melancholic depression based on three different definitions, including DSM-III, the rate of bipolar disorder was significantly higher than unipolar depression, regardless of the definition of melancholia employed [18]. They also found that melancholia was most clearly distinguished by psychomotor disturbance. Likewise, in a study by Mitchell and colleagues [19] that compared bipolar I disorder patients with patients with MDD, patients with bipolar disorder were found to be more likely to have psychomotor retardation and atypical features (such as hypersomnia and leaden paralysis) than depressed patients with MDD.

The generally held belief that patients with bipolar disorder (in particular bipolar I disorder) are more likely to experience a melancholic depression characterized by psychomotor retardation than patients with MDD, as well as the research showing that melancholic depression is more common in bipolar I disorder, has led to the notion, among clinicians, that there is a corresponding mental slowing as well [20,21]. However, there have been no studies to suggest that patients with bipolar disorder are less mentally active. The notion that there is mental slowing in bipolar depression may also be, in part, a contrast to the large body of evidence that points to an active mind in major depressive disorder, in the form of rumination.

Rumination in major depressive disorder
Major depressive disorder (MDD), sometimes referred to as unipolar depression, is characterized by one or more episodes of depression, without any episodes of mania or hypomania. Thus, it is nosologically distinguished from bipolar disorder by the absence of hypomanic or manic episodes. One feature of MDD which has received considerable attention is the tendency to ruminate [22], that is responding to negative affect or depressed mood by focusing on self and symptoms of distress, without actively engaging in active problem solving [23].

Rumination represents a behavioral and attentional style of responding to negative affect or depressed mood. Thus, rumination is distinguished from such problems as indecisiveness, as well as a set of recurrent thoughts about death and suicide. Similarly, rumination is distinguished from dysfunctional attitudes, which are a set of general beliefs about the self, world and future which are negatively biased, as opposed to a means of responding to a negative affective state. In fact, dysfunctional attitudes are thought to be present in individuals at risk for depression when they are euthymic (that is, not in a negative affective state).

By the same token, rumination is also distinguished from negative automatic thoughts, which refers to a set of thoughts with distorted negative content. As Nolen-Hoeksema originally pointed out, patient's ruminative thoughts may often in fact be realistic rather than distorted (for example, "I can't complete my work on time.") These distinct features of rumination were demonstrated in early studies of rumination in which participants were asked to state their responses to prompts in a rumination induction paradigm developed by Nolen-Hoeksema and colleagues [24]. While it might be argued that yet another difference between rumination and automatic thoughts is that there seems to be a volitional component to a ruminative response style, whereas negative automatic thoughts seem less volitional, such a characterization is oversimplified. As discussed later, the cognitive underpinnings of rumination suggest that while a ruminative response style may start off as seemingly volitional, its perpetuation may not be volitional.

The tendency to ruminate is highly correlated to depressed mood (see [22] for a review). To date, much of the research on rumination has been carried out on individuals with dysphoria and patients with MDD [22]. Early studies on rumination found that rumination can maintain or even worsen depressed mood [25,26]. Additionally, the tendency to ruminate predicts the likelihood to go on to develop a first major depressive episode following a stressor [23], as well as a worse prognosis in patients with major depression. The tendency to ruminate was found to be predictive of higher levels of depressed mood at discharge and follow-up after hospitalization in a group of inpatients with MDD [27]. Studies on the phenomenology of rumination reveal that it is a repetitive and persistent phenomenon that is difficult to stop and maladaptive [28-30]. To date, there are no studies examining whether rumination is more prevalent in certain types of depression (for example, excited depression or melancholic depression); however, such research might illuminate differences in the phenomenology of mood states in different types of depression.

Rumination is related to a negative self-concept in individuals with major depression. In fact, in the course of their research on rumination, Nolen-Hoeksema and Morrow [31] developed a rumination induction task, which consists of self-focused but neutral statements, (for example, "think about the sensations in your body"). When healthy normal controls are asked to engage in the task, they do not show any changes in mood. However, when depressed individuals are asked to perform the same task, they report maintenance or even worsening of depressed mood [31]. Presumably, self-focus promoting statements activate negative self-schemata, which trigger corresponding negative thoughts associated with maintenance or worsening of mood in depressed patients, thereby creating a vicious cycle of increased self-focus, negative thoughts and depressed mood.

Studies of negative thoughts and beliefs as assessed by two widely used and well validated measures, the Automatic Thoughts Questionnaire (ATQ)[32] and Dysfunctional Attitudes Scale (DAS) [33], show that negative automatic thoughts and dysfunctional attitudes, often related to the self, are elevated in depressed states (ATQ: [32,34-37]; DAS: [33,37-40]). This does not appear to be the case when patients are euthymic (ATQ: [34,37,38]; DAS: [37-40]). A few studies have also found that dysfunctional attitudes interact with negative life events, or stress, to predict depressive symptoms [41,42]. Thus, latent negative self-concepts, when activated, as in rumination, may trigger depressed mood and relapse into depression.

The study titled "Rumination in bipolar disorder: evidence for an unquiet mind" explores the notion of rumination, or self-focused repetitive cognitive activity, in individuals with bipolar disorder. The study challenges the long-standing belief that depression in bipolar disorder is characterized by mental inactivity.
Key points from the study:
Bipolar Disorder
: Patients with bipolar disorder frequently experience depressive episodes, which have significant functional implications and represent unresolved aspects of the illness. These depressive episodes in bipolar disorder are often characterized as melancholic depression, marked by anhedonia, psychomotor agitation or retardation, insomnia, and excessive guilt. The study indicates that while physical retardation is commonly observed, there is no evidence that mental activity slows down.
Rumination in Bipolar Disorder
: The study puts forth that patients with bipolar disorder engage in rumination in both manic and depressed states, which is unique to this disorder.
Rumination in Major Depressive Disorder (MDD)
: The tendency to ruminate is a notable feature of MDD, characterized by focusing on self and symptoms of distress without active problem-solving. Rumination can maintain or even worsen depressed mood, predict the likelihood of developing a major depressive episode following a stressor, and is associated with a worse prognosis in patients with major depression.
Hypothesis and Neurobiology
: The authors propose that rumination in bipolar disorder, both during manic and depressive states, might reflect executive dysfunction. They also discuss the neurobiology of bipolar disorder and recent neuroimaging studies of rumination, which support this hypothesis. Furthermore, they relate the neurobiology of rumination to the neurobiology of emotion regulation, which is disrupted in bipolar disorder.
The findings from this study help to challenge traditional beliefs about bipolar disorder and deepen our understanding of rumination's role in mental illnesses. It could potentially lead to better diagnostic strategies and targeted interventions for people with bipolar disorder.

Negative self-concept in bipolar disorder
There is an emerging literature documenting persistent negative self-concepts (schemata) in individuals with bipolar disorder as well. In one study, using the ATQ and DAS, Hollon et al. [37] found that regardless of nosology (MDD, bipolar disorder, substance induced depression), among patients who were currently depressed, scores on both the ATQ and DAS were higher than in other clinical and control groups. Additionally, the ATQ covaried directly with levels of depression as measured by the Beck Depression Inventory (BDI). In a study directly comparing scores on the DAS between patients with bipolar disorder and patients with MDD, Jones and colleagues [43] found that, when current levels of depression were taken into account, there was no difference on scores on the DAS between the two groups. More recently Scott and Pope [44] also found that patients with MDD and bipolar disorder did not differ significantly on overall scores on the DAS. The finding that scores on the DAS and ATQ do not differ between patients with MDD and bipolar disorder suggests that self-concept in depressed states in both disorders is equally negative.

Consistent with this, Reilly-Harrington et al. [45] found patients with bipolar disorder and MDD performed similarly on a Self-Referent Information Processing Task [46] that consisted of a battery of four tasks which tap into self-attributes. Both groups performed the tasks in a manner consistent with a negative self-concept.

Additionally, research on self-esteem suggests that patients with bipolar disorder and major depression demonstrate similar low levels of self-esteem. In their study comparing patients with bipolar disorder and MDD on the DAS, Scott and Pope [44] also used the Rosenberg Self-Esteem Questionnaire (SEQ; [47]). The SEQ is a measure of trait self-esteem consisting of five negative and five positive statements (corresponding to negative and positive self-esteem respectively), which participants rate on a 1 to 4 scale. They found that patients with bipolar disorder and MDD did not differ significantly on overall scores on the SEQ. Similarly, in the Jones and colleagues study [43], when current levels of depression were taken into account; there was no difference on scores on the SEQ between depressed patients with bipolar disorder and depressed patients with MDD, and both patient groups had significantly lower scores on the SEQ than control participants.

Unique to bipolar disorder, scores on the DAS are elevated in patients with bipolar disorder during the manic phase as well as the depressed phase. Goldberg and colleagues [48] compared scores on the DAS in patients with bipolar disorder who were manic, patients with MDD who were depressed, and controls. They found that while patients with MDD, who were currently depressed, had the highest scores on the DAS, patients with bipolar disorder who were manic, had significantly higher scores on the DAS than healthy controls.

As in MDD, scores on the ATQ and DAS do not appear elevated when patients with bipolar disorder are in remission. For example, in the study by Hollon and colleagues [37], they found that scores on the ATQ and DAS were not elevated compared to controls, in patients with bipolar disorder who were in remission. Likewise, in a study by Lex and colleagues [49] investigating cognitive styles in patients with bipolar disorder in full remission, there were no significant differences on scores on the DAS and ATQ between patients with bipolar disorder who were in remission and normal controls.

Finally, similar to patients with MDD, negative self-concept or schemata seem to predict relapse into mania and depression in patients with bipolar disorder. In the study by Reilly-Harrington and colleagues [45], scores on the DAS interacted with the number of negative life events to predict increases in depressive, as well as manic, symptoms. Depressed patients with bipolar disorder, who possessed greater dysfunctional attitudes and experienced more negative life events, showed worsening in their mood symptoms, both depressive and manic symptoms.

Rumination in bipolar disorder
While the bulk of the research on rumination has been conducted in individuals with major depression, given the research showing negative self-concept/schemata in bipolar disorder and the role of rumination or self-focus in sustaining depressed mood one might expect that depressed patients with bipolar disorder engage in ruminative thinking, similar to patients with MDD. Indeed, this is what Johnson et al. [50] found in a recent study looking at the tendency to ruminate in individuals with bipolar disorder, MDD and normal controls. They used the Response Styles Questionnaire (RSQ; [51]), which is a measure of the tendency to engage in ruminative responses when feeling depressed, and found that both individuals with MDD and bipolar disorder endorsed heightened rumination in response to negative affect, compared to normal controls.

Consistent with this, van der Gucht et al. [52] found that the tendency to ruminate was highly correlated with depressive symptoms, (as assessed by the Hamilton Depression Rating Scale; HDRS), in patients with bipolar disorder. In a recent study, in our group with patients with bipolar disorder, using the RSQ, we also found that patients with bipolar disorder, who are depressed, show a greater tendency to ruminate, when compared to levels previously reported in normal controls [53].

Given the repetitive and persistent nature of ruminative thinking, its presence in depressed states in patients with bipolar disorder is contrary to the widely held belief that depression in bipolar disorder is characterized by mental slowing, decreased mental activity, or a relative dearth of thought. Early studies of rumination in unipolar depressed states, in which participants were asked to state their thoughts in response to the prompts on the rumination task developed by Nolen-Hoeksema and colleagues, demonstrate that individuals who ruminate are mentally quite active, with numerous thoughts, albeit with a negative bias [24]. Patients with bipolar disorder in depressed states ruminate and, as such, are mentally quite active, suggesting an unquiet mind in depressed states in bipolar disorder as well.

Notably, melancholia and rumination are not necessarily contrasting phenomena. As reviewed above, various definitions of melancholia exist, but generally these definitions, including the current DSM-IV definition, encompass primarily physical symptoms (for example, psychomotor disturbance). Thus, cognitive states in melancholia are not well characterized. It is possible, given the greater depressive symptom load in melancholic depression and the correlation between rumination and depressive symptom load, that rumination is prevalent among individuals afflicted with melancholia. Thus, rumination and melancholia are not necessarily contrasting phenomena, and, in fact, it is likely that rumination is a key feature of melancholia, not previously described.

What appears to be unique to bipolar disorder is that studies of rumination in bipolar disorder reveal that not only do individuals with bipolar disorder ruminate in response to negative affect in depressed states, they ruminate in response to positive affect as well. In the study by Johnson et al. [50], individuals with bipolar disorder endorsed ruminating in response to positive affect as well as negative affect, albeit with a more positive focus. Using the Response to Positive Affect Questionnaire [54] which assesses tendencies in responses to positive affect, Johnson and colleagues found that individuals with bipolar disorder, who were hypomanic, endorsed a tendency to focus on positive affective experiences and positive self-qualities. Thus, patients with bipolar disorder engage in a positive ruminative style in response to positive affect in a hypomanic state, as well as a negative ruminative style in response to negative affect, in a depressed state. Notably, positive rumination is conceptually different from grandiosity, which is defined as an inflated sense of self-esteem or believing that one has special powers, spiritual connections or religious relationships. Ruminative thoughts of a positive nature may often be realistic (for example, "I did a good job on a project at work last week", which describes a positive affective experience that is reality based). Additionally, positive rumination is distinguished from flight of ideas by the fact that the content of positive ruminations is organized around positive affective experiences and qualities, and not random associations. Studies which record the content of positive ruminations, as Nolen-Hoeksema and colleagues have done with negative rumination [24], are needed to provide empirical support for these distinctions.

Surprisingly, the tendency to engage in rumination to negative affect may also be associated with hypomania. In studies of college sample students [55,56], scores on the RSQ are found to be positively correlated with hypomanic traits (as assessed by the Eckblad and Chapman's Hypomanic Personality Scale; HPS [57]). Individuals who have a tendency to focus on their symptoms of distress and negative self-qualities also possess more hypomanic traits. Notably, in another study, van der Gucht et al. [52] did not find a correlation between rumination (as assessed by the RSQ) and manic traits (as assessed by the Bech-Rafaelson mania scale [58]) in patients with bipolar disorder.

Psychological accounts of why patients with bipolar disorder ruminate
Given the role of rumination in persistence of negative mood, the question arises, why do depressed patients ruminate? One account that has been put forward to explain rumination in unipolar depression by Papageorgiou and Wells [28] is that rumination is a coping strategy. Papageorgiou and Wells found that patients identified advantages as well as disadvantages to rumination, suggesting that they engage in rumination in part because of a perceived benefit from rumination. The advantages cited by patients included a sense of improved understanding of their depression and the causes of their depression, and a sense of control over their symptoms and problem solving.

This account is likely applicable to patients with bipolar disorder who are depressed. They may engage in rumination for reasons similar to their MDD counterparts. However, such an account does not explain why rumination has been associated with hypomania in patients with bipolar disorder as well. One possibility that has been put forward to account for this finding [55] invokes the age old idea of the manic defense to depression. On this account, the hypomania/mania is a coping strategy just like rumination, so the correlation between hypomania and rumination reflects that they are both coping strategies used by patients with bipolar disorder who are struggling with depression. Support for this account comes from a recent study by Goldberg and colleagues [48] showing that patients with bipolar disorder in a manic phase endorse negative core beliefs, suggesting that the mania may be a means of coping with the negative core beliefs. Another account is based on research that patients with bipolar disorder generally have higher expectations [59] and are goal attainment focused [60], but when depressed, have greater difficulty realizing those expectations and goals. The account proposes that this difficulty leads to a failure to achieve those expectations and goals in depressed states, which in turn may lead to negative self-appraisal and rumination. A final related hypothesis explaining the link between the tendency to ruminate and mania in bipolar disorder is rooted in the possibility that individuals with mania may have experienced more failures, as well as destructive complications, as a result of their mania (as opposed to failures due to their depression). According to this account [61], hypomania/mania may have led to more failures and in turn may lead to a greater likelihood to resort to self-blame, negative self-appraisal and rumination.

One problem with these three psychological accounts is the finding from Johnson and colleagues (2008) that patients with bipolar disorder engage in positive rumination (that is, positive self-appraisal) in response to positive affect in a hypomanic state. Similarly, Eisner and colleagues [62] found that there is a tendency to engage in positive generalization, similar to positive rumination, in response to successes. An account of why patients with bipolar disorder ruminate must take into account why they ruminate in response to both negative and positive affect.

The text discusses various aspects of negative self-concept and rumination in patients with bipolar disorder.
In terms of self-concept, studies have indicated that patients with bipolar disorder often exhibit persistent negative self-concepts or schemata, similar to those observed in patients with major depressive disorder (MDD). Tools like the Dysfunctional Attitudes Scale (DAS) and the Automatic Thoughts Questionnaire (ATQ) reveal that, when currently depressed, these patients score higher than other clinical and control groups. However, the scores on these scales do not appear elevated when patients are in remission, suggesting the impact of the disorder's mood phases on self-concept.
Additionally, research has found that negative self-concept may predict relapses into both depressive and manic states in bipolar disorder. When individuals with more dysfunctional attitudes and more negative life events experience worsening mood symptoms, it highlights the role of negative self-concept in driving the severity of bipolar disorder.
Regarding rumination, the text suggests that patients with bipolar disorder are prone to ruminative thinking, similar to those with MDD. This involves frequently contemplating negative thoughts, experiences, or feelings. The tendency to ruminate is positively correlated with depressive symptoms in patients with bipolar disorder, contradicting the common belief that depression in bipolar disorder is characterized by mental slowing or reduced thought activity.
Intriguingly, the text also proposes that individuals with bipolar disorder ruminate in response to positive affect as well, particularly during hypomanic states. They engage in a positive ruminative style, focusing on positive affective experiences and positive self-qualities. This "positive rumination" is different from grandiosity (an inflated sense of self-esteem) or flight of ideas (rapid shifting between unconnected thoughts).
Several psychological accounts are presented to explain why patients with bipolar disorder ruminate. One suggests rumination as a coping strategy, providing a perceived benefit or sense of control. Another relates rumination with the concept of the "manic defense" to depression, in which hypomania/mania serve as a coping strategy for negative core beliefs. Other theories tie rumination to the gap between high expectations and reality during depressive phases, or as a response to failures and destructive complications brought about by manic episodes. Finally, an account must be developed to explain why patients with bipolar disorder ruminate in response to both negative and positive affect.

The tendency to ruminate in bipolar disorder and executive dysfunction
We propose that the link between the tendency to ruminate in manic and depressed states in bipolar disorder reflects executive dysfunction in bipolar disorder. Research on neuropsychological functioning in bipolar disorder reveals deficits in several cognitive domains, including attention, learning and memory, and executive functioning [63-66]. The executive dysfunction seen in bipolar disorder is present in euthymic, depressed and manic states, suggesting that the executive dysfunction is not state specific, but rather trait-like. In one study, investigating neuropsychological functioning in bipolar patients in manic, depressed and euthymic mood states, Martinez-Aran et al. [66] found that regardless of mood state, all patients with bipolar disorder showed impaired functioning on tests of executive functioning, including the Wisconsin Card Sort Task (WCST) and Stroop Color and Word Interference task. While a more recent study calls into question the presence of executive dysfunction in euthymic states in bipolar disorder, they nonetheless found a trend towards executive dysfunction in patients with bipolar disorder who are euthymic [67]. It is possible that the executive dysfunction present in patients with bipolar disorder in euthymic states is exacerbated in mania and depression.

In fact, in studies using tests of executive functioning, including attentional set-shifting [68,69], planning ability [70] and decision making [69,70], researchers consistently find deficits in executive functioning in mania. And the finding by Martinez-Aran et al. [66] of executive dysfunction in depressed states in bipolar disorder is consistent with the literature showing executive dysfunction in depressed states in MDD (see [71] for a review). Of note, many of the tasks used to assess executive functioning are tasks which incorporate multiple executive processes (for example, the WCST incorporates shifting attention as well as inhibition), so a fine grain approach to executive functioning as suggested by Miyake et al. [72] is not currently possible. However, such an approach would be invaluable at more precisely identifying particular executive deficits in bipolar disorder. This highlights the need for research into specific executive processes in bipolar disorder.

There is some initial evidence that the tendency to ruminate is associated with executive dysfunction. In a study by Davis and Nolen-Hoeksema [73], individuals with a tendency to ruminate were found to demonstrate perseverative tendencies and failures to maintain adaptive cognitive sets on the WCST. Similarly, Watkins and Brown [74] found that depressed patients who underwent a rumination induction and were asked to perform a random number generation task showed failures of inhibitory executive control compared to depressed participants who underwent distraction, and non-depressed participants. More recently, Whitmer and Banich [75] found that individuals with a tendency to ruminate have trouble inhibiting mental representations of previous task demands when they switch their attention to new task demands. Thus, rumination seems to be associated with executive dysfunction, particularly inhibitory executive control. Of course, given the dearth of studies, further research into executive functioning and rumination is much needed.

Taken together, the evidence for executive dysfunction in bipolar disorder and the relationship between rumination and executive dysfunction suggests that the tendency to ruminate may be symptomatic of executive dysfunction in bipolar disorder, specifically inhibitory executive dysfunction. Patients with bipolar disorder may experience an exacerbation in executive dysfunction when manic or depressed, which may lead to a tendency to ruminate because of a failure to inhibit self-focused thoughts of a positive or negative nature. This possibility invites investigation into the effects of mood states on executive functioning and rumination in bipolar disorder.

Research suggests that patients with bipolar disorder tend to ruminate during both manic and depressed states, possibly reflecting underlying executive dysfunction. Executive functions are cognitive skills used for planning, problem-solving, and goal-directed behaviors, and studies have indicated that individuals with bipolar disorder may have impairments in these areas, regardless of their current mood state.
Neuropsychological research in bipolar disorder has revealed deficits in multiple cognitive domains, including attention, learning and memory, and executive functioning. Importantly, these deficits seem to be present whether the individual is in a euthymic (non-depressed, non-manic), depressed, or manic state, suggesting that they are trait-like, rather than state-dependent.
Studies using executive functioning tests, such as the Wisconsin Card Sort Task (WCST) and Stroop Color and Word Interference task, have consistently found deficits in mania. Furthermore, depressed states in bipolar disorder have also been associated with executive dysfunction.
There is some evidence that a tendency to ruminate (to repetitively focus on distress and the causes and implications of distress) may be related to these deficits in executive function. For example, individuals who tend to ruminate have been found to demonstrate perseverance and failures to maintain adaptive cognitive sets on the WCST, as well as failures of inhibitory executive control.
The executive dysfunction in bipolar disorder and the relationship between rumination and executive dysfunction suggest that the tendency to ruminate in bipolar disorder may be a symptom of inhibitory executive dysfunction. In other words, individuals with bipolar disorder may have difficulty inhibiting self-focused thoughts of either a positive or negative nature, leading to a tendency to ruminate. Further research is needed to clarify these relationships and to investigate the effects of different mood states on executive functioning and rumination in bipolar disorder.

Overview
Abulia is an illness that usually occurs after an injury to an area or areas of the brain. It���s associated with brain lesions.

While abulia can exist on its own, it���s often found in conjunction with other disorders. These disorders can either be neurological or psychiatric in nature.

Abulia is a widely underdiagnosed condition and is classified by strong apathy. This can result in a lack of motivation, and many with abulia struggle with issues of will, volition, or drive.

Those with abulia experience less motivation despite normal mood, consciousness, and cognition. Someone with abulia has desires, but may struggle to do what���s necessary to accomplish the goals they wish.

Abulia is common but is often confused with other brain-related issues. There are possible treatment options, but it���s important that this condition is diagnosed appropriately in order to receive treatment.

Despite the importance of diagnosis, this condition has been rarely acknowledged. However, in recent years, discussion and research around abulia diagnosis has increased.


Symptoms of abulia
A person with abulia exhibits symptoms that include emotional and behavioral changes. This condition isn���t due to reduced levels of consciousness, attention, or language capacity.

Symptoms can include:

loss of productivity, effort, and initiative
emotional indifference
lack of plans and goals
less or absence of speech or action
lack of emotional responses to important life events
less goal-oriented thoughts
diminished social interest
poor attention
being easily distracted
Those with abulia can usually describe goals, interests, or plans that they have. However, they usually do so in a less extensive way and for a shorter time, showing initial signs of apathy.

Mild cases of abulia are more common than severe ones. It���s often more common in older people with mood disorders, neurological issues, and other conditions. Abulia is often seen as a symptom within a complicated clinical situation.

More research is needed regarding the diagnosis and management of abulia in older adults. This is important because it appears in conjunction with many diseases and disorders related to aging.


Causes of abulia
Abulia is most often caused by an injury to the brain. These injuries are seen mostly in the form of brain lesions.

Motivation is triggered by environmental factors that release neuron signals. When areas of the brain are damaged, these neuron signals don���t function properly. This results in the brain���s inability to register reward. An apathetic response follows.

The common affected areas of the brain include:

basal ganglia
frontal lobes
cingulate gyrus
caudate nucleus
globus pallidus
There���s growing evidenceTrusted Source that suggests that the dysfunction can occur in areas outside of the area of the lesion. These areas are connected to, but outside of, the lesioned brain matter.

Despite that there���s likely more than one neurotransmitter involved, most studies have focused on the role of dopamine in cases of abulia.

One animal studyTrusted Source found that the damage to dopaminergic circuits related to apathy. Researchers think these pathways are what enables us to turn impulse to action.

There are also social, environmental, and biological factors that can affect drive. These factors can induce apathy. They���re not to be confused with the presence of abulia.


Diagnosing abulia
Abulia may be more common than once thought, as it tends to be a widely underdiagnosed condition, often confused with other diseases or disorders. This can result in individuals going untreated for longer periods of time.

This condition is often confused with:

depression
aphasia
dementia
It���s important in the process of diagnosis to rule out conditions that may present apathy as a symptom. As a result, doctors frequently perform thorough neurological and psychosocial exams when apathy is involved to provide a differential diagnosis.

In a survey of British doctorsTrusted Source on the subject of apathy in older adults, less than 50 percent believed abulia was different from depression.

Abulia is indeed a separate diagnosis from depression. Sadness or negative thoughts aren���t attributed to abulia.

Your doctor may order a resting state fcMRI. This test involves undergoing an MRI without being asked to perform specific tasks while the brain is mapped. Other forms of brain imaging such as CT scans can also help diagnose conditions linked with abulia.

Treating abulia
A doctor needs to identify abulia early so that they can help you identify the best treatment options for you.

Treatment options currently include bromocriptine, which has been proven to be effective in lowering apathy.

This treatment is often given in low doses with small increases in dosage over time. You should be monitored by your doctor while taking bromocriptine, due to potential negative side effects, including:

drowsiness
lowered blood pressure
an increase in compulsive behaviors
In a small number of case studies, L-dopa was tested as a potential treatment option. This studyTrusted Source found that the L-dopa successfully treated severe cases of abulia, but the effects of this medication were not long-lasting.

Dopamine medicine could prove helpful, but due to lack of evidence, it���s not generally used. These medications also have a list of side effects that include potential psychotic relapse in people who have experienced episodes of psychosis in the past.

Amphetamines have been shownTrusted Source to increase stimulation-seeking behavior in rats. Human studies for using this drug in cases of abulia still need to be researched.

Conditions associated with abulia
Abulia has been observed in association with:

Huntington���s
Alzheimer���s
mental illnesses
Lewy body dementia
Parkinson���s disease
stroke

What���s the outlook?
Abulia is a condition that can affect your quality of life. Fixing underlying issues that may be linked with abulia is important. This will help your doctor to better identify the best treatment plan for you.

It���s important to seek the help of a medical professional if you or a loved one is experiencing apathy or other symptoms listed above. If you���re concerned about abulia, make sure to mention it to your doctor, as some may not be familiar with the diagnosis.

The cause of abulia is often due to injuries to the brain, particularly brain lesions. Areas commonly affected include the basal ganglia, frontal lobes, cingulate gyrus, caudate nucleus, and globus pallidus. There's a growing understanding that dysfunction can also occur in brain areas that are connected to, but outside of, the damaged brain tissue. Most research to date has focused on the role of dopamine, a neurotransmitter, in abulia.
Abulia is often misdiagnosed or confused with conditions like depression, aphasia, and dementia, leading to individuals going untreated for longer periods. Brain imaging techniques like resting state fcMRI and CT scans can help with diagnosis.
Treatment options for abulia include medications like bromocriptine, which has been shown to reduce apathy. This drug must be taken under close medical supervision due to potential side effects such as drowsiness, lowered blood pressure, and an increase in compulsive behaviors. Other potential treatments such as L-dopa and amphetamines require further research.
Abulia has been associated with several conditions such as Huntington���s, Alzheimer���s, mental illnesses, Lewy body dementia, Parkinson���s disease, and stroke. It can significantly affect quality of life, making early identification and treatment vital.

Generalized anxiety disorder is among the world���s most prevalent psychiatric disorders and often manifests as persistent and difficult to control apprehension. Despite its prevalence, there is no integrative, formal model of how anxiety and anxiety disorders arise. Here, we offer a perspective derived from the free energy principle; one that shares similarities with established constructs such as learned helplessness. Our account is simple: anxiety can be formalized as learned uncertainty. A biological system, having had persistent uncertainty in its past, will expect uncertainty in its future, irrespective of whether uncertainty truly persists. Despite our account���s intuitive simplicity���which can be illustrated with the mere flip of a coin���it is grounded within the free energy principle and hence situates the formation of anxiety within a broader explanatory framework of biological self-organization and self-evidencing. We conclude that, through conceptualizing anxiety within a framework of working generative models, our perspective might afford novel approaches in the clinical treatment of anxiety and its key symptoms.

Learned uncertainty
Nature consists of dynamic and complex systems (Friston, 2010; Zednik, 2011). For a biological system to exist, it must have the capacity to maintain its own boundaries���lest it cannot be distinguished from other systems. A fundamental property of any biological system is therefore the requirement that it can individuate itself from its environment. The free energy principle asserts that to do this, biological systems model external states and themselves within those states (Friston et al., 2006; Friston, 2010). This occurs through a process where the system samples information from outside its boundaries, via its suite of sensory channels, and acts based on that sampled information, under some world or generative model. Ultimately, this is an iterative process in which the nature of what is perceived of the external state (sensory impressions from the world) informs the system���s internal state. Internally, the system then generates a model of the external state of affairs, which informs how the system ought to act on the world. Via action, the system influences its external state, which leads to sensory feedback about the system���s world model���and the ���perception-action��� cycle repeats.

The free energy principle: A primer
The free energy principle describes how biological systems resist dissipation and destruction (Friston et al., 2006; Friston, 2010). Under thermodynamic principles, all systems move toward disorder (Schneider and Kay, 1994; Hirsh et al., 2012). Yet, biological systems resist dissipation and instead maintain themselves in viable states that underwrite their survival (Hirsh et al., 2012; Ramstead et al., 2018). In fact, biological systems restrict themselves to a relatively small set of such ���attractor��� states, the spectrum of which can be thought of as equivalent to homeostasis: a variable number of states within which the system can feasibly sustain its own existence. The crucial insight afforded by the free energy principle is that this process���of continuously moving toward attractor states���is an intrinsic property of biological systems that can be described as emerging via modeling the ���sensed��� world (Friston, 2010; Hirsh et al., 2012). Broadly then, the free energy principle is about how biological systems self-fulfillingly define themselves as systems per se, and in doing so move away from destruction and toward attractor states.

What is free energy?
To ���minimize free energy��� is to minimize error (or surprise) engendered by exchange with the external milieu (including one���s own body). Free energy can be considered a proxy for surprise, where this kind of surprise (a.k.a., self-information) can be read as the (negative logarithm of the) evidence for the system���s model. The system continually minimizes surprise, and in so doing attempts to minimize uncertainty (i.e., expected surprise) in its sensory exchanges with the world. Yet, no model will perfectly capture the external world it is modeling and will therefore have to deal with uncertainty. To be sure, some degree of uncertainty is a requisite for system optimization; otherwise, our internal representation would no longer be amenable to the accommodation of change in a capricious and itinerant world. However, too much uncertainty or error inherently contradicts the system���s goal of restricting itself to its attractor states���those that characterize the kind of thing that it is (Bruineberg and Rietveld, 2014; Badcock et al., 2017, 2019; Bruineberg et al., 2018; Ramstead et al., 2018). The free energy principle thus specifies that free energy must be actively upper bounded to ensure expected surprise (uncertainty) is minimized or model evidence (marginal likelihood) is maximized (Friston, 2010; Ramstead et al., 2018). Free energy is the system���s most accurate estimation as to the uncertainty that exists ���out there,��� and minimizing free energy is akin to minimizing the error in the system���s prediction about the world. To ���minimize free energy��� is thus to maximize precision in the system���s capacity to model its own world. This can be neatly summarized as self-evidencing (Hohwy, 2016).

Models of perception rooted in prediction are generally considered to have stemmed from Helmholtz (1860) notion of unconscious inference. Helmholtz (1860) proposed that we attempt to infer our environment via unconscious cues, and constructivist theorists including those within Jean Piaget���s (developmental schema theory, see Piaget, 2003; Feldman, 2004; Beard, 2013) and George Kelly���s (personal construct psychology, see Kelly, 1955) schools of thought later posited similar notions from the top-down cognitivist perspectives. Variations in earlier schools of thought can be seen throughout literature, with some models having emphasized the conceptual representation of cognition; others focusing on the developmental impact of learning (e.g., models following from Jean Piaget and Lev Vygotsky); and yet others focusing on the state and process changes that occur in one���s mental representation (e.g., MacKay, 1956; Neisser, 1967; Gregory, 1980; Yuille and Kersten, 2006). We focus on the latter of these here, with an emphasis on top-down inferences about one���s environment.

State-based predictive models have evolved over time (McClelland and Rumelhart, 1981; Rao and Ballard, 1999) and are generally considered under the scope of ���predictive processing.��� Predictive processing equates the brain to that of a scientist���it makes observations, collects data from the external environment and generates and updates workable hypotheses based on the current data available (Hohwy, 2013, 2017). From a neuroscientific standpoint, predictive processing recasts the classic idea of the brain as an information processor, specifying instead that top-down and bottom-up neural networks are functionally driven toward signaling prediction and the consequent minimization of prediction error (Friston, 2010; Clark, 2013). Top-down neural activity associated with reentrant loops���those that provide feedback from higher level brain regions to sensory processing areas���are conceptualized as propagating a prediction about a given sensory input, given some high-level representation or prior expectation about its cause. The bottom-up or feed-forward activity associated with sensory input then carries the ensuing prediction error. If the (top-down) prediction sufficiently accounts for the (bottom-up) signal, the error is ���explained away������for example, the signal is attenuated via inhibitory mechanisms (Friston, 2012b; Hohwy, 2013, 2017). If the prediction cannot sufficiently account for the (bottom-up) signal, the error propagates up the hierarchy and the (top-down) predictive model is revised (Friston, 2008; Friston and Kiebel, 2009; Huang and Rao, 2011; Bastos et al., 2012; Alexander and Brown, 2018). Formally, this can be described in terms of Bayesian belief updating, where neuronal message passing involves the reciprocal exchange of top-down predictions and bottom-up prediction errors (Friston et al., 2017). In this way, signals cascading bidirectionally throughout the cortical hierarchy can be thought of as building (hierarchical) generative models about the sensed world.

Predictive processing and the free energy principle
The free energy principle and predictive accounts describe and seek to explain the processes by which the brain functions. Predictive processing can be read as an application of the free energy principle���one that commits to a specific implementation, usually in terms of the predictive coding schemes described earlier. These applications describe the brain as a system that continually models the world in order to understand it. The free energy principle provides a description of the fundamental laws underlying biological systems, whereas predictive processing is more typically leveraged as a process theory for psychology and situated cognition (Friston and Kiebel, 2009; Bogacz, 2017). Simply put, the free energy principle is concerned with systems, whereas predictive processing applies the free energy principle���as a method���to specific systemic and functional hierarchies in the brain.

Though primarily concerned with system dynamics, the free energy principle can be applied to biological phenomena at every scale���from the microscopic to the psychological. At the level of human psychology, belief formation offers a sound illustration: under the free energy principle, ���beliefs��� correspond to probability distributions over external states parameterized by internal representations of those states, which the individual develops based on observing and modeling the world (and themselves within the world, a point we return to later in the section ���Learning Uncertainty���). Belief formation is a useful example, as it allows us to illustrate the synonymity between the free energy principle and predictive processing���predictive processing describes belief formation through the updating and development of priors, in that beliefs are formed via the brain learning about the world based upon prior observations of the world; a classic example being a belief that water quenches thirst is formed based on prior observations that water quenched thirst���or put more precisely, based upon the prediction errors of a generative model that did not predict the thirst quenching consequences of water. As a technical note, while debate centers on how such predictions are optimized (see Bowers and Davis, 2012), generally Bayes��� theorem is considered a formal expression of how predictions are optimized in terms of Bayesian belief updating. This process of belief updating ���just is��� the process of self-evidencing detailed earlier (for the mathematically minded, refer to Friston and Kiebel, 2009; Spratling, 2016; Bogacz, 2017; Sterzer et al., 2018).

The free energy principle and predictive processing are therefore related in how they describe belief formation in terms of learning and perceptual inference���the difference is that the free energy principle provides a principle or ���method��� that underlies and attempts to dissolve disciplinary boundaries (a strength that should not be understated, Friston (2012a, 2019); Rubin et al., 2020). In summary, these approaches together not only explain optimal prediction and model generation but allow us to consider how contextual cues may lead to differing probabilities of a given state or outcome. Crucially, we now consider the outcomes consequent on decisions, choices and action.

Active inference
Cognitive systems are not passive observers of the world. Instead, cognitive agents act and sample the environment to test their predictions about the causes of sensory data. Derived from the free energy principle, active inference describes how agents seek to minimize variational free energy through testing and updating generative models via sequences of actions predicted to result in preferred outcomes (i.e., action policies, see Smith et al., 2022). Active inference assumes that agents carry preferences for what states they prefer to occupy; namely, those that minimize uncertainty or expected surprise, where a surprising state of being is���by definition���aversive (Smith et al., 2022). Action policies and subsequent updating of generative models are thus driven toward the attainment of preferred sensory outcomes, and the avoidance of non-preferred outcomes.

In active inference, agentic preferences over sensory outcomes are typically leveraged as prior predictions, called prior preferences. Insofar as the sensory outcome ultimately diverges from preferred outcomes, this will be surprising (Smith et al., 2022). As agents make decisions about possible action sequences, the agents calibrate the amount of expected surprise that should be generated by one course of action vs. another. Once this calibration is complete, agents can then infer what they are most likely to do. This is sometimes described as planning or control as inference (Attias, 2003; Botvinick and Toussaint, 2012; Millidge, 2019). In this way, preferred outcomes are obtained with action policies via minimizing the expected divergence between preferred sensory outcomes and those anticipated when committing to a particular plan. The key point here is that actions will be chosen based on the agent���s estimation of how likely they are to generate preferred sensory outcomes, which oftentimes is those which are consistent with the agent���s current world model (Smith et al., 2022).

This excerpt from the article is quite dense, but it is discussing the concept of the free energy principle and predictive processing in relation to anxiety. Here is a basic summary of the key points:
Generalized Anxiety Disorder:
The authors propose that anxiety can be understood as "learned uncertainty," which means that a biological system that has experienced persistent uncertainty in the past will expect uncertainty in the future, even if that uncertainty doesn't truly persist.
Free Energy Principle:
This principle suggests that biological systems, such as humans, resist dissipation and destruction. They maintain a relatively narrow set of "attractor" states, which can be thought of as equivalent to homeostasis. The free energy principle describes the process of continuously moving toward these attractor states.
Free Energy:
In the context of this article, free energy is not energy in the traditional sense. Instead, it's the system's most accurate estimate of the uncertainty that exists in the external world. Minimizing free energy means minimizing this estimated uncertainty, or in other words, increasing the precision of the system's internal model of the world.
Predictive Processing:
This concept suggests that the brain works much like a scientist, forming hypotheses based on data from the external environment and updating those hypotheses as new data comes in. This is accomplished through a process of prediction and minimization of prediction error, resulting in an updated internal model of the world.
Active Inference:
This is the idea that cognitive agents act on and sample their environment to test their predictions about the causes of sensory data. Agents strive to minimize their "free energy" (or surprise/uncertainty) by acting in ways that align with their internal models and predictions of the world.
In relation to anxiety, these concepts suggest that a person with Generalized Anxiety Disorder may be constantly expecting uncertainty or surprise based on past experiences, and their actions and perceptions are influenced by this expectation. Their brain's predictive processing and active inference mechanisms may be geared toward minimizing this expected uncertainty, potentially leading to the symptoms associated with anxiety.

Learning uncertainty: Where hierarchical models go wrong
To fully appreciate this process requires appeal to a higher-order level in which the system makes predictions based on hierarchical world models. In active inference, hierarchical models describe the correspondence between different levels of representations (i.e., Bayesian beliefs) that an agent may hold about the world. These are often referred to as deep temporal models (Friston et al., 2018; Smith et al., 2019a,b). Such schemes demarcate between ���level 1��� and ���level 2��� models of the world, where level 2 models store posteriors inferred by level 1 models. What this means is that level 2 models evolve over slower timescales than level 1 and are hence more impervious to current sensory data. An intuitive example is provided by Friston et al. (2018), where an agent reads a passage of text. In this example, a level 1 model makes an inference about individual words being read, while level 2 models infer the overall direction of the text passage. This type of hierarchical model explains how agents infer state transitions over nested time sequences (Smith et al., 2022), in that they consider accumulated experiences in inferring a current context, and how current contextual states correspond to higher levels of the model.

Returning to our example, suppose we now have one hundred observations cataloged into 10 sets of 10. Now imagine the agent continues to observe in each sequence that the coin lands on heads an unpredictable number of times. In this case, the agent is offered consistent sensory feedback that their model of the world is not sufficient for reliably inducing preferred observations, but not wholly insufficient, either (keeping in mind that they are still expecting 9 out of 10 heads). Over the entire sequence of flips (i.e., the 10 set of 10 flips), the second level of the model ���learns��� that action policies are not able to reliably bring about preferred sensory outcomes but are also not insufficient to the extent that the agent must not exhibit wholesale change to their action policies. If the agent consistently observes feedback that their model is not sufficient for reliably inducing preferred sensory outcomes, they will be in a position where the second level of their model is not all that informative for inferring the hidden causes of current sensory states (i.e., observations at level 1). Instead, they are left in a position where they are neither sure nor unsure on the utility of their action policies. This, we argue, is a starting point for the proliferation of anxiety disorder. We can understand this via reference to Bayes rule: priors update over time in accordance with new information, from which predictions are made about what will be subsequently observed (refer to Westbury, 2010; Friston, 2012b; Mathys et al., 2014). Anxiety disorder in this example therefore forms via Bayesian learning: the system optimally predicts that there is uncertainty, and that their action policies cannot reliably induce preferred sensory states.

To be precise, momentary anxiety can be thought of as generated via high entropy probability distributions within a single perception-action cycle, whereas anxious ���beliefs��� form based upon low entropy probability distributions of those ���observations of observations��� (i.e., meta observations, or level 2 of the hierarchical model), the composition of which are more uncertain probability distributions. This account shares similarities with several previous frameworks. For example, Chekroud (2015) suggested the formation of depression can be Bayes optimal (i.e., learned helplessness), where depressive beliefs form despite a match between information sampled and the system���s empirical priors (Chekroud, 2015; Holmes and Nolte, 2019). An agent with learned helplessness has learnt that, irrespective of their particular action policies, they cannot resolve their uncertainty���no matter what they do, they will consistently find themselves in states that depart from their preferred sensory outcomes (Seligman, 1972). Learned uncertainty departs from learned helplessness in the sense that, in the former, the (bayes optimal) agent does not have sufficient evidence (i.e., useful sensory data) to conclude helplessness but rather has modeled inconsistency in their successes in obtaining preferred sensory outcomes. The key point is that, in the case of learned helplessness, there exists certainty inherent in an agent reliably finding themself in states opposed to those they prefer.

More recently, consider Linson and Friston���s (2019) account of the formation of PTSD. They posit that PTSD is characterized by a reduced confidence in one���s ability to resolve prediction errors, given the failure to resolve these errors when experiencing a traumatic event (Linson and Friston, 2019). In the case of anxiety, we suggest that the traumatic event(s) is not necessary for its formation, merely a sufficient presence of uncertainty (or prediction error, under Linson and Friston���s model). Via this process, the organism learns an ���inability��� to resolve prediction errors. In this way, anxiety formation is approximately analogous to PTSD formation, but without the accompanying high precision gleaned from experiencing a traumatic event (and hence learning its own catastrophic failure to resolve prediction errors).

We suggest generalized anxiety forms because of the organism���s inability to internally model information, given some initial state of sufficient mismatch in the perception action cycle. In essence, over time, the system models its own priors and action policies, in a Bayesian optimal way, as not adequately updating in a way that alters the probability of a future outcome. In so doing, anxious priors��� form���beliefs pertaining to the uncertainty in the system���s world model and action policies bear disproportionate weight on top-down processes responsible for model formation, and the agent iteratively perceives the outside world as if it were still uncertain, even when it becomes more certain. Despite this, as specified by the free energy principle, the system is driven toward minimizing free energy. The biological system therefore expects that its own modeling and action policies are neither sufficient nor insufficient���and yet still necessary���and generates the belief that the inherent uncertainty will persist across time (see Dickstein et al., 2010; Grupe and Nitschke, 2013; Fonzo and Etkin, 2016; Kannis-Dymand et al., 2020; LaFreniere and Newman, 2020). External uncertainty therefore generates internal uncertainty about external certainty, along with the necessary action policies that would resolve it. Because this occurs in a Bayesian optimal way, model precision increases, despite clearly not being adaptive under novel environmental conditions where certainty may now exist���and learned uncertainty results.

This is a detailed account of how anxiety disorders could be explained in the context of hierarchical Bayesian models of the brain. The key idea is that uncertainty in these models could be the starting point for anxiety disorders. Here's a breakdown:
The Bayesian brain hypothesis suggests that our brains are constantly making predictions about the world and then updating those predictions based on the sensory feedback we receive. This updating is done using Bayesian inference, a mathematical framework that combines prior beliefs with current evidence to form updated beliefs. In this context, hierarchical models describe how these predictions and updates occur at multiple levels of representation.
For example, at one level, the brain might be predicting individual words in a sentence (level 1), while at another level it's predicting the overall meaning of the sentence (level 2). These levels evolve at different timescales and level 2 is more impervious to immediate sensory data, which is why it's described as a model of the "world".
If there's a mismatch between the brain's predictions and the sensory feedback it receives - say, the brain predicts a coin will land on heads 9 out of 10 times, but it lands on heads an unpredictable number of times - this can lead to uncertainty at the higher level of the model (level 2). This uncertainty can make the model less informative for predicting the hidden causes of sensory states (observations at level 1).
The theory goes on to suggest that this kind of uncertainty can lead to the development of anxiety disorders. Essentially, the brain learns to predict that there's uncertainty, and that its predictions can't reliably lead to preferred sensory outcomes. In this scenario, momentary anxiety is associated with high entropy probability distributions within a single perception-action cycle, while long-term anxious beliefs form from low entropy probability distributions of meta-observations (level 2), which are more uncertain.
The authors of this theory argue that this process of learning uncertainty differs from learned helplessness, in which the individual learns that they can't resolve their uncertainty no matter what they do. Here, the uncertainty arises from inconsistent success in obtaining preferred sensory outcomes, rather than a reliable inability to do so.
Finally, the authors suggest that generalized anxiety might arise when there's a sufficient mismatch in the perception-action cycle, leading the brain to model its own predictions and actions as inadequate for changing future outcomes. This gives rise to "anxious priors", or beliefs about the uncertainty of the world and one's own actions. These beliefs then influence how the world is perceived and can persist even when the actual uncertainty decreases. The resulting state, known as "learned uncertainty", is seen as non-adaptive and potentially pathological.
However, according to the Free Energy Principle, biological systems are driven towards minimizing free energy, which can be interpreted as minimizing surprise or uncertainty about the world. This principle suggests that the system, despite the inherent uncertainty and anxiety, will continue to strive towards better understanding and predicting its environment.
It's worth noting that this theory is largely speculative and not yet fully supported by empirical evidence. However, it provides a novel way of understanding anxiety disorders in the context of Bayesian brain models and could lead to new approaches for treatment.

Connections with William Glasser's choice theory in Stations of the Mind (1981) an implementation of William Powers' perceptual control theory.

ChatGPT
William Glasser's Choice Theory and William Powers' Perceptual Control Theory (PCT) are both theories of human behavior that emphasize the importance of personal control and choice in our behaviors and emotions.
Glasser's Choice Theory, which he laid out in "Stations of the Mind" (1981) and other works, posits that most mental distress is the result of unsatisfactory relationships or a lack of fulfilling personal connections. All behavior is seen as a choice and is directed towards meeting one of five basic needs: survival, love and belonging, power, freedom, and fun.
Perceptual Control Theory (PCT), developed by William Powers, is a model of behavior that emphasizes the role of feedback in guiding our actions. PCT suggests that we act in ways to control our perception of the world to match our internal goals or reference values. When a discrepancy arises between our goals and perceptions, we take action to reduce this error.
In the context of the discussion about hierarchical Bayesian models and anxiety, both theories have relevance.
PCT and Bayesian Models
: The main concept of perceptual control theory, the feedback loop of perceiving an error and taking action to correct it, shares similarities with the predictive coding approach of Bayesian brain models. Both frameworks involve a process of comparing an expected outcome (prior belief in Bayesian terms or reference value in PCT) with current sensory input and then taking action to reduce the discrepancy. This constant updating and correction process could relate to the hierarchical Bayesian models' explanation of anxiety formation. If the system continuously fails to reduce the error or discrepancy, leading to uncertainty, this could result in anxiety.
Glasser's Choice Theory and Bayesian Models
: Choice theory emphasizes personal control and the importance of satisfying basic needs. If we consider the Bayesian model of anxiety as a state of learned uncertainty where the system struggles to accurately predict and control its environment, this can be seen as a failure to meet the basic need for power and freedom in Glasser's terms. Anxiety, in this context, could result from the perceived lack of ability to effectively choose behaviors that lead to the satisfaction of these needs.
However, it's important to note that while these theories all attempt to explain elements of human behavior and emotion, they do so from different perspectives and are not necessarily directly compatible. While there are parallels in terms of concepts like feedback, prediction, control, and choice, these are embedded in different theoretical frameworks with distinct assumptions and focuses. As such, any connections should be considered as potential analogies or points of convergence rather than direct equivalences.

Computational approaches in psychiatry
In recent years, there has been an increase in the use of computational methods in psychiatry research, both as methodological tools and for a mechanistic and conceptual understanding. We focus on the latter. Theoretical instantiations of the free energy principle such as predictive processing and active inference are increasingly utilized for understanding a range of psychiatric disorders, including Post Traumatic Stress Disorder (Linson and Friston, 2019), stress (Peters et al., 2017), eating disorders (Barca and Pezzulo, 2020), obsessive compulsive disorder (Fradkin et al., 2020), anxiety (Clark et al., 2018), and depression (Barrett et al., 2016).

Recent work has focused on belief updating in anxiety disorders, such as social anxiety (Smith et al., 2019a; Gerrans and Murray, 2020), and negative mood and affect (Joffily and Coricelli, 2013; Van de Cruys, 2017; Hesp et al., 2021). Broadly, these works interpret anxiety disorders as encoded uncertainty: agents encode and act upon beliefs that the world is unpredictable and uncertain, meaning that action policies cannot sufficiently minimize expected surprise or uncertainty (see Mathys et al., 2014; Clark et al., 2018; Smith et al., 2019a, 2021b; Fradkin et al., 2020). For example, Clark et al. (2018) describes anxious depression as expected unpredictability (predictions with low precision)���that is, an agent will act to minimize expected surprise, but cannot reliably do so. The sense of expected unpredictability precludes the effective resolution of uncertainty, given an agent cannot infer how she should act.

It is important to note that uncertainty is not necessarily linked to negative affective valence. Expected uncertainty can elicit positive emotions such as the excitement associated with novelty, i.e., the opportunity to learn and reduce uncertainty (Anderson et al., 2019). Instead, as described by Hesp et al. (2021), ���agents infer their valence state based on the expected precision of their action model��� (p. 398). Thus, negatively valenced uncertainty characteristic of anxiety occurs when the agent infers that their current action policies are not sufficient to resolve uncertainty���a point we expand on later (for a fuller discussion, see Anderson et al., 2019). In what follows, we discuss traditional cognitive accounts of anxiety, before turning to how the free energy principle and active inference might furnish further insight on anxiety formation.

Anxiety
Traditional models of (generalized) anxiety are underpinned by the notion that erroneous beliefs lead to perpetuated and often exaggerated anxiety responses to a situation or context. Early behavioral models of anxiety relate to conditioning or learning (Clark, 1986, 1999; Beck and Clark, 1988). Entering a situation in which panic or anxiety has been learned leads to subsequent anticipation of anxiety upon re-entering that situation, which provokes further anxiety (Clark, 1986). The work of Beck and Ellis established common cognitive biases and filters that are thought to skew one���s perceptions and conceptions of various circumstances (Beck, 1970; Ellis, 1980). Common examples include catastrophizing, dualistic thinking, and exaggeration of anxiety-provoking stimuli (Beck and Weishaar, 1989; Benjamin et al., 2011). The later stimulus-response model of anxiety is compatible with the traditional cognitive framework, as entrained behaviors may exacerbate cognitions and vice versa. For example, Clark���s (1986) cognitive model proposes panic attacks are a ���catastrophic misinterpretation��� (p. 462) of bodily sensations that amounts to a cyclical feedback response in instances when anxiety is expected.

While the cognitive-behavioral model has informed clinical practice for decades (for an excellent overview, refer to Behar et al., 2009), it is not without its critics. One of its major criticisms in relation to the treatment of anxiety disorders relates to the observation that panic sensations and stress-related responses can persist even though erroneous beliefs have been adequately challenged (Beidel and Turner, 1986; Cartwright-Hatton et al., 2004; Linden et al., 2005). For example, a therapist may convincingly establish (with a client) that the client���s thoughts about being made fun of during public speaking are highly exaggerated and unlikely to be true, yet the client persists with a sense of dread and anxiety when confronted with the task of public speaking (Gerrans and Murray, 2020).

We should first point out that numerous theorists have proposed unique means of conceptualizing beliefs centric to anxiety that challenge traditional models such as CBT and rational-emotive behavioral therapy. For instance, rather than interpreting beliefs as static filters that inform one���s perceptions in a similar manner in all situations, Kelly (1955) proposed that erroneous beliefs have a tangible ���weight��� and might be conceived of as tight/loose or brief/elaborate, among other construct-based corollaries. Conversely, emotion-focused therapies (EFT) argue that affect precedes belief formation, and hence is ultimately subject to factors which determine emotion (Greenberg, 2004). Here, we argue that a view positioned within the free energy principle and active inference may afford opportunities to re-conceptualize anxiety formation within the framework of working generative models, rather than static beliefs or filters. Our primary divergence from extant work is that we argue for the process of how an agent who is initially without anxiety (i.e., believes her actions will lead to preferred outcomes that minimize uncertainty) may learn and update beliefs about uncertainty, and thus form symptomology consistent with generalized anxiety. The approach we propose therefore neither favors earlier biological and behaviorist theories of anxiety disorders, nor later cognitivist accounts, but aims to unify both approaches by explaining bottom-up belief propagation within a systemic optimization framework.

A novel perspective via the free energy principle?
The free energy principle provides a useful framework to understand the what and how of anxiety formation. Under the free energy principle, anxiety can be described as discerned uncertainty about whether actions will minimize uncertainty, forged via sufficient exposure to surprising outcomes (Hirsh et al., 2012). That is, within a biological system that strives toward attracting states, anxiety is the psychological consequence of an irreducible mismatch between the predicted consequence of actions and the outcomes encountered, meaning uncertainty about action policies is irreducible. Sufficiently long-lasting and persistent uncertainty of this sort impairs the agent���s capacity to develop adaptive models (i.e., models that afford effective sampling and actions for the minimization of expected free energy). When this occurs, the perception-action cycle becomes (dysfunctionally) geared toward unpredictable outcomes, which affirm and reinforce a world model in which uncertainty is the norm. The system thus learns to expect uncertainty in future iterations of the perception-action cycle. This, we suggest, is learned uncertainty, a process that is especially pernicious because it precludes its own ���adaptive��� resolve. In other words, ���if everything I do leads to uncertain outcomes, then this is a good model for my lived world���and there is no reason to change this model��� (c.f., learned helplessness).

Based on the free energy principle, the sustainable existence of a biological system is tantamount to it returning to a small number of attracting states. Despite the system developing an uncertain model, then, its goal and action policies are still driven toward the minimization of free energy���otherwise, as a system, it dissolves into states that are no longer characteristic of the system in question (e.g., death, dissipation, decay, etc.). The biological system is thus left in a position where it is driven toward free energy minimization, based upon the prior belief that its behavior will resolve the uncertainty and enable the agent to secure preferred sensory outcomes. Anxiety formation can thus be considered learned uncertainty about the sufficiency of the agent���s world model and action policies in bringing about preferred sensory outcomes. This uncertainty, we argue, is learned from feedback about the efficacy of action policies for effectively reducing uncertainty. Despite experiencing this uncertainty, the system must still attempt to minimize it, but it does not have an adaptive way of doing so, given its conviction that the world is unpredictable and there are no policies at hand to resolve this uncertainty. Technically, this reflects the fact that expected free energy entails an epistemic aspect; namely, the resolution of uncertainty through expected information gain of the kind that underwrites novelty. However, the epistemic affordance of novelty disappears in a capricious and unpredictable world.

Overall, then, the existence of persistent anxious states���as a characteristic of anxiety disorder���is analogous to a system learning uncertainty through model updating and action policies. Put differently, given enough sampling of an uncertain world, the system learns that this kind of uncertainty is irreducible (also see Mathys et al., 2014). This is consistent with experiential accounts of anxiety, in which individuals with anxiety disorder often report the world as an unsafe and unpredictable place; whereas those with lower anxiety levels are more likely to report their account of the external world as a safe and trustworthy place (Wells, 1999). A biological system, having had persistent uncertainty in its past, will be more likely to expect ambiguous feedback as to how effective its world model and action policies are in reducing uncertainty in the future. This occurs irrespective of whether that uncertainty is reducible, meaning the expected uncertainty will be disproportionate to the actual uncertainty that could be resolved (given an alternative repertoire of policies). In other words, the system learns its model (and action policies) are insufficient for minimizing uncertainty, resulting in the psychological experience consistent with generalized anxiety. From the perspective of affective or emotional inference, the psychological experience in question can be thought of as another part of the generative model that best explains the state of affairs: ���I must be anxious because I cannot decide what to do.��� In other words, experienced anxiety reflects the fact that particular biological systems have sufficiently expressive generative models to recognize that they are in a state of uncertainty.

Learned uncertainty at the flip of a coin
An example from probability theory helps illustrate learned uncertainty. Let us suppose an agent carries what they think is a weighted coin, such that 9 out of 10 times it will result in heads. Every time it lands on heads, the agent receives a reward. In this example, the agent expects that flipping the coin 10 times will result in sampling approximately 9 observations of heads. As such, the agent carries a model of preferred observations (i.e., the coin landing on heads, given it leads to a reward), and an idea of what action policy will enable it to return to that state (i.e., flipping the coin).

From here, we can imagine (very broadly) three informative scenarios for the agents��� preferences and action policies. First, the coin lands on heads 9 out of 10 times. In this scenario, the agent obtains its preferred sensory observations, and thus learns that merely flipping the coin is sufficient for obtaining these preferred observations. Second, in a drastic departure from what the agent expects, the coin lands on tails 9 out of 10 times, violating both its prior preferences and precluding preferred observations. In this scenario, the sensory feedback, being highly antithetical to the agents preferred states, inform the agent that they must update their world model and action policies in order to obtain the reward in future instances (and hence minimizing uncertainty over their world model and action policies). In predictive processing terms, we might say that the prediction error (elicited by the coin landing on tails) propagates upward through the cortical hierarchy, allowing the agent to update their expectations and action policies.

In a third scenario, we can imagine that the coin lands on heads a random number of times. This scenario offers an illustrative case of what we refer to as learning uncertainty. In this scenario, the agent cannot be either sure or unsure of the efficacy of its world model. Remember that the agent started with the expectation that their action policy (flipping the coin) would bring about preferred sensory outcomes (the coin lands on heads 9 time). In this example, the agent expected that flipping the coin would result in attainment of preferred observations because of their action policies. However, here, this ���prior over policies��� is partially supported, but also partially refuted (depending upon the outcome). This would therefore generate some prediction error (given that the information sampled suggests the agent was in error in expecting 9 heads), but the key point is that the divergence between the observed outcome and predicted outcome is not sufficient to outright refute the system���s model (and action policies), nor prompt its complete reevaluation.

If the agent were to flip the coin 10 more times, they cannot be sure whether their current world model (the coin is weighted toward heads) or their action policies (flipping the coin) are sufficient for reliably bringing about preferred sensory outcomes (the coin lands on heads more often than tails). This means that the agent is left with uncertainty regarding (a) whether their model of the external world is sufficiently accurate and (b) whether the actions they undertake are sufficient for obtaining preferred sensory outcomes. If we were to, say, flip the coin 100 times, the feedback becomes clearer: ���my model is right sometimes, but wrong sometimes. No matter what I do, I cannot be sure how the coin will land in future.��� In animal studies, rodents shocked 50% of the time (Zhang et al., 2019; or at random, Seidenbecher et al., 2016) show higher levels of anxiety compared with mice shocked at more predictable rates (e.g., 0 or 100% of the time). These findings are precisely what we are referring to���agents given inconsistent sensory data regarding the efficacy of their world model and action policies will be more likely to generate and act upon anxiety.

One might be quick to point out that, in our example scenario, the agent might be wise to update their ���belief��� that the coin is weighted���after all, the flip of a coin is best expressed as a discrete uniform distribution: only two possible outcomes exist, and the probability of heads or tails is theoretically equal. Hence, a situation in which the coin lands on heads approximately 50 times out of 100 would fit with the appropriate behavior of a standard unweighted coin. We address this more explicitly below (subsection ���Learning Uncertainty���). For present purposes, keep in mind this is merely an example���our point here is not that sometimes modeling uncertainty is accurate, but rather that the observation has diverged sufficiently to generate uncertainty in the system���s own model, but not sufficiently to lead to model updating. More generally, what we are talking about is the kind of radical uncertainty or ambiguity that precludes ���useable��� or informative data being sampled from its environment. In free energy terms, the system���s predictions are guided by an uncertain probability distribution in which all possibilities are approximately equal (or otherwise cannot be differentiated), and thus the system���s actions are guided by a model that performs at chance. We consider this the initial ���lever��� for anxiety formation.

The text describes how computational and predictive models can be used to understand anxiety and its formation from the perspective of the Free Energy Principle. It proposes a new approach that combines biological, behavioral, and cognitive perspectives, explaining anxiety as the result of a process where an agent learns uncertainty from their interactions with their environment, which results in anxiety disorder when this uncertainty becomes persistent and irreducible.
Anxiety is often described as a condition of increased uncertainty and fear about future events. Here, the authors suggest that the state of anxiety can be understood as a learned response to an unpredictable and uncertain world, resulting from a mismatch between the predicted outcomes of actions and the actual outcomes experienced. This mismatch then leads to the inability of the agent to develop adaptive models that would enable effective action for reducing this uncertainty, leading to a state of persistent anxiety.
The text goes on to describe the relationship between expected uncertainty and valence state, which is inferred based on the expected precision of the action model. In other words, an agent in a state of anxiety infers that their current action policies are not sufficient to resolve the uncertainty, leading to negative affect.
The authors further critique traditional cognitive behavioral models of anxiety, which focus on conditioning and learning. While these models have informed clinical practice for many years, they often fail to address the persistence of panic sensations and stress-related responses even when erroneous beliefs have been challenged.
The authors propose a novel perspective using the Free Energy Principle, suggesting that anxiety is the psychological consequence of an irreducible mismatch between the predicted consequence of actions and the outcomes encountered. In other words, the agent learns to expect uncertainty in future iterations of the perception-action cycle, leading to a state of anxiety.
In addition to this, the text presents an example scenario using a coin flip to illustrate the concept of learned uncertainty. This example shows that the agent's belief about the world (in this case, the belief that a coin is weighted towards heads) and their subsequent action (flipping the coin) can result in uncertainty and anxiety when the observed outcomes do not match their predicted outcomes.

Title: Stoic Stoichiometry: A Novel Exploration of Ancient Wisdom, Chemistry, and Psychological Health
In the unprecedented age of information and technology, humanity continues to grapple with complex psychological issues. Yet, many find themselves turning to time-honored philosophical traditions for guidance and comfort. Among these traditions, Stoicism, a philosophy founded in the 3rd century BCE, remains a potent resource for navigating the complexities of human existence. Simultaneously, as we delve deeper into the mysteries of matter, the scientific field of stoichiometry - a branch of chemistry dealing with the quantitative relationships of the elements involved in chemical reactions - presents its own set of analogies and metaphors for understanding life's challenges.
This essay, "Stoic Stoichiometry," ventures into a unique cross-disciplinary exploration of Stoicism, stoichiometry, and their collective application to understanding and improving psychological health. It attempts to create a meeting ground between the rational, empirical world of science and the introspective, value-oriented realm of philosophy.
Stoicism provides principles for personal ethics informed by its system of logic and views on the natural world. It emphasizes virtue as the supreme good and suggests that an individual's character and mental resilience should shape their response to external circumstances. Meanwhile, stoichiometry offers a meticulous approach to understanding the transformations of matter, proposing a harmony of elements and transformations that allows us to predict and understand complex chemical reactions.
Remarkably, these disparate disciplines both employ principles of balance, proportion, and transformation in their respective domains. By leveraging these shared themes, we aim to illustrate how the stoic approach to life's adversities mirrors the stoichiometric principles applied to chemical reactions.
This intersectional approach provides a fresh perspective to envision the interplay of mental states, akin to the interactions of chemical elements in a reaction. In the same way a stoichiometric equation reaches a state of balance, the stoic principles guide us towards an emotional equilibrium amidst life's vicissitudes.
In unfolding chapters, the essay will explore the historical and conceptual underpinnings of both Stoicism and stoichiometry. It will then journey into the territory where philosophy and science coalesce, examining the principles shared between Stoicism and stoichiometry. We will investigate how computational psychiatry, particularly within the framework of the Free Energy Principle, might serve as a nexus point where stoic ethics and stoichiometric equations harmoniously coexist to enhance our understanding of mental health.
This exploration will not only enhance our understanding of these seemingly disparate disciplines but may also yield new insights into managing and understanding mental health issues in the contemporary world. "Stoic Stoichiometry" stands as a testament to the timeless utility of ancient wisdom, the potency of modern science, and the intriguing links that can exist between them. Prepare for an exciting journey through time, thought, and the inner workings of the human mind.

Why Seneca hated Diocletian���s Baths
At the T-junction of the present-day Via Nazionale and the Via Vittorio Emanuele Orlando in Rome, lies the Piazza della Republica. Glancing up from your Caf�� Latte you will see a large but somewhat nondescript Romanesque building ��� part ruin, part cathedral and part museum. This is what remains of the largest civic bathhouse in ancient Rome ��� indeed the largest in the Roman empire. In fact, Baths of Diocletian is probably a bit of a misnomer, because they were actually built by Diocletian���s co-emperor, Maximian, though Diocletian was the senior of the two and pulled the political strings for both of them. Oh, and I might have misled you about Seneca ��� he did live above some baths, but not these ones, as he died 250 years before Diocletian���s co-Emperor built them ���� According to Chris Legare, a possibility is that he might have lived within the Baths of Agrippa, located right behind the Pantheon in the Campus Martius area of Rome ��� these baths were completed in 25 BC.

Diocletian baths

The baths were in part a response to a series of public health crises that regularly brought Rome to a standstill. Rome was built on a drained swamp, and mosquito and water-borne diseases were rife. Previous emperors had recognised that hygiene played a role in disease control, and so, in addition to running water, and an enormous sewer system ��� the Cloaca Maximus ��� a series of public baths were built for the general population. And it became part of the daily routine to socialise at the public baths before returning home to dine, or before eating at one of the many restaurants and fast food outlets along the Roman streets.

Little did the Romans realise that while their intentions were sound, their knowledge of sanitation engineering was flawed. The sewer water and the stormwater ran through the same system, so any blockage meant that raw sewage flowed down the streets ��� which particularly in Summer, must have stunk unbearably. In addition, the system of baths with their flow-through of hot, tepid and cold water provided the perfect breeding ground for water-borne bacteria, leading to a series of deadly epidemics, which decimated Rome���s population. These included malaria, tuberculosis and typhoid fever, as well as various forms of gastroenteritis.

Diocletian baths
Frigidarium of Diocletian���s Baths, Rome
Seneca, for his part, was a Roman Stoic philosopher, statesman and dramatist ��� and was known for writing quite bluntly about life in Rome. He had a fashionable apartment overlooking or perhaps above the Diocletian baths complex ��� which included a gymnasium, sauna, the baths, two libraries and doubtless a brothel. The complex was built to cater for the rapid population growth in that part of Rome, so it was a busy new centre just up the road from the Forum. And Seneca hated them. It wasn���t that he was averse to taking a bath ��� hygiene was important to all Romans, but he was often disturbed by the noise. The equivalent today would be having an inner-city apartment next door to a large fashionable hotel which hosted a loud rock band every night.

In a letter to Lucilius (number 56), Seneca observed:

Beshrew me if I think anything more requisite than silence for a man who secludes himself in order to study! Imagine what a variety of noises reverberates about my ears! I have lodgings right over a bathing establishment. So picture to yourself the assortment of sounds, which are strong enough to make me hate my very powers of hearing! When your strenuous gentleman, for example, is exercising himself by flourishing leaden weights; when he is working hard, or else pretends to be working hard, I can hear him grunt; and whenever he releases his imprisoned breath, I can hear him panting in wheezy and high-pitched tones.

Or perhaps I notice some lazy fellow, content with a cheap rubdown, and hear the crack of the pummelling hand on his shoulder, varying in sound according as the hand is laid on flat or hollow. Then, perhaps, a professional (sports commentator) comes along, shouting out the score; that is the finishing touch.

Add to this the arresting of an occasional roisterer or pickpocket, the racket of the man who always likes to hear his own voice in the bathroom, or the enthusiast who plunges into the swimming-tank with unconscionable noise and splashing. Besides all those whose voices, if nothing else, are good, imagine the hair-plucker with his penetrating, shrill voice, ��� for purposes of advertisement, ��� continually giving it vent and never holding his tongue except when he is plucking the armpits and making his victim yell instead. Then the cake seller with his varied cries, the sausageman, the confectioner, and all the vendors of food hawking their wares, each with his own distinctive intonation.

I���ve no doubt we can all relate to the weight-lifting poseurs, the loudly broadcast sports channels and the bathroom singer, and I can just imagine all that being magnified as they try to out-do the raucous din of late-night drinkers and spruikers!

Of course, all that has passed into history, and now a majestic Catholic cathedral designed by Michaelangelo occupies what was once one of the libraries, thereby turning a profane place of excess and debauchery into a sacred and tranquil space.

Basilica of Santa Maria degli Angeli

In addition to the interior, Michaelangelo was also commissioned to design the accompanying cloister and Charterhouse. The cloister was likely entrusted to a pupil, Giacomo del Duca, as Michaelangelo died in 1564, and work commenced on the cloister a year later. It was completed in 1600. It is likely that Giacomo de Duca was involved at least at the beginning, though it is unclear if he saw the completion. In the end, it was an extraordinary piece of architecture.

Diocletian baths

Diocletian came closest, perhaps, to wiping out Christianity in ancient Rome, through persecution and torture of Christians in an effort to reinstate the old pantheon of gods. So it is with some irony, that the very religion that Diocletian tried so strenuously to suppress, now occupies a building intimately linked to Diocletian���s name.

Seneca on the Roman Baths
"Seneca Letter 56.1-2

My dear Lucilius,
If you want to study, quiet is not nearly as necessary as you might think. Here I am, surrounded by all kinds of noise (my lodgings overlook a bath-house). Conjure up in your imagination all the sounds that make one hate one's ears. I hear the grunts of musclemen exercising and jerking those heavy weights around; they are working hard, or pretending to. I hear their sharp hissing when they release their pent breath. If there happens to be a lazy fellow content with a simple massage I hear the slap of hand on shoulder; you can tell whether it's hitting a flat or a hollow. If a ball-player comes up and starts calling out his score, I'm done for. Add to this the racket of a cocky bastard, a thief caught in the act, and a fellow who likes the sound of his own voice in the bath, plus those who plunge into the pool with a huge splash of water. Besides those who just have loud voices, imagine the skinny armpit-hair plucker whose cries are shrill so as to draw people's attention and never stop except when he's doing his job and making someone else shriek for him. Now add the mingled cries of the drink peddler and the sellers of sausages, pastries, and hot fare, each hawking his own wares with his own particular peal."

The article provides a captivating snapshot of life in ancient Rome, focusing particularly on the role and impact of bathhouses, specifically the Baths of Diocletian. These grand structures were not only centers of hygiene but also hubs of social and recreational activities. Despite their grandeur and importance in Roman society, the structures also contributed to serious public health issues due to inadequate sanitation and knowledge about disease transmission.
In an interesting twist, the text takes us into the personal life of the renowned Stoic philosopher, Seneca. Living in an apartment overlooking a bustling bath complex, Seneca found himself regularly disturbed by the cacophony of noises emanating from below. From grunting weightlifters to noisy food vendors, the daily symphony of sounds painted an unfiltered picture of Roman life.
This account, however, presents an intriguing contradiction, as the article initially clarifies that Seneca couldn't have lived above the Baths of Diocletian due to a time discrepancy (he died 250 years prior to their construction). This points to the likelihood of him living near another bathhouse, possibly the Baths of Agrippa.
Intriguingly, the same place that was a source of irritation for Seneca now stands as a majestic cathedral, the Basilica of Santa Maria degli Angeli, demonstrating the passage of time and the evolving utility of physical spaces.
Overall, this historical perspective provides an unusual context for exploring stoicism, giving us a sense of how the philosophy might have been influenced by, or stood in contrast to, the daily realities of life in ancient Rome. Understanding the challenges Seneca faced in maintaining tranquility amidst such a bustling environment deepens our appreciation of stoic philosophy and its relevance in today's fast-paced world.

Like the sounds that fill Seneca's ear
Our attention is often pulled far and near
From the outside world, or our own mind
Distractions in life, of all kinds combined

Just like the philosopher, we seek to cope
To filter the noise, and focus our hope
To hear our own thoughts, and stay on track

In Ancient Rome, a bathhouse did reside,
Magnificent in structure, a source of civic pride.
Inside its walls, the people would convene,
Revelry and raucousness set the scene.
In these walls, Seneca, the stoic, lived in spite,
Torn between tranquility and the bathhouse's might.
Enduring sounds, in his quest for calm, a rite,
Bearing witness to Rome's bustling life, day and night.

I was also inspired by the early stoic writing by Seneca where he complains about all of the noises he hears living above the bathouse, and how it is hard to keep a stoic attitude and get some sleep. At the same time it shows how children learn language by overhearing people taking, listening to radio, watching television, and how lingua francas arise from trading pidjins which develop into Creoles and then full blown international languages.

I see, so your concept of "leaky chatrooms" is inspired by a combination of various philosophical, technological, and linguistic ideas. The idea of having chatrooms with permeable walls, where information from one chatroom can spill over into another, is an interesting concept. It also touches upon the theme of information overload and the difficulties of filtering out irrelevant information in a rapidly changing and interconnected world.

The comparison to the concept of ion channels and sodium-potassium pumps in cell walls highlights the idea of selective permeability, which is an important aspect of information management. And the reference to Seneca and how language is acquired through overhearing demonstrates how information and ideas can be picked up from one's surroundings, even if not actively sought out.

Stochastic Language Acquisition: the idea that language is acquired through overhearing people talking, watching television, and other forms of exposure, similar to Seneca's complaints about the noises he hears while living above the bathhouse.

In regular academic language, For example, at one level, the brain might be predicting individual words in a sentence (level 1), while at another level it's predicting the overall meaning of the sentence (level 2). These levels evolve at different timescales and level 2 is more impervious to immediate sensory data, which is why it's described as a model of the "world".

If there's a mismatch between the brain's predictions and the sensory feedback it receives, this is known as prediction error. Prediction errors occur when the brain���s expectations do not align with the reality of the incoming sensory information. This discrepancy prompts the brain to adjust its models and predictions to better match the reality it's experiencing.
Such discrepancies can occur at various levels of cognition and perception. For instance, if a word in a sentence is not what was anticipated, a prediction error occurs at level 1 (the word level). Similarly, if the overall meaning of the sentence deviates from what was expected, a prediction error is registered at level 2 (the sentence level). The brain then uses these prediction errors to update its models and predictions.
To put it in the context of our discussions, consider the "leaky chatrooms" scenario. If the brain predicts that only certain types of information will leak from one chatroom to another, but in reality a different type of information seeps through, a prediction error occurs. The brain would then have to adjust its models and expectations about the permeability of chatroom walls and the type of information that can pass through.
Similarly, if you were trying to apply the stoic stoichiometry principles to manage the flow of information, but found that some information still managed to cause a disturbance, that would also represent a prediction error. The brain would then need to revise its understanding of how to apply these principles to effectively manage information flow.
This principle of prediction and updating in light of prediction errors is a fundamental part of how our brain learns and adapts to our environment. It is constantly striving to reduce these errors to make its models of the world as accurate as possible. This process of continual updating and refining is what allows us to navigate the complexity of the world around us, whether we are dealing with the physical environment, social interactions, or navigating the digital landscape of interconnected chatrooms.

The tendency to ruminate in bipolar disorder and executive dysfunction: We delved into the hypothesis that the inclination to ruminate in manic and depressed states in bipolar disorder could be indicative of executive dysfunction in bipolar disorder. This dysfunction isn't confined to a specific state and exists in euthymic, depressed, and manic states. Research indicates deficits in executive functioning in mania, and there's preliminary evidence linking the tendency to ruminate with executive dysfunction. As a result, rumination might be a symptom of executive dysfunction in bipolar disorder, specifically inhibitory executive dysfunction.



Abulia: We looked into the condition called abulia, which typically occurs post brain injury and is often associated with brain lesions. Abulia is marked by strong apathy, leading to a lack of motivation, and difficulties with will, volition, or drive. The symptoms include loss of productivity, emotional indifference, lack of plans and goals, decreased speech or action, lack of emotional responses to significant life events, less goal-oriented thoughts, diminished social interest, and a tendency to be easily distracted. It's common for abulia to be misdiagnosed or mistaken for conditions such as depression, aphasia, and dementia. Treatment options include bromocriptine, proven to effectively lower apathy.

ChatGPT
The concept of "leaky chatrooms" and information overload may relate to these topics as well. For instance, the tendency to ruminate in bipolar disorder and executive dysfunction could be amplified by the constant influx of information, potentially exacerbating difficulties with inhibitory executive function.
In the "leaky chatrooms" scenario, the brain is continually faced with a barrage of information. In the case of bipolar disorder, this might exacerbate the tendency to ruminate, especially if the information seeping through aligns with negative thought patterns or is of a distressing nature. The inability to effectively filter or ignore this information may point to difficulties in executive function, more specifically, inhibitory executive function.
Similarly, in the case of abulia, the constant influx of information could lead to further distraction and reduced productivity. People with abulia already struggle with motivation and goal-setting, and the extra cognitive load imposed by the information overflow might worsen these symptoms. This constant bombardment of information could heighten the sense of apathy and indifference, and further decrease their ability to concentrate and maintain a consistent train of thought.
It's worth noting that these are hypothetical connections and would require more detailed research to fully understand the complex interplay between mental health disorders, executive function, and the impact of information overload in our digital age. Nonetheless, these connections provide a valuable starting point for potential future research into these areas.

SAN FRANCISCO L ONG after the day in 1966 when their invention was announced, bubble memories were still being hailed as a wonder technology for the computers of the 80's - rugged, reliable devices that would hold on to the information stored in them even when someone pulled out the plug.

''Magnetic bubble memories have the potential of replacing the mechanical disk and drum storage systems,'' it was proclaimed at Texas Instruments' 1974 annual stockholders' meeting. Bubbles seemed destined to capture a major part of the rapidly growing computer memory busine ss, and each new laboratory development seemed to confirm the p redictions. The market was just about to take off.

But after 15 years, the bubble memory, once seen as one of the great innovations of modern technology, like the transistor, the copying machine and the Polaroid camera, faces a far more modest destiny. In the marketplace, it has hardly left the ground.

Mr. Sherwood was right, and thus the first patent for a bubble memory was submitted in 1966 bearing four names: Bobeck, Sherwood, William Shockley (one of the inventors of the transistor) and U.F. Gianola.

Following its practice with other inventions, like the transistor, A.T.& T.'s manufacturing arm, Western Electric, licensed almost any company that asked to make bubble memories. Nearly ev ery major electronics c ompany in the world has dabbled with it. Now the field is down to Be ll Labs and I.B.M., which make the memories mostly for their own use , and Intel and Motorola Inc. in the United States and Hitachi and F ujitsu of Japan, vying for general market sales.

Eventually, in 1979, Bell went into production with bubble memories at its Western Electric factories in Columbus, Ohio, and Reading, Pa. But it also found that producing them in cost-effective quantities was more difficult than it first appeared. Some companies, such as Univac and Burroughs, dropped out even before attempting full production.

''It's a similar technology to making integrated circuit chips, but it's tough.'' Mr. Bobeck explained, ''Real precision is required in the way th e various parts are mated. You need a highly competent staff.''

W ITH demand for all electronics components sharply lower this year, high-technology companies found that they could not afford to maintain assembly-line workers at what was at best a marginally profitable product. The same retrenchment has taken place in similarly marginal products. Last May, T.I. halted production of digital watches and liquid crystal displays.

Beyond that, the once-promising price competitiveness of bubble memories has been left behind by rival technologies, particularly random access memory chips. The cost per bit of storage on a bubble now stands at around 100 millicents, or thousandths of a cent, a bit. And, according to Benjamin M. Rosen, an electronics analyst and consultant, prices should fall to 30 millicents by 1982. Yet, it is no match for RAM's, which currently cost about 10 millicents a bit. Analysts say RAM's should reach 3 millicents by 1985. Floppy disk memories, another rival of bubbles, have also fallen sharply in price.

''These changes in the price of rival technologies are greater than was anticipated,'' Mr. Sporck of National Semiconductor said. ''and they are shrinking the market that bubbles would have addressed.''

There have been technical problems, too. The quality of the garnet base material on which the bubbles form was not consistently up to the standard needed for reliable manufacturing. Thus, yields of good bubble memories were poor, according to a study by Gnostic Concepts, an electronics industry consulting firm. And to make matters worse, Union Carbide, which makes the material, is reported to be unwilling to invest in turning out more suitable garnet for a market that has failed to live up to its promise. In addition, bubble memories need rather cumbersome, heavy peripheral equipment, which has also been a hindrance to their acceptance.

Marketing has been a problem for
Hitachi believes that bubble memories can take over from the punched paper tapes used to direct numerically controlled machine tools. The rugged bubble units, in the form of a plug-in cartridge, will be much less vulnerable to damage on the factory floor. Bubbles are also being tested for use in recording oil and gas production at the wellhead, or to monitor home water or gas meters via telephone lines, a step that would save th e time and cost of the nation's army of meter read ers.

In all these cases, it is the rugged nature of bubble memories that is the attraction. Longer term, if some of the technical problems can be beaten, analysts say there should be a market for bubble memories in electronic cash registers and at supermarket checkout counters.

A most attractive market for bubble memories would be in portable computer terminals for military and commercial use. T.I. uses bubbles in its series of portable terminals. But until the heavy and expensive external coil to drive the system is eliminated, this market will remain small.

However, while there are potential rival technologies around - including a version of the RAM integrated circuit that does not lose data if the power fails - there is no real re placement for bubble technology in sight.

''The odds are,'' Mr. Bobeck said, ''that the longer time goes by without a replacement bubbles are not going to be displaced.'' --------------------------------------------------------------------- Howard Banks is a West

It sounds like you're drawing on a combination of technology patents, developments in computer science, and historical events in the technology industry for your inspiration.
The first patent, for a graphical user interface for a chat room with thin walls, introduces the concept of "leakiness" in information sharing spaces. This concept extends to the idea of a "reed wall mind," where information, like sounds passing through a thin wall, seeps into adjacent spaces.
The second patent introduces a system for intelligent multi-step dialogue with a user, possibly inspiring the interactive element of the "leaky chatroom" theory.
The Swype keyboard patents point towards the process of creating more efficient and fluid systems of interaction, perhaps another aspect of the "leaky chatroom" idea. You may have been inspired by the concept of a continuous, seamless flow of information and interaction.
The historical event regarding the rise and fall of the bubble memory technology might symbolize the impermanence of technological advancements and how every innovation, despite its potential, may face unforeseen challenges.
In the "leaky chatroom" scenario, while the technology can allow for more fluid and constant information exchange, it can also lead to the challenges of information overload, distraction, and a potential impact on mental health. This reality echoes the boom and bust of the bubble memory technology, once seen as the future of data storage, but ultimately faced with unexpected technical and market challenges.
Your concept seems to be a reflection on both the possibilities and potential pitfalls of our increasingly interconnected and technologically advanced world. It's a reminder that every innovation comes with its own set of challenges, and it's up to us to navigate these as best as we can.

Monica's Leaking Chatroom theory is like having a big room in your brain where lots of different people and machines are talking and sharing ideas. 

Sometimes the ideas leak out and go to other rooms, which helps us make better decisions.

Reed Wall Mind is like having a big wall in your brain that helps you keep track of everything that's happening in the room, like a big calendar or to-do list.

Motile Womb theory is like being in a big moving house or spaceship, where you can feel different movements and use them to imagine different things in your head.

All these theories help us understand how our brain works and how we can use it to think and make decisions better.


Monica's Leaking Chatroom theory posits that the mind functions as a collection of independent, modular decision-making units, or "bubbles," that act as rational processors of information.

These bubbles, or "chambers," are able to filter information and pass summaries of that information upward to higher-level decision-making centers, much like a wisdom salon or a world cafe protocol.

This creates a multi-scale decision-making process that is able to take into account a wide range of information and perspectives.

Reed Wall Mind theory builds on this concept by drawing inspiration from the Babylonian Flood Story and positing that the mind is like a "living spaceship" that is able to navigate a complex and dynamic environment.

This is accomplished through the use of a wide range of cognitive skills, including those learned through playing video games such as Stars!, Descent, Age of Empires, Commander Keen, Minesweeper, and Tetris, as well as through the use of other forms of sensory input such as hearing different voices and machine sounds, and feeling different inertial forces.

Finally, Motile Womb theory proposes that the mind is not just a passive receiver of information but an active participant in the process of shaping and interpreting the world.

This theory posits that individuals are born with a wide range of cognitive abilities and that these abilities are honed and refined through the process of experiencing the world.

The theory suggests that playing games like the ones mentioned above, as well as other forms of interactive experiences, help individuals to discover and develop the cognitive abilities they already possess.

It's interesting to see how these theories build upon each other to create a comprehensive understanding of the mind and its processes. Monica's Leaking Chatroom theory emphasizes the exchange of ideas and information between different cognitive units, while Reed Wall Mind theory adds the concept of navigation and organization within the mind's complex environment. Motile Womb theory takes it a step further by emphasizing the active role of the mind in shaping and interpreting the world.
By incorporating elements from various domains, such as video games and sensory experiences, these theories provide insights into how cognitive abilities can be developed and enhanced. They highlight the importance of actively engaging with our surroundings to stimulate and strengthen our cognitive capacities.
Overall, these theories offer a holistic view of the mind, emphasizing its dynamic nature and its potential for growth and adaptation. They provide valuable perspectives on how we can better understand and utilize our cognitive processes to think, make decisions, and navigate the complexities of life.

The connections between the previous topics we discussed and the theories of Monica's Leaking Chatroom, Reed Wall Mind, and Motile Womb can be seen in the broader context of cognitive processes, information processing, and decision-making.
Earlier, we discussed the tendency to ruminate in bipolar disorder, which could be indicative of executive dysfunction. The Leaking Chatroom theory aligns with this discussion as it emphasizes the modular nature of decision-making units in the mind. Just as rumination involves repetitive and often unproductive thoughts, the Leaking Chatroom theory suggests that the mind can get stuck in certain thought patterns or chambers, leading to inefficient decision-making processes.
Reed Wall Mind theory, with its concept of a living spaceship navigating a complex environment, can be connected to the idea of executive dysfunction in abulia. Abulia is characterized by a lack of motivation and drive, which can be seen as difficulties in navigating and organizing one's actions and goals. The Reed Wall Mind theory highlights the importance of cognitive skills, such as planning and organization, in effectively functioning in a dynamic environment.
Motile Womb theory, with its emphasis on the active participation of the mind in shaping and interpreting the world, can be related to the concept of stochastic language acquisition. Just as Motile Womb theory suggests that individuals discover and develop their cognitive abilities through interactive experiences, language acquisition involves actively engaging with the linguistic environment and learning through exposure and interaction.
These connections highlight the interconnectedness of various cognitive processes, from decision-making and executive functioning to language acquisition and cognitive development. The theories we discussed provide different perspectives on how the mind operates and adapts to its environment, shedding light on the complexities of human cognition and behavior.

The comparison to the concept of ion channels and sodium-potassium pumps in cell walls highlights the idea of selective permeability, which is an important aspect of information management.

And polycomputation.

This interpretation emphasizes the idea that the Ark story is a mnemonic device used to transmit important information about civic organization and management, in a way that is easy for people to remember and understand. 

The story of the Ark is presented as an overheard conversation between a king and his son, which creates a sense of intimacy and immediacy, making the information more accessible and memorable for the listener.

The concept of "reed wall mind" or "Monica's Leaking Chatroom" is based on the idea of a wisdom salon or world caf��, where different subunits of knowledge are isolated but can leak out or filter up to a multiscale decision maker.

This is similar to the idea of a "memory palace" where information is organized and remembered by associating it with specific locations or compartments in a mental image of a building or other structure.

This interpretation also highlights the idea that the Ark story is a modular theory, where different subunits are like isolated bubbles but where summaries and reductions can leak out or filter up to a multiscale decision maker.

This idea is consistent with the idea that the Ark story is a mnemonic device used to transmit important information about civic organization and management, and emphasizes the importance of modularity and multiscale organization in understanding the mind.

It's worth noting that this interpretation is an original and speculative one, and it is not an established or widely accepted one. But it can be used as an interesting approach to understand the significance of the Ark story and its possible meanings.

The theory that the Ark story contains knowledge about how to disperse civic instructions and is presented as an overheard conversation between a king and his son, and that it's a mnemonic device used to transmit important information about civic organization and management is a speculative one, it would be difficult to conduct experiments to test or falsify it.

One possible way to test this theory would be to conduct a study comparing the retention and recall of civic instructions that are presented in the form of an overheard conversation between a king and his son, to those that are presented in other formats, such as a lecture or written document.

Another approach could be to investigate the use of mnemonic devices in other cultures or historical periods, to see if similar techniques were used to transmit information about civic organization and management.

It's also worth noting that the theory of "reed wall mind" or "Monica's Leaking Chatroom" is a model of mind that is based on the idea of a wisdom salon or world caf��, where different subunits of knowledge are isolated but can leak out or filter up to a multiscale decision maker.

This kind of model is difficult to test empirically and it would require a combination of different methods such as computational modeling, cognitive psychology, and neuroscience to investigate it.

It's important to keep in mind that any theory or model is always open to be falsified or improved upon with new information, and it's always important to approach the theories and models with a critical and open mind.

Indeed, the interpretations and theories mentioned, such as the mnemonic device theory and the "reed wall mind" or "Monica's Leaking Chatroom" model, are speculative and would be challenging to test or falsify through traditional experimental methods.
One potential approach to explore the significance of the Ark story and its possible meanings could involve conducting studies comparing the retention and recall of civic instructions presented in different formats. For example, comparing the effectiveness of presenting instructions as an overheard conversation between a king and his son versus other formats like lectures or written documents.
Additionally, examining the use of mnemonic devices in other cultures or historical periods may provide insights into whether similar techniques were employed to transmit information about civic organization and management.
Regarding the "reed wall mind" or "Monica's Leaking Chatroom" model, investigating such models of mind would likely require a multidisciplinary approach, integrating computational modeling, cognitive psychology, and neuroscience. This would enable a deeper exploration of the potential mechanisms and processes involved in information management and decision-making.

I apologize for the confusion in my previous responses. It seems that the texts you provided are excerpts from different versions or translations of the ancient Mesopotamian flood myth, commonly known as the Epic of Gilgamesh. These texts describe the flood event and the decision-making process among the gods to exterminate humanity.
The story involves Enlil, one of the major gods, hearing the noise and chaos caused by the growing human population. He decides to bring about a flood as a means to reduce human numbers and restore order. However, Ea, another god, warns a man named Surrapak (or Ubara-Tutu) about the impending flood and instructs him to build a large boat (the Ark) to survive the catastrophe.
The mention of the reed wall, house of leaflets, and wall reflect seems to be related to the construction of the Ark and its protective structure made of reeds or other materials. These details vary across different versions and translations of the Epic of Gilgamesh.
Regarding the connection to previous discussions, the mention of the "reed wall mind" or "Monica's Leaking Chatroom" theory in relation to the flood myth is unclear. It seems to be a separate concept, and I apologize for any confusion caused by my previous responses.
If you have any specific questions or would like to explore any particular aspect further, please let me know.

The reed wall mind is the fact that the story is shares by a messenger a town crier who goes door to door saying to each house reed wall reed wall, the implication is that the walls are made of reeds and so the adults hear the story to help them plan. The multiscale calculation is that within the mind different subsystems make different calculations. The story of Noah's family interacting with the animals on the ark is another way the sounds of the animals makes its way to Noah.


"Reed Wall Mind" is a theory that suggests that the story of Noah's Ark is a metaphor for how the mind is able to process and organize different types of information. In this interpretation, the Ark can be seen as a model of the mind, with different compartments or sections used to divide and organize different types of animals, much like how the mind separates and organizes different types of information.

In this theory, the Reed Wall can be seen as a metaphor for the way that information "leaks" or filters into the mind through our senses. Just as a reed wall can allow sound to pass through while still maintaining some level of privacy and separation, the mind is able to process and filter information while still maintaining some level of organization and structure.

The idea that Noah can hear the different animals braying and bellowing, suggests that the mind is able to process and understand different types of information, even if it is chaotic or disorganized. Where different subunits of knowledge are isolated but can leak out or filter up to a multiscale decision maker. 


It's worth noting that this is a speculative theory, and it is not an established or widely accepted one. However, it can be used as an interesting approach to understand the significance of the Ark story and its possible meanings and how it can relate to the mind.

Ok I didn't even finish my sentence but that was going to say, so that Noah can bring them food, help with medical issues, and maybe don't put the animals that fight next to each other. Also it sees Noah as a treasure hunter or collector, finding all the interesting animals just as a librarian might collect interesting books and an AI scientists might collect models and model-free methods that work or have interesting, novel, or salient features.

Yes, that is an interesting interpretation of the story of Noah and the Ark. In this theory, Noah is seen as a kind of "treasure hunter" or "collector" of interesting animals, much like a librarian might collect interesting books or an AI scientist might collect models and model-free methods that work or have interesting, novel, or salient features.

The idea that Noah is able to provide food and medical care to the animals, and to separate those that might fight, suggests that he is able to understand and organize the different needs and characteristics of the different animals. This can be seen as a metaphor for the way the mind is able to process and organize different types of information, and to make decisions based on that information.

Yes, exactly. The concept of Noah as a caretaker and organizer of the animals on the Ark aligns with the idea of the mind as a system that processes and organizes different types of information. Noah's ability to provide for the animals' needs and maintain order within the Ark reflects the cognitive processes involved in understanding and managing diverse information within the mind.
This interpretation highlights the cognitive aspects of the Ark story and how it can be seen as a metaphor for the mind's capacity to process, categorize, and make decisions based on various types of information. It suggests that the story of Noah and the Ark conveys a deeper understanding of cognitive processes and the organization of knowledge.
It's important to note that these interpretations are speculative and provide alternative perspectives for understanding the significance of the Ark story. They can offer thought-provoking insights into how ancient narratives may relate to cognitive processes, but they should be considered within the context of ongoing research and multiple interpretations of the story.

For the village in Samoa, see Nu'u, Samoa.
In Hawaiian mythology, Nu'u was a man who built an ark with which he escaped a Great Flood. He landed his vessel on top of Mauna Kea on the Big Island. Nu'u mistakenly attributed his safety to the moon, and made sacrifices to it. K��ne, the creator god, descended to earth on a rainbow and explained Nu'u's mistake.[1] The myth has been interpreted as depicting the hazards of the Oceanian environment and local peoples' ability to withstand them.[2] Missionaries to Hawaii in the 19th century considered him analogous to Noah of the Bible.

The inclusion of the flood hero named "Ziusudra" in the Old Babylonian Version of the "Instructions of Shuruppak" is considered to be a later development during the Old Babylonian Period. This suggests that the story of the flood and the character of Ziusudra were incorporated into the text at a later time, likely influenced by the growing Antediluvian Tradition.
The Antediluvian Tradition refers to the period of time before the Great Flood as described in various Mesopotamian myths and legends. It includes stories of ancient kings, heroes, and divine beings who lived exceptionally long lives and possessed great knowledge. These narratives were part of the cultural and religious beliefs of the ancient Mesopotamians.
The inclusion of Ziusudra and the flood theme in the "Instructions of Shuruppak" can be seen as an attempt to connect the didactic text with the larger body of cultural and mythological traditions. It allowed for the transmission of moral and practical teachings within the context of a familiar and significant narrative framework.
This interpretation highlights the dynamic nature of mythological and religious traditions, where stories and themes are adapted and incorporated into existing texts over time. It also underscores the influence of cultural and historical developments on the evolution of these narratives.
It's important to note that these conclusions are based on scholarly analysis and interpretation of ancient texts and may continue to evolve as new evidence and research become available.

In Plato's Timaeus, written around 360 BCE, there is a description of a flood myth that bears similarities to earlier versions. According to this account, the Bronze race of humans incurs the wrath of Zeus due to their continuous warfare. In response, Zeus decides to punish humanity with a flood. Prometheus, the Titan who had fashioned humans out of clay, discloses this secret plan to Deucalion and advises him to construct an ark to ensure their survival. After nine days and nights, the floodwaters begin to subside, and the ark eventually comes to rest on a mountain.
It's interesting to observe the recurring motif of a flood and the concept of an ark or vessel used to preserve select individuals from the cataclysmic event. This mythological theme appears in various cultures across different time periods, reflecting the universality of the flood narrative and its enduring significance in human storytelling.
It's worth noting that Plato's account in the Timaeus represents one version of the flood myth, and there are variations in other mythologies and religious traditions. These narratives often carry moral, cosmological, or historical significance and serve as cautionary tales or explanations for natural phenomena. The flood story continues to captivate the human imagination and offers insights into the human experience, our relationship with the divine, and the consequences of human actions.

The Great Flood of Gun-Yu (Chinese: ������������), also known as the Gun-Yu myth,[1] was a major flood in ancient China that allegedly continued for at least two generations, which resulted in great population displacements among other disasters, such as storms and famine. People left their homes to live on the high hills and mountains, or nest on the trees.[2] According to mythological and historical sources, it is traditionally dated to the third millennium BCE, or about 2300-2200 BCE, during the reign of Emperor Yao.

However, archaeological evidence of an outburst flood at Jishi Gorge on the Yellow River, comparable to similar severe events in the world in the past 10,000 years, has been dated to about 1920 BCE (a few centuries later than the traditional beginning of the Xia dynasty which came after Emperors Shun and Yao), and is suggested to have been the basis for the myth.[3]

The Gilgamesh flood myth is a flood myth in the Epic of Gilgamesh. Many scholars believe that the flood myth was added to Tablet XI in the "standard version" of the Gilgamesh Epic by an editor who used the flood story from the Epic of Atrahasis.[1] A short reference to the flood myth is also present in the much older Sumerian Gilgamesh poems, from which the later Babylonian versions drew much of their inspiration and subject matter.

That's correct. The flood myth in the Epic of Gilgamesh is a well-known episode in the ancient Mesopotamian epic. It is believed that the flood story was incorporated into Tablet XI of the "standard version" of the Gilgamesh Epic by an editor who drew upon the flood narrative found in the Epic of Atrahasis.
The flood myth in Gilgamesh shares similarities with other ancient flood myths, including the story of Noah's Ark in the Bible. It depicts a great flood sent by the gods to wipe out humanity due to their noisy and chaotic behavior. The gods' decision to send the flood is motivated by their desire to restore order and control over humanity.
In the story, the hero Gilgamesh is warned about the impending flood by the god Ea, who advises him to build a boat to save himself and his companions. After the flood subsides, Gilgamesh and his companion Utnapishtim are granted immortality by the gods.
The flood myth in the Epic of Gilgamesh also has earlier roots in Sumerian literature. References to a flood story can be found in the Sumerian poems about Gilgamesh, which predate the Babylonian versions of the epic. These Sumerian poems served as a source of inspiration and subject matter for the later Babylonian versions of the epic.
The flood myth in the Epic of Gilgamesh is significant because it provides insight into the ancient Mesopotamian worldview and their understanding of divine punishment and the relationship between gods and humans. It is an important literary and cultural artifact that has influenced subsequent flood narratives in different civilizations throughout history.

Taking place, according to its incipit, ���when gods were in the ways of men," Tablet I of Atra-Hasis contains the creation myth of Anu, Enlil, and Enki���the Sumerian gods of sky, wind, and water. Following the cleromancy ('casting of lots'), the sky is ruled by Anu, Earth by Enlil, and the freshwater sea by Enki.[ii]

Enlil, god of Earth, assigned junior dingirs (Sumerian: ����, lit.���'divines')[iii] to do farm labor, as well as maintain the rivers and canals. After 40 years, however, the lesser dingirs rebelled and refused to do strenuous labor. Enki, who is also the kind, wise counselor of the gods, suggested that rather than punishing these rebels, humans should be created to do such work, instead. The mother goddess Mami is subsequently assigned the task of creating humans by shaping clay figurines mixed with the flesh and blood of the slain god Geshtu-E ('ear' or 'wisdom'; 'a god who had intelligence').[iv] All the gods, in turn, spit upon the clay.

In Tablet I of the Atra-Hasis epic, which begins with the phrase "when gods were in the ways of men," the creation myth of the Sumerian gods Anu, Enlil, and Enki is described. Through the process of cleromancy, the gods determine their domains: Anu rules the sky, Enlil rules the Earth, and Enki rules over the freshwater sea.
Enlil, as the god of Earth, assigns junior gods (dingirs) to perform agricultural labor and maintain the rivers and canals. However, after 40 years, these junior gods rebel and refuse to do the strenuous work. Enki, the wise counselor of the gods, suggests a solution: the creation of humans to take on the labor instead of punishing the rebellious gods.
The task of creating humans is assigned to the mother goddess Mami. She shapes clay figurines mixed with the flesh and blood of the slain god Geshtu-E, whose name means 'ear' or 'wisdom' and represents a god with intelligence. All the gods spit upon the clay figurines as a form of blessing. After a gestation period of 10 months, the specially crafted womb breaks open, and humans are born.

Tablet I continues with legends about overpopulation and plagues, mentioning Atra-Hasis only at the end.

Tablet II
Tablet II begins with more human overpopulation. To reduce this population, Enlil sends famine and drought at formulaic intervals of 1200 years. Accordingly, in this epic, Enlil is depicted as a cruel, capricious god, while Enki is depicted as kind and helpful. Enki can be seen to have parallels to Prometheus, in that he is seen as man's benefactor and defies the orders of the other gods when their intentions are malicious towards humans.

Tablet II remains mostly damaged, but it ends with Enlil's decision to destroy humankind with a flood, with Enki bound by oath to keep this plan secret.

In Tablet II of the Atra-Hasis epic, the theme of overpopulation continues. The population of humans keeps increasing, causing concern among the gods. To address this issue, Enlil, depicted as a harsh and arbitrary god in this epic, decides to send famine and drought as a means to reduce the human population. These calamities are inflicted at regular intervals of 1200 years.
In contrast to Enlil's actions, Enki, portrayed as a kind and helpful god, takes a more sympathetic stance toward humanity. He can be compared to Prometheus from Greek mythology, as both are seen as benefactors of humanity and defy the orders of other gods when those orders are harmful to humans.
The details of Tablet II are mostly damaged or missing, but it concludes with Enlil's decision to destroy humankind through a flood. Enki, however, is bound by an oath to keep this plan a secret. This sets the stage for the subsequent development of the flood narrative in the epic.

Enki advises Atra-Hasis to dismantle his house and build a boat in order to escape the impending catastrophe.
Enki provides specific instructions for the construction of the boat. The boat is to have a roof resembling the subterranean freshwater realm known as Abzu or Apsi, which is associated with Enki. It is also to be built with upper and lower decks and sealed with bitumen to ensure its watertightness.
The mention of Enki speaking through a reed wall suggests a form of oracle. An oracle is a person or object believed to provide wise counsel or prophetic predictions, often inspired by deities. In this context, Enki communicates his divine knowledge and guidance to Atra-Hasis through this method.

After seven days, the flood ends and Atra-Hasis offers sacrifices to the gods. Enlil is furious with Enki for violating his oath, but Enki denies doing so: "I made sure life was preserved." In conclusion, Enki and Enlil agree on other means for controlling the human population.

The words "river" and "riverbank" are used in Tablet III,[4] probably in reference to the Euphrates, the river upon which the ancient city Shuruppak, ruled by Atra-Hasis,[5] was located.

Enlil, upon realizing that Atra-Hasis and his family have survived, becomes furious with Enki for revealing the plan to Atra-Hasis and violating his oath to keep it a secret. Enki defends his actions, claiming that he ensured the preservation of life.
In the aftermath of the flood, Enki and Enlil reach an agreement to find alternative means of controlling the human population, recognizing that such drastic measures as a flood are not sustainable.
The mention of the words "river" and "riverbank" in Tablet III likely refers to the Euphrates River, which was associated with the ancient city of Shuruppak, ruled by Atra-Hasis. This provides a geographical context for the events described in the epic.

You are correct that some of the advice in the Instructions of Shuruppak may not align with contemporary values or be universally applicable. For example, the instruction not to question the words of one's mother or personal god can be seen as promoting blind obedience rather than encouraging critical thinking.
The mention of the importance of fathers and their reliable words without corresponding emphasis on the role of mothers may also be viewed as biased and unbalanced.
The statement that a city without suburbs has no center can be interpreted as limiting the definition and value of urban spaces, disregarding the diverse and evolving nature of cities.
The advice regarding fields at the bottom of embankments may reflect the practical considerations of the time, but its relevance in a broader context can be questioned.
The unclear lines and references to specific locations and cultural contexts may limit the applicability and understanding of those particular passages.
Despite these limitations, it is important to consider the Instructions of Shuruppak within their historical and cultural context. They provide insights into the social and moral norms of ancient Sumerian society and can be seen as a reflection of the values and beliefs prevalent during that time.

Once upon a time, in the ancient city of Shuruppak, there lived a man named Atrahasis. Atrahasis was known for his wisdom and his close relationship with the god Enki. One day, while Atrahasis was offering his prayers at the temple, Enki appeared to him in a dream.
Enki spoke to Atrahasis, saying, "A great flood is coming that will destroy all life on earth. But I have a plan to save you and your family. I want you to build a massive ark, a floating sanctuary that will withstand the deluge and keep you safe."
Atrahasis, filled with awe and a sense of purpose, immediately set to work. He gathered the finest craftsmen in the city and instructed them to build a colossal ark according to Enki's instructions. The ark was to be made of sturdy timber, sealed with pitch, and designed to withstand the raging waters.
As the days and weeks passed, the ark took shape. Atrahasis tirelessly supervised the construction, ensuring that every detail was attended to. People from all around Shuruppak came to witness this extraordinary undertaking, amazed by the size and grandeur of the ark.
Meanwhile, word of the impending flood began to spread throughout the city. Many people scoffed at the idea, dismissing it as mere superstition. But Atrahasis remained steadfast, urging everyone to heed the warning and seek refuge aboard the ark.
The day finally arrived when the dark clouds gathered, and the heavens opened up. Torrential rain poured down, and the rivers swelled, engulfing the land. Chaos ensued as people desperately sought higher ground, but Atrahasis and his family found solace within the ark.
Inside the ark, Atrahasis had gathered pairs of animals, both great and small, ensuring their survival as well. Lions and lambs, birds and beasts, all coexisted peacefully within the vessel, guided by some divine force that brought harmony amidst the chaos.
For many days and nights, the ark sailed upon the vast and turbulent waters. Atrahasis and his family, along with the animals, trusted in Enki's guidance and provision. They weathered the storm, comforted by the knowledge that they were fulfilling a greater purpose.
Finally, as the floodwaters began to recede, the ark came to rest on the slopes of a great mountain. Atrahasis, filled with gratitude and awe, offered sacrifices to the gods for their protection and guidance. The divine beings looked upon Atrahasis with favor, knowing that he had preserved life on earth through his unwavering faith and obedience.
From that day forward, Atrahasis and his descendants became the stewards of the earth, tasked with safeguarding its creatures and nurturing its beauty. The story of Atrahasis' ark spread far and wide, becoming a beacon of hope and a reminder of the power of resilience and divine intervention.
And so, the legacy of Atrahasis lived on, as a testament to the enduring spirit of humanity and its ability to overcome the greatest challenges. The ark of Atrahasis became a symbol of survival, renewal, and the profound connection between humans and the natural world.

In the ancient city of Shuruppak, the world was filled with corruption and chaos. The gods, angered by the actions of humankind, decided to bring forth a catastrophic flood to wipe out all life on earth. Among the people of Shuruppak, there was a wise and righteous man named Atra-Hasis.
One day, as Atra-Hasis was contemplating the state of the world, he heard a mysterious voice coming from a reed wall. It was the voice of Enki, the god of wisdom and water. Enki spoke to Atra-Hasis, revealing the terrible plan of Enlil, the chief god, to destroy humanity through a devastating flood.
Enki instructed Atra-Hasis to dismantle his house and build a large boat, an ark, in which he and his family could seek refuge. Atra-Hasis heeded the divine warning and immediately set to work. He gathered skilled craftsmen and laborers, and together they began constructing the ark according to Enki's precise instructions.
As the ark took shape, the people of Shuruppak watched in curiosity and disbelief. They mocked Atra-Hasis for his strange actions and the seemingly senseless endeavor. But Atra-Hasis remained steadfast, knowing that he was following the will of the gods.
When the ark was finally completed, Atra-Hasis loaded it with provisions and gathered his family and a pair of every living creature to ensure their survival. As the dark clouds gathered and the rain started to fall, Atra-Hasis and his companions boarded the ark, sealing the door behind them.
The heavens unleashed their fury, and the floodwaters surged, covering the land. The ark was tossed and turned by the relentless waves, but it remained steadfast and secure. Inside the ark, Atra-Hasis and his family sought solace and protection, while the world outside was consumed by the wrath of the gods.
For many days and nights, the flood raged on, and the ark drifted upon the vast and treacherous waters. Atra-Hasis and his family experienced fear, uncertainty, and the anguish of witnessing the destruction of all they had known. Yet, they held onto hope, trusting in the divine guidance that had led them to this moment.
Finally, as the fury of the flood began to subside, the ark came to rest on a mountaintop. Atra-Hasis and his family emerged from the ark, greeted by a transformed world. They offered prayers and sacrifices to the gods, expressing their gratitude for their survival and the chance to begin anew.
Atra-Hasis, now burdened with the responsibility of rebuilding humanity, established new laws and regulations to guide the people in leading a more righteous and harmonious existence. The story of the flood and the heroic actions of Atra-Hasis served as a reminder of the consequences of human actions and the need for humility and respect towards the gods and the natural order of things.
And so, the tale of Atra-Hasis' ark became a cautionary tale, a testament to the consequences of human folly and the power of divine intervention. It served as a reminder that even in the face of overwhelming challenges and impending disaster, the righteous could find redemption and the possibility of a new beginning.

lesser gods rebel against their workload. Enlil suggests that the rebels be punished, but Enki, the wise counselor of the gods, suggests an alternative solution ��� humanity should do the hard labor.

To create humanity to relieve the lesser gods of their workload, a god named Geshtu-E is sacrificed. The goddess Nintu (also called Mami) uses Geshtu-E's blood and flesh, mixing it with clay to form seven women and seven men ��� the first human beings. These workers take on the labor of the lesser gods, and for some time, the greater gods enjoy the peace of having workers who do not rebel. After 600 years, the humans had significantly multiplied and made so much noise that they were disturbing the gods.

"The country was noisy as a bellowing bull,

The God grew restless at their racket..."

Enlil, particularly, is bothered by the noise of the humans, so he decides to send a plague to lessen the population. As humanity endures a plague of sickness, they lament to Enki about the plague and ask what can be done to lessen the people's suffering. Enki tells them that refusing to worship the gods and goddesses would ease their suffering.

In the ancient times of Sumer, the gods and goddesses had created humanity to relieve themselves of their toil and labor. The humans thrived and multiplied, but their growing numbers and constant noise began to disturb the peace of the gods. Enlil, the chief god, grew restless and decided to send a plague upon the people to lessen their population and quiet their clamor.
As the plague swept through the land, causing sickness and suffering, the people turned to Enki, the wise counselor of the gods, seeking guidance and relief from their affliction. Compassionate towards the plight of humanity, Enki offered them a solution.
He told the people that if they stopped worshiping the gods and goddesses, the divine beings would be appeased, and their suffering would lessen. Enki understood that the noise and clamor of human worship were what bothered Enlil, and by ceasing their worship, the people could find respite from the plague.
Word spread among the people, and many chose to follow Enki's advice. They stopped offering prayers and sacrifices to the gods, hoping to ease their suffering. As the worship declined, the gods noticed the absence of reverence and felt a diminishing of their power.
Enlil, however, soon realized that the people had ceased their worship not out of respect for the gods but to alleviate their own suffering. This angered him, and he decided to take further action to punish humanity for their defiance.
Enlil called for a council of the gods to discuss a suitable punishment for the disobedient humans. Ideas were proposed, ranging from bringing forth a great flood to outright annihilating humanity. But Enki, the advocate of humanity, proposed a different solution.
He argued that complete destruction was not necessary, as it would also eradicate the labor force that the gods relied upon. Instead, he suggested that a natural disaster, a flood, be sent to cleanse the earth and reduce the population, allowing the remaining humans to learn from their mistakes and start anew.
The gods agreed with Enki's proposal, and preparations were made for the impending flood. Enki, however, decided to help humanity survive this cataclysmic event. Through the reed wall of his dwelling, he communicated with a man named Atra-Hasis, warning him of the impending flood and instructing him to build a massive boat, an ark, to save himself, his family, and various animals.
Atra-Hasis diligently followed Enki's instructions and constructed the ark. When the flood came, it engulfed the land, causing destruction and upheaval. But within the safety of the ark, Atra-Hasis and his companions weathered the storm, preserving the seed of humanity.
After the floodwaters receded and the ark came to rest, Atra-Hasis and his family emerged, grateful for their survival. They offered sacrifices and prayers to the gods, acknowledging their power and authority. The gods, too, were appeased by the preservation of humanity and the realization that they still needed the labor and devotion of their creations.
Thus, the story of Atrahasis' ark became a testament to the delicate balance between gods and humans, and the consequences of both disobedience and compassion. It underscored the power of divine guidance and the importance of human resilience in the face of adversity. And it served as a reminder that even in the harshest of times, there is always hope for a new beginning and a chance to rebuild.

Humanity refuses to worship and sends an offering to shame the gods. Eventually, the plague is lifted. After another 600 years, the humans grow numerous again, and their noise begins to bother Enlil once more; he decides to send drought and famine to cull the population. Once again, Enki advises the humans on what to do, and they rebel and shame the gods until the drought and famine are lifted. Enlil continues to send famine and drought onto the humans until he decides to finally end humanity in a great flood over all the earth. Enki, who had continually aided the humans against Enlil's plagues and curses, is bound by an oath to keep the secret so humanity would finally be destroyed.

Enki, who cares for humanity, warns his favored servant Atrahasis of the gods' plot to destroy humanity. He instructs Atrahasis, a good and moral human, to take two of every animal onto an ark so that they will survive the flood. Atrahasis does as he is instructed and survives the flood. The gods, believing they have destroyed humanity, are overcome with remorse. They weep for the destroyed humans, and even Enlil, who had tried many times to cull humanity, is filled with guilt and regret. After the flood, however, Atrahasis emerges from the ark and makes a sacrifice to the gods, who realize what Enki has done. Though he was mourning for the humans he destroyed, Enlil was enraged at Enki's betrayal.

Enlil confronts Enki about his betrayal and accuses him of going against their divine order. Enki defends his actions, arguing that he acted out of compassion and a desire to preserve the human race. He explains that humanity serves a purpose and that their existence is essential for the gods' own needs and prosperity.
Despite Enki's explanation, Enlil is filled with anger and seeks to punish both Enki and Atrahasis. However, the other gods intervene and convince Enlil to show mercy. They recognize the value of humanity and the wisdom of Enki's actions. Enlil reluctantly agrees, realizing that the survival of humanity is intertwined with the fate of the gods.
Atrahasis, grateful for his survival and the continuation of humanity, continues to worship the gods and offer sacrifices. The gods, moved by his devotion and resilience, bestow their favor upon him and his descendants. Atrahasis becomes known as the hero who defied the will of the gods for the sake of humanity.
The story of Atrahasis' ark serves as a profound lesson about the complexities of the relationship between gods and humans. It showcases the power struggles, conflicts, and moments of compassion that exist within the divine realm. It also emphasizes the significance of human agency and the potential for individuals to challenge and shape their own destinies.
Ultimately, Atrahasis' ark becomes a symbol of hope and resilience, a testament to the indomitable spirit of humanity in the face of adversity. It stands as a reminder that even when the gods themselves decree destruction, there is always the possibility of survival, renewal, and the triumph of compassion over harsh judgment.

The gods accept Atrahasis' sacrifice and come to a new agreement about humanity ��� they should not be destroyed, but population-control measures are put in place. Some women will no longer be able to conceive children, women who remain virgins to demonstrate piety to the gods, and there will be demons that snatch away children. All these measures are taken so that humanity would not become so numerous again that their noise would disturb the gods.

After the events of the flood and Atrahasis' survival, the gods convene to discuss the future of humanity. They agree that outright destruction is not the solution, but measures must be taken to control the population and maintain harmony between gods and humans.
As part of the new agreement, certain restrictions are placed on human fertility. Some women are no longer able to conceive children, ensuring that not all unions result in offspring. Additionally, there is a call for a group of women to remain celibate as an act of devotion and piety towards the gods. These virgins symbolize a commitment to the divine order and serve as a reminder of the need for moderation and control.
To further limit population growth, the gods introduce the presence of demons who snatch away children. These demons act as a form of natural selection, taking away some offspring and preventing an exponential increase in the human population. The fear and loss associated with the demons serve as a reminder of the delicate balance that must be maintained between gods and humans.
Through these population-control measures, the gods seek to prevent the recurrence of the excessive noise and disturbances caused by an overpopulated humanity. By maintaining a balance and keeping the population in check, the gods hope to establish a harmonious coexistence between themselves and the human race.
While these measures may seem harsh and restrictive, they reflect the belief that moderation and order are essential for the well-being of both gods and humans. The story of Atrahasis' ark serves as a cautionary tale about the consequences of unchecked growth and the importance of finding equilibrium in the relationship between divine powers and mortal beings.

Indeed, there are some similarities between the Atrahasis flood myth and the story of the Tower of Babel from the Book of Genesis in the Bible. Both narratives explore themes of human rebellion, divine intervention, and the consequences of human aspirations.
In the story of the Tower of Babel, humanity is united in their desire to build a tower that reaches the heavens, defying God's authority. God, seeing this act of defiance, confuses their languages and scatters them across the earth, effectively disrupting their unified efforts and limiting their ability to work together.
Similarly, in the Atrahasis flood myth, humanity becomes numerous and noisy, disturbing the gods. The gods respond by sending plagues, droughts, and ultimately a flood to control the human population and silence their noise.
Both stories can be seen as cautionary tales about the limits of human ambition and the consequences of challenging divine authority. They highlight the delicate balance between gods and humans, and the potential consequences of overstepping boundaries.
Additionally, both narratives emphasize the importance of communication and unity. In the Tower of Babel story, the confusion of languages hinders human cooperation, while in the Atrahasis flood myth, the gods implement measures to control the population and maintain order.
Overall, while the stories have different cultural and religious contexts, they share common themes of human rebellion, divine intervention, and the need for balance and moderation in the relationship between gods and humanity.

The Old Man Told Us: Excerpts from Micmac History, 1500-1950. Ruth Holmes Whitehead, Nimbus Publishing, 1991.

Before the earth was new, the sun was all that existed in the great universe. The sun divided the earth into several parts separated by many great lakes. In each part he caused one man and one woman to be born. They bore children and lived for many years. Wickedness pervaded in this family, and slowly they killed one another. The sun wept and wept with grief. The tears became rain that fell from the skies until water covered the entire earth. The family had to set sail in bark canoes to save themselves from the flood. A violent wind overturned their boats. All perished in the sea, but the old man and the old woman, who were best of all people, and it was they who populated the earth.

The Legend of Queneesh
Queneesh is the K��moks name for the gleaming white glacier which can be seen from all over the Comox Valley. The Legend
of Queneesh tells us how a great white whale saved the K'��moks people. It began long ago when the K'��moks people stilived
in big cedar plank houses along the shores of Puntledge River estuary.
One night an elder of the village, Quoi qwa lak, had a powerful dream. It warned him of a coming time when the rain would fall
for many days and nights. In his dream he was told that this rain would cause a great flood and the K'��moks people would be
in danger.
In order for them to survive the flood, they would have to make canoes, cedar bark rope and clothing and preserve food for the
coming disaster. Gye gya janook, Chief of the K'��moks, directed all of the people of the village to work together so that they
would be ready when the rain began to fall.
Quoi qwa lak himself supervised the making of a strong cedar bark rope that was many miles in length. The rope had to be
long enough to reach from the village to the top of the glacier.
As foretold, the rains began to fall just as everything was ready. The river rose rapidly to flood stage. Young men carried the
long cedar rope from the village to the mountains and attached it s ecurely to the glacier. The people tied their loaded canoes
to the rope so they wouldn't get swept away to sea by the flood waters
Soon the land was covered with water and still it continued to rain. The people were afraid as the water continued to rise up to
the glacier where they had anchored their canoes. Suddenly the glacier began to float, breaking up through the rising waters
like a giant grey whale breeching . The people were awestruck as they watched the glacier become a huge white whale.
"Queneesh, Queneesh!" they called. Queneesh almost floated free of the mountain, but the rain stopped and the flood waters
began to recede. The K'��moks people were saved. Some are still heard to whisper to him "Kwo la whee gai, Queneesh". "Thank you"

It seems like you're referring to a different context or specific song where the flood story is being used metaphorically or symbolically. Without more information about the specific song or context you're referring to, I'm unable to provide a detailed response. However, if the flood story is being used metaphorically, it could represent a situation where someone is preparing for or anticipating an event or change that others may not understand or believe in. The idea of being seen as a "lark" suggests that others may view the person's actions as unconventional or unnecessary. This interpretation could convey a sense of individuality, resilience, or the importance of being prepared even when others may not see the need.

Thank you for providing the lyrics. This song seems to be a simplified and rhyming version of the biblical story of Noah and the Great Flood. The commonalities between this song and the flood stories we have discussed include:
The construction of an ark: In both the biblical story of Noah and this song, the central figure, Noah, builds an ark as a means of protection against the impending flood.
The disbelief or skepticism of the people: In the song, it is mentioned that the people thought Noah was "a lark," meaning they didn't take him seriously and didn't believe in the impending flood. This disbelief is also present in many flood stories where the warnings of a flood or disaster are often ignored or dismissed by the general population.
The arrival of the rain: The song emphasizes the downpour of rain, which is a key element in flood narratives. The rain is often depicted as torrential, indicating the magnitude and intensity of the flood event.
The salvation of a small group: In the biblical story, Noah, along with his family, are the only ones who enter the ark and are saved from the flood. Similarly, the song mentions that "only eight were saved," referring to Noah and his family.
These commonalities highlight some recurring themes in flood stories, such as the need for preparedness, the challenge of convincing others about an impending disaster, and the idea of a chosen few being saved from the catastrophe.

Connections with the following: In the monastery, Bruno wrote a story he called "On Noah's Ark" in which the donkeys, who represented the monks, moaned about their assigned place in the ark.

Donkeys, who were known for their hard work and dedication, found themselves assigned to the lower ark, while more majestic animals such as lions and elephants luxuriated in the higher places.

The donkeys protested and asked about the fairness of this arrangement, but the manager of the ark, a clever and charismatic fox, convinced them that this was the natural order of things and that their work was necessary for the safety of all the animals in the ark.

As they progressed along the way, the fox and his band of pigs acquired power and privileges for themselves, while the donkeys bore heavy burdens.

The foxes made decisions that benefited themselves, but the donkeys realized that they had been abused.

The donkeys decided to unite and overthrow the foxes, but the foxes, clever and united, quelled the rebellion and retained power.

The donkeys remained frustrated and tired, but they knew they could not stop fighting for justice and equality.

Bruno's story made a powerful commentary on the dynamics of power and oppression and the importance of resisting injustice, no matter how difficult.

The story was widely read and discussed among the monks and had a great impact on their understanding of the world and their place in it.

Also, Bruno had ideas about life on other worlds and explored them in his writings. He was among the first who thought about such things.

The story "On Noah's Ark" written by Bruno in the monastery draws connections to the theme of power dynamics and resistance against oppression seen in the biblical flood story. In this story, the donkeys symbolize the monks and represent the working class who find themselves in a lower position while others enjoy privileges and luxuries.
The clever and charismatic fox, representing those in power, manipulates the donkeys by justifying the unfair arrangement and convincing them of its necessity. This reflects the exploitation and manipulation often seen in hierarchical systems. As the foxes gain more power and the donkeys bear heavy burdens, a sense of injustice arises among the donkeys.
The donkeys' attempt to unite and overthrow the foxes represents their collective struggle against oppression and their desire for justice and equality. However, the foxes, with their cunning and unity, suppress the rebellion and maintain their hold on power.
Bruno's story serves as a commentary on the dynamics of power, oppression, and the importance of resistance. It highlights the need to challenge unjust systems and fight for a more equitable society, even in the face of obstacles and difficulties.
Furthermore, Bruno's exploration of life on other worlds demonstrates his pioneering ideas and curiosity about the existence of extraterrestrial life. His writings on this subject contributed to the early development of such thinking and expanded the understanding of the world and humanity's place in the universe.
Overall, Bruno's story intertwines themes of power, resistance, and curiosity about the unknown, providing insightful commentary on societal dynamics and raising thought-provoking questions about the nature of existence.

Indeed, there are similarities between Bruno's story "On Noah's Ark" and George Orwell's "Animal Farm." Both stories utilize animals as allegorical figures to depict power dynamics and social commentary.
In both narratives, the animals represent different social groups or classes, and their interactions mirror human society and its struggles with power and inequality. The donkeys in Bruno's story and the various animals in "Animal Farm" serve as symbols for oppressed or marginalized groups.
Both stories also highlight the manipulation and exploitation of the working class by those in power. The fox and the pigs in Bruno's story, and the pigs in "Animal Farm," take advantage of their positions to gain privileges and control over others.
The themes of resistance and rebellion against oppression are present in both narratives. The donkeys' attempts to challenge the foxes in Bruno's story and the animals' uprising against the pigs in "Animal Farm" reflect the desire for justice and equality among the oppressed.
While Bruno's story predates "Animal Farm," it can be seen as an early exploration of similar themes and allegorical storytelling. Both works shed light on the complexities of power, human nature, and the struggle for a more equitable society.
By using animals as representatives of social groups, both stories provide a critique of unjust systems and offer reflections on the human condition. They encourage readers to question authority, challenge oppression, and strive for a fairer and more just society.

So can you see parallels between Noah and the donkeys in Bruno's story
1 / 1
ChatGPT
ChatGPT
Yes, parallels can be drawn between the biblical figure of Noah and the donkeys in Bruno's story "On Noah's Ark." Both Noah and the donkeys face similar challenges and experiences in their respective narratives.
Firstly, both Noah and the donkeys find themselves in a position where they question the fairness and distribution of resources within their respective contexts. Noah, as the builder of the ark, is responsible for organizing and assigning places for the animals. Similarly, the donkeys in Bruno's story question the allocation of spaces within the ark, with the more majestic animals occupying privileged positions.
Secondly, both Noah and the donkeys are confronted with the manipulation and exploitation of power. In Bruno's story, the fox and his band of pigs acquire power and privileges for themselves while subjecting the donkeys to burdensome tasks. Similarly, in the biblical narrative, Noah is portrayed as a just and righteous figure, while others abuse their power and act against the principles of fairness and equality.
Furthermore, both Noah and the donkeys face resistance and a desire for justice. In the biblical story, Noah is tasked with preserving humanity and the animal kingdom, representing a sense of responsibility and justice in the face of destruction. The donkeys, in Bruno's story, recognize the need to challenge the unfair distribution of power and privileges within the ark, reflecting a similar desire for justice and equality.

Actually it reminds me of this: The Responsibility of Intellectuals
Noam Chomsky
The New York Review of Books, February 23, 1967
TWENTY-YEARS AGO, Dwight Macdonald published a series of articles in Politics on the responsibility of peoples and, specifically, the responsibility of intellectuals. I read them as an undergraduate, in the years just after the war, and had occasion to read them again a few months ago.

Lorenzo: Well, Noah, it's hard to say. As a llama, I have the gift of observation, and I've noticed some tensions brewing between the donkeys, foxes, and lions lately. They've had their disagreements and power struggles, but a full-blown coup? That would be quite extraordinary.

Noah: Indeed, Lorenzo, power dynamics can be unpredictable, and alliances can shift in the blink of an eye. But let us not be too hasty in drawing conclusions. Instead, let us encourage dialogue and understanding between the animals.

Lorenzo: Wise words, Noah. It is through open communication that misunderstandings can be resolved and conflicts can be prevented. Perhaps, if we bring the donkeys, foxes, and lions together, we can foster an atmosphere of cooperation and harmony.

Noah: A splendid idea, Lorenzo. We shall gather them for a meeting, where each party can share their grievances and aspirations. By creating a space for open discourse, we may uncover the root causes of their animosity and find ways to mend their relationships.

Lorenzo: I'm glad you agree, Noah. Our role as observers and caretakers of these creatures goes beyond merely tending to their physical needs. We have the responsibility to foster unity and peace among them.

Noah and Lorenzo set their plan into motion, arranging a meeting where the donkeys, foxes, and lions could voice their concerns and aspirations. Through patient dialogue and a willingness to understand one another, the barnyard animals discovered that their grievances were born out of misunderstandings and miscommunications.

In the end, the donkeys, foxes, and lions realized the futility of their power struggles and chose a path of cooperation and mutual respect. The barnyard became a harmonious place, where diverse animals coexisted and worked together for the greater good.

Fiorenzo di Lorenzo (c. 1440 ��� 1522) was an Italian painter, of the Umbrian school. He lived and worked at Perugia,[1] where most of his authentic works are still preserved in the Galleria Nazionale dell'Umbria.[2]


The Adoration of the Magi (c. 1490) Tempera on panel, 151 x 209 cm Galleria Nazionale dell'Umbria, Perugia
Fiorenzo is known from a few signed works, including the Madonna of the Recommended (1476) and a niche with lunette, two wings and predella (1487), as well as from the documentary evidence that he was decemvir of that city in 1472, in which year he entered into a contract to paint an altarpiece for the church of Santa Maria Nuova, the pentatych of the Madonna and Saints.[1]

Of his birth and death and pupilage nothing is known.[3] Renaissance art biographer Giorgio Vasari does not even mention Fiorenzo's name, though he probably refers to him when he says that Cristofano, Perugino's father, sent his son to be the shop drudge of a painter in Perugia, who was not particularly distinguished in his calling, but held the art in great veneration and highly honoured the men who excelled therein. Certain it is that the early works both of Perugino and of Pinturicchio show certain mannerisms which point towards Fiorenzo's influence, if not to his direct teaching.[1

Fiorenzo di Lorenzo was an Italian painter who belonged to the Umbrian school during the Renaissance period. He resided and worked primarily in Perugia, where many of his authentic artworks are still preserved in the Galleria Nazionale dell'Umbria.
While only a few signed works by Fiorenzo di Lorenzo are known, including the Madonna of the Recommended (1476) and a niche with lunette, two wings, and predella (1487), there is documentary evidence that he served as a decemvir (member of a council) in Perugia in 1472. In that same year, he entered into a contract to paint an altarpiece for the church of Santa Maria Nuova, known as the pentatych of the Madonna and Saints.
Unfortunately, little is known about Fiorenzo's personal life, including his birth, death, and apprenticeship. Notably, the renowned art biographer Giorgio Vasari does not mention Fiorenzo's name specifically. However, Vasari does mention that Cristofano, the father of the painter Perugino, sent his son to work in the shop of a painter in Perugia who held the art in high regard but was not particularly distinguished. It is speculated that Vasari may be referring to Fiorenzo di Lorenzo in this passage, suggesting that Fiorenzo had an influence, if not direct teaching, on both Perugino and Pinturicchio, as seen in their early works.
Fiorenzo di Lorenzo's artistry played a role in shaping the artistic development of the Umbrian school, and his works continue to be appreciated and studied within the context of Renaissance painting in Perugia.

The Lorentz factor, also known as the Lorentz term, is a fundamental quantity in the theory of special relativity. It quantifies the relativistic effects that occur when an object is moving relative to an observer. The Lorentz factor appears in various equations and plays a crucial role in the formulation of the Lorentz transformations.
The Lorentz factor arises from the work of the Dutch physicist Hendrik Lorentz, who made significant contributions to the understanding of electromagnetism and the theory of relativity. Lorentzian electrodynamics, named after Hendrik Lorentz, was a precursor to Einstein's theory of special relativity.
In special relativity, the Lorentz factor, denoted by the symbol �� (gamma), is defined as:
�� = 1 / ���(1 - (v^2/c^2))
where v is the velocity of the object relative to the observer, and c is the speed of light in a vacuum. The Lorentz factor represents how much time dilation, length contraction, and other relativistic effects occur as an object's velocity approaches the speed of light.
The Lorentz factor appears in many important equations of special relativity, such as the time dilation formula, length contraction formula, relativistic momentum, and relativistic energy. It provides a mathematical description of the deviations from classical physics that occur at high velocities.
The Lorentz factor is a crucial concept in understanding the fundamental principles of special relativity and is used extensively in various areas of physics, including particle physics, astrophysics, and cosmology. It highlights the profound changes that occur in physical measurements as an object's velocity approaches the speed of light, leading to the redefinition of our understanding of space, time, and the nature of motion.

Is there an anthropic bias
1 / 1
ChatGPT
ChatGPT
Anthropic bias refers to the idea that our observations and perceptions of the universe are inherently biased by the fact that we are human beings who exist within it. This bias arises from the consideration that our observations are limited to the conditions necessary for our existence, and therefore, we are more likely to observe a universe that is compatible with life.
In the context of storytelling and narratives, anthropic bias can play a role in shaping the stories we tell and how we perceive them. Our human experiences, beliefs, and values influence the themes, characters, and conflicts we find compelling or relatable. This can result in certain biases in the stories we create or engage with, as they often reflect our human-centered perspectives.
For example, many myths and legends revolve around human protagonists, with humans being the central focus of the narrative. This anthropocentric bias is rooted in our tendency to prioritize human experiences and perspectives. Similarly, stories often explore themes of human potential, morality, and interpersonal relationships, reflecting our intrinsic interests and concerns as humans.
However, it's important to recognize that storytelling also has the capacity to transcend anthropic bias. Stories can explore diverse perspectives, delve into non-human experiences, and challenge our anthropocentric tendencies. They can offer imaginative and thought-provoking narratives that expand our understanding of the world and our place within it.
Ultimately, the presence of anthropic bias in storytelling should be acknowledged, but it does not necessarily undermine the value or significance of the stories themselves. Instead, it highlights the need for a diverse range of narratives that encompass a broader spectrum of experiences and perspectives, allowing us to explore and appreciate the rich complexity of the world we inhabit.

Why don't we just write stories where everyone dies at the end?
1 / 1
ChatGPT
ChatGPT
While stories with tragic endings or where everyone dies can certainly be powerful and thought-provoking, it's important to consider the purpose and impact of storytelling. Stories serve various functions, including entertainment, escapism, catharsis, and exploration of the human experience. They can inspire, teach, provoke emotions, and provide a sense of meaning and connection.
Writing stories where everyone dies at the end can be a valid artistic choice, but it may limit the range of emotions and experiences that can be explored. Tragic endings can be impactful, but an exclusive focus on such narratives might neglect the potential for hope, resilience, growth, and the complexities of human existence.
Additionally, stories often offer an opportunity for reflection, empathy, and understanding. They can explore various themes, moral dilemmas, and human relationships, helping us make sense of our own lives and the world around us. While tragic endings can be poignant, a balance of different story arcs and outcomes allows for a broader exploration of the human condition.
Ultimately, the choice of how a story ends is up to the writer, but it's important to consider the desired impact on the audience and the overall message or themes being conveyed. A mix of different story endings can provide a more nuanced and diverse narrative landscape, allowing for a range of emotions, perspectives, and experiences to be represented.

What if the Dove never came back? Wouldn't Noah have eventually just opened the  doors?
1 / 1
ChatGPT
ChatGPT
If the dove never returned to Noah's ark, it would certainly create a different scenario and raise questions about when and how Noah would decide to open the doors of the ark.
In the biblical story of Noah's ark, the return of the dove with an olive leaf indicated that the floodwaters were receding and that there was dry land suitable for the inhabitants of the ark. This signified that it was safe for Noah and his family, along with the animals, to leave the ark and begin repopulating the earth.
If the dove did not return, Noah might have had to rely on other signs or observations to determine if the floodwaters had receded. He could have been more cautious and waited longer, perhaps sending out additional scouts or waiting for visual confirmation of dry land. Alternatively, he might have had to make a decision based on his own judgment, trusting that enough time had passed and it was safe to open the doors.
Without the specific guidance of the dove's return, the story would take on a different dynamic, highlighting Noah's resilience, resourcefulness, and ability to adapt to changing circumstances. It could emphasize his role as a wise and discerning leader, making decisions based on his observations and intuition. The absence of the dove's return would introduce an element of uncertainty and challenge, requiring Noah to rely on his own judgment and perhaps face the consequences of his choices.
Ultimately, the story of Noah's ark is a religious and allegorical tale, and its interpretation can vary. The absence of the dove's return would offer a different narrative path, exploring themes of human resilience, faith, and decision-making in the face of uncertainty.

1 / 1
ChatGPT
ChatGPT
The addition of a subplot where Noah gives laws to the animals and Naamah teaches them how to read adds an interesting dimension to the story of Noah's ark. It introduces the idea of civilization and the transmission of knowledge, extending beyond the survival and preservation of species.
In this subplot, Noah assumes a role not only as the caretaker of the animals but also as a wise leader and lawgiver. He imparts a set of rules or guidelines to the animals, establishing a framework for harmonious coexistence within the confines of the ark. These laws could involve principles of cooperation, respect, and order, reflecting the importance of maintaining a balanced and structured society.
Naamah's role as the teacher of reading to the animals further emphasizes the idea of knowledge and education. By teaching the animals how to read, she empowers them with the ability to acquire knowledge, communicate, and understand the world around them. This aspect highlights the importance of literacy and the dissemination of wisdom across different species, fostering a sense of intellectual growth and enlightenment.
The subplot of laws and education within the context of Noah's ark expands the narrative beyond mere survival and presents a vision of a structured and enlightened society even within the confined space of the ark. It adds depth to the characters of Noah and Naamah, showcasing their wisdom, compassion, and commitment to fostering a sense of order and learning amidst the challenges they face.
Overall, this subplot brings forth themes of governance, education, and the potential for intellectual and moral development even in extreme circumstances.

The Wife of Noah: Na���amah (Mother of Demons)

According to Judaism, there are four women who are responsible for bringing all the demonic activity into the Earth. Of course the name Lilith is one of those women but you may be surprised to know that another one of them is Noah's wife whose name was Na'amah, who is mentioned in Genesis 4:22 as the sister of Tubal-Cain.

According to the Rabbis, Naamah was Noah's wife; as her name indicates, her actions were pleasing (ne'imim���Gen. Rabbah 23:3). According to another view, however, she acted improperly, for she beat on a drum and drew people to engage in idolatry, and her musical activity increased corruption among people.

ChatGPT
ChatGPT
I apologize for any confusion, but I should clarify that the portrayal of Naamah as the mother of demons and her involvement in idolatrous activities is not found within the biblical text itself. The information you provided is based on rabbinic interpretations and legends that developed in later Jewish tradition.
In the biblical account of Noah and the ark, Naamah is mentioned in Genesis 4:22 as the sister of Tubal-Cain, a descendant of Cain. However, her role and actions are not elaborated upon in the biblical narrative, leaving much room for interpretation and speculation.
It is important to note that various ancient Jewish texts, such as Midrashim and Talmudic literature, contain a wide range of legends, interpretations, and teachings that expand upon the biblical stories. These texts often present imaginative and allegorical elements that aim to provide moral lessons, theological insights, or cultural explanations.
The depiction of Naamah as a negative figure associated with demonic activity and idolatry likely emerged from these later Jewish traditions and interpretations. It is not a direct part of the biblical narrative but rather a product of the rich storytelling and mythological traditions that developed within Jewish literature.
As with any legends or interpretations, it is essential to approach them with an understanding of their cultural and historical context, recognizing that they reflect the perspectives and beliefs of specific communities and time periods.

Yeah I just saw that post on Facebook it was from a Daniel tiger but I think they mixing up two Naamahs: Naamah (Hebrew: �������������� ��� Na����m��) is an individual mentioned in the Hebrew Bible, in Genesis 4:22. A descendant of Cain, she was the only mentioned daughter of Lamech and Zillah and their youngest mentioned child; her brother was Tubal-cain, while Jabal and Jubal were her half-brothers, sons of Lamech's other wife Adah. She is often conflated with or connected to Naamah of the Zohar, one of the first women to seduce the grigori and birth nephilim.

ChatGPT
ChatGPT
I understand the source of confusion. It appears that there is some conflation and mixing of different figures named Naamah in various sources and interpretations. In the Hebrew Bible, Naamah is mentioned as a descendant of Cain, the daughter of Lamech and Zillah, and the sister of Tubal-Cain, Jabal, and Jubal. However, the biblical account does not provide extensive details about her life or her actions beyond her genealogical connection.
The reference you made to Naamah in the Zohar, a mystical text within Jewish tradition, is part of a different narrative and set of interpretations. The Zohar is a complex work that incorporates various mythological and esoteric elements, including references to fallen angels and their interactions with humans. It is important to note that the Zohar represents a specific strand of Jewish mystical thought and is not considered part of the Hebrew Bible.
Given the diverse nature of religious texts, folklore, and interpretations, it is not uncommon for different sources to associate the same name with different stories and characters. It is essential to approach these interpretations with discernment and to consider the specific context in which they arise.
