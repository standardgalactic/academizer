"The Dispossessed" and science fiction as a fantasy of political agency
So It Turns Out, #52

DAVID KASTEN
AUG 25, 2023
Hi,

So here are some things I���ve been thinking about this week.

"The Dispossessed" and science fiction as a fantasy of political agency
In college, I briefly flirted with Yale���s knockoff of Oxford���s Philosophy, Politics, and Economics (PP&E) major ��� Ethics, Politics, and Economics (EP&E)1. (I later realized that it blocked me from getting pre-registration access to the good Poli Sci seminars, and switched to Political Science.)2

But while briefly in that major, I did have to take a class called ���Classics of Ethics, Politics, and Economics.��� And in that class, I had to read Marx���s Capital, Volume I, and then write an essay about it.

My essay was, frankly, a pretty boring argument that, duh, Marx is wrong about the labor theory of value, and that market values are based on exchange and sentiments.3

My professor gave me some of the most useful feedback I ever received. He told me that the paper deserved an A, but he was giving me an A-, because I hadn���t demonstrated that I had learned anything from the experience of reading Marx ��� I had come away exactly the same opinions I had before.

His criticism was not a reflection of his personal beliefs, or evidence for some sort of conspiracy theory about Marxism in the academy. (Suffice it to say that, ah, this professor has links on his personal web page to sub-pages entitled ���Arendt,��� ���Hobbes,��� and ���Plato��� and their lessons about confronting totalitarianism. A communist, he is very not.) Rather, he was saying that I hadn���t improved my argument at all by coming into contact with someone who believed something very different.

So, the goal of this essay is to avoid repeating that mistake with a book I read recently. I���m sure I disagree with a big chunk of it, but it did teach me some things that I want to share.

The Dispossessed: An Ambiguous Utopia, by Ursula K. Le Guin
It���s hard to explain persuasively in a review format why the book is so compelling. There are, I think, three reasons for that, two that I want to touch on only briefly, and the third that will be the focus of much that follows.

First, it is a work of science fiction, where part of the narrative power comes from experiencing a different way to describe things. The classic example is Robert Heinlein���s, ���the door irised open,��� to emphasize that doors are circular in the future; Le Guin uses similar literary tricks to demonstrate that the characters on Anarres are literally without possessions ��� saying things like ���You can share the handkerchief I use��� instead of, ���you can borrow my handkerchief.��� This is hard to describe more concisely than just block-quoting huge sections of the book.

Second, it���s a book written in 1974. There are just some things about its politics that were radical for its time, but aren���t as much so any longer, like its themes of feminism, equality of the sexes, and casual acceptance of homosexuality. Similarly, the structural intercutting of two time periods in a novel to demonstrate the themes of the work is just less unusual to fiction lovers raised on this trope.4

But third, and most importantly, the book seeks to demonstrate its themes in an intentionally-equivocating way.

The Dispossessed takes place on a moon, Anarres, settled by the descendants of an anarcho-syndicalist revolution, who fled Urras, a planet-kinda-like-ours around the star Tau Ceti. (As a background detail, the book is set in a broader universe where humans were settled around other stars by a collapsed ancient empire, so we���re supposed to think of them as us, not ���Aliens!���)

Our hero, Shevek, is an Anarran physicist trying to develop a general theory that will have a variety of applications; some are for faster-than-light travel, others are for weapons of mass destruction. He believes in the value of reaching out to Urras, and he ultimately travels there to pursue his theories ��� and perhaps, to spread the philosophy of anarchism ��� regardless of the consequences. He faces great condemnation and accusations of disloyalty, and it���s never quite clear what motivates him; for such a smart man, he seems almost lacking in agency. He, ultimately, attempts to drive political change but fails at tremendous cost, and returns home, unsure of what he���s truly changed beyond the frontiers of physics.

(Of course, you scarcely need me to tell you this: Shevek is based on Le Guin���s memories of her parents��� close friend, J. Robert Oppenheimer.5)

On Anarres, everything is run by a series of theoretically-non-hierarchical worker���s syndicates, where there is no property, and at least in theory everything is held in common. You can do whatever job you can convince others to be okay with you doing; your home is assigned to you by the local syndicate based on your needs; you eat in a common dining hall; you can go on vacation when you want.6 And, oh yeah, no one gets to kick up their feet in a mansion: at least one day in ten, you have to go do manual labor to keep society functioning. This is a society where when there���s a famine, everyone starves a little. It does, genuinely, seem to have a sort of social solidarity in Le Guin���s account, and many people do seem to flourish in it.

Meanwhile, back on Urras, society is, ah, grim. The allegedly-not-totalitarian state is run by authoritarian aristocrats that ban women from work outside the home, aggressively censor speech, and routinely machine-gun labor unions. Its geopolitical rival, a totalitarian state, is basically North Korea. Both sides see Shevek purely as an instrument, whose insights are valuable purely for their own geopolitical games on Urras, not their importance to understanding the universe or exploring the galaxy. (Urras isn���t a stand-in for America, or capitalism, or whatever. It���s a stand-in for centralized power.)

But Anarres is, at best the ���ambiguous utopia��� of the subtitle. There���s many things about the consequences of its anarchist blend of voluntarism and communal life that would shock even most far-leftists: parents can abandon children with no consequences; teachers mock students who are too independent-minded; they don���t have jails so they rely on mob violence; and, perhaps most importantly for the philosophical experiment involved, our protagonist the society has the tyranny-of-structurelessness problem, where there is plenty of hierarchy that can ruin your life, it���s just more opaque. And there are famines, there.

In other words: ���I���m not sure,��� said the comfortable former management consultant, ���that I would move there.���

How surprising, David.

Care to play for getting that minus removed from the grading sheet?

So what did I learn about the world from reading this book?

Another great science fiction author, Lois McMaster Bujold, once gave a Guest of Honor speech where she argued:

In fact, if romances are fantasies of love, and mysteries are fantasies of justice, I would now describe much SF as fantasies of political agency. All three genres also may embody themes of personal psychological empowerment, of course, though often very different in the details, as contrasted by the way the heroines ���win��� in romances, the way detectives ���win��� in mysteries, and the way, say, young male characters ���win��� in adventure tales. But now that I���ve noticed the politics in SF, they seem to be everywhere, like packs of little yapping dogs trying to savage your ankles. Not universally, thank heavens���there are wonderful lyrical books such as The Last Unicorn or other idiosyncratic tales that escape the trend. But certainly in the majority of books, to give the characters significance in the readers��� eyes means to give them political actions, with ���military��� read here as a sub-set of political.

But unlike many other stories of around its time period, our hero Shevek seems to lack the sort of agency that we���d expect from a Science Fiction hero. He���s almost our passive Virgil, giving us a tour of hell, limbo, and heaven, rather than enacting a cunning plan to change it. He talks big about anarchism, but has no real idea about how to change Urras when he visits it, and no real plan for how to use the leverage of the theory he has in his head to do anything.

The fantasy, I want to suggest, isn���t about him.

The fantasy is that us ��� the readers ��� have the ability to avoid becoming people like this:

The point of The Dispossessed, I think, isn���t for us to vote on whether possessions are good, or hierarchy is bad7, or any of that stuff. Great college common room fodder, but not what this essay is about.8

The point is to say this: right now, you actually live in a society where you actually have agency. You actually have the ability to decide whether you���re going to be involved in whatever thing matters to you ��� organizing it, doing it, maintaining it, and occasionally mucking out its stables ��� and be a part of shaping your community. Or you can choose to become the sort of person who says the real fight is over which low-status group you want to force to do it instead of you, while you sit back and shoulder no moral responsibility for what results.

Which one are you going to choose?

I���m looking for new opportunities; I���ve been especially successful in the past in corporate strategy and consulting roles where I work closely with technical, product and legal experts, and am looking for similar for my next role. I���m open to a range of different industries, but am especially interested in organizations where I can help keep people safe from bad guys, and/or help them get easier access to government services and benefits that they deserve. If you���re aware of an interesting opportunity, I���d love to chat with you and learn more.

David Kasten���s reflections on "The Dispossessed" by Ursula K. Le Guin explore the novel���s nuanced portrayal of political agency through science fiction. The book���s setting on the anarchist moon Anarres and the authoritarian planet Urras offers a complex landscape where political and social structures are examined. Kasten contrasts his previous academic experience of critiquing Marx without gaining new insights, using this novel as a springboard to engage deeply with its ideas.
Kasten appreciates Le Guin's ability to depict an alternative reality that challenges readers to think about their political agency. He highlights the ambiguous nature of Anarres as a society with both utopian and dystopian elements, reflecting the imperfections and challenges of real-world attempts at creating a perfect society. Shevek, the protagonist, embodies this ambiguity, struggling with his agency and the consequences of his actions.
Kasten connects this to a broader theme in science fiction, as noted by Lois McMaster Bujold: SF often serves as a fantasy of political agency. However, unlike typical SF heroes, Shevek���s journey is more about exposing the limitations and complexities of political action rather than achieving a clear victory.
Ultimately, Kasten argues that "The Dispossessed" prompts readers to reflect on their own agency in the real world, urging them to actively participate in shaping their communities rather than passively accepting the status quo. This introspective approach encourages readers to consider their roles in society and the impact of their choices on collective well-being.

I thought it was interesting how everyone had a unique name, selected from unused names of ancestors by a supercomputer
ChatGPT
Indeed, the naming convention in "The Dispossessed" is a fascinating aspect that reflects the book's underlying themes of individuality and communal identity. In Ursula K. Le Guin's imagined society on Anarres, names are generated by a supercomputer from a pool of unused names of ancestors. This process ensures that each individual has a unique name, which is both a personal identifier and a connection to the past.
This system serves several purposes within the context of the novel:
Individuality and Uniqueness
: Each person having a unique name underscores the importance of individuality in a society that, at the same time, emphasizes collective ownership and communal living. It highlights the balance between the individual's identity and their role within the larger community.
Connection to Ancestry
: By using names from ancestors, the naming process creates a link between past and present generations. It reinforces a sense of continuity and heritage, reminding the inhabitants of Anarres of their shared history and the revolutionary ideals that led to the establishment of their society.
Practical Function
: The use of a supercomputer to assign names ensures an efficient and impartial system. It removes the personal biases or societal influences that might come into play if parents chose names, thereby supporting the society's principles of equality and fairness.
Symbolic Representation
: The unique naming system can be seen as a metaphor for the society's attempt to forge a new identity distinct from Urras, while still acknowledging its origins. It represents the effort to create a new social order that values each individual while striving for a collective ideal.
Overall, the distinctive naming convention in "The Dispossessed" enriches the novel's exploration of identity, community, and the tension between individuality and collectivism. It is one of the many intricate details Le Guin uses to build a compelling and thought-provoking world.

Process and Reality is a book by Alfred North Whitehead, in which the author propounds a philosophy of organism, also called process philosophy. The book, published in 1929, is a revision of the Gifford Lectures he gave in 1927���28.


Process and Reality
We diverge from Descartes by holding that what he has described as primary attributes of physical bodies, are really the forms of internal relationships between actual occasions. Such a change of thought is the shift from materialism to Organic Realism, as a basic idea of physical science.

������Process and Reality, 1929, p. 471.
Whitehead's Process and Reality
edit
Whitehead's background was an unusual one for a speculative philosopher. Educated as a mathematician, he became, through his co-authorship with his student and disciple Bertrand Russell and publication in 1913 of Principia Mathematica, a major logician. Later he wrote extensively on physics and its philosophy, proposing a theory of gravity in Minkowski space as a logically possible alternative to Einstein's general theory of relativity. Whitehead's Process and Reality[1] is perhaps his philosophical master work.

The following is an attempt to provide an accessible outline of some of the main ideas in Whitehead's Process and Reality, based on the book itself, but guided by a general reading of secondary sources, especially I. Leclerc's Whitehead's Metaphysics. An Introductory Exposition.[2] Whitehead often speaks of the metaphysics of Process and Reality as 'the philosophy of organism'.

The cosmology elaborated in Process and Reality posits an ontology based on the two kinds of existence of entity, that of actual entity and that of abstract entity or abstraction.

The ultimate abstract principle of actual existence for Whitehead is creativity. Actual existence is a process of becoming, and ���'becoming' is a creative advance into novelty���.[3] It is manifest in what can be called 'singular causality'. This term may be contrasted with 'nomic causality'. An example of singular causation is that I woke this morning because my alarm clock rang. An example of nomic causation is that alarm clocks generally wake people in the morning. Aristotle recognises singular causality as efficient causality. For Whitehead, there are many contributory singular causes for an event. A further contributory singular cause of my being awoken by my alarm clock this morning was that I was lying asleep near it until it rang.

An actual entity is a general philosophical term for an utterly determinate and completely concrete individual particular of the actually existing world or universe of changeable entities considered in terms of singular causality, about which categorical statements can be made. Whitehead's most far-reaching and profound and radical contribution to metaphysics is his invention of a better way of choosing the actual entities. Whitehead chooses a way of defining the actual entities that makes them all alike, qua actual entities, with a single exception, God.

For example, for Aristotle, the actual entities were the substances, such as Socrates (a particular citizen of Athens) and Bucephalus (a particular horse belonging to Alexander the Great). Besides Aristotle's ontology of substances, another example of an ontology that posits actual entities is in Leibniz' monads, said to be 'windowless

Alfred North Whitehead's "Process and Reality" is a seminal work in philosophy, presenting what he calls the philosophy of organism, or process philosophy. Published in 1929 and based on his Gifford Lectures, this book marks a significant departure from Cartesian materialism, proposing instead a form of Organic Realism.
Key Concepts of Process Philosophy
Philosophy of Organism
: Whitehead's central idea is that reality is a process of becoming rather than a static existence. This process is driven by creativity, which he sees as the ultimate principle of actual existence. Everything in the universe is interconnected through a web of internal relationships among "actual occasions," the fundamental units of reality.
Actual Entities and Abstract Entities
: Whitehead distinguishes between two kinds of existences:
Actual Entities
: These are the concrete, specific events or occurrences that constitute reality. They are utterly determinate and represent the basic units of the physical universe. Each actual entity is unique and particular.
Abstract Entities
: These include universals, forms, and other non-concrete elements that do not exist in the same way as actual entities but are essential for understanding the structure and interrelationships of actual occasions.
Creativity and Becoming
: Creativity is the process through which the universe evolves. It represents the constant flow of change and the emergence of new realities. This ongoing process is what Whitehead calls "creative advance into novelty."
Singular Causality vs. Nomic Causality
: Whitehead introduces a distinction between two types of causality:
Singular Causality
: This refers to specific, unique causes of particular events (e.g., waking up because an alarm clock rang).
Nomic Causality
: This pertains to general, law-like causes that apply universally (e.g., alarm clocks generally waking people).
The Role of God
: In Whitehead's metaphysics, God is a unique actual entity who plays a special role in the process of creativity and becoming. Unlike other actual entities, God is not subject to the same processes and changes but instead provides the potential for novelty and order in the universe.
Whitehead's Contributions to Metaphysics
Whitehead's approach represents a significant shift from traditional metaphysical views, particularly those of Aristotle and Leibniz. Aristotle's substances (e.g., individual people or animals) and Leibniz's monads (self-contained units of reality) are replaced by actual entities that are defined by their interrelations and processes of becoming. This relational and dynamic perspective allows for a more fluid and interconnected understanding of the universe.
Implications and Influence
Whitehead's process philosophy has influenced various fields, including metaphysics, theology, and science. It offers a framework for understanding reality as a dynamic and interconnected whole, where change and development are fundamental aspects of existence. This perspective challenges static and reductionist views of the universe, promoting a more holistic and integrated approach to both philosophy and science.
In summary, "Process and Reality" by Alfred North Whitehead presents a profound and innovative metaphysical system that emphasizes the importance of process, creativity, and interconnection in the fabric of reality.

For Whitehead, the actual entities exist as the only foundational elements of reality, the ultimately existing facts of the world. Nothing "either in fact or in efficacy"[4] underlies or lies beyond the actual entities; rather they underlie all reality.[5]

The actual entities are of two kinds, temporal and atemporal.

With one exception, all actual entities for Whitehead are temporal and are occasions of experience (which are not to be confused with consciousness, or with mere subjectivity). This 'actual entity' idea is most distinctly characteristic of the metaphysics of Process and Reality, and requires of the newly approaching reader a philosophically unprejudiced approach. An entity that people commonly think of as a simple concrete object, or that Aristotle would think of as a substance ��� a human being included ��� is in this ontology considered to be a composite of indefinitely many occasions of experience.

The one exceptional actual entity is at once temporal and atemporal: God. He is objectively immortal, as well as being immanent in the world. He is objectified in each temporal actual entity; but He is not an eternal object. Whitehead uses the term 'actual occasion' to refer only to purely temporal actual entities, those other than God.[6]

The occasions of experience are of four grades. The first comprises processes in a physical vacuum such as the propagation of an electromagnetic wave or gravitational influence across empty space. The occasions of experience of the second grade involve just inanimate matter. The occasions of experience of the third grade involve living organisms. Occasions of experience of the fourth grade involve experience in the mode of presentational immediacy, which means more or less what are often called the qualia of subjective experience. So far as we know, experience in the mode of presentational immediacy occurs in only more evolved animals. That some occasions of experience involve experience in the mode of presentational immediacy is the one and only reason why Whitehead makes the occasions of experience his actual entities; for the actual entities must be of the ultimately general kind. Consequently, it is inessential that an occasion of experience have an aspect in the mode of presentational immediacy; occasions in the grades one, two, and three lack that aspect. The highest grade of experience "is to be identified with the canalized importance of free conceptual functionings".[7]

There is no mind-matter duality in this ontology, because "mind" is simply seen as an abstraction from an occasion of experience which has also a material aspect, which is of course simply another abstraction from it; thus the mental and the material aspects are abstractions from one and the same concrete occasion of experience. The brain is part of the body, both being abstractions of a kind known as persistent physical objects, neither being actual entities. Though not recognised by Aristotle, there is biological evidence, written about by Galen,[8] that the human brain is an essential seat of human experience in the mode of presentational immediacy. We may say that the brain has a material and a mental aspect, all three being abstractions from their indefinitely many constitutive occasions of experience, which are actual entities.[9]

Inherent in each actual entity is its respective dimension of time. Potentially, each occasion of experience is causally consequential on every other occasion of experience that precedes it in time, and has as its causal consequences every other occasion of experience that follows; thus it has been said that Whitehead's occasions of experience are 'all window', in contrast to Leibniz's 'windowless' monads. In time defined relative to it, each occasion of experience is causally influenced by prior occasions of experiences, and causally influences future occasions of experience. An occasion of experience consists of a process of prehending other occasions of experience, reacting to them.

The causal outcomes obey the usual well-respected rule that the causes precede the effects in time. Some pairs of processes cannot be connected by cause-and-effect relations, and they are said to be spatially separated. This is in perfect agreement with the viewpoint of the Einstein theory of special relativity and with the Minkowski geometry of spacetime.[10] It is clear that Whitehead respected these ideas, as may be seen for example in his 1919 book An Enquiry concerning the Principles of Natural Knowledge[11] as well as in Process and Reality. Time in this view is relative to an inertial reference frame, different reference frames defining different versions of time.

The actual entity, the occasion of experience, is logically atomic in the sense that it cannot be cut and separated into two other occasions of experience. This kind of logical atomicity is perfectly compatible with indefinitely many spatiotemporal overlaps of occasions of experience. One can explain this atomicity by saying that an occasion of experience has an internal causal structure that could not be reproduced in each of the two complementary sections into which it might be cut. Nevertheless, an actual entity can completely contain indefinitely many other actual entities.[12]

Whitehead's theory of extension concerns the spatio-temporal features of his occasions of experience. Fundamental to both Newtonian and to quantum theoretical mechanics is the concept of velocity. The measurement of a velocity requires a finite spatiotemporal extent. Because it has no finite spatiotemporal extent, a single point of Minkowski space cannot be an occasion of experience, but is an abstraction from an infinite set of overlapping or contained occasions of experience, as explained in Process and Reality.[1] Though the occasions of experience are atomic, they are not necessarily separate in extension, spatiotemporally, from one another. Indefinitely many occasions of experience can overlap in Minkowski space.

An example of a nexus of temporally overlapping occasions of experience is what Whitehead calls an enduring physical object, which corresponds closely with an Aristotelian substance. An enduring physical object temporally has an earliest and a last member. Every member (apart from the earliest) is a causal consequence of the earliest member of the nexus, and every member (apart from the last) of such a nexus is a causal antecedent of the last. There are indefinitely many other causal antecedents and consequences of the enduring physical object, which overlap, but are not members, of the nexus. No member of the nexus is spatially separate from any other member. Within the nexus are indefinitely many continuous streams of overlapping nex��s, each stream including the earliest and the last member of the enduring physical object. Thus an enduring physical object, like an Aristotelian substance, undergoes changes and adventures during the course of its existence.[13]

Another aspect of the atomicity of occasions of experience is that they do not change. An actual entity is what it is. An occasion of experience can be described as a process of change, but is itself unchangeable.[14
ChatGPT
Whitehead's "Process and Reality" posits a metaphysics grounded in the idea that the fundamental elements of reality are "actual entities," or "occasions of experience." These actual entities are the building blocks of existence, serving as the foundational facts of the world, with nothing underlying or lying beyond them.
Key Elements of Whitehead's Metaphysics
Actual Entities and Temporal/Atemporal Distinction
:
Temporal Actual Entities
: These entities are all occasions of experience, forming the composite reality we perceive. Each occasion is an indivisible, concrete occurrence.
Atemporal Actual Entity
: The singular exception is God, who is both temporal and atemporal, immanent in the world, and involved in every temporal occasion.
Grades of Occasions of Experience
:
First Grade
: Processes in a physical vacuum, such as electromagnetic waves or gravitational influences.
Second Grade
: Inanimate matter.
Third Grade
: Living organisms.
Fourth Grade
: Presentational immediacy, encompassing subjective experiences or qualia, primarily found in higher animals.
Mind-Matter Unity
:
Whitehead rejects Cartesian dualism. Instead, he views "mind" and "matter" as abstractions from the same concrete occasions of experience, which are the actual entities. The brain, for example, is an abstraction of numerous occasions of experience, with both material and mental aspects.
Causality and Prehension
:
Each actual entity exists in time and is causally influenced by past occasions and influences future occasions. This process is known as "prehension," where an occasion of experience incorporates and reacts to others. This contrasts with Leibniz's "windowless monads," as Whitehead's entities are interrelated and causally interconnected.
Spatiotemporal Extension and Atomicity
:
Actual entities, while logically atomic and indivisible, can overlap spatiotemporally. For example, an enduring physical object consists of a nexus of overlapping occasions of experience, each causally connected from the earliest to the latest member.
Unchanging Nature of Actual Entities
:
Despite being processes of change, actual entities themselves do not change. Each is what it is, embodying a specific process or event in its entirety.
Implications and Philosophical Context
Whitehead's framework challenges traditional metaphysical views by emphasizing process over static substance and interconnectedness over isolation. His theory aligns with certain scientific principles, such as those found in relativity and quantum mechanics, by recognizing the spatiotemporal dimensions of experience and the causal relationships between events.
Summary
Whitehead's "Process and Reality" presents a dynamic ontology where reality is composed of interrelated processes or actual entities, both temporal and atemporal. This process philosophy, emphasizing the creativity and interconnectedness of all things, offers a profound shift from traditional substance-based metaphysics, inviting a reconsideration of the nature of existence and the relationships between mind, matter, and experience.

Whitehead's abstractions are conceptual entities that are abstracted from or derived from and founded upon his actual entities. Abstractions are themselves not actual entities, but are the only entities that can be real.

An abstraction is a conceptual entity that involves more than one single actual entity. Whitehead's ontology refers to importantly structured collections of actual entities as nexuses of actual entities. Collection of actual entities into a nexus emphasises some aspect of those entities, and that emphasis is an abstraction, because it means that some aspects of the actual entities are emphasised or dragged away from their actuality, while other aspects are de-emphasised.

Whitehead admitted indefinitely many eternal objects. An example of an eternal object is a number, such as the number 'two'. Whitehead held that eternal objects are abstractions of a very high degree. Many abstractions, including eternal objects, are potential ingredients of processes.

Relation between actual entities and abstractions stated in the ontological principle
edit
For Whitehead, besides its temporal generation by the actual entities which are its contributory causes, a process may be considered as a concrescence of abstract ingredient eternal objects. God enters into every temporal actual entity.

Whitehead's ontological principle is that whatever reality pertains to an abstraction is derived from the actual entities upon which it is founded or of which it is comprised.[15]
ChatGPT
Whitehead's metaphysics in "Process and Reality" intricately weaves together the concepts of actual entities and abstractions, forming a comprehensive framework that explores the nature of reality. Here are the key points on abstractions and their relation to actual entities within his ontology:
Abstractions and Actual Entities
Nature of Abstractions
:
Abstractions are conceptual entities derived from actual entities.
They are not actual entities themselves but represent real entities that are abstracted from the concrete reality of actual occasions.
An abstraction involves more than one actual entity, highlighting specific aspects while de-emphasizing others.
Nexuses of Actual Entities
:
Whitehead refers to structured collections of actual entities as nexuses.
A nexus emphasizes certain aspects of the involved actual entities, creating a conceptual unity that is an abstraction.
Eternal Objects
:
Eternal objects are high-degree abstractions that are timeless and unchanging, such as mathematical entities (e.g., the number 'two').
These objects are potential ingredients of processes and can be incorporated into the becoming of actual entities.
Ontological Principle
Relation Between Actual Entities and Abstractions
:
The reality of an abstraction is derived from the actual entities it is founded upon or comprised of.
This principle emphasizes that abstractions do not have an independent existence but are grounded in the concrete reality of actual occasions.
Process as Concrescence
:
A process is seen as the concrescence (coming together) of abstract ingredients, particularly eternal objects.
Each actual entity in its becoming integrates these abstractions, including God, who enters into every temporal actual entity.
God and Temporal Actual Entities
God, in Whitehead's framework, is a unique actual entity that is both temporal and atemporal.
God is immanent in the world and contributes to the creative process by incorporating eternal objects into the concrescence of actual entities.
Implications
Whitehead's approach blurs the traditional distinctions between the concrete and the abstract, emphasizing a dynamic interplay where the abstract (eternal objects and other abstractions) is essential for the process of becoming in actual entities. This perspective allows for a richer understanding of how complex structures and relationships emerge from the fundamental building blocks of reality.
In summary, Whitehead's philosophy of organism or process philosophy presents a vision of reality where abstractions, including eternal objects, are deeply intertwined with actual entities. These abstractions derive their reality from actual entities and play a crucial role in the ongoing creative processes that constitute the universe.

In  mathematics, point-free geometry is a geometry whose primitive ontological notion is region rather than point. Two axiomatic systems are set out below, one grounded in mereology, the other in mereotopology and known as connection theory.

Point-free geometry was first formulated in Whitehead (1919, 1920), not as a theory of geometry or of spacetime, but of "events" and of an "extension relation" between events. Whitehead's purposes were as much philosophical as scientific and mathematical.[a]

Formalizations
edit
Whitehead did not set out his theories in a manner that would satisfy present-day canons of formality. The two formal first-order theories described in this entry were devised by others in order to clarify and refine Whitehead's theories. The domain of discourse for both theories consists of "regions." All unquantified variables in this entry should be taken as tacitly universally quantified; hence all axioms should be taken as universal closures. No axiom requires more than three quantified variables; hence a translation of first-order theories into relation algebra is possible. Each set of axioms has but four existential quantifiers.

Point-free geometry, as developed by Alfred North Whitehead, is a geometric theory that eschews the traditional notion of points in favor of regions. Whitehead���s work in this area, particularly in his 1919 and 1920 publications, sought to describe a framework for understanding "events" and the "extension relation" between them, driven by both philosophical and scientific interests.
Overview of Point-Free Geometry
Point-free geometry is founded on the concept of regions, which serve as the primitive ontological entities. There are two primary formal systems that have been developed to capture Whitehead's ideas: one based on mereology and the other on mereotopology, also known as connection theory.
Mereology
: This system focuses on the part-whole relationships between regions. It forms the basis of a formal theory where regions are the basic entities, and the relationships between them are described without reference to points.
Mereotopology (Connection Theory)
: This system extends mereology by incorporating notions of connection and boundary. It adds topological concepts to the part-whole relationships, allowing for a richer description of how regions relate to one another.
Formalizations of Point-Free Geometry
Whitehead's original theories were not formalized to meet contemporary standards of rigor. Subsequent formalizations were developed by others to clarify and refine his ideas. These formalizations use first-order logic and are based on a domain of discourse consisting entirely of regions.
Key Features of the Formal Systems
Universal Quantification
: All variables are implicitly universally quantified, meaning that the axioms are taken as universal closures.
Limited Quantification
: Each axiom involves no more than three quantified variables, facilitating a translation into relation algebra.
Existential Quantifiers
: There are only four existential quantifiers in each set of axioms, simplifying the logical structure.
Mereological Axioms
The mereological axioms define the relationships of part to whole among regions. Key axioms include:
Transitivity of Parthood
: If region A is part of region B, and region B is part of region C, then region A is part of region C.
Antisymmetry of Parthood
: If region A is part of region B, and region B is part of region A, then region A and region B are the same region.
Reflexivity of Parthood
: Every region is part of itself.
Mereotopological Axioms
The mereotopological axioms build on mereological principles by adding notions of connection and boundaries. Key axioms include:
Connection Axiom
: If regions A and B are connected, then they share a boundary.
Boundary Axiom
: Boundaries of regions are themselves regions.
Interior and Exterior
: Every region has an interior and an exterior, which are also regions.
Philosophical and Scientific Implications
Whitehead���s approach to geometry and spacetime emphasizes the fluid, interconnected nature of reality. By focusing on regions rather than points, point-free geometry aligns more closely with certain physical theories where the concept of indivisible points is less intuitive or relevant. This approach has implications for various fields, including:
Philosophy
: Point-free geometry aligns with process philosophy, emphasizing events and processes over static entities.
Mathematics and Physics
: This framework can provide alternative foundations for theories of spacetime and the structure of the universe.
Conclusion
Point-free geometry, rooted in the philosophical and scientific work of Alfred North Whitehead, offers an innovative approach to understanding space and time. Through formal systems based on mereology and mereotopology, it provides a rigorous and philosophically rich alternative to traditional point-based geometry.

Biology
edit
In plant morphology, Rolf Sattler developed a process morphology (dynamic morphology) that overcomes the structure/process (or structure/function) dualism that is commonly taken for granted in biology. According to process morphology, structures such as leaves of plants do not have processes, they are processes.[36][37]

In evolution and in development, the nature of the changes of biological objects are considered by many authors to be more radical than in physical systems. In biology, changes are not just changes of state in a pre-given space, instead the space and more generally the mathematical structures required to understand object change over time.[38][39]

Ecology
edit
With its perspective that everything is interconnected, that all life has value, and that non-human entities are also experiencing subjects, process philosophy has played an important role in discourse on ecology and sustainability. The first book to connect process philosophy with environmental ethics was John B. Cobb, Jr.'s 1971 work, Is It Too Late: A Theology of Ecology.[40] In a more recent book (2018) edited by John B. Cobb, Jr. and Wm. Andrew Schwartz, Putting Philosophy to Work: Toward an Ecological Civilization[41] contributors explicitly explore the ways in which process philosophy can be put to work to address the most urgent issues facing our world today, by contributing to a transition toward an ecological civilization. That book emerged from the largest international conference held on the theme of ecological civilization (Seizing an Alternative: Toward an Ecological Civilization) which was organized by the Center for Process Studies in June 2015. The conference brought together roughly 2,000 participants from around the world and featured such leaders in the environmental movement as Bill McKibben, Vandana Shiva, John B. Cobb, Jr., Wes Jackson, and Sheri Liao.[42] The notion of ecological civilization is often affiliated with the process philosophy of Alfred North Whitehead���especially in China.[43]

Mathematics

In the philosophy of mathematics, some of Whitehead's ideas re-emerged in combination with cognitivism as the cognitive science of mathematics and embodied mind theses.

Somewhat earlier, exploration of mathematical practice and quasi-empiricism in mathematics from the 1950s to 1980s had sought alternatives to metamathematics in social behaviours around mathematics itself: for instance, Paul Erd��s's simultaneous belief in Platonism and a single "big book" in which all proofs existed, combined with his personal obsessive need or decision to collaborate with the widest possible number of other mathematicians. The process, rather than the outcomes, seemed to drive his explicit behaviour and odd use of language, as if the synthesis of Erd��s and collaborators in seeking proofs, creating sense-datum for other mathematicians, was itself the expression of a divine will. Certainly, Erd��s behaved as if nothing else in the world mattered, including money or love, as emphasized in his biography The Man Who Loved Only Numbers.

Medicine

This section does not cite any sources. (May 2013)
Several fields of science and especially medicine seem [vague] to make liberal use of ideas in process philosophy, notably the theory of pain and healing of the late 20th century. The philosophy of medicine began to deviate somewhat from scientific method and an emphasis on repeatable results in the very late 20th century by embracing population thinking, and a more pragmatic approach to issues in public health, environmental health, and especially mental health. In this latter field, R. D. Laing, Thomas Szasz, and Michel Foucault were instrumental in moving medicine away from emphasis on "cures" and towards concepts of individuals in balance with their society, both of which are changing, and against which no benchmarks or finished "cures" were very likely to be measurable.

Psychology
edit
See also: Process psychology
In psychology, the subject of imagination was again explored more extensively since Whitehead, and the question of feasibility or "eternal objects" of thought became central to the impaired theory of mind explorations that framed postmodern cognitive science. A biological understanding of the most eternal object, that being the emerging of similar but independent cognitive apparatus, led to an obsession with the process "embodiment", that being, the emergence of these cognitions. Like Whitehead's God, especially as elaborated in J. J. Gibson's perceptual psychology emphasizing affordances, by ordering the relevance of eternal objects (especially the cognitions of other such actors), the world becomes. Or, it becomes simple enough for human beings to begin to make choices, and to prehend what happens as a result. These experiences may be summed in some sense but can only approximately be shared, even among very similar cognitions with identical DNA. An early explorer of this view was Alan Turing who sought to prove the limits of expressive complexity of human genes in the late 1940s, to put bounds on the complexity of human intelligence and so assess the feasibility of artificial intelligence emerging. Since 2000, Process Psychology has progressed as an independent academic and therapeutic discipline: In 2000, Michel Weber created the Whitehead Psychology Nexus: an open forum dedicated to the cross-examination of Alfred North Whitehead's process philosophy and the various facets of the contemporary psychological field.[44]

Philosophy of movement
edit
The philosophy of movement is a sub-area within process philosophy that treats processes as movements. It studies processes as flows, folds, and fields in historical patterns of centripetal, centrifugal, tensional, and elastic motion.[45] See Thomas Nail's philosophy of movement and process materialism
ChatGPT
Application of Process Philosophy Across Disciplines
Biology: Process Morphology
In plant morphology, Rolf Sattler's process morphology, also known as dynamic morphology, challenges the traditional dualism of structure and process. Sattler posits that structures like plant leaves are not static entities with processes but are themselves processes. This perspective integrates function and form, viewing biological structures as dynamic and evolving rather than fixed.
Evolution and Development
In evolutionary biology and developmental biology, changes in biological objects are seen as more radical than those in physical systems. These changes are not just alterations of state within a pre-given space but involve transformations that redefine the space and the mathematical structures necessary to understand these changes. This reflects a processual view where the very framework of change evolves over time.
Ecology: Interconnectedness and Value
Process philosophy has significantly influenced ecological thought and sustainability. It emphasizes the interconnectedness of all life and the intrinsic value of non-human entities. John B. Cobb, Jr.'s 1971 book, "Is It Too Late: A Theology of Ecology," was pioneering in connecting process philosophy with environmental ethics. The concept of ecological civilization, particularly influential in China, is grounded in Whitehead���s process philosophy, promoting a holistic view of human and non-human interrelations and sustainability.
Mathematics: Cognitive Science and Practice
In mathematics, Whitehead's ideas have resurfaced within cognitive science, focusing on how mathematical concepts are embodied and understood. This perspective was anticipated by the exploration of mathematical practices and quasi-empiricism from the 1950s to the 1980s. Mathematician Paul Erd��s exemplified this process-oriented approach, with his collaborative style and the idea of a "big book" containing all proofs reflecting a dynamic, process-driven understanding of mathematical discovery.
Medicine: Pragmatic and Holistic Approaches
Process philosophy has influenced various fields of medicine, especially in the theory of pain and healing. It has led to a pragmatic approach in public health, environmental health, and mental health, emphasizing the dynamic balance between individuals and their changing societies. Thinkers like R. D. Laing, Thomas Szasz, and Michel Foucault have contributed to this shift, moving away from the concept of definitive cures towards understanding health as a dynamic process of adaptation and balance.
Psychology: Imagination and Embodiment
In psychology, process philosophy has shaped the study of imagination and the concept of eternal objects of thought. This has led to an emphasis on embodiment, the process by which cognitive functions emerge. Influential figures include J. J. Gibson, whose perceptual psychology highlighted affordances, and Alan Turing, who explored the limits of human intelligence and the potential for artificial intelligence. Michel Weber's establishment of the Whitehead Psychology Nexus in 2000 has further developed process psychology as a discipline, focusing on the intersection of process philosophy and contemporary psychological theories.
Philosophy of Movement
The philosophy of movement, a sub-area within process philosophy, treats processes as movements and studies them as flows, folds, and fields. It examines historical patterns of motion, including centripetal, centrifugal, tensional, and elastic movements. Thomas Nail���s work on process materialism and the philosophy of movement exemplifies this approach, emphasizing the dynamic nature of processes and their underlying patterns.
Summary
Process philosophy, with its emphasis on dynamic processes and interconnectedness, has found applications across various disciplines, from biology and ecology to mathematics, medicine, and psychology. Each field incorporates the principles of process philosophy to challenge traditional dualisms, emphasizing the evolving, interconnected nature of reality and the importance of understanding entities as dynamic processes.

Book of Thoth is a name given to many ancient Egyptian texts supposed to have been written by Thoth, the Egyptian god of writing and knowledge. They include many texts that were claimed to exist by ancient authors and a magical book that appears in an Egyptian work of fiction.

Texts that are known or claimed to exist
edit
The Egyptians stored many texts, on a wide range of subjects, in "Houses of Life", the libraries contained within temple complexes. As Thoth was the god of knowledge, many of these texts were claimed to be his work.[1] The Egyptian historian Manetho said that Thoth wrote 36,525 books.[2]

The church father Clement of Alexandria, in the sixth book of his work Stromata, mentions forty-two books used by Egyptian priests that he says contain "the whole philosophy of the Egyptians". All these books, according to Clement, were written by Hermes (a pre-existing Greek god that the Greeks likened to Thoth, claiming they were the same god, having similar qualities, e.g. both invented writing). Translation from Egyptian language and concepts to Greek language and concepts was not entirely accurate, and some Egyptian authenticity was lost. Among the subjects they cover are hymns, rituals, temple construction, astrology, geography, and medicine.[3]

The Egyptologists Richard Lewis Jasnow and Karl-Theodor Zauzich have dubbed a long Egyptian text from the Ptolemaic period "the Book of Thoth". This Demotic text, known from more than forty fragmentary copies, consists of a dialogue between a person called "The-one-who-loves-knowledge" and a figure that Jasnow and Zauzich identify as Thoth. The topics of their conversation include the work of scribes, various aspects of the gods and their sacred animals, and the Duat, the realm of the dead.[4]

I saw the connection between the instructions to build the ark as similar to the instructions to build the ark, it looks like it could also be instructions to build a library, if the animals are different writings
ChatGPT
The connection you perceive between the instructions for building the Ark (in the biblical story of Noah) and the construction of a library, with animals representing different writings or types of knowledge, is a fascinating and insightful interpretation. This metaphor can be explored in several ways:
The Ark as a Symbolic Library
Preservation of Knowledge
:
Just as Noah's Ark was built to preserve the various species of animals from the flood, a library is constructed to preserve different forms of knowledge and writings from being lost over time. The Ark ensures the survival of biodiversity, while a library ensures the survival of human knowledge and culture.
Categorization and Organization
:
The detailed instructions for building the Ark, including its dimensions and compartments, can be likened to the careful organization of a library. Each "animal" (type of writing or knowledge) needs a specific place to be preserved properly, mirroring how books and manuscripts are categorized and shelved according to subject, genre, or author in a library.
Diversity and Inclusivity
:
Noah's Ark was meant to carry pairs of every species, ensuring a broad and diverse representation of life. Similarly, a well-rounded library strives to include a wide range of subjects and perspectives, ensuring diverse knowledge is accessible to future generations.
Guided Construction
:
The Ark���s construction was guided by divine instructions, emphasizing the importance of following a higher wisdom. Building a library or a body of knowledge often involves following established methodologies and principles, ensuring that the knowledge preserved is accurate and valuable.
Metaphorical Connections
Animals as Writings
:
Viewing animals as different writings or types of knowledge opens up a rich metaphorical landscape. Each species (type of writing) contributes uniquely to the ecosystem of knowledge. For example:
Lions and Eagles (Mythological and Historical Texts)
: Represent strength and grandeur in literature.
Ants and Bees (Scientific and Technical Manuals)
: Represent industriousness and meticulous detail in the accumulation of knowledge.
Songbirds (Poetry and Music)
: Represent beauty and harmony in cultural and artistic expressions.
Flood as Loss of Knowledge
:
The flood in the Noah story can be seen as a metaphor for the potential loss of knowledge through time, disasters, or neglect. The Ark (library) serves as a safeguard against this loss, ensuring continuity and survival.
Constructing a Library with Purpose
Building for Future Generations
:
Both Noah���s Ark and a library are built with future generations in mind. The Ark ensures the survival of species, while a library ensures the continuity of knowledge, culture, and learning.
Sacred Duty
:
In the biblical narrative, building the Ark was a sacred duty. Similarly, the creation and maintenance of a library can be seen as a sacred duty to preserve and disseminate human knowledge and wisdom.
Conclusion
Viewing the instructions for building Noah���s Ark as analogous to building a library, where animals represent different writings or types of knowledge, provides a rich and meaningful metaphor. This perspective highlights the importance of preservation, organization, and diversity in both biological and intellectual contexts. It underscores the sacred duty of safeguarding knowledge for future generations, ensuring that wisdom and learning endure through time.

Process philosophy reminds me of functional programming where you might make a Function that always gives  back a certain number instead of storing it as a variable, so it is a process instead of a noun.
ChatGPT
That's an insightful comparison! There are indeed notable parallels between process philosophy and functional programming. Both emphasize processes, dynamic interactions, and the avoidance of static states. Here are some specific points of connection between the two:
Process Philosophy and Functional Programming
Emphasis on Processes and Functions
:
Process Philosophy
: Reality is composed of dynamic processes rather than static substances. Everything is in a constant state of becoming, driven by interactions and changes.
Functional Programming
: Programs are constructed using functions, which are processes that take inputs and produce outputs. Functional programming avoids mutable states and focuses on the flow of data through functions.
Immutability and State
:
Process Philosophy
: Actual entities (or occasions of experience) are transient and constantly changing. There is no permanent state; instead, everything is in flux.
Functional Programming
: Variables are immutable, meaning once a value is assigned, it does not change. This immutability mirrors the concept of dynamic processes where states are not stored but continually transformed through function applications.
Pure Functions and Determinacy
:
Process Philosophy
: Events are determined by a complex web of interactions and prehensions. Each entity's state is a result of processes rather than intrinsic properties.
Functional Programming
: Pure functions always produce the same output for the same input, emphasizing the determinacy of results based on input processes rather than stored states.
Avoidance of Side Effects
:
Process Philosophy
: Focuses on the interconnectedness and ongoing interactions between processes. The impact of an entity is always through its relations and actions.
Functional Programming
: Avoids side effects, ensuring that functions do not alter the state outside their scope. This aligns with the idea that processes interact in a controlled, predictable manner.
Higher-Order Functions and Abstractions
:
Process Philosophy
: Abstractions are derived from actual entities and their interactions. Higher-order concepts are formed by understanding these fundamental processes.
Functional Programming
: Supports higher-order functions, which can take other functions as arguments or return them as results. This abstraction allows for building complex behaviors from simpler processes.
Declarative Nature
:
Process Philosophy
: Describes the world in terms of processes and relations, offering a high-level understanding of reality.
Functional Programming
: Is declarative, meaning it focuses on what to compute rather than how to compute it. This high-level approach describes the desired outcomes of processes.
Examples of Functional Programming Concepts
Pure Functions
:
haskell
Copiar c��digo
add :: Int -> Int -> Int
add x y = x + y
This function
add
always returns the same result for the same inputs, reflecting the idea of a process without side effects.
Higher-Order Functions
:
haskell
Copiar c��digo
map :: (a -> b) -> [a] -> [b]
map f xs = [f x | x <- xs]
The
map
function takes a function
f
and a list
xs
, applying
f
to each element of
xs
. This demonstrates the abstraction of processes.
Immutability
:
haskell
Copiar c��digo
incrementAll :: [Int] -> [Int]
incrementAll xs = map (+1) xs
The list
xs
is not altered; instead, a new list is produced where each element is incremented. This immutability reflects the constant change in process philosophy.
Summary
The connection between process philosophy and functional programming lies in their shared emphasis on processes, interactions, and avoiding static states. Functional programming's reliance on pure functions, immutability, and higher-order functions mirrors process philosophy's focus on dynamic becoming, interactions, and abstractions. This comparison highlights how philosophical concepts can find practical expression in modern computational paradigms.

Product Overview
Description
The Invocation Model of Process Expression argues that mathematics does not provide the most appropriate conceptual foundations for computer science, but, rather, that these foundations are a primary source of unnecessary complexity and confusion.  It supports that there is a more appropriate conceptual model that unifies forms of expression considered quite disparate and simplifies issues considered complex and intractable.  This book presents that this model of process expression is alternative theory of computer science that is both valid and practical
