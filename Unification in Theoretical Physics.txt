Problem that has gotten the most attention: conventional 
quantization of weakly coupled GR has renormalizability problems. No 
consistent non-perturbative def i nition of quantum gravity, either by itself

The excerpt you provided from Peter Woit's presentation "Rethinking the Foundations of Physics: Unification" outlines an ambitious project in theoretical physics. Here's a breakdown of the key topics covered in the document:
Unification Goals
: The document starts by addressing what the unification efforts aim to achieve. This involves the integration of the various forces and particles described by the Standard Model (electromagnetic, weak, and strong forces, managed by their respective gauge fields U(1), SU(2), and SU(3)) and the gravitational force described by General Relativity. This is a fundamental quest in physics to form a coherent theory that can encompass all fundamental interactions under a single framework.
Current Status and Challenges
:
Standard Model
: It's a well-established model with its predictions precisely matching experimental results. It is based on quantum field theory and details how fundamental particles interact via three fundamental forces. The model includes the Higgs field, which gives mass to some particles via the Higgs mechanism.
General Relativity
: This theory describes gravitation through the curvature of spacetime, represented mathematically via the Einstein-Hilbert action. Like the Standard Model, General Relativity has been experimentally verified to a great extent.
Open Questions
:
The rationale behind the specific groups U(1), SU(2), SU(3), and the values of their coupling constants.
Reasons for particle properties like spin, specific charge patterns, and the existence of three generations of particles.
The nature and the specific potential of the Higgs field, along with why it couples in particular ways to matter (Yukawa couplings).
Technical and Conceptual Challenges
:
A consistent non-perturbative definition of chiral gauge theories is lacking, which is crucial for a full understanding of the Standard Model.
Issues with quantizing gravity in a way that's compatible with the principles of quantum mechanics (renormalizability problems) and finding a non-perturbative formulation of quantum gravity.
Woit's presentation likely argues for a new paradigm in attempting to unify these theories, given the challenges with current methods, which might include exploring new theoretical frameworks or revising existing assumptions within theoretical physics. His work pushes for a reconsideration of foundational concepts in an effort to address unanswered questions and resolve inconsistencies between the Standard Model and General Relativity.

Grand Unif i ed Theories 
History: Begins with Georgi-Glashow (January 1974) 
Basic idea: 
Choose a larger Lie group G such that U(1) �� SU(2) �� SU(3) ��� G. 
Grand unif i ed theory is a gauge theory with gauge group G (simplest 
examples G = SU(5),SO(10)). Get a relation between the three SM 
coupling constants. 
Find irreducible representations of G that give the SM charges when 
you restrict to the SM subgroup. 
Introduce new Higgs i elds, with dynamics that breaks G to 
U(1) �� SU(2) �� SU(3). 
Initial enthusiasm: The new generators in G give gauge i elds that will 
cause quarks to decay to leptons, so get predictions for proton decay.

(more later). Extend the Poincar�� e Lie algebra to a super-Lie algebra, 
by adding fermionic spinor generators Q such that {Q,Q} ��� P. 
Extend the SM to a theory that has same gauge group, larger 
space-time symmetry algebra. Can also do this for a GUT. 
Initial enthusiasm: The new generators in the super-Lie algebra commute 
with SM generators, so get prediction of new ���superpartners��� of all known 
particles. Experimental situation

The sections you've shared from Peter Woit's presentation provide an overview of two significant attempts in theoretical physics to create a unified framework that could potentially integrate the Standard Model of particle physics with General Relativity:
Grand Unified Theories (GUTs)
and
Supersymmetry (SUSY)
. Both theories seek to address and extend beyond the limitations of the Standard Model through higher symmetries and new theoretical constructs.
Grand Unified Theories (GUTs)
History and Basic Idea
:
Origin
: GUTs began with the Georgi-Glashow model in 1974. The fundamental idea in GUTs is to find a larger Lie group G that encompasses the gauge groups of the Standard Model (U(1) �� SU(2) �� SU(3)) as subgroups.
Examples
: Common choices for G include SU(5) and SO(10), which allow a mathematical unification of the gauge forces and predict relationships between the coupling constants of the Standard Model forces.
Mechanics
: GUTs involve irreducible representations of these larger groups that simplify to the familiar charges and interactions of the Standard Model when broken down. This breakdown typically involves new types of Higgs fields.
Predictions and Challenges
:
Proton Decay
: A significant prediction of many GUTs is that protons should be unstable, decaying into leptons among other products, which would be a direct consequence of the new gauge fields introduced by the larger symmetry group G.
Experimental Status
: Despite initial enthusiasm, no experimental evidence of proton decay has been observed, challenging the validity of these theories.
Supersymmetry (SUSY)
History and Basic Idea
:
Origin
: The concept of supersymmetry was introduced in 1974, expanding the Poincar�� algebra to include fermionic spinor generators that relate to the bosonic components through a super-Lie algebra.
Mechanics
: Supersymmetry proposes a partner (superpartner) for every known particle, with the partners differing by half a unit of spin. This extension aims to address several theoretical issues, including hierarchy problems and the unification of coupling constants at high energies.
Predictions and Challenges
:
Superpartners
: SUSY predicts the existence of these superpartners for all Standard Model particles.
Experimental Status
: To date, no superpartners have been detected in particle physics experiments, casting doubt on the simplest versions of supersymmetry.
Conclusion
Both Grand Unified Theories and Supersymmetry represent ambitious efforts to extend our understanding of the fundamental forces and constituents of the universe. However, the lack of empirical evidence supporting the key predictions of these theories (such as proton decay in GUTs and superpartners in SUSY) poses significant challenges to their acceptance. Woit's presentation likely critiques these approaches for their failure to align with experimental data, highlighting the need for new theoretical ideas or a reevaluation of existing paradigms in the quest for a true unification of physics.

ChatGPT dijo:
ChatGPT
The sections from Peter Woit's presentation discuss two advanced theoretical frameworks in physics:
Supergravity
and
Kaluza-Klein Theories
, as well as
Superstring Theory
. These theories represent further attempts to achieve a unified description of all known fundamental interactions, including gravity, often referred to as a "Theory of Everything."
Supergravity and Kaluza-Klein Theories
History and Basic Idea
:
Supergravity
(March 1976): An extension of supersymmetry (SUSY) that includes gravity. It gauges SUSY, adding gravitational interactions to the framework. Supergravity introduces the gravitino, a supersymmetric partner to the graviton (the hypothetical quantum of gravity).
Kaluza-Klein Theories
(April 1978): These theories suggest that in addition to the usual four dimensions of spacetime (three spatial dimensions plus time), there are extra, compactified dimensions. The original idea dates back to Theodor Kaluza and Oskar Klein, who proposed a fifth dimension to unify electromagnetism with gravity.
Initial Enthusiasm and Challenges
:
Both theories generated significant interest, particularly after Stephen Hawking's 1980 lecture pondering the end of theoretical physics, suggesting that these theories might lead to a final unified theory.
Experimental Evidence
: Despite theoretical advancements, no experimental evidence has been found for extra dimensions or gravitinos, key elements of these theories.
Superstring Theory
History and Basic Idea
:
Origin
: The idea that elementary particles could be modeled not as point-like objects but as one-dimensional "strings" was revitalized by Jo��l Scherk and John Schwarz in 1974. Interest surged with Edward Witten's influential work in 1984.
Mechanics
: Superstring theory extends GUTs, supergravity, and Kaluza-Klein ideas by positing that particles are vibrational modes of strings. It requires ten dimensions for consistency and naturally incorporates SUSY and certain GUT groups.
Initial Enthusiasm and Challenges
:
Witten's work and subsequent developments suggested that superstring theory could potentially explain all fundamental forces and matter forms, contributing to its description as a possible "Theory of Everything."
Experimental Evidence
: Similar to GUTs and SUSY, superstring theory suffers from a lack of direct empirical support. No experimental evidence has been observed for the hallmarks of these theories, such as SUSY particles, extra dimensions, or string-theoretic phenomena.
Conclusion
Supergravity, Kaluza-Klein, and Superstring theories represent some of the most ambitious attempts in theoretical physics to unify all known forces and describe all aspects of the universe at a fundamental level. However, the absence of experimental validation for key aspects of these theories has led to skepticism and calls for new approaches or revisions of these theoretical frameworks. Woit's critique likely reflects a broader perspective within the physics community that while these theories are mathematically elegant and rich, their physical relevance remains unconfirmed due to the lack of empirical evidence supporting their major predictions.

Generic problems of unif i cation attempts 
Attempts to go beyond the SM and GR and i nd a more fully unif i ed 
theory have all had the same generic problems: 
They try to embed the SM and GR in a larger structure, but there is 
no experimental evidence at all for any component of such a structure. 
Whatever the advantages are of the larger structure, they are ruined 
by the necessity of coming up with an explanation of why one doesn���t 
see any evidence of this structure. Elegance then turns to ugliness. 
The theory fails in a very conventional way: whatever new it predicts 
is not seen, so one must make the theory more and more complicated 
to explain away why one sees nothing. The endpoint is not an elegant 
predictive theory, but a complicated one that predicts nothing. 
I���ve emphasized that the ideas involved all are about 50 years old. These 
are not new ideas that need more work. The inability of the community to 
give up on failed ideas has brought the subject of unif i cation to intellectual 
collapse. Most serious theorists have stopped working on the idea as 
hopeless without new help from experiment. 
Peter Woit (Columbia University Mathematics

A new approach to unif i cation 
A proposal 
The past few years I���ve been working on a dif f erent approach to unif i cation 
which seems promising. It assumes: 
Four dimensions is very special. Unif i cation should use not extra 
dimensions, but the special properties of 4d, in particular the 
geometry of 4d spinors and twistors. 
Quantum i eld theories are well def i ned only in Euclidean signature, 
with an extra structure needed to ���Wick rotate��� to Minkowski 
signature. 
The main new idea is to recognize that this ���Wick rotation��� changes the 
spinor geometry in a fundamental way. One of the SU(2) factors of the 4d 
rotation group becomes an internal symmetry from the point of view of 
Minkowski spacetime. This provides a new sort of unif i cation of internal 
and spacetime symmetry, using just known degrees of freedom.

Peter Woit's critique of traditional unification attempts in theoretical physics highlights several key issues that have plagued these efforts, ultimately proposing a novel approach aimed at overcoming these challenges.
Critique of Traditional Unification Attempts
Generic Problems
:
Lack of Experimental Evidence
: Traditional unification theories, which often include elements like higher dimensions, supersymmetry, or larger gauge groups, have not been substantiated by experimental data. The absence of evidence for any components of these extended structures presents a significant problem.
Complexity Over Elegance
: Woit argues that as these theories fail to predict new phenomena or match experimental results, they become increasingly complex. This complexity is often a result of theoretical adjustments made to account for the lack of observable evidence. The result, according to Woit, is a move away from elegance and simplicity towards a cumbersome framework that lacks predictive power.
Intellectual Stagnation
: Woit emphasizes that many of these unification ideas are decades old and have not evolved significantly despite extensive theoretical development. He suggests that persistence in pursuing these failed ideas without new experimental data or insights has led to a kind of intellectual dead-end in the field of unification.
Woit's New Approach to Unification
Novel Proposal
:
Special Properties of Four Dimensions
: Instead of adding extra dimensions as in theories like string theory or Kaluza-Klein, Woit focuses on exploiting the unique properties of the four-dimensional spacetime we inhabit. This includes specific aspects of 4D geometry like spinors and twistors.
Role of Wick Rotation
: Woit points to the importance of the Wick rotation���a mathematical technique used to convert problems in quantum field theory (QFT) from Euclidean space (where time is treated as a fourth spatial dimension) to Minkowski space (the spacetime of relativity). He suggests that this rotation fundamentally alters the geometry of spinors, leading to new insights.
Unification of Internal and Spacetime Symmetry
: The key innovation in Woit's proposal seems to be a novel way of viewing one of the SU(2) factors of the 4D rotation group as an internal symmetry from the perspective of Minkowski space. This approach aims to unify internal symmetries (typically associated with particle interactions) with the symmetries of spacetime itself, using existing physics without the need for unobserved phenomena.
Conclusion
Woit���s criticism reflects a broader frustration with theoretical physics��� reliance on unproven, complex theories that have yet to yield empirical validations. His proposal attempts to redirect the focus towards utilizing inherent properties of known physics and spacetime dimensions, potentially offering a more grounded approach to unification. This approach aims to be less speculative, relying on enhancing our understanding and utilization of the existing dimensions and symmetries rather than inventing new ones, which might lead to a more empirically accessible and theoretically elegant model of unification.

��(z = t + i��,x) = e��H��(z = t,x)e�����H 
Since H has a positive unbounded spectrum, there will be problems 
with this for �� ��= 0. You can���t Wick rotate i eld operators from real to

The discussion you've provided focuses on the differences and challenges associated with using Wick rotation to transition between Euclidean and Minkowski formulations of Quantum Field Theory (QFT). Here's a breakdown of the key points and their implications:
1. Wick Rotation Explained
Wick rotation is a mathematical tool used in theoretical physics to transition between Euclidean space (where time is imaginary and denoted as i��) and Minkowski space (the usual spacetime framework with real time t). This transition involves converting the time coordinate from real to imaginary (or vice versa) through the relation �� = it, intending to simplify calculations and handle divergences in integrals by moving into a space with better mathematical properties.
2. Challenges in Wick Rotation

(which has a positive and unbounded spectrum) indicate that as

Path Integral Formalism
In the Euclidean space, path integrals, which are central to formulations of QFT, are well-defined because the exponential terms
e

S

e
���
S
(where

In Minkowski space, the path integral formulation deals with factors like

e

S
, which oscillate instead of dampen, often leading to divergences and making the measure for these integrals ill-defined.
The transformation of these measures between imaginary and real time is not straightforward, as the path integral in Minkowski space isn't just a simple analytic continuation of its Euclidean counterpart.
3. Wightman and Schwinger Functions
Wightman Functions
These are defined in the context of Minkowski space as vacuum expectation values of the time-ordered product of field operators, such as

They reflect the non-commutative nature of the field operators in real time and are generally distributions (not ordinary functions), complicating their mathematical handling and interpretation.
Schwinger Functions
Derived in Euclidean space, these functions correspond to moments of probability measures (related to path integrals) and are indexed by imaginary time.
Unlike Wightman functions, Schwinger functions are symmetric (
S
(
x

y

S

S(x,y) = S(y,x)
S

) and arise naturally in statistical mechanics at zero temperature (where the imaginary time coordinate is limited to a finite extent

).
Implications
These mathematical and conceptual challenges underscore the fundamental differences between Euclidean and Minkowski spaces in QFT. While Wick rotation provides a powerful theoretical tool, it isn't a panacea for all the problems in QFT due to inherent limitations in extending distributions, operator behaviors, and path integral measures across these two frameworks. This raises important considerations for theoretical physicists in how they approach problems involving deep quantum and relativistic regimes, where the traditional tools may need adaptation or rethinking.

Reconstructing the real time theory 
Given just the Schwinger functions, one can reconstruct the real time 
states and operators, but doing this requires breaking the SO(4) invariance 
of the imaginary time theory, by choosing an imaginary time direction, and 
an operator ��OSwhich implements ���Osterwalder-Schrader ref l ection��� in 
imaginary time. 
Note that the way spacetime symmetries work is dif f erent in real and 
imaginary time. The construction of operators and states in real time is 
SO(3,1) equivariant, with no distinguished direction of time (just �� 
timelike cones). 
Osterwalder-Schrader reconstruction is well-understood for scalar i eld 
theories, but what happens for spinors has always been much more 
mysterious. My proposal is that it is here that something unexpected 
happens, with a spacetime symmetry in the Euclidean QFT appearing as 
in internal symmetry in the Minkowski QFT.

The problem with spinors 
The fundamental problem is that the properties of 4d spinors are quite 
dif f erent in Minkowski and Euclidean spacetime. I don���t have time or space 
here to go through the spinor geometry. Some basic facts though are: 
Euclidean spacetime: The double cover of the rotation group is 
Spin(4) = SU(2)L��SU(2)R, 
with the geometry in some sense breaking up 
into separate ���left-handed��� and ���right-handed��� parts, with the two SU(2) 
groups acting on independent C2Weyl spinors SLand SR. Vectors are the 
tensor product SL��� SR 
Minkowski spacetime: Spin(4) is replaces by Spin(3,1) = SL(2,C). 
There is one kind of C2Weyl spinor S, together with its complex 
conjugate S. Minkowski spacetime vectors are the tensor product S ��� S.

The passage you've shared deals with the complex interplay between real and imaginary time formulations in quantum field theory (QFT), specifically focusing on the challenges posed by spinors in the transition from Euclidean to Minkowski spacetime. Let's break down the key points and their implications:
Osterwalder-Schrader Reconstruction
Background
:
Schwinger Functions
: These are defined in Euclidean (imaginary time) QFT and are symmetric in their arguments. They serve as a probabilistic measure in path integrals.
Wightman Functions
: These describe the real time behavior of fields in Minkowski spacetime and reflect the non-commutative nature of the operators.
Reconstruction Process
:
To transition from Euclidean QFT (Schwinger functions) to Minkowski QFT (Wightman functions), a process known as Osterwalder-Schrader reconstruction is employed. This involves "breaking" the SO(4) symmetry of the Euclidean theory by choosing a specific imaginary time direction. Additionally, an operator
��
O
S
\Theta_{OS}
��
OS
���
is used to implement the Osterwalder-Schrader reflection, which is critical for ensuring that the reconstructed real-time theory respects physical conditions like causality and unitarity.
SO(4) vs. SO(3,1)
: The Euclidean theory is invariant under rotations in four-dimensional space, while the real-time theory must respect the Lorentz symmetry of spacetime (SO(3,1)), which involves transformations that mix space and time but distinguish between time directions.
The Problem with Spinors
Differences in Spinor Geometry
:
Euclidean Space (Spin(4) = SU(2)_L �� SU(2)_R)
: In Euclidean space, the symmetry group for rotations, Spin(4), can be expressed as a product of two SU(2) groups. These groups act on two separate types of Weyl spinors,
S
L
S_L
S
L
���
and
S
R
S_R
S
R
���
, reflecting a kind of chirality or "handedness" in the Euclidean framework. Vectors in this space are considered as the tensor products of these left-handed and right-handed spinors.
Minkowski Space (Spin(3,1) = SL(2, C))
: In contrast, the corresponding symmetry group in Minkowski space is SL(2,C), which acts on a single type of Weyl spinor
S
S
S
and its complex conjugate. The vectors in Minkowski space are formed by the tensor products of a spinor and its conjugate.
Implications
:
The transition from the Euclidean to the Minkowski framework involves a fundamental change in how these spinors are structured and interact. This has always been a complex issue, particularly because the properties and interactions of these spinors are significantly altered by the change in spacetime symmetry.
Proposal
: The suggestion that Euclidean spacetime symmetries might appear as internal symmetries in Minkowski spacetime offers a potential unifying concept for addressing these discrepancies. This could imply new ways of understanding how fundamental symmetries govern the properties of elementary particles, potentially leading to new insights or formulations in particle physics.
Conclusion
The treatment of spinors across different spacetime geometries highlights not just a technical challenge in theoretical physics but also touches on deeper conceptual issues about the nature of space, time, and matter. Understanding these transitions and their implications could lead to significant advancements in how we conceive of and formulate theories that aim to unify quantum mechanics with general relativity, a central goal in the field of theoretical physics.

In the excerpt you've shared, the discussion on Wick rotating spinors highlights some technical and conceptual intricacies involved in the process, particularly with respect to the transformation properties of the Dirac operator and the role of complex spacetime symmetries. Here���s a breakdown of the key points and their implications:
Understanding the Dirac Operator and Wick Rotation
Dirac Operator
:
The Dirac operator, denoted as

D = \gamma^\mu \frac{\partial}{\partial x^\mu}

, is central to the description of fermions in quantum field theory. The gamma matrices (

��
\gamma^\mu

) are used to construct this operator, which are crucial for ensuring the theory respects the principles of relativity.
Although the Dirac operator is often treated as if it is Lorentz invariant for simplicity, it actually transforms non-trivially under Lorentz transformations, reflecting its vector-like behavior rather than being a true scalar.
Complex Spacetime and Spinor Transformations
:
When spacetime is complexified, meaning considering spacetime coordinates as complex numbers, the behavior and transformation properties of vectors and spinors change significantly.
Under complex spacetime, the rotation group for the Dirac operator is

A New Approach to Wick Rotation for Spinors
Revised Wick Rotation Process
:
Peter Woit suggests a different approach to Wick rotating spinors, focusing on the role of the Osterwalder-Schrader reflection (

\Theta_{OS}

) which is pivotal for correctly transforming the properties of spinor fields from Euclidean to Minkowski spacetime.
In Woit���s formulation, instead of rotating the tensor product of left and right Weyl spinors (

), the focus shifts to rotating

(right-handed spinors with themselves). This perspective aligns with his remark that "spacetime is right-handed," indicating a novel way of conceptualizing the underlying symmetries and properties of spacetime in the context of spinors.

suggests that the usual symmetries associated with left-handed spinors (

) might act trivially on the transformed fields, possibly relegating these symmetries to an internal role within the theory. This can have profound implications for how internal symmetries (like those seen in gauge theories) are understood in relation to spacetime symmetries.
Woit acknowledges that this is an area still under exploration, suggesting that the full implications and the mathematical formalism are still being developed.
Conclusion
This new approach to Wick rotating spinors proposed by Woit offers a potentially transformative way of understanding the relationship between spinor geometry and spacetime symmetries, possibly influencing how theories of particle physics are unified with theories of gravity. By reassessing how fundamental symmetries are represented and interact in theoretical physics, Woit is attempting to address some of the deep-seated challenges in formulating a consistent and empirically viable theory of everything. This underscores an ongoing need for innovative theoretical approaches in tackling the complex landscape of fundamental physics.
