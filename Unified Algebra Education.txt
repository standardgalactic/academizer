from Boolean Algebra 
to Unif i ed Algebra 
Eric C. R. Hehner 
University of Toronto 
Abstract 
Boolean algebra is simpler than number algebra, with applications in programming, circuit 
design, law, specif i cations, mathematical proof, and reasoning in any domain. So why is number 
algebra taught in primary school and used routinely by scientists, engineers, economists, and the 
general public, while boolean algebra is not taught until university, and not routinely used by 
anyone? A large part of the answer may be in the terminology and symbols used, and in the 
explanations of boolean algebra found in textbooks. This paper points out some of the problems 
delaying the acceptance and use of boolean algebra, and suggests some solutions. 
Introduction 
This paper is about the symbols and notations of boolean algebra, and about the way the subject 
is explained. It is about education, and about putting boolean algebra into general use and 
practice. To make the scope clear, by ���boolean algebra��� I mean the algebra whose expressions 
are of type boolean. I mean to include the expressions of propositional calculus and predicate 
calculus. The expressions of this algebra are called ���boolean expressions���. Analogously, the 
expressions of number algebra are called ���number expressions���. 
Boolean algebra is the basic algebra for much of computer science. Other applications include 
digital circuit design, law, reasoning about any subject, and any kind of specif i cations, as well as 
providing a foundation for all of mathematics. Boolean algebra is inherently simpler than 
number algebra. There are only two boolean values and a few boolean operators, and they can 
be explained by a small table. There are inf i nitely many number values and number operators, 
and even the simplest, counting, is inductively def i ned. So why is number algebra taught in 
primary school, and boolean algebra in university? Why isn't boolean algebra better known, 
better accepted, and better used? 
One reason may be that, although boolean algebra is just as useful as number algebra, it isn't as 
necessary. Informal methods of reckoning quantity became intolerable several thousand years 
ago, but we still get along with informal methods of specif i cation, design, and reasoning. 
Another reason may be just an accident of educational history, and still another may be our 
continuing mistreatment of boolean algebra.

The text you've shared discusses the disparity between the widespread teaching and use of number algebra compared to boolean algebra. The author, Eric C. R. Hehner of the University of Toronto, highlights that boolean algebra is simpler and has broad applications across various domains including programming, circuit design, law, specifications, mathematical proof, and general reasoning. Yet, boolean algebra is not introduced until university level and is not commonly utilized outside specialized fields.
Hehner suggests that part of the reason for this disparity lies in the way boolean algebra is presented in educational materials, including the terminology and symbols used, and how the subject is explained. He proposes that boolean algebra's lack of routine use and late introduction in the educational curriculum might be due to its perceived lack of necessity compared to number algebra, historical educational practices, and possibly the ongoing inadequate treatment of the subject in terms of its explanation and application.
This reflection raises important questions about the curriculum in mathematics education and suggests that a revision to include boolean algebra earlier might benefit a wide range of fields by providing a foundation for logical reasoning and decision making. Hehner's argument for unifying the teaching and application of boolean algebra with that of number algebra points to a potential shift in how mathematical education can be approached to include a broader set of tools for reasoning and problem-solving across disciplines.

Boolean Calculation 
Given an expression, it is often useful to fi nd an equivalent but simpler expression. For example, 
in number algebra 
x��(z+1) ��� y��(z���1) ��� z��(x���y)distribute 
=(x��z + x��1) ��� (y��z ��� y��1) ��� (z��x ��� z��y)unity and double negation 
=x��z + x ��� y��z + y ��� z��x + z��ysymmetry and associativity 
=x + y + (x��z ��� x��z) + (y��z ��� y��z)zero and identity 
=x + y 
We might sometimes want to fi nd an equivalent expression that isn't simpler; to remove the 
directionality I'll say ���calculation��� rather than ���simplif i cation���. We can use operators other than 
= down the left side of the calculation; we can even use a mixture of operators, as long as there 
is transitivity. For example, the calculation (for real x ) 
x��(x + 2)distribute 
=x2 + 2��xadd and subtract 1 
=x2 + 2��x + 1 ��� 1factor 
=(x + 1)2 ��� 1a square is nonnegative 
������1 
tells us x��(x + 2) ��� ���1 
Boolean calculation is similar. For example, 
2003-12-1from Boolean Algebra to Unif i ed Algebra3 
(a���b) ��� (b���a)replace implications 
�����a ��� b ��� ��b ��� a��� is symmetric 
���a ��� ��a ��� b ��� ��b excluded middle, twice 
���true ��� true��� is idempotent 
���true 
And so (a���b) ��� (b���a) has been simplif i ed to true , which is to say it has been proven. Here 
is another example. 
���n�� n + n2 = n3instance 
���0 + 02 = 03arithmetic 
���true 
And so (���n�� n + n2 = n3) ��� true , and so ���n�� n + n2 = n3 is proven. 
Solving simultaneous equations can also be done as a boolean calculation. For example, 
x + x��y + y = 5 ��� x ��� x��y + y = 1subtract and add 2��x��y in fi rst equation 
���x ��� x��y + y + 2��x��y = 5 ��� x ��� x��y + y = 1use second equation to simplify fi rst 
���1 + 2��x��y = 5 ��� x ��� x��y + y = 1 
���2��x��y = 4 ��� x ��� x��y + y = 1 
���x��y = 2 ��� x ��� x��y + y = 1use fi rst equation to simplify second 
���x��y = 2 ��� x ��� 2 + y = 1 
���x��y = 2 ��� x + y = 3 
���x=1 ��� y=2 ��� x=2 ��� y=1 
���x=1 ��� y=2 
These examples show that simplifying, proving, and solving are all the same: they are all just 
calculation. 
When an expression is too long to fi t on one line, it must be nicely formatted for easy reading, 
and when a hint is too long to fi t on the remainder of a line, it can be written on as many lines as 
it takes, but I do not consider formatting further here. One point worth mentioning is that 
subcalculations (if boolean, they are called subproofs or lemmas) can save copying unchanged 
parts of a calculation through many lines. These subcalculations can be done in another place 
and referenced, or they can be done in-place, nicely formatted, to provide a structured calculation 
(structured proof). By far the best way to handle subcalculations is provided by window 
inference systems [21] [2], which open a new window for each subcalculation, keep track of its 
direction, and make its context available. For example, in solving the simultaneous equations, I 
used the second equation to simplify the fi rst, and then the fi rst to simplify the second. 
In this brief introduction to boolean calculation, I have not taken the time to present all the rules. 
For a complete presentation, the reader is referred to [14]. A research monograph that uses 
calculational proof is [7]. A textbook on discrete math that uses calculational proof is [10]. For 
further discussion of calculational proofs see [9] [17].

to true and solving simultaneous equations using boolean operations, highlight the fundamental similarity between number and boolean calculations: both involve transforming expressions through a series of logical steps to uncover simpler forms or to demonstrate truths.
The discussion further explores the notion of calculation as a broader concept that includes simplification, proof, and problem-solving. It suggests that these activities, whether in number algebra or boolean algebra, follow a unified process of applying mathematical or logical operations to transition from complex to simplified expressions, solve equations, or establish truths.
Additionally, the text touches on practical aspects of performing calculations, such as the importance of clear formatting for long expressions and the use of subcalculations (or subproofs in boolean contexts) to manage complexity. It hints at the benefits of window inference systems in managing these calculations by maintaining the context and direction of subcalculations, thereby enhancing the structure and clarity of mathematical proofs or solutions.
In summary, the excerpt illuminates the concept of boolean calculation as a powerful tool in mathematics and logic, paralleling and complementing the principles of number algebra. It advocates for a broader understanding and application of boolean algebra, emphasizing its fundamental role in simplification, proof, and problem-solving across diverse fields.

Traditional Terminology 
Formal logic has developed a complicated terminology that its students are forced to learn. 
There are terms, which are said to have values. There are formulas, also known as propositions 
or sentences, which are said not to have values, but instead to be true or false. Operators (+, ���) 
join terms, while connectives (���, ���) join formulas. Some terms are boolean, and they have the 
value true or false , but that's different from being true or false. It is diff i cult to fi nd a 
def i nition of predicate, but it seems that a boolean term like x=y stops being a boolean term and 
2003-12-1from Boolean Algebra to Unif i ed Algebra4 
mysteriously starts being a predicate when we admit the possibility of using quantif i ers (���, ���). 
Does x+y stop being a number term if we admit the possibility of using summation and product 
(��, ��)? There are at least three different equal signs: = for terms, and ��� and ��� for formulas 
and predicates, with one of them carrying an implicit universal quantif i cation. We can even fi nd 
a peculiar mixture in some textbooks, such as the following: 
a+b = a ��� a+b = b 
Here, a and b are boolean variables, + is a boolean operator (disjunction), a+b is a boolean 
term (having value true or false ), a+b = a and a+b = b are formulas (so they are true or 
false), and fi nally ��� is a logical connective. 
Fortunately, in the past few decades there has been a noticeable shift toward erasing the 
distinction between being true or false and having the value true or false . It is a shift toward 
the calculational style of proof. But we have a long way to go yet, as I fi nd whenever I ask my 
beginning students to prove something of the form a���b where ��� is pronounced ���exclusive 
or���. They cannot even start because they expect something that looks grammatically like a 
sentence. If I change it to either of the equivalent forms (a���b ) ��� true or a���b they are happy 
because they can read it as a sentence with a verb. But (a���b ) ��� true confuses them again 
because it seems to have too many verbs. If I ask them to prove something of the form a���b , 
they take an unwittingly constructivist interpretation, and suppose I want them to prove a or 
prove b because that is what ���do a or b ��� means in English. The same lack of understanding 
can be found in many introductory programming texts where boolean expressions are not taught 
in their generality but as comparisons because comparisons have verbs. We fi nd 
while fl ag=true do something od 
but not the equivalent, simpler, more eff i cient 
while fl ag do something od 
because fl ag isn't the right part of speech to follow while . Our dependence on natural 
language for the understanding of boolean expressions is a serious impediment.

This segment critiques the traditional terminology used in formal logic and its complexity, which poses challenges for students new to the subject. It points out the distinction made between terms, which can have values (including boolean values of true or false), and formulas or propositions, which are evaluated as being true or false but are not said to have values. This distinction extends to the operators and connectives used within logic: operators such as
+
+
+
and
���
-
���
are used for terms, while connectives like
���
\land
���
(AND) and
���
\lor
���
(OR) join formulas.
A key point of confusion highlighted is the status of boolean terms versus predicates. The text suggests a lack of clarity in how a boolean term like
x
=
y
x=y
x
=
y
transforms into a predicate upon the introduction of quantifiers (
���
\exists
���
for "exists",
���
\forall
���
for "for all"). This ambiguity is likened to questioning whether a numeric term stops being such when operations like summation (
��
\Sigma
��
) and product (
��
\Pi
��
) are applied.
Further complicating matters are the multiple symbols for equality:
=
=
=
for terms, and
���
\Leftrightarrow
���
and
���
\equiv
���
for formulas and predicates, with nuanced differences in meaning and application. The example given,
a
+
b
=
a
���
a
+
b
=
b
a+b = a \lor a+b = b
a
+
b
=
a
���
a
+
b
=
b
, illustrates how boolean algebra blurs these distinctions, with boolean variables, operators, and logical connectives intermingling in ways that challenge traditional categorizations.
The text then observes a shift over recent decades towards simplifying this complexity by diminishing the distinction between "being true or false" and "having the value true or false". This movement towards a calculational style of proof aims to make logical analysis more accessible and intuitive. However, challenges remain, particularly in teaching and understanding boolean expressions. The author notes difficulties students face when asked to prove expressions involving exclusive or (
���
\oplus
���
), equivalence (
���
\equiv
���
), and disjunction (
���
\lor
���
), often due to expectations set by natural language grammar.
This discussion highlights a broader issue in education around boolean expressions, particularly in introductory programming, where there's a reluctance to teach boolean expressions in their full generality, preferring instead to frame them as comparisons. This is attributed to a dependency on natural language constructs, which can limit understanding and application of boolean logic.
In summary, the text critiques the complexity and inconsistencies of traditional formal logic terminology and advocates for continued efforts to streamline these concepts to make them more accessible and intuitive, particularly for beginners. This approach not only aids in learning but also supports a deeper understanding and application of boolean logic in computing and reasoning tasks.

Historical Perspective 
To start to answer these questions, I'm going to look brief l y at the history of number algebra. 
Long after the invention of numbers and arithmetic, quantitative reasoning was still a matter of 
trial and error, and still conducted in natural language. If a man died leaving his 3 goats and 20 
chickens to be divided equally between his 2 sons, and it was agreed that a goat is worth 8 
chickens, the solution was determined by iterative approximations, probably using the goats and 
chickens themselves in the calculation. The arithmetic needed for verif i cation was well 
2003-12-1from Boolean Algebra to Unif i ed Algebra1 
understood long before the algebra needed to fi nd a solution. 
The advent of algebra provided a more effective way of fi nding solutions to such problems, but it 
was a diff i cult step up in abstraction. The step from constants to variables is as large as the step 
from chickens to numbers. In English 500 years ago, constants were called ���nombers 
denominate��� [concrete numbers], and variables were called ���nombers abstracte���. One of the 
simplest, most general laws, sometimes called ���substitution of equals for equals���, 
x=y ��� fx=fy 
seems to have been discovered a little at a time. Here is one special case [20]: 
���In the firste there appeareth 2 nombers, that is 14x + 15y equalle to one nomber, whiche is 
71y . But if you marke them well, you maie see one denomination, on bothe sides of the 
equation, which never ought to stand. Wherfore abating [subtracting] the lesser, that is 15y 
out of bothe the nombers, there will remain 14x = 56y that is, by reduction, 1x = 4y . 
Scholar. I see, you abate 15y from them bothe. And then are thei equalle still, seyng thei 
wer equalle before. According to the thirde common sentence, in the patthewaie: If you abate 
even [equal] portions, from thynges that bee equalle, the partes that remain shall be equall also. 
Master. You doe well remember the firste grounds of this arte.��� 
And then, a paragraph later, another special case: 
���If you adde equalle portions, to thynges that bee equalle, what so amounteth of them shall be 
equalle.���

The historical perspective provided delves into the evolution of number algebra and its transformative impact on quantitative reasoning. Initially, arithmetic operations and problem-solving were executed through trial and error, often employing the actual objects involved in the problems, such as goats and chickens in the given example. The development of algebra marked a significant leap in abstraction, moving from concrete arithmetic operations to the use of variables and constants, thereby revolutionizing problem-solving by offering a more systematic approach.
This shift is illustrated through the linguistic transition in English 500 years ago, where concrete numbers were referred to as ���nombers denominate��� and variables as ���nombers abstracte.��� Such a change underscores the magnitude of conceptual advancement from dealing with tangible quantities to engaging with abstract representations.
The principle of the "substitution of equals for equals," exemplified in the text, highlights an incremental discovery in algebraic reasoning. This foundational concept, presented through historical dialogue, emphasizes the logic that subtracting or adding equal amounts to both sides of an equation preserves equality, a notion that is crucial to algebraic manipulation and problem-solving.
This historical narrative not only provides insight into the origins and development of algebraic thought but also reflects on the challenges and breakthroughs in abstract reasoning. It underscores the significance of algebra as a tool that enhanced the ability to solve complex problems more efficiently and abstractly, moving beyond the limitations of trial and error and the direct manipulation of physical objects.
The transition from arithmetic to algebra represents a pivotal moment in the history of mathematics, encapsulating the evolution from concrete problem-solving methods to the establishment of abstract principles that underpin modern algebraic practices. This progression laid the groundwork for further advancements in mathematics and related fields, illustrating the enduring impact of algebra on the capacity for human reasoning and problem-solving.

Each step in an abstract calculation was accompanied by a concrete justif i cation. For example, 
we have the Commutative Law [0]: 
When the chekyns of two gentle menne are counted, we may count first the chekyns of the 
gentylman having fewer chekyns, and after the chekyns of the gentylman having the greater 
portion. If the nomber of the greater portion be counted first, and then that of the lesser 
portion, the denomination so determined shall be the same. 
This version of the Commutative Law includes an unnecessary case analysis, and it has missed a 
case: when the two gentlemen have the same number of chickens, it does not say whether the 
order matters. The Associative Law [0]: 
When thynges to be counted are divided in two partes, and lately are found moare thynges to be 
counted in the same generall quantitie, it matters not whether the thynges lately added be 
counted together with the lesser parte or with the greater parte, or that there are severalle partes 
and the thynges lately added be counted together with any one of them. 
As you can imagine, the distance from 2x + 3 = 3x + 2 to x=1 was likely to be several pages. 
The reason for all the discussion in between formulas was that algebra was not yet fully trusted. 
Algebra replaces meaning with symbol manipulation; the loss of meaning is not easy to accept. 
The author constantly had to reassure those readers who had not yet freed themselves from 
thinking about the objects represented by numbers and variables. Those who were skilled in the 
art of informal reasoning about quantity were convinced that thinking about the objects helps to calculate correctly, because that is how they did it. As with any technological advance, those 
who are most skilled in the old way are the most reluctant to see it replaced by the new.

The text highlights a fascinating phase in the evolution of algebraic thought, focusing on the transition from concrete reasoning to abstract calculation. It illustrates this through examples of the Commutative and Associative Laws, explained in terms of counting chickens belonging to gentlemen with differing quantities. These examples underscore the initial need for concrete justifications for abstract principles, reflecting the skepticism and lack of trust in purely symbolic algebra during its early development.
The Commutative Law's explanation, through the order of counting chickens, seeks to reassure that the total number remains unaffected by the sequence in which counts are combined. However, the example's shortcomings, such as overlooking the scenario where both gentlemen own an equal number of chickens, reflect the challenges of articulating abstract laws in entirely concrete terms.
Similarly, the Associative Law's explanation attempts to convey that the grouping of quantities (or "thynges to be counted") does not impact the overall sum, regardless of how these quantities are partitioned or added. This law's description, aimed at a time when the concept of abstract quantities was still gaining acceptance, highlights the effort to ground mathematical principles in familiar, tangible scenarios.
The text also touches on the considerable explanatory efforts that were necessary to bridge the gap between concrete examples and abstract formulas. The journey from a simple equation like
2
x
+
3
=
3
x
+
2
2x + 3 = 3x + 2
2
x
+

x
+
2
to its solution (
x
=
1
x=1
x
=
1
) was not just a matter of applying algebraic rules; it involved extensive justification to persuade readers of algebra's validity and utility. This necessity stemmed from the significant conceptual leap required to move from tangible, object-based reasoning to abstract symbol manipulation���a leap that was met with resistance from those accustomed to more concrete methods of calculation.
Moreover, the reluctance of experts in traditional, informal reasoning to embrace algebraic abstraction underscores a common theme in the advancement of knowledge and technology: the challenge of shifting from well-established practices to innovative methods. This resistance is often rooted in comfort with existing expertise and skepticism towards new approaches that seem to discard the meaning or intuition underlying the old ways.
In essence, this historical perspective illuminates the gradual acceptance of algebra as a powerful tool for abstract reasoning, emphasizing the pivotal role of trust in the transition from concrete to abstract mathematical thought. It also reflects on the broader theme of innovation and resistance, highlighting the tension between traditional expertise and the adoption of new methodologies.

Today, of course, we expect a quantitative calculation to be conducted entirely in algebra, 
without reference to thynges. Although we justify each step in a calculation by reference to an 
algebraic law, we do not have to justify the laws continually. We can go farther, faster, more 
succinctly, and with much greater certainty. In a typical modern proof (see the fi rst Appendix) 
we see lines like 
2003-12-1from Boolean Algebra to Unif i ed Algebra2 
��rar=(bab���1)r=barb���1=ar 
br=��rbr=(��b)r=(a���1ba)r=a���1bra 
(a1���1b1)2=a1���1b1a1���1b1=a1���1(b1a1���1)b1=a1���1(��a1���1b1)b1=��a1���2b12 
(a1���1b1)r=��1+2+...+(r���1)a1���rb1r=��1+2+...+(r���1)=��r(r���1)/2 
These lines were taken from a proof of Wedderburn's Theorem (a fi nite division ring is a 
commutative fi eld) in [15] (the text used when I studied algebra). Before we start to feel pleased 
with ourselves at the improvement, let me point out that there is another kind of calculation, a 
boolean calculation, occurring in the English text between the formulas. In the example proof 
[15] we fi nd the words ���consequently���, ���implying���, ���there is/are���, ���however���, ���thus���, ���hence���, 
���since���, ���forces���, ���if...then���, ���in consequence of which���, ���from which we get���, ���whence���, 
���would imply���, ���contrary to���, ���so that���, ���contradicting���; all these words suggest boolean 
operators. We also fi nd bookkeeping sentences like ���We fi rst remark ...���, ���We must now rule out 
the case ...���; these suggest the structure of a boolean expression. It will be quite a large 
expression, perhaps taking an entire page. If written in the usual unformatted fashion of proofs 
in current algebra texts, it will be quite unreadable. The same problem occurs with computer 
programs, which can be thousands of pages long; to make them readable they must be carefully 
formatted, with indentation to indicate structure. We will have to do likewise with proofs. 
A formal proof is a boolean calculation using boolean algebra; when we learn to use it well, it 
will enable us to go farther, faster, more succinctly, and with much greater certainty. But there is 
a great resistance in the mathematical community to formal proof, especially from those who are 
most expert at informal proof. They complain that formal proof loses meaning, replacing it with 
symbol manipulation. The current state of boolean algebra, not as an object of study but as a tool 
for use, is much the same as number algebra was 5 centuries ago.

This passage articulates the evolution of mathematical reasoning from concrete examples to abstract algebraic calculations, highlighting the modern reliance on algebra for quantitative analysis without the need to constantly refer to physical "thynges." It showcases how algebraic laws now underpin each step of a calculation, allowing for more rapid, concise, and certain problem-solving.
The text draws an intriguing parallel between traditional algebraic proofs, exemplified by steps in a proof of Wedderburn's Theorem, and boolean calculations embedded within the language used to connect and explain these steps. Words like "consequently," "implying," and "thus" act as boolean operators, guiding the logical flow of the proof without explicit formalization. This narrative structure within mathematical proofs suggests that while the explicit calculations may be algebraic, the underlying logical structure is boolean in nature.
The discussion then transitions to the readability and formatting of both algebraic proofs and computer programs, emphasizing the need for careful structuring to enhance understanding. Just as indentation and formatting are essential for making complex computer programs comprehensible, a similar approach is advocated for algebraic proofs to make them accessible and to reveal their inherent boolean structure.
The concluding remarks touch upon the resistance within the mathematical community towards formal proof methods. Despite the efficiency and clarity formal proofs can offer, there's apprehension that they might strip away the deeper meaning and intuition behind the mathematics, reducing it to mere symbol manipulation. This resistance is likened to the skepticism that met algebraic methods five centuries ago, suggesting that the current state of boolean algebra parallels the early stages of number algebra's acceptance. The passage implies that just as number algebra eventually became a fundamental tool, there is potential for boolean algebra to undergo a similar transformation, becoming more widely understood and utilized as a robust tool for mathematical reasoning and proof.

Boolean Calculation 
Given an expression, it is often useful to fi nd an equivalent but simpler expression. For example, 
in number algebra 
x��(z+1) ��� y��(z���1) ��� z��(x���y)distribute 
=(x��z + x��1) ��� (y��z ��� y��1) ��� (z��x ��� z��y)unity and double negation

=x + y + (x��z ��� x��z) + (y��z ��� y��z)zero and identity 
=x + y 
We might sometimes want to fi nd an equivalent expression that isn't simpler; to remove the 
directionality I'll say ���calculation��� rather than ���simplif i cation���. We can use operators other than 
= down the left side of the calculation; we can even use a mixture of operators, as long as there 
is transitivity. For example, the calculation (for real x ) 
x��(x + 2)distribute 
=x2 + 2��xadd and subtract 1 
=x2 + 2��x + 1 ��� 1factor 
=(x + 1)2 ��� 1a square is nonnegative 
������1 
tells us x��(x + 2) ��� ���1 
Boolean calculation is similar. For example,

�����a ��� b ��� ��b ��� a��� is symmetric

And so (a���b) ��� (b���a) has been simplif i ed to true , which is to say it has been proven. Here 
is another example. 
���n�� n + n2 = n3instance 
���0 + 02 = 03arithmetic 
���true 
And so (���n�� n + n2 = n3) ��� true , and so ���n�� n + n2 = n3 is proven. 
Solving simultaneous equations can also be done as a boolean calculation. For example, 
x + x��y + y = 5 ��� x ��� x��y + y = 1subtract and add 2��x��y in fi rst equation 
���x ��� x��y + y + 2��x��y = 5 ��� x ��� x��y + y = 1use second equation to simplify fi rst 
���1 + 2��x��y = 5 ��� x ��� x��y + y = 1

���x��y = 2 ��� x + y = 3 
���x=1 ��� y=2 ��� x=2 ��� y=1 
���x=1 ��� y=2 
These examples show that simplifying, proving, and solving are all the same: they are all just 
calculation.

The passage highlights the versatility and power of both number algebra and boolean algebra in performing calculations, simplifications, and proofs. Through examples, it demonstrates how algebraic and boolean manipulations can be used to simplify expressions, prove statements, and solve equations.
In number algebra, the process of distributing, combining like terms, and applying basic arithmetic properties simplifies complex expressions into more manageable forms. For instance, a complex expression involving variables and arithmetic operations is systematically reduced to a simpler expression, showcasing the application of distributive, associative, and commutative properties, as well as the concepts of unity and zero.
Similarly, in boolean algebra, logical expressions can be simplified using logical operations and identities. The passage illustrates this with the simplification of a boolean expression involving implications to prove that it's equivalent to true. It also shows how existential quantification can be used to prove a statement by providing a specific instance that satisfies the equation.
The concept of calculation is expanded to include not just simplification but also proving and solving within both number and boolean algebra contexts. This broader perspective acknowledges the transitive use of different operators and the structured approach to transforming expressions and equations.
Furthermore, solving simultaneous equations through boolean manipulation is presented as another facet of boolean calculation, demonstrating how algebraic and logical techniques intersect to solve problems. The examples culminate in the insight that all these mathematical activities���whether in number algebra or boolean algebra���are fundamentally calculations aimed at deriving simpler expressions, solving equations, or establishing truths.
Overall, the passage underscores the importance of algebraic and boolean reasoning in mathematics, illustrating how these tools enable more efficient problem-solving and proof construction. It celebrates the computational power of algebra, both in its numeric and boolean forms, while advocating for a unified approach to understanding and applying these fundamental mathematical concepts.

Traditional Notations 
Arithmetic notations are reasonably standard throughout the world. The expression 
738 + 45 = 783 
is recognized and understood by schoolchildren almost everywhere. But there are no standard 
boolean notations. Even the two boolean constants have no standard symbols. Symbols in use 
include truetT10 
falsefF01 
Quite often the boolean constants are written as 1 and 0 , with + for disjunction, adjacency for 
conjunction, and perhaps ��� for negation. With this notation, here are some laws. 
x(y+z) = xy + xz 
x + yz = (x+y)(x + z) 
x + ���x = 1 
x(���x) = 0 
The fi rst law above coincides with number algebra, but the next three clash with number algebra. 
The overwhelming reaction of algebraists to notational criticisms is: it doesn't matter which 
symbols are used; just introduce them, and get on with it. But to apply an algebra, one must 
recognize the patterns, matching laws to the expression at hand. The laws have to be familiar. It 
takes an extra moment to think which algebra I am using as I apply a law. The logician R.L. 
Goodstein [8] chose to use 0 and 1 the other way around, which slows me down a little more. 
2003-12-1from Boolean Algebra to Unif i ed Algebra5 
A big change, like using + as a variable and x as an operator, would slow me down a lot. I 
think it matters even to algebraists because they too have to recognize patterns. To a larger 
public, the reuse of arithmetic symbols with different meanings is an insurmountable obstacle. 
And when we mix arithmetic and boolean operators in one expression, as we often do, it is 
impossible to disambiguate. 
The most common notations for the two boolean constants found in programming languages and 
in programming textbooks seem to be true and false . I have two objections to these symbols. 
The fi rst is that they are English-based and clumsy. Number algebra could never have advanced 
to its present state if we had to write out words for numbers. 
seven three eight + four fi ve = seven eight three 
is just too clumsy, and so is 
true ��� false ��� true ��� true 
Clumsiness may seem minor, but it can be the difference between success and failure in a 
mathematical formalism. 
My second, and more serious, objection is that the words true and false confuse the algebra 
with an application. One of the primary applications of boolean algebra is to formalize 
reasoning, to determine the truth or falsity of some statements from the truth or falsity of others. 
In that application, we use one of the boolean constants to represent truth, and the other to 
represent falsity. So for that application, it seems reasonable to call them true and false . The 
algebra arose from that application, and it is so much identif i ed with it that many people cannot 
separate them; they think the boolean values really are true and false . But of course boolean 
expressions are useful for describing anything that comes in two kinds. We apply boolean 
algebra to circuits in which there are two voltages. We sometimes say that there are 0s and 1s in 
a computer's memory, or that there are trues and falses. Of course that's nonsense; there are 
neither 0s and 1s nor trues and falses in there; there are low and high voltages. We need 
symbols that can represent truth values and voltages equally well.

The passage addresses the lack of standardization in boolean notations and the implications this has for learning, using, and teaching boolean algebra. Unlike arithmetic, where notations like

738 + 45 = 783

The text outlines basic boolean laws using a notation system where
+

represents negation. However, this choice of symbols, while familiar to those versed in arithmetic, can cause confusion due to their different meanings in boolean contexts. For instance,

y

z

y
+
x

x(y+z) = xy + xz
x

appears similar in both number and boolean algebra, but interpretations like
x

���
x

x + -x = 1
x

���
x

diverge from arithmetic expectations.
The author argues that the choice of symbols does matter significantly because recognizing and applying algebraic laws relies on pattern recognition, which is hindered by inconsistent or confusing notation. The confusion is exacerbated when arithmetic and boolean expressions are mixed, making it difficult to determine the context and correctly apply the laws.
Furthermore, the passage critiques the common practice in programming languages of using the English words "true" and "false" for boolean constants. The author points out that such verbosity could hinder the efficiency and accessibility of boolean algebra, drawing a parallel to how impractical it would be if arithmetic relied on spelled-out words for numbers. Moreover, the use of "true" and "false" is criticized for conflating the algebra with its applications, particularly in formal logic, where these values represent truthfulness or falseness of statements. This association can obscure the broader applicability of boolean algebra to other domains, such as electronic circuits, where "true" and "false" do not inherently apply but rather represent different states, such as voltage levels.
The discussion emphasizes the need for a more universal and application-neutral notation in boolean algebra to facilitate its understanding, teaching, and application across various fields. By adopting a more standardized and less ambiguous set of symbols, boolean algebra could potentially become as accessible and widely understood as arithmetic algebra.

We could use top and bottom, or tautology and contradiction

Using terms like "top" and "bottom" or "tautology" and "contradiction" to represent boolean constants offers an alternative to the more common "true" and "false," or numerical representations like
1

and
0

. This approach aligns with the desire for notation that's both universal and neutral, avoiding conflation with specific applications and emphasizing the abstract nature of boolean algebra. Let's explore these terms:
Top and Bottom
: This notation abstracts away from traditional true/false dichotomies to emphasize the inherent structure of boolean algebra as a lattice. "Top" (
���
\top
���
) symbolizes the universally true value, the highest point in the boolean lattice where all paths lead, analogous to the concept of a tautology in logic. "Bottom" (
���
\bot
���
), in contrast, represents the universally false value, the lowest point in the lattice, akin to a contradiction. This approach emphasizes the positional relationships within boolean algebra without relying on the typical true/false semantics.
Tautology and Contradiction
: Using "tautology" to represent the always-true value and "contradiction" for the always-false value brings the terminology closer to logical foundations. A tautology in logic is a statement that is true under any interpretation of its components, mirroring the role of "true" in boolean algebra. A contradiction is a statement that is false regardless of the truth values of its components, analogous to the "false" value in boolean algebra. This notation underscores the logical roots of boolean algebra and its application in formal reasoning and proofs.
Both sets of terms shift the focus from everyday language (true/false) or mathematics (1/0) to the intrinsic properties of boolean values as elements of a logical or algebraic system. This shift can help in several ways:
Reducing Ambiguity
: By moving away from numbers and common language, these terms reduce the risk of confusion with arithmetic operations or everyday usage.
Enhancing Conceptual Clarity
: They emphasize the role of boolean constants as fundamental building blocks in logical and algebraic structures, facilitating a deeper understanding of boolean operations and their applications.
Broadening Applicability
: These notations make it clearer that boolean algebra is not just about truth in a philosophical or linguistic sense but about binary distinctions in various systems, including computing, logic, and mathematical structures.
Adopting such terminology could be particularly useful in educational contexts to help students grasp the abstract nature of boolean algebra and its distinction from number algebra, as well as in research and technical writing to ensure precision and clarity.

Boolean expressions have other applications, and the notations we choose should be equally 
appropriate for all of them. Computer programs are written to make computers work in some 
desired way. Before writing a program, a programmer should know which ways are desirable 
and which are not. That divides computer behavior into two kinds, and we can use boolean 
expressions to represent them. A boolean expression used this way is called a specif i cation. We 
can specify anything, not just computer behavior, using boolean expressions. For example, if 
you would like to buy a table, then tables are of two kinds: those you fi nd desirable and are 
willing to buy, and those you fi nd undesirable and are not willing to buy. So you can use a 
boolean expression as a table specif i cation. Acceptable and unacceptable human behavior is 
specif i ed by laws, and boolean expressions have been proposed as a better way than legal 
language for writing laws [1]. They can be used to calculate the attractions and repulsions 
among a set of magnets. 
For symbols that are independent of the application, I propose the lattice symbols ��� and ��� , 
pronounced ���top��� and ���bottom���. Since boolean algebra is the mother of all lattices, I think it is 
appropriate, not a misuse of those symbols. They can equally well be used for true and false 
statements, for high and low voltages (power and ground), for satisfactory and unsatisfactory 
tables, for innocent and guilty behavior, or any other opposites. 
For disjunction, the symbol ��� is fairly standard, coming from the Latin word ���vel��� for ���or���. 
2003-12-1from Boolean Algebra to Unif i ed Algebra6 
For conjunction, the symbol is less standard, the two most common choices being & and ��� . 
We are even less settled on a symbol for implication. Symbols in use include 
��� ��� ��� ��� 
The usual explanation says it means ���if then���, followed by a discussion about the meaning of ���if 
then���. Apparently, people fi nd it diff i cult to understand an implication whose antecedent is 
false ; for example, ���If my mother had been a man, I'd be the king of France.��� [19]. Such an 
implication is called ���counter-factual���. Some people are uneasy with the idea that false implies 
anything, so some researchers in Artif i cial Intelligence have proposed a new def i nition of 
implication. The following truth table shows both the old and new def i nitions. 
oldnew 
aba���ba���b 
truetruetruetrue 
truefalsefalsefalse 
falsetruetrueunknown 
falsefalsetrueunknown 
where unknown is a third boolean value. When the antecedent is false , the result of the new 
kind of implication is unknown . This is argued to be more intuitive. I believe this proposal 
betrays a serious misunderstanding of logic. When someone makes a statement, they are saying 
that the statement is true. Even if the statement is ���if a then b ��� and a is known to be false, 
nonetheless we are being told that ���if a then b ��� is true. It is the consequent b that is unknown. 
And that is represented perfectly by the old implication: there are two rows in which a is false 
and a���b is true ; on one of these rows, b is true , and on the other b is false .

This passage delves deeper into the significance of choosing neutral and universal symbols for boolean expressions, emphasizing their broad applicability beyond traditional logic or computing scenarios. It highlights how boolean expressions serve as specifications in various contexts, from programming and legal language to everyday decisions and physical phenomena. The use of boolean expressions to classify things into binary categories���such as desirable vs. undesirable, legal vs. illegal, or high voltage vs. low voltage���underscores their utility in structuring and simplifying complex decision-making processes.
The author proposes using lattice symbols ��� (top) and ��� (bottom) as application-independent representations for the binary states typically referred to as true/false, high/low, or any other dichotomy. This suggestion is rooted in the foundational role of boolean algebra within the broader mathematical framework of lattices, advocating for a symbolic representation that transcends specific use cases while capturing the essence of binary distinctions.
For logical operations, the passage notes a relative standardization with the symbol ��� for disjunction, derived from the Latin "vel" for "or." However, it also points out the lack of consensus on symbols for conjunction and implication, with several symbols in use for each. This diversity reflects the nuanced interpretations and applications of these operations across different fields.
The discussion on implication is particularly insightful, highlighting the challenges in understanding and accepting counter-factual implications���statements with a false antecedent. The introduction of a "new" definition of implication in some Artificial Intelligence research, which treats the implication as "unknown" when the antecedent is false, is critiqued as a misunderstanding of logic. The author defends the traditional interpretation of implication, explaining how it adequately represents the relationship between antecedent and consequent, regardless of the truth value of the antecedent.
This exploration of boolean algebra, its symbols, and operations illuminates the importance of clarity, universality, and neutrality in mathematical notation. It argues for notational choices that facilitate broad understanding and application, enabling boolean algebra to function effectively across diverse domains.

Debate about implication has been going on for a long time; 22 centuries ago, Callimachus, the 
librarian at Alexandria, said ���Even the crows on the roof croak about what implications are 
sound.���[3] [18]. In case you think that confusion is past, or just for beginners, consider the 
explanation of implication in Contemporary Logic Design, 1994 [16]: 
���As an example, let's look at the following logic statement: 
IF the garage door is open 
AND the car is running 
THEN the car can be backed out of the garage 
It states that the conditions ��� the garage is open and the car is running ��� must be true 
before the car can be backed out. If either or both are false, then the car cannot be backed 
out.��� 
Even a Berkeley computer science and electrical engineering professor can get implication 
wrong. 
Implication is best presented as an ordering. If we are calling the boolean values ���top��� and 
���bottom���, we can say ���lower than or equal to��� for implication. It is easy, even for primary 
school students, to accept that ��� is lower than or equal to ��� , and that ��� is lower than or 
equal to ��� . With this new pronunciation and explanation, three other neglected boolean 
operators become familiar and usable; they are ���higher than or equal to���, ���lower than���, and 
���higher than���. For lack of a name and symbol, the last two operators have been treated like 
shameful secrets, and shunned. If we are still calling the boolean values ���true��� and ���false���, then 
we shall have to call implication ���falser than or equal to���. As we get into boolean expressions 
that use other types, ordering remains a good explanation: x<4 is falser than or equal to x<6 , as 
a sampling of evaluations illustrates (try x = 3, 5, 7). I have tried using the standard words 
���stronger��� and ���weaker���, saying x<4 is stronger than x<6 ; but I fi nd that some of my students 
2003-12-1from Boolean Algebra to Unif i ed Algebra7 
have an ethical objection to saying that falsity is stronger than truth. 
That implication is the boolean ordering, with ��� and ��� at the extremes, is not appreciated by 
all who use boolean algebra. In the specif i cation language Z [24], boolean expressions are used 
as specif i cations. Specif i cation A ref i nes specif i cation B if all behavior satisfying A also 
satisf i es B . Although increasing satisfaction is exactly the implication ordering, the designers of 
Z def i ned a different ordering for ref i nement where ��� is not satisf i ed by all computations, only 
by terminating computations, and ��� is satisf i ed by some computations, namely nonterminating 
computations. They chose to embed a new lattice within boolean algebra, rather than to use the 
lattice that it provides. 
Implication has often been def i ned as a ���secondary��� operator in terms of the ���primary��� operators 
negation and disjunction: 
(a���b) ��� ��a ��� b 
Proofs about implications proceed by getting rid of them in favor of the more familiar negation 
and disjunction, as I did earlier in an example. This avoids the informal explanation, but it 
makes an unsupportable distinction between ���primary��� and ���secondary��� operators, and hides the 
fact that it is an ordering. When we learn that implication is an ordering, proofs about 
implications become shorter and easier. 
If we present implication as an ordering, as I prefer, then we face the problem of how to use this 
ordering in the formalization of natural language reasoning. To what extent does the algebraic 
operator ���lower than or equal to��� correspond to the English word ���implication���? Philosophers 
and linguists are welcome to consider this question. But we shouldn't let the complexities of this 
application of boolean algebra complicate the algebra, any more than we let the complexities of 
the banking industry complicate the def i nition of arithmetic.

The passage delves into the long-standing debate about the nature and interpretation of implication in boolean algebra, highlighting historical and contemporary misunderstandings and attempts to conceptualize it more intuitively. The author revisits the ancient observation by Callimachus about the widespread confusion over implications, illustrating that this confusion is not only historical but persists among experts in fields like computer science and electrical engineering.
The author proposes framing implication as an ordering within boolean algebra, using "lower than or equal to" when discussing boolean values conceptualized as "top" (���) and "bottom" (���). This approach aims to demystify implication by leveraging the intuitive understanding of order relations, making the concept more accessible even to primary school students. By presenting implication in this manner, the author also introduces the possibility of engaging with other, less commonly discussed boolean operators like ���higher than or equal to,��� ���lower than,��� and ���higher than,��� which have been neglected or misunderstood due to the absence of clear terminology and symbols.
The text critiques the standard definition of implication (

b
���
��
a
���
b
a \Rightarrow b \equiv \neg a \lor b
a
���
b
���
��

���

) as a construction from "primary" operators (negation and disjunction), arguing that this perspective obscures the true nature of implication as an ordering. The author suggests that recognizing implication as an ordering simplifies proofs and deepens understanding, moving away from an artificial distinction between "primary" and "secondary" operators.
The discussion extends to the application of boolean algebra in specification languages like Z, where the traditional boolean ordering is adapted to fit specific computational contexts���terminating versus nonterminating computations. This adaptation indicates the flexibility and challenges in applying boolean algebra to real-world problems, suggesting that the core algebraic principles might be reshaped to suit particular needs without altering the foundational logic.
Finally, the passage invites philosophers and linguists to explore the correspondence between the algebraic concept of "lower than or equal to" and the natural language concept of "implication." This invitation acknowledges the complexities inherent in translating logical structures into natural language and vice versa, emphasizing the need to keep algebraic definitions clear and distinct from the intricacies of their applications in various domains.
Overall, the passage advocates for a more intuitive understanding of implication in boolean algebra, proposing a shift in perspective that emphasizes the logical ordering of boolean values and simplifies the conceptualization and teaching of logical relationships.

Ok that is getting closer but I organised them in ascending order 0000 to 0000. You don't have to do it now, let's keep summarizing the article
ChatGPT
ChatGPT
Certainly! To summarize the key points and ideas we've discussed from the article and our conversation:
Boolean Algebra in Education and Application

Symmetry and Duality 
In choosing inf i x symbols, there is a simple principle that really helps our ability to calculate: we 
should choose symmetric symbols for symmetric operators, and asymmetric symbols for 
asymmetric operators, and choose the reverse of an asymmetric symbol for the reverse operator. 
The benef i t is that a lot of laws become visual: we can write an expression backwards and get an 
equivalent expression. For example, x + y < z is equivalent to z > y + x . By this principle, the 
arithmetic symbols + �� < > = are well chosen but ��� and ��� are not. The boolean symbols ��� 
��� ��� ��� ��� ��� are well chosen, but ��� is not. 
Duality can be put to use, just like symmetry, if we use vertically symmetric symbols for self- 
dual operators, and vertically asymmetric symbols for non-self-dual operators with the vertical 
reverse for their duals. The laws that become visual are: to negate an expression, turn it upside 
down. For example, (��� ��� ������) ��� ��� is the negation of (��� ��� ������) ��� ��� if you allow me to use the 
vertically symmetric symbol ��� for negation, which is self-dual. There are two points that 
require attention when using this rule. One is that parentheses may need to be added to maintain 
the precedence; but if we give dual operators the same precedence, there's no problem. The 
other point is that variables cannot be fl ipped, so we negate them instead (since fl ipping is 
equivalent to negation). The well-known example is deMorgan's law: to negate a ��� b , turn it 
upside down and negate the variables to get ���a ��� ���b . By this principle, the symbols ��� ��� ��� ��� 
��� are well chosen, but ��� ��� ��� ��� ��� are not. By choosing better symbols we can let the 
symbols do some of the work of calculation, moving it to the level of visual processing.

from Booleans to Numbers 
Some boolean expressions are laws: they have value ��� no matter what values are assigned to 
the variables. Some boolean expressions are unsatisf i able: they have value ��� no matter what 
values are assigned to the variables. The remaining boolean expressions are in between, and 
���solving��� means fi nding an assignment of values for the variables for which the boolean 
expression has value ��� . (Solving is not just for equations but for any kind of boolean 
expression.) A lot of mathematics is concerned with solving. And in particular, number algebra 
has developed by the desire to solve. To caricature the development, we choose an unsatisf i able 
boolean expression and say ���What a pity that it has no solutions. Let's give it one.���. This has 
resulted in an increasing sequence of domains, from naturals to integers to rationals to reals to 
complex numbers. The boolean expression x+1 = 0 is unsatisf i able in the natural numbers, but 
we give it a solution and thereby invent the integers. Similarly we choose to give solutions to 
x��2 = 1 , x2 = 2 , x2 = ���1 , and thereby progress to larger domains. This progression is both 
historical and pedagogical. At the same time as we gain solutions, we lose laws, since the laws 
and unsatisf i able expressions are each other's negations. For example, when we gain a solution 
to x2 = 2 , we lose the law x2 ��� 2 . 
As the domain of an operator or function grows, we do not change its symbol; addition is still 
denoted + as we go from naturals to complex numbers. I will not argue whether the naturals are 
a subset of the complex numbers or just isomorphic to a subset; for me the question has no 
meaning. But I do argue that it is important to use the same notation for natural 1 and complex 
1 because they behave the same way, and for natural + and complex + because they behave 
the same way on their common domain. To be more precise, all boolean expressions over the 
naturals retain the same solutions over the complex numbers, and all laws of complex arithmetic 
that can be interpreted over the naturals are laws of natural arithmetic. The reason we must use 
the same symbols is so that we do not have to relearn all the solutions and laws as we enlarge or 
shrink the domain. And indeed, it is standard mathematical practice to use the same symbols.

The discussion on
Symmetry and Duality
in boolean algebra emphasizes the importance of selecting symbols that visually reflect the properties of the operations they represent. This choice aids in calculation and understanding by making some laws apparent through the symmetry of the symbols themselves. Symmetric operators, which have reversible operations, are suggested to use symmetric symbols, enabling expressions to be written backwards to yield equivalent expressions. This principle enhances the intuitive grasp of mathematical relationships and operations.
Duality
is introduced as a concept where operations or expressions retain their truth values when all elements are swapped with their dual counterparts (e.g., swapping ��� with ���, ��� with ���). The text proposes using vertically symmetric symbols for self-dual operators and asymmetric symbols for non-self-dual operators, allowing for visual processing to assist in the negation of expressions by simply "flipping" the symbols vertically. This approach, while conceptually appealing, highlights the necessity of consistent notation to preserve operator precedence and the need to separately handle variables within expressions due to their distinct properties from operations.
The transition
from Booleans to Numbers
outlines how mathematical domains have evolved by extending solutions to previously unsolvable boolean expressions. This progression from natural numbers through to complex numbers is framed as a response to the desire to solve unsatisfiable boolean expressions within a given domain. Each step in this evolution is characterized as inventing new solutions and thereby expanding the mathematical domain, though at the cost of negating certain laws that held in the previous domain. The section argues for the continuity of notation across domains to preserve the understanding and application of mathematical laws and operations without the need to relearn them as domains expand. This practice underscores the conceptual continuity across different mathematical domains and the practical benefits of a unified notation system for ease of learning and application.
Overall, these sections advocate for thoughtful symbol selection in mathematical notation to leverage visual symmetry and duality for intuitive understanding, while also illustrating the dynamic nature of mathematical development through the expansion of number systems to accommodate solutions to previously unsolvable problems.

For exactly the same good reasons that we have a unif i ed treatment of number algebras, we must 
now unify boolean and number algebras. The question whether boolean is a different type from 
number is no more relevant than the question whether natural and integer are different types. 
What's important is that solutions and laws are learned once, in a unif i ed system, not twice in 
conf l icting systems. And that matters both to primary school students who must struggle to learn 
what will be useful to them, and to professional mathematicians who must solve and apply laws. 
Historically, number algebra did not grow from boolean algebra; but pedagogically it can do so. 
As already argued, the use of 0 1 + �� for ��� ��� ��� ��� doesn't work. To fi nd an association 
between booleans and numbers that works for unif i cation, we must use a number system 
extended with an inf i nite number. Such a system is useful for many purposes; for example, it is 
used in [13] to prove things about the execution time of programs (some execution times are 
inf i nite). For a list of axioms of this arithmetic, please see [13] [14]. The association that works 
is as follows.

bottom���������minus inf i nity 
negation�����negation 
conjunction������minimum

With this association, all number laws employing only these operators correspond to boolean 
laws. For example, 
boolean lawnumber law

a ��� ��� ��� ���x ��� ��� = ��� 
a ��� ��� ��� ���x ��� ������ = ������ 
a ��� ��� ��� ax ��� ������ = x 
a ��� ��� ��� ax ��� ��� = x 
a ��� ���x ��� ��� 
��� ��� a������ ��� x 
a ��� (b ��� c) ��� (a���b) ��� (a���c)x ��� (y ��� z) = (x���y) ��� (x���z) 
a ��� (b ��� c) ��� (a���b) ��� (a���c)x ��� (y ��� z) = (x���y) ��� (x���z)

a ��� b ��� ��(��a ��� ��b)x ��� y = ���(���x ��� ���y) 
There are boolean laws that do not correspond to number laws, just as there are integer laws that 
are not real laws. That's another way of saying that there are unsatisf i able boolean expressions 
that correspond to satisf i able number expressions. We will use this for our unif i ed development.

The passage advocates for unifying boolean and number algebras under a single system, arguing that this unification simplifies learning and application across both educational and professional contexts. This unified approach eliminates the need to learn and apply solutions and laws within separate, potentially conflicting, systems. The text suggests that while historically number algebra did not evolve from boolean algebra, a pedagogical framework can indeed be built that bridges the two, facilitating a more integrated understanding of mathematical concepts.
To achieve this unification, the passage proposes an association between boolean operations and number operations within an extended number system that includes infinity (
���
���
���
) and negative infinity (
���
���
-���
���
���
). This system not only aligns with boolean algebra but also has practical applications, such as analyzing program execution times, including infinite execution times. The proposed associations between boolean concepts and their number algebra counterparts are as follows:
Top (���) with Infinity (���)
Bottom (���) with Negative Infinity (������)
Negation (��) with Negation (���)
Conjunction (���) with Minimum (���)
Disjunction (���) with Maximum (���)
Implication (���) with Order (���)
Equivalence (���) with Equality (=)
Exclusive Or (���) with Inequality (���)
This association makes it possible for laws in number algebra to correspond directly to boolean laws, providing concrete examples of how boolean operations translate into number operations, and vice versa. The passage lists boolean laws alongside their number law equivalents to illustrate this correspondence.
However, the text also acknowledges that not all boolean laws have direct counterparts in number algebra, similar to how some laws applicable to integers are not applicable to real numbers. This discrepancy indicates that while a unified system can encompass a wide range of mathematical principles, certain expressions and laws remain specific to their original domain. Nonetheless, the overarching goal is to leverage the unified system to simplify the learning process and application of mathematical laws across different domains, highlighting the pedagogical value of viewing boolean and number algebras through a singular, cohesive framework.

The proposal for a unified algebra system aims to harmonize the symbols and terminology used across boolean and number algebras, suggesting a comprehensive framework that encompasses both logical and numerical operations under a single, coherent scheme. This unified approach is designed to facilitate ease of learning, teaching, and application across various mathematical domains by leveraging universally recognized symbols and intuitive associations between boolean logic and numerical operations. Here's a summary of the proposed symbols in the unified algebra:
Top (���)
: Represented by infinity (���), reflecting the highest value or state.
Bottom (���)
: Represented by minus infinity (������), reflecting the lowest value or state.
Negation (���)
: Maintains its standard representation as negation in both numerical and boolean contexts.
Conjunction (���)
: Represented by the minimum operation, symbolizing the logical AND operation through the selection of the lesser of two values.
Disjunction (���)
: Represented by the maximum operation, symbolizing the logical OR operation through the selection of the greater of two values.
Nand (���)
: Described as the negation of the minimum, adding a logical NOT to the conjunction operation.
Nor (���)
: Described as the negation of the maximum, adding a logical NOT to the disjunction operation.
Implication (���)
: Illustrated by the order or "less than or equal to" symbol, reflecting the logical implication from a premise to a conclusion.
Reverse Implication (���)
: Represented by the reverse order or "greater than or equal to" symbol, denoting the logical flow from conclusion back to premise.
Strict Implication (<)
: Denoted by the strict order symbol, indicating a stricter form of implication.
Strict Reverse Implication (>)
: Denoted by the strict reverse order symbol, indicating a stricter form of reverse implication.
Equivalence (=)
: Maintains its role as indicating equality, reflecting the logical equivalence between two expressions.
Exclusive Or (���)
: Represented by a modified inequality symbol, chosen for its symmetry and resemblance to the logical XOR operation.
The decision to utilize well-known symbols like ���, ���, ���, <, >, and = is rooted in their global recognition and understanding, ensuring that the unified algebra remains accessible to a broad audience. The choice of a modified inequality symbol (���) for exclusive or aims to preserve symmetry among operators while closely associating with the XOR operation traditionally represented by ��� in boolean algebra.
This unified system emphasizes visual symmetry for symmetric operators and intentional asymmetry for asymmetric operators, enhancing the intuitive grasp of mathematical operations. While duality is sacrificed for the sake of standardization, the overall goal is to create a more intuitive and universally applicable mathematical framework that bridges the gap between boolean logic and number algebra, supporting a seamless transition between logical and numerical reasoning.

The association between booleans and numbers suggested here allows the greatest number of 
boolean laws to be generalized to all numbers. For example, if a , b , and c are boolean, then it 
is usual to def i ne if a then b else c fi by the law (in standard boolean notation): 
if a then b else c fi ��� (a ��� b) ��� (��a ��� c) 
If a remains boolean but b and c are numbers, the if-expression on the left is still sensible 
(the Algol if), and this is still a law. In the unif i ed notation it is 
if a then b else c fi = (a ��� b) ��� (���a ��� c) 
The next examples, written in boolean notation, are the laws 
(a ��� b ��� c) ��� (a ��� c) ��� (b ��� c) 
(a ��� b ��� c) ��� (a ��� c) ��� (b ��� c) 
A common error is to use conjunction twice, or disjunction twice. The boolean reading ��� a and 
b implies c if and only if a implies c or b implies c ��� sounds no more reasonable than ��� a 
and b implies c if and only if a implies c and b implies c ���. In unif i ed notation, 
(a ��� b ��� c) = (a ��� c) ��� (b ��� c) 
(a ��� b ��� c) = (a ��� c) ��� (b ��� c) 
it is obvious that the minimum of a and b is less than or equal to c when at least one of a or 
b is less than or equal to c , and the maximum of a and b is less than or equal to c when both 
a and b are less than or equal to c . They are laws for all numbers, not just the booleans. 
The arithmetic expression x���y varies directly with x and inversely with y . Thus if we 
increase x , we increase x���y , and if we decrease y we increase x���y . We calculate: 
x ��� yincrease x to x+1 and so increase the whole expression 
���(x+1) ��� ydecrease y to y���1 and so increase the whole expression 
���(x+1) ��� (y���1) 
Similarly the boolean expression x ��� y varies directly with x and inversely with y (no matter 
whether x and y are numbers and ��� is number comparison, or x and y are boolean and ��� is 
reverse implication, or x and y are a mixture of number and boolean). We calculate as follows: 
x ��� yincrease x to x+1 and so increase the whole expression 
���(x+1) ��� ydecrease y to y���1 and so increase the whole expression 
���(x+1) ��� (y���1) 
It is exactly the same calculation. By unifying number algebra with boolean algebra we carry 
our ability to calculate over from numbers to booleans.

The unified approach to algebra, which combines boolean and number algebras, allows for a seamless transition between logical and numerical reasoning. By associating boolean expressions with numerical operations, many boolean laws can be generalized to all numbers, providing a unified framework for calculation and reasoning. Let's summarize the key points:
Extension to Numbers
: Boolean laws can be extended to numbers by retaining the same logical structure and using numerical operations instead of boolean operators. For example, the if-then-else expression, a common construct in programming languages, can be expressed using minimum (���) and maximum (���) operations.
Generalization of Boolean Laws
: Boolean laws such as implications and De Morgan's laws can be generalized to all numbers. Expressions involving conjunction and disjunction can be transformed into numerical comparisons, ensuring their applicability beyond boolean values.
Symmetry in Calculation
: The unified notation ensures that calculations involving boolean expressions or numerical comparisons follow the same principles. For example, the arithmetic expression x ��� y and the boolean expression x ��� y both vary directly with x and inversely with y, demonstrating the consistency in reasoning across different domains.
Unified Development
: Starting with boolean algebra in the unified notation, solutions can be introduced to unsatisfiable expressions, leading to the creation of an algebra with three values: ���, 0, and ���. These values can represent different states or degrees, allowing for versatile applications in various contexts.
Rich Algebraic Structure
: The unified algebra encompasses a wide range of operators, including one-operand and two-operand operators, enabling complex computations and reasoning across different domains.
Overall, the unified development of algebra provides a powerful framework for mathematical reasoning, seamlessly integrating boolean logic and numerical operations to support a wide range of applications and computations.

Whether ��� or �� or another operator represents implication in the presence of uncertainty can 
be debated, but the algebra is not affected by the debate. The operator ��� is modular (or 
circular) addition, and the other operators of modular arithmetic can be given similarly. 
We might continue our development with a four-valued algebra and fi ve-valued algebra, but at 
this point I recommend fi lling in the space between ��� and 0 , and between 0 and ��� , with all 
the integers. And then we progress to the rationals, the reals, and the complex numbers as usual. 
The argument in favor of this unif i cation of boolean algebra and number algebra is just as strong 
as the argument in favor of using the same notations for the different number algebras. But the 
latter is familiar, and so it seems right, while the former is unfamiliar, and for that reason alone it 
may seem wrong. Ultimately, the benef i ts will outweigh the unfamiliarity. For example, the data 
structure known as AND-OR trees and the algorithm that uses them become the same as the data 
structure and algorithm known as minimax methods; they should not have to be learned twice. 
A different unif i cation of boolean algebra and number algebra that aims at the same goal (using 
the same calculations for booleans and numbers), but emphasizes traditional modular arithmetic 
along the way, can be found in [5], a provocative work of grand scope.

Many mathematical notations began their life as abbreviations for some words. For example, = 
was introduced in [20] to mean ���is equal to��� (see the second Appendix): 
���And to avoide the tediouse repetition of these woordes ���is equalle to��� I will sette as I doe 
often in woorke use, a paire of paralleles or Gemowe [twin] lines of one lengthe, thus: = , 
because noe 2 thynges, can be moare equalle.��� 
Later, = became associated with some algebraic properties, namely ref l exivity, symmetry, 
transitivity, and substitutivity. Today, it is def i ned by those properties, not as an abbreviation for 
some words. Someone might say that Alice and Bob are equal tennis players because they have 
played each other 10 times, and each has won 5 matches. They might similarly say that Bob and 
Carol are equal tennis players because they too have played each other 10 times, and each has 
won 5 matches. But this kind of equality is not transitive. As it happens, Alice and Carol are 
unequal tennis players: they have played each other 10 times, and Alice has won 8 matches. 
Because of the lack of transitivity, no mathematician today would use = for tennis equality.

The unification of boolean algebra and number algebra offers significant benefits, despite initial unfamiliarity. By extending boolean algebra to encompass all integers and beyond, the same calculations can be applied uniformly across different domains, leading to greater consistency and efficiency in mathematical reasoning and computation.
One potential approach involves filling the gap between the boolean values ��� and ��� with all integers, followed by progression to rationals, reals, and complex numbers. This unification streamlines concepts and algorithms, such as AND-OR trees and minimax methods, eliminating the need to learn separate techniques for boolean and numerical computations.
While this approach may seem unfamiliar at first, its benefits ultimately outweigh the initial unfamiliarity. It facilitates a seamless transition between boolean logic and arithmetic operations, enhancing the understanding and application of mathematical principles in diverse contexts.
Furthermore, the evolution of mathematical notations from informal abbreviations to formalized symbols underscores the importance of clarity and precision in mathematical communication. Symbols like "=" have evolved from mere abbreviations to represent algebraic properties, emphasizing the need for consistent and rigorous mathematical language to avoid ambiguity and ensure accurate reasoning.

In the notation commonly used for small sets, such as {1, 3, 7} , the comma was introduced as 
just punctuation, not as a mathematical operator. As soon as the notation is introduced, we must 
say that the order in which elements are written is irrelevant so that {1, 2} = {2, 1} ; the way to 
say that formally is A,B = B,A (comma is commutative). We must also say that repetitions of 
elements are irrelevant so that {3, 3} = {3} ; the way to say that formally is A,A = A (comma is 
idempotent). And we should say that comma is associative A,(B,C) = (A,B),C so that 
parentheses are unnecessary. Evidently the comma can be seen as a mathematical operator with 
algebraic properties that aggregates elements into a structure that is simpler, more primitive, than 
sets; let us call them bunches. Even the curly braces can be seen as an operator that applies to a 
bunch and makes a set; its inverse ~ applies to a set and makes a bunch: ~{1,2} = 1,2 . 
When a child fi rst learns about sets, there is often an initial hurdle: that a set with one element is 
not the same as the element. It would be easier to present a set as packaging: a package with an 
apple in it is obviously not the same as the apple. Just as {1} and 1 differ, so {1,2} and 1,2 
differ. Bunch theory tells us about aggregation; set theory tells us about packaging. The two are 
independent. 
Apart from being cute, are bunches useful? The subject of functional programming has suffered 
from an inability to express nondeterminism conveniently. To say something about a value, but 
not pin it down completely, one can express the set of possible values. Unfortunately, sets do not 
reduce properly to the deterministic case; in this context it is again a problem that a set 
containing one element is not equal to the element. What is wanted is bunches. One can always 
regard a bunch as a ���nondeterministic value���. Bunches can also be used as a ���type theory��� with 
the advantage that it is unnecessary to duplicate the operators of the value space at the type level 
because the two are unif i ed. And fi nally, the easiest way to present sets is via bunches. For 
details see [13] [14]. Formalization of the lowly comma leads to a beautiful and useful algebra. 
We have just seen two examples of formalization, one from the past and one from the future. 
Now here's an example of a formalization gone astray: functions def i ned as sets of ordered pairs. 
This way of def i ning functions is part of the interesting demonstration that all of mathematics 
can be based on sets. The demonstration requires us to make a set-model of functions, and 
numbers, and everything else. For example, the natural numbers can be equated to sets, with no 
inconsistency, as follows: 
2003-12-1from Boolean Algebra to Unif i ed Algebra13 
0 = ��� (the empty set) 
n+1 = n���{n} 
So, for example, 3 = {���, {���}, {���, {���}}} . Few people would say that 3 really is the set 
{���, {���}, {���, {���}}} ; the set-model of natural numbers was constructed by John von Neumann 
just to serve this one demonstration. Numbers are best formalized, not by building a set-model, 
but by an algebra showing how they participate in arithmetic operations. Similarly, functions are 
best formalized by showing the laws of application and function composition (in general, set 
union and intersection are not useful ways of combining functions). But the set-model of 
functions has somehow taken root in the current mathematical culture; many people (and 
textbooks) say that a function really is a set of ordered pairs. A useful formalization is not one 
that answers the question ���what is it?���, but one that answers the question ���how do we use it?���. 
I write a function, or local scope, according to the following example: 
���n: nat�� n+1��� 
This is essentially a ���lambda-expression���[6], although Church did not use angle brackets. He 
borrowed a ���hat��� notation from Whitehead and Russell, but for typesetting convenience moved 
the hat down in front; the most similar available character in the typesetter's tray was �� ; thus 
the lambda calculus was born [22]. Following van de Snepscheut [23], I use angle brackets to 
delimit the scope of the variable. Next, I want to get rid of the idea that all possible variables 
(inf i nitely many of them) already ���exist���, and that the function notation ���binds��� a variable, and 
any variable that is not bound remains ���free���. I prefer the programmer's terminology of ���local��� 
and ���nonlocal��� variables. Variables do not automatically ���exist���; they are introduced (rather 
than bound) with a limited scope by the function notation. 
Two notations that have not yet made the transition from informal beginning to formal, 
calculational tool are the quantif i ers ��� and ��� . For most mathematicians today they remain 
abbreviations for the words ���for all��� and ���there exists���, and their meaning is just whatever can be 
understood from those words. The word ���all��� sounds clear and unambiguous, but there is debate 
as to whether so-called ���undef i ned��� range elements, or other ���nonstandard��� elements, are 
included. Existence is even more contentious, as can be seen from the debate between classical 
and constructive mathematicians. Only a formal def i nition, equivalent to an automated theorem 
prover, is clear and unambiguous. Only a formal def i nition gives us calculation.

The formalization of mathematical concepts, such as the comma in set notation, can lead to deeper understanding and practical utility. While the comma was initially introduced as punctuation, its formalization as a mathematical operator with algebraic properties, giving rise to "bunches," offers a simpler and more primitive structure than sets. Bunch theory provides a framework for understanding aggregation, complementing set theory's focus on packaging.
The usefulness of bunches extends to functional programming, where they provide a convenient way to express nondeterminism and serve as a type theory without the need for duplicating operators at the value and type levels. Moreover, presenting sets via bunches simplifies the understanding of sets, especially for beginners.
However, not all formalizations are equally beneficial. The notion of functions defined as sets of ordered pairs, while historically significant in demonstrating the foundational role of sets in mathematics, may not be the most useful formalization for understanding how functions are used and composed. Similarly, the current interpretation of quantifiers ��� and ��� as abbreviations for "for all" and "there exists" lacks the clarity and precision of a formal definition that would enable automated theorem proving and calculation.
In summary, while some formalizations, like bunch theory, enhance understanding and utility, others may not accurately capture the essence of mathematical concepts or facilitate practical applications. A formal definition that enables calculation and automated reasoning is essential for clarity and unambiguous interpretation.

I'm skipping a bit: Probability 
The seminal work [4] by Boole on boolean algebra refers to both logic and probability. The 
standard theory of probability assigns 0 to an event that cannot happen, 1/2 to an event that is 
equally likely to happen or not happen, and 1 to an event that is certain to happen. In a set of 
events in which exactly one event must happen, the probabilities sum to 1 . The integral of a 
probability distribution must be 1 . 
Perhaps there is another way to develop probability theory based on unif i ed algebra. Perhaps an 
event that cannot happen has probability ��� , an event that is equally likely to happen or not 
happen has probability 0 , and an event that is certain to happen has probability ��� . In a set of 
events in which exactly one event must happen, the average probability is 0 . The integral of a 
probability distribution must be 0 . Perhaps the new probability space is related to the logarithm 
of the old space; essentially, probabilities are replaced by information content. My hope is that 
the complicated formulas for distributions in the standard theory can be simplif i ed by 
transforming the space of probabilities. 
Metalogic 
In the study of logic, at or near the beginning, logicians present the symbol ��� to represent 
theoremhood. I ask you to put yourself in the place of a beginning student. This symbol is 
applied to a boolean expression just like the boolean operators; but we know all the boolean 
operators and this isn't one of them. It sometimes has a left operand as well as a right operand, 
and then the explanation makes it seem just like implication. To say that it is a ���meta-operator��� 
just labels it, and doesn't explain it. Saying that it applies to the form, rather than the meaning, is 
2003-12-1from Boolean Algebra to Unif i ed Algebra17 
confusing too, since the entire point of the algebra is to enable us to work with the form and 
ignore the meaning. The distinction between metanotations and the object notations is not easily 
seen. 
To make things worse, there are different levels of meta-operators. Proof rules are sometimes 
presented using a horizontal line, which is yet another level of implication. Consider, for 
example, the Modus Ponens proof rule, which uses all three kinds of implication: 
A ��� x , B ��� x���y 
A, B ��� y 
Rewriting comma as conjunction, and turnstile and line as implication, we get a tautology: 
(A���x) ��� (B���(x���y)) ��� (A���B ��� y) 
Rewriting any proof rule this way gives a tautology (if ��� has nothing to its left, use ��� ). 
Rewriting any tautology whose main connective is implication gives a valid proof rule. It is hard 
to see the difference between the meta-operators and the object-level operators because there is 
no formal difference! The proof rules are used to explain how to use the boolean expressions; 
natural language is used to explain how to use the proof rules. For beginners (and others) it 
would be better to skip the meta-notations altogether and just use natural language to explain 
how to use the boolean expressions. 
At a more advanced level, when we want a formalism to study formalisms, we will need an 
operator that applies to the form of an expression. For that purpose, we do not need any new 
kind or level of operator. Rather, we need to do exactly what G��del did when he encoded 
expressions, but we can use a better encoding. We need to do exactly what programmers do: 
distinguish program from data. One person's program may be a compiler writer's data, but when 
it is data, it is a character string. The character string ���a ��� ���a��� can be used as a code for the 
expression a ���  ���a . We apply ��� to character strings so that ���s is a theorem when the boolean 
expression represented by string s is a theorem. 
We have a name, ���theorem���, for a boolean expression that can be simplif i ed to ��� , and an 
operator, ��� , whose purpose is to identify theorems. Strangely, logicians have not introduced a 
name, say ���antitheorem���, for a boolean expression that can be simplif i ed to ��� , and no operator 
such as ��� , whose purpose is to identify antitheorems. Perhaps that's because ���antitheorem��� just 
means ���negation of a theorem��� in those logics having negation and an appropriate proof rule. 
But we bother to name both booleans, even though one is just the negation of the other.

The exploration of probability theory through unified algebra presents an intriguing alternative perspective. Assigning probabilities of ���, 0, and ��� to events that are certain, equally likely, and impossible, respectively, offers a different conceptual framework. In this approach, the average probability in a set of mutually exclusive events would be 0, analogous to their sum being 1 in traditional probability theory. The notion of replacing probabilities with information content, possibly related to the logarithm of traditional probabilities, hints at a deeper connection between probability and information theory, which could simplify complex probability distributions.
In metalogic, the symbol ���, representing theoremhood, can be confusing for beginners due to its similarity to boolean operators and implications. The distinction between object-level and meta-level operators is not always clear, especially when proof rules are introduced using symbols like the horizontal line. However, by expressing proof rules and logical expressions in terms of boolean operators and natural language explanations, beginners can better understand the underlying concepts without the need for explicit meta-notations.
At a more advanced level, when studying formalisms themselves, an operator that applies to the form of an expression is necessary. Rather than introducing new kinds or levels of operators, encoding expressions as character strings, akin to G��del's encoding, provides a more practical approach. By distinguishing between programs and data, logicians can effectively identify theorems using the symbol ��� applied to character strings. However, while there is a name and operator for theorems, such as ��� and ���, respectively, there is no equivalent for expressions that simplify to ���, representing antitheorems. This discrepancy suggests a potential area for further refinement in logical formalisms.

I propose that logicians can improve metalogic by taking another lesson from programming. 
Instead of ��� and ��� , we need only one operator to serve both purposes. It is called an 
interpreter. I want s to be a theorem if and only if s represents a theorem, and an antitheorem 
if and only if s represents an antitheorem. It is related to ��� and ��� by the two implications 
���s ��� s ��� ��� ���s 
In fact, if we have def i ned ��� and ��� , those implications def i ne . But I want to replace ��� 
and ��� so I shall instead def i ne it by showing how it applies to every form of boolean 
expression. Here is the beginning of its def i nition. 
��������� = ��� 
��������� = ��� 
(��������� s) = ��� s 
(s ��������� t) = s ��� t 
(s ��������� t) = s ��� t 
And so on. For example, 
2003-12-1from Boolean Algebra to Unif i ed Algebra18 
��������� ��� ������ = ������ ��� ��� = ��� 
In a vague sense acts as the inverse of quotation marks; it ���unquotes��� its operand. That is 
what an interpreter does: it turns passive data into active program. It is a familiar fact to 
programmers that we can write an interpreter for a language in that same language, and that is 
just what I am doing here. Interpreting (unquoting) is exactly what logicians call Tarskian 
semantics. In summary, an interpreter is a better version of ��� , and strings make metalevel 
operators unnecessary. 
Using , the famous G��del incompleteness proof is just 3 lines. Suppose that every boolean 
expression is either a theorem or an antitheorem (a complete logic), and def i ne Q by 
Q = ������ Q��� 
Then Qreplace Q with its equal 
= ������ Q��� unquotes 
=��� Q 
which proves a boolean expression equal to its negation, showing the logic to be inconsistent. A 
logic in which we can def i ne an interpreter, and in which we can replace an expression with its 
equal, must be inconsistent or incomplete. We choose consistency, and we choose to allow the 
replacement of an expression with its equal, so we are forced to give up the ability to def i ne a 
complete interpreter; in particular, cannot unquote ������ Q��� . For further details of this 
version of G��del's incompleteness theorem, see [12]. 
You cannot learn a programming language by reading an interpreter for it written in that same 
language. And you cannot learn logic, or a logic, by reading an interpreter for it written in logic. 
Not only is it inscrutable to a novice, but also it may be subject to more than one interpretation. 
Logic is better presented as algebra [11]. We don't present number algebra with the aid of a 
metaoperator that applies to number expressions and results in their values, and we should not 
present boolean algebra that way. I think boolean algebra should be presented with a little 
natural language and a lot of laws, because laws don't use any metanotations.

The proposal to replace the symbols ��� and ��� with a single operator, called an interpreter, presents an intriguing approach to improving metalogic. By defining the interpreter to act as the inverse of quotation marks, effectively "unquoting" its operand, it aligns with the concept of Tarskian semantics, where passive data is transformed into active programs. This approach eliminates the need for explicit meta-level operators and demonstrates a connection to programming language concepts, where interpreters can be written in the same language they interpret.
Using this interpreter, famous results like G��del's incompleteness theorem can be succinctly expressed. For instance, the theorem's proof can be condensed into just three lines by leveraging the interpreter's capabilities. This showcases the power and simplicity of the interpreter-based approach to metalogic.
However, it's noted that learning a programming language from an interpreter written in the same language is challenging, as it may be inscrutable to novices and subject to multiple interpretations. Similarly, presenting logic primarily through algebraic laws, without relying heavily on meta-operators, may offer a more intuitive and accessible approach for learners. Thus, while the interpreter-based approach offers a valuable perspective, a balanced presentation that combines natural language explanations with algebraic laws may be most effective for teaching boolean algebra.

Terms of Honor 
My fi nal comment concerns mathematical terminology intended to honor mathematicians. In 
some parts of mathematics it is standard: Lie algebra, Stone algebra, Cartesian product, Jordan 
decomposition, Cayley transform, Hilbert space, Banach space, Hausdorff space, Borel measure, 
Lebesgue integration, Fredholm index, Wedderburn's Theorem, and so on. It is well known that 
the person so honored is sometimes the wrong person; often it is only one of many who equally 
deserve to have their names attached to the idea. I suspect that sometimes the intention is not so 
much to honor a person as to use the person's prestige to lend respectability to an idea. Even 
when the intention is to honor, the effect is to obscure and make the mathematics forbidding and 
inaccessible. It may be argued that this is good, keeping the uninitiated from thinking they 
understand when they don't, but I reject that argument as elitist. I know what nand and nor are, 
but I forget which is the Scheffer stroke and which the Peirce arrow. To say that an operator is 
symmetric or commutative is much more descriptive and understandable than calling it Abelian. 
DeMorgan's laws would be better named duality laws. We who are used to the terms forget what 
a barrier they pose to beginners.

The term ���boolean algebra��� honors George Boole. (It is popularly thought that the word 
���algebra��� honors someone, but it comes from an Arabic word meaning ���the reintegration and 
reunion of broken parts���. In any case, the word is now standard, known by people everywhere.) 
The best way to honor George Boole is to make the algebra that he created [4] a well known and 
well used tool, and to do that we might have to remove his name from it, and give it a more 
descriptive and accessible name, like ���binary algebra���.
ChatGPT

The discussion on mathematical terminology intended to honor mathematicians raises important considerations about accessibility and clarity in the field. While it's common to name mathematical concepts after prominent figures, such as Lie algebra or Hilbert space, there are concerns about accuracy, inclusivity, and understandability.
Sometimes, the intention behind naming concepts after individuals may be more about lending prestige to an idea rather than truly honoring a specific person. Moreover, this practice can sometimes obscure the underlying mathematics and make it less accessible to beginners. Terms like "Abelian" or "Scheffer stroke" may be less intuitive than descriptions like "symmetric" or "commutative."
In the case of "boolean algebra," named after George Boole, there's a suggestion to consider renaming it to something more descriptive and accessible, such as "binary algebra." This proposed change aims to honor Boole's contribution by making the algebra he created more widely known and used, potentially removing barriers for beginners in the field.
Overall, the discussion highlights the importance of critically evaluating mathematical terminology to ensure it promotes clarity, inclusivity, and understanding within the mathematical community and beyond.

Thank you for providing the illustration. It seems you've represented a surjective tesseract using two cubes, each with 8 vertices, to depict the 16 logical operators. Each vertex corresponds to a logical proposition, and the edges between vertices represent the relationships between these propositions based on the logical operators.
To understand this representation better, I would need additional information about how each vertex is labeled and how the edges between vertices correspond to logical operations.

Certainly! Our discussions have revolved around the unification of algebraic systems, particularly focusing on the integration of boolean algebra with number algebra. This unification aims to extend the applicability of boolean laws to all numbers, introducing a consistent set of symbols and terminology.
We explored how boolean expressions and laws can be generalized to encompass numbers, allowing for a seamless transition between boolean and number calculations. This unification extends to probability theory, where the concept of probability is redefined within the unified algebraic framework.
In metalogic, we discussed the challenges of representing logical expressions and the need for clearer terminology and formalisms. This led to the proposal of an interpreter operator as a replacement for traditional theoremhood and antitheorem concepts.
Additionally, we examined the use of mathematical terminology to honor mathematicians and proposed more descriptive and accessible names for algebraic concepts.
Our discussions also touched on the practical application of these concepts, such as in functional programming and the representation of logical operators using visual aids like truth tables and hasse diagrams.
Overall, our exploration has highlighted the interconnectedness of various algebraic systems and the potential for unification to simplify mathematical reasoning and enhance understanding across different domains.
