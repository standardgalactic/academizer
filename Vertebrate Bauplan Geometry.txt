We present a plausible account of the origin of the archetypal vertebrate bauplan. We offer a theoretical 
reconstruction of the geometrically regular structure of the blastula resulting from the sequential sub- 
division of the egg, followed by mechanical deformations of the blastula in subsequent stages of 
gastrulation. We suggest that the formation of the vertebrate bauplan during development, as well as 
i xation of its variants over the course of evolution, have been constrained and guided by global me- 
chanical biases. Arguably, the role of such biases in directing morphologydthough all but neglected in 
previous accounts of both development and macroevolutiondis critical to any substantive explanation 
for the origin of the archetypal vertebrate bauplan. We surmise that the blastula inherently preserves the 
underlying geometry of the cuboidal array of eight cells produced by the i rst three cleavages that ul- 
timately def i ne the medial-lateral, dorsal-ventral, and anterior-posterior axes of the future body plan. 
Through graphical depictions, we demonstrate the formation of principal structures of the vertebrate 
body via mechanical deformation of predictable geometrical patterns during gastrulation. The descrip- 
tive rigor of our model is supported through comparisons with previous characterizations of the em- 
bryonic and adult vertebrate bauplane. Though speculative, the model addresses the poignant absence in 
the literature of any plausible account of the origin of vertebrate morphology. A robust solution to the 
problem of morphogenesisdcurrently an elusive goaldwill only emerge from consideration of both top- 
down (e.g., the mechanical constraints and geometric properties considered here) and bottom-up (e.g., 
molecular and mechano-chemical) inf l uences.

The article titled
"Origin of the vertebrate body plan via mechanically biased conservation of regular geometrical patterns in the structure of the blastula"
by David B. Edelman, Mark McMenamin, Peter Sheesley, and Stuart Pivar explores a theoretical model for the origin of the vertebrate body plan, or
bauplan
.
Key Points:
Geometric Foundation:
The authors propose that the early embryonic structure called the
blastula
retains a geometric pattern derived from the initial cell divisions of the egg. Specifically, the first three cleavages produce an array of eight cells arranged in a cube, inherently defining the medial-lateral, dorsal-ventral, and anterior-posterior axes of the future organism.
Mechanical Deformation:
They suggest that during
gastrulation
���a critical phase where the blastula reorganizes into a multilayered structure���mechanical forces deform these geometric patterns predictably. This mechanical bias influences the formation of the principal structures of the vertebrate body.
Global Mechanical Biases:
The paper emphasizes that global mechanical forces have been overlooked in previous studies of development and evolution. The authors argue that these forces are crucial for both the formation of the body plan during an organism's development and the fixation of its variations over evolutionary time.
Top-Down and Bottom-Up Influences:
A comprehensive understanding of
morphogenesis
(the biological process that causes an organism to develop its shape) requires considering both top-down factors like mechanical constraints and geometric properties, and bottom-up factors such as molecular and mechano-chemical influences.
Speculative Model:
While the model is theoretical and speculative, it aims to fill a gap in the scientific literature by providing a plausible explanation for the origin of vertebrate morphology based on mechanical and geometric considerations.
Implications:
Developmental Biology:
The model could offer new insights into how physical forces shape biological forms during early development.
Evolutionary Biology:
Understanding mechanical biases might shed light on how certain body plans are conserved or altered over evolutionary timescales.
Interdisciplinary Approach:
The paper highlights the need for integrating principles from physics, geometry, and biology to fully understand complex biological processes.

���The origin of life, the evolution of increasing biological complexity, 
and the development of the embryo from a single egg cell, all seem 
miraculous at i rst sight, and all remain largely unexplained.��� 
���Paul Davies 
���The palm will be won by the one who can trace the formative 
forces of the animal body back to the general forces that direct the 
life of the universe.��� ���Karl Ernst von Baer 
1. Introduction 
1.1. Animal form: a longstanding problem 
Foremost among the unresolved problems confronting modern 
biology is the origin of biological complexity, most notably that of 
the shape and form of our own bodies. From Leonardo Da Vinci and 
Vesalius toGray���s Anatomy, anatomists have succeeded inproviding 
detailed descriptions of the musculoskeletal, organ, and nervous 
systems. Yet, the problem of the origin of these and other aspects of 
organismal form remains unresolved. Since the body develops from 
the embryo, nineteenth century anatomists reasonably sought a 
solution from the observation of early animal developmentdor 
embryogenesis. By the end of the nineteenth century, the embry- 
ological stages of nearly all major phyla had been characterized in 
excruciating detail. But no answers were forthcoming, as the form 
of the embryo seemed to emerge, in a sudden ���phase shift,��� from a 
mass of cells, giving no clue as tothe mechanism responsible for the 
organization of that form. Moreover, while there must necessarily 
be a relationship between the emergence of animal form during 
somatic development and the advent of new phyla during evolu- 
tion, the nature of this relationship is still poorly understood. For 
example, the evolutionary transition from marine tetrapods to land 
vertebrates was recently illuminated by the discovery of Tiktaalik 
roseae and other transitional forms (Shubin et al., 2006a, 2006b, 
2014). Yet, the origin of the earliest i sh remains a mystery and 
we still seek a plausible explanation for the emergence of limbs 
from i ns. Based on morphological similarities, amphioxus, the 
larval stage of tunicate, and the Cambrian Pikaia gracilens Walcott 
have each been suggested as possible precursors of early i sh, 
though the origins of these forms have not been explained (Morris 
and Caron, 2012). In another example, Darwin gave a plausible 
account of the emergence of different beak adaptations among 
Galapagos i nches (Darwin, 1859). Nevertheless, natural selection 
doesn���t provide a mechanism that would explain the advent of 
diverse beak designs, much less the overall morphology of the 
members of the tanager family known as Darwin���s i nches. On the 
Origin of Species doesn���t actually address the rise of new species. 
Rather, it confronts the question of how selection might work, once 
myriad variations have been established (Darwin,1859). Recent work 
highlighting the importance of genetic and epigenetic interactions 
in the evolution of Darwin���s i nches suggests that neither one nor 
the other should be considered to have primacy in the emergence 
of newspecies (Skinneret al., 2014). The mechanism underlyingthe 
origin of radically new forms thus remains very much an open 
question (for a comprehensive pr?ecis of the history and contem- 
porary study of the origin of vertebrateform, see Onai and Kuratani, 
2014; for a review of the problem of macroevolution, also see Vrba 
and Eldredge, 2005). 
The description of the conceptual model proposed here is fol- 
lowed by an historical account of the problem of vertebrate form 
and an outline of relevant scientif i c and philosophical consider- 
ations. The authors beg the reader to suspend skepticism that such 
a complex and longstanding problem is subject to a solution of 
relative simplicity. Though neither rigorous nor exhaustive in an 
empirical sense, our model offers an intuitive and plausible 
description of the emergence of form via simple geometrical and 
mechanical forces and constraints. The model provides a template, 
or roadmap, for further investigation, subject to conf i rmation (or 
refutation) by interested researchers.

The passage you've provided includes quotes from Paul Davies and Karl Ernst von Baer, setting the stage for a discussion on the longstanding problem of understanding the origin of animal form, particularly in vertebrates.
Key Points:
The Unresolved Problem of Biological Complexity:
The origin of complex biological forms, including the development of an embryo from a single egg cell, remains largely unexplained despite extensive research.
Anatomists have detailed descriptions of bodily systems, but the mechanisms behind the origin of these forms are still a mystery.
Historical Attempts to Understand Embryogenesis:
Nineteenth-century anatomists studied early animal development to find clues about the emergence of form.
Despite characterizing embryonic stages of major phyla, the sudden appearance of organized form from a mass of cells during development provided no clear answers.
Evolutionary Transitions and Gaps in Understanding:
Discoveries like
Tiktaalik roseae
have illuminated evolutionary transitions, such as from marine tetrapods to land vertebrates.
However, the origins of early fish and the emergence of limbs from fins remain unexplained.
Morphological similarities suggest possible precursors to early fish (e.g., amphioxus, tunicate larvae,
Pikaia gracilens
), but their origins are not fully understood.
Limitations of Natural Selection in Explaining Morphology:
While natural selection explains how certain traits are favored once variations exist, it doesn't fully account for the initial emergence of radically new forms.
The example of Darwin's finches illustrates adaptation but doesn't explain the origin of diverse beak designs or overall morphology.
Recent studies suggest that both genetic and epigenetic factors are important in species emergence, but neither alone fully explains it.
The Need for a Plausible Mechanism:
The origin of new species and radically new forms is still an open question in biology.
A comprehensive understanding requires exploring mechanisms beyond current explanations.
Introduction of the Authors' Conceptual Model:
The authors present a conceptual model proposing that simple geometrical and mechanical forces and constraints can explain the emergence of form.
They acknowledge that the model is neither rigorous nor exhaustive empirically but believe it offers an intuitive and plausible description.
They invite readers to consider their model as a template for further investigation, open to confirmation or refutation.
Implications:
Interdisciplinary Approach:
The authors emphasize the importance of integrating concepts from geometry, mechanics, and biology to address the problem of morphogenesis.
Challenge to Conventional Views:
By suggesting that mechanical and geometrical factors play a significant role, the model challenges the focus on purely genetic or molecular explanations.
Call for Open-Mindedness:
The authors ask readers to suspend skepticism regarding the simplicity of their proposed solution to such a complex problem.
Connection to Previous Content:
In the earlier abstract, the authors proposed that the vertebrate body plan originates from the geometric patterns established during early embryonic development, influenced by mechanical deformations during gastrulation. This introduction provides the context and motivation for that proposal by highlighting the historical difficulty of explaining the origin of complex biological forms and the limitations of existing theories.
Conclusion:
The authors are setting the stage for presenting their model by:
Highlighting the persistent gaps in understanding the emergence of animal form.
Critiquing the sufficiency of natural selection and genetic explanations alone.
Proposing that their geometrical and mechanical model offers a fresh perspective that could potentially fill these gaps.

1.2. Embryo geometry 
The body plans of complex organisms are predominantly radi- 
ally or bilaterally symmetric. Animals with radial symmetry have 
vase-like bodies. Animals with bilateral symmetry comprise 
segmented tubes with anterior heads, dorsal eyes, and pairs of 
jointed and pointed limbs. All complex organisms initially develop 
from an egg that cleaves alternately along the three spatial axes, 
yielding eight cells arranged as the corners of a cuboid form. 
Further divisions create the blastula, a ball of hundreds of cells of 
fairly regular geometry derived from the earlier cuboid form

Summary of Section 1.2: Embryo Geometry
In this section, the authors delve into the role of geometric patterns and mechanical forces in the development of complex animal body plans, emphasizing the significance of
embryo geometry
in morphogenesis.
Key Points:
Symmetry in Animal Body Plans:
Radial Symmetry:
Organisms like jellyfish exhibit vase-like bodies where body parts radiate from a central point.
Bilateral Symmetry:
Most animals, including vertebrates, display a segmented, tube-like structure with mirror-image left and right sides, featuring anterior heads, dorsal eyes, and paired limbs.
Early Embryonic Cleavage and Cuboid Formation:
All complex organisms begin as a single egg that divides along the three spatial axes (x, y, z).
The first three cleavages produce eight cells positioned at the corners of a cube���a
cuboid form
.
This initial arrangement establishes the foundational axes (anterior-posterior, dorsal-ventral, medial-lateral) of the future organism.
Formation of the Blastula:
Continued cell divisions transform the cuboid into a
blastula
, a spherical structure comprising hundreds of cells.
The blastula maintains a regular geometry derived from the earlier cuboid form.
The authors liken the blastula to an Earth-like sphere, with cell populations in north-south and east-west hemispheres floating like continents over the fluid-filled
blastocoel
.
Mechanical Deformation and Evolutionary Drift:
The model speculates that, akin to tectonic plates drifting over geological time, cell populations within the blastula have shifted over evolutionary eons.
These movements lead to perturbations and deformations of the original geometric arrangements, contributing to the diversity of animal forms.
The major body plans (
baupl��ne
) could have plausibly emerged from these cleavage patterns influenced by mechanical forces.
Embryo Geometry as a Predictive Model:
Embryo geometry
refers to the predictions about animal morphology arising from global geometric constraints and mechanical forces.
The model suggests that morphogenesis is driven by mechanically induced topological shifts constrained by physical properties like size and shape.
These global processes act in conjunction with local mechano-chemical and cellular mechanisms during early development.
Scope and Acknowledgment of Limitations:
While the authors recognize the importance of integrating top-down (global geometric and mechanical processes) with bottom-up (molecular and cellular dynamics) approaches, they focus on the former in this paper.
They acknowledge that a comprehensive understanding of the emergence of animal form requires synthesizing both perspectives but do not attempt this synthesis here.
Implications:
Mechanical Forces in Development:
The emphasis on mechanical deformation underscores the role of physical forces, alongside genetic factors, in shaping embryonic development.
Geometric Constraints and Evolution:
The initial geometric arrangement of cells sets a foundational blueprint that influences the organism's development and evolutionary potential.
Over evolutionary timescales, shifts in these geometric patterns could lead to the emergence of new body plans and morphological diversity.
Predictive Power of Embryo Geometry:
By understanding the geometric and mechanical principles at play, scientists may better predict and explain the morphology of various animal forms.
Connection to Previous Sections:
This section builds upon the introduction by providing a conceptual framework to address the longstanding problem of the origin of animal form.
It extends the discussion of the limitations of solely genetic or natural selection explanations by introducing a model that incorporates physical principles.
Conclusion:
The authors present a speculative yet plausible model that highlights the significance of geometric and mechanical factors in embryonic development and evolution.
They encourage further research to explore how these global processes interact with molecular and cellular dynamics, aiming for a holistic understanding of morphogenesis.
This model serves as a foundation for re-examining the emergence of complex biological forms through the lens of geometry and mechanics.
Further Discussion:
If you're interested in exploring this topic further, consider examining:
Comparative Embryology:
How do different organisms' embryonic developments compare, and what can this tell us about the universality of geometric constraints?
Mechanobiology:
The study of how physical forces and changes in the mechanical properties of cells and tissues influence development, physiology, and disease.
Mathematical Modeling:
Developing mathematical models to simulate the mechanical and geometric aspects of embryogenesis as proposed by the authors.
Questions for Consideration:
How might integrating molecular biology with embryo geometry enhance our understanding of development?
What experimental approaches could be used to test the predictions made by the embryo geometry model?
In what ways could this model influence future research in developmental biology and evolutionary biology?

2. The model 
The initial events as predicted by this model suggest the 
emergence of either radial or bilateral morphologies as the blastula 
membrane involutes during gastrulation, either symmetrically or 
asymmetrically descending along the inside surface of the blastula 
sphere, eventually reaching the bottom of the early embryonic 
form. In symmetrical gastrulation, the separate segments of cell 
layers meet at the opposite interior pole, where they join to project 
upward and outward through the blastopore as tentacles (or, in the 
case of plants, a cylindrical shoot that opens in circlets of leaves or 
l owers) (Fig. 2). In asymmetrical gastrulation, one of the longitu- 
dinal hemispheresdthe future dorsal side of the bodydenters the 
blastopore by a kind of subduction, clinging to the inner surface of 
the vitelline membrane, but also remaining attached to the ventral 
hemisphere that is drawn along concurrently. The curvature of the 
dorsal hemisphere is reversed as it is laminated upon the ventral 
hemisphere in a conf i guration that establishes the early basis of the 
vertebrate bauplan. The details of this process are graphically 
depicted in Figs. 3e5. 
2.1. Formation of the blastula 
The i rst three cleavages of the fertilized egg, through alter- 
nating, orthogonal axes of space within the conf i nes of the spher- 
ical vitelline membrane, generate eight cells arranged in a cube-like 
formation. Subsequent cleavages yield the blastula, comprising 
hundreds of cells conf i ned within the vitelline membrane as a 
hollow ball with a wall one cell thick that encases a l uid-f i lled core 
called the blastocoel. The model hypothesizes that the cells of the 
blastula retain the geometrically cuboidal axial subdivision of the 
three initial subdivisions, with later subdivisions generating the 
familiar left-right, anterior-posterior, and dorsal-ventral organiza- 
tion of the bilateral body (Fig. 1aef). Further segmentation creates 
subdivisions that, upon deformation during gastrulation and, later, 
organogenesis, result in the organs of the archetypal vertebrate 
body (Figs. 6 and 7). 
2.2. Gastrulation 
Gastrulation is characterized by a phase in which massive cell 
proliferation induces the ball of cells of the blastula to begin 
collapsing inward at its lower pole to form a two-layered, vase- 
shaped form. This form is preserved in radial animals (Fig. 1). 
Gastrulationdduring which an embryo forms its innermost, 
middle, and outermost layersdoccurs early in the development of 
all complex animals (Stern, 2004) and has, over the course of 
evolution, been elaborated in a variety of ways ref l ected in the 
appearance of later stages of development. At present, though, it is 
not possible to account for either the intermediate stages between 
gastrulation and later stages or their functional relevance. 
The proposed model suggests that the involution of cells during 
gastrulation, resulting from the expansion of the blastocoel and 
consequent cell crowding, causes collectives of cells enclosed 
within the subdivisions to be drawn inward toward a point of polar 
involution. This results in the compression of zones of cells in the 
lower hemisphere of the blastocoel and the expansion of zones of 
cells in its upper hemisphere. Zones of cells in the lower hemi- 
sphere are eventually compressed to such an extent that they form 
girdles that are pinched off proximally, but remain attached 
dorsally. It is surmised that these are the precursors of i ns and 
limbs, while the large zones of cells in the upper hemisphere are 
the precursors of the skull. In this view, the gridded inner layer of 
the gastrula is the precursor of the pharynx (Fig.1hei). The present 
model proposes that the modern form of the gastrula is simply an 
elaboration of the ancestral vertebrate gastrula, modif i ed over the 
course of evolution by the presence of an impenetrable yolk within 
the egg that causes involuting collectives of blastula cells to 
penetrate the narrow conf i ned space between the outer vitelline 
membrane and the membrane of blastocoel in a process reminis- 
cent of geological subduction. This sort of ���subductive gastrulation��� 
is an observable feature of insect, frog, and i sh embryogenesis. An 
exampledthe mechanical events precipitating the emergence of 
the frog bauplandis shown in Fig. 4.

Summary of Section 2: The Model
This section outlines a conceptual model for embryonic development, focusing on how early embryonic events lead to the formation of animal body plans through radial or bilateral symmetries during gastrulation. The model proposes mechanisms by which these morphologies arise and how they evolve into complex organismal structures.
Key Points:
Mechanics of Gastrulation:
Symmetrical Gastrulation:
In this scenario, cell layers descend symmetrically inside the blastula, meeting at the interior opposite pole to form structures like tentacles in animals or cylindrical shoots in plants.
Asymmetrical Gastrulation:
Here, one hemisphere (future dorsal side) undergoes a kind of subduction, wrapping around and eventually laminating upon the ventral hemisphere. This action sets the foundational layout for the vertebrate body plan.
Formation of the Blastula:
The initial cleavage of the fertilized egg happens along three orthogonal axes, producing eight cells in a cuboidal formation. This geometric arrangement is crucial as it sets the axes for later body organization (left-right, anterior-posterior, dorsal-ventral).
As the blastula forms, it becomes a hollow sphere with a single cell-thick wall surrounding a fluid-filled core, the blastocoel, yet retains the geometric properties from the earlier cuboid shape.
Elaboration of Gastrulation:
During gastrulation, the blastula undergoes significant changes. A mass cell proliferation at the lower pole causes the sphere to collapse inward, forming a two-layered, vase-shaped structure.
This structure is preserved in radial animals but elaborates differently in other organisms through further stages of development, leading to the formation of various organs and structures in vertebrates.
Subductive Gastrulation:
The model introduces the concept of "subductive gastrulation," comparing it to geological subduction, where cell collectives move into confined spaces, akin to tectonic plates shifting.
This process is observable in the embryogenesis of insects, frogs, and fish, contributing to the unique developmental patterns seen in these organisms.
Implications of the Model:
Biological Symmetry:
The model provides insights into how radial and bilateral symmetries develop through mechanical and geometrical constraints, explaining the diversity of body plans in the animal kingdom.
Evolutionary Adaptations:
The gradual changes and adaptations in the gastrulation process across different species suggest an evolutionary mechanism influenced by both internal (cellular) and external (environmental) factors.
Connection to Previous Content:
This section deepens the discussion started in the introduction and the overview of embryo geometry by detailing the dynamic processes during gastrulation that contribute to the formation of complex animal forms.
Further Discussion and Considerations:
Experimental Validation:
How can these proposed mechanisms be experimentally validated in modern developmental biology research?
Comparative Development:
What comparisons can be drawn between the gastrulation processes of different species that might support or challenge this model?
Evolutionary Biology:
How does this model align with or challenge existing theories on the evolution of body plans, particularly the transitions observed in the fossil record?
Conclusion:
The authors present a speculative yet grounded model that integrates mechanical and geometric concepts to explain the embryogenesis of complex organisms. By proposing specific mechanisms like symmetrical and asymmetrical gastrulation and introducing the idea of subductive gastrulation, they offer a fresh perspective on how animal forms might originate and diversify.

4. Conservation of complex form during development 
The mechanism by which an extended sequence of cell divisions 
produces essentially a reproduction of the complex body at each 
developmental iteration is a central problem confronting the model 
proposed here. While a solution to this problem is beyond the 
scope of the present paper, four processes may provide possible 
clues, and thus warrant further investigation: 
1. Hertwig���s Rule: During mitosis, a given cell divides along its 
equator, leaving two cells compressed within an outer mem- 
brane with axes orthogonal to (or 90-degrees from) the parent. 
Hence, the resulting alternation of the axes of subdivision 
sequentially through the three spatial axes generates the initial 
eight cells that establish the lateral, dorsal-ventral, and anterior- 
posterior of the body. 
2. Tissue Polarity: The mechanism of tissue polarity, or planar cell 
polarity, has recently been identif i ed. It was determined that 
certain ���polarity genes��� orient cells by providing them with a 
���sense of position��� with respect to a specif i c developing organ or 
entire organism (Adler, 2002; Adler and Nathans, 2016). 
3. Gene regulation and expression: Historically, the regulation and 
expression of genes have been characterized as the means by 
which animal form is specif i ed. More likely, though, the timed 
regulation of gene expression and coordinated activity of entire 
gene circuits are important in specifying cycles of cell division, 
differentiation, movement, and death (see Edelman,1988,1992, 
2004), thereby providing overall constraints on the size and 
local morphological attributes (i.e., digit and other skeletal 
element numbers and shapes) of an otherwise relatively i xed 
phenotypic form. 
4. Signaling pathways: Around two dozen major families of 
signaling pathways have been identif i ed in animals, most of 
them devoted to development, morphogenesis, and embryo- 
genesis (Gilbert, 2013; Marijuan, 2013). Of these, perhaps the 
most relevant to the early phase of vertebrate development 
described here are the Wnt, Hedgehog, Notch, and transforming 
growth factor (or TGF) pathways (Gerhart, 1999). 
5. Evolution of animal form 
5.1. Origin of radial and bilateral bauplane 
The premise that, early in development, the membrane of the 
gastrula may migratedor ���drift���dwith respect to the blastocoel 
that it encloses, suggests that a series of mechanical events, 
informed and constrained by geometric principles, could plausibly 
account for the origin of bilateral animal morphology. That is, the 
bilateral body plan is likely the consequence of displacement of cell 
populations within the apex of an initial radial blastula conf i gura- 
tion to a new position along a meridian during gastrulation. Me- 
chanical instability induced by an increase in the number of 
dividing cells and elongation of the polar axis of the forming gas- 
trula is suggested here as a possible cause of the displacementdor 
migrationdof apical cell populations. Such a migration event could, 
for example, reasonably account for the anteriorly directed dispo- 
sition of the distal segments of arthropod limbs (Fig. 22). 
The premise that complex animal form arises from mechanical 
forces acting on geometrically constrained populations of dividing 
cells in the early embryo provides a new lens through which to 
view the processes of development and evolution, and perhaps a 
signif i cant challenge to the dictumdpropounded by the Modern 
Synthesisdthat evolution proceeds by selection of adventitious 
mutations resulting from errors in DNA transcription. 
6. Discussion 
The origin of animal form remains one of greatest mysteries in 
biology. Since the 19th century, biologists seeking to understand 
the origin and evolution of life have observed and attempted to 
describe the embryology of all multicellular animal phyla. This task 
was assumed by many to be more or less complete by the turn of 
the 20th century. Indeed, Balfour published a massive compen- 
dium, A Treatise on Comparative Embryology (Balfour, 1880), 
describing the detailed embryology of most of the dozens of 
different phyla known at the time. Here, Balfour characterizes the 
state of late 19th century embryology:

Needless to say, the prodigious efforts of 19th and 20th century 
embryologists did not produce a coherent view of emergent animal 
morphology, either during development or over the course of 
evolution. The origin of complex biological form has thus remained 
a confounding enigma. 
Modern developmental biology therefore remains very much a 
descriptive science, save for the details of certain molecular 
signaling pathways that def i ne cell differentiation events, mor- 
phoregulatory i elds of expression, and the inf l uence of cell and 
substrate adhesion molecules on the fate of individual cells and cell 
populations (Edelman, 1988, 1992, 2004; Gilbert, 2013; Mariju?an 
et al., 2015). Developmental biologists have not yet been able to 
provide a robust explanation for the trajectory or order of observed 
steps leading tothe myriad known animal forms. The appearance of 
an embryo from a small mass of cells offers no clue as to its origin 
(see Fink, 1991). The embryo differentiates into the organs of the 
body, exhibiting no discernable directive logic. This paper relates a

account for the origin of both embryonic and adult forms, as well as

The critical process of organogenesis, during which the verte- 
brate embryo appears froma small collective of cellsdthe innercell 
massdhas never been observed or described by embryologists due 
to the loss, over eons of evolution, of the initial ancestral steps that 
led to the appearance of the embryo (but see Mammoto and Inber, 2010 for a discussion of the role of mechanical inf l uences in 
organogenesis). This premise is consistent with the idea that the

Summary of Sections 4, 5, and 6
Section 4: Conservation of Complex Form During Development
The authors address the challenge of how complex body forms are consistently reproduced through successive cell divisions during development. While a complete solution is beyond the scope of their paper, they propose four processes that may contribute to this conservation of form:
Hertwig's Rule
: This principle states that during mitosis, cells divide along their longest axis. In the early embryo, successive divisions occur along alternating orthogonal axes, leading to the formation of eight cells arranged in a cube. This establishes the foundational axes���lateral, dorsal-ventral, and anterior-posterior���of the organism.
Tissue Polarity
: Also known as planar cell polarity, this mechanism involves 'polarity genes' that provide cells with spatial orientation within a tissue or organ. These genes help cells understand their position relative to specific structures or the entire organism, guiding proper tissue and organ formation.
Gene Regulation and Expression
: The timing and coordination of gene expression play crucial roles in development. Rather than specifying form directly, gene regulation controls cycles of cell division, differentiation, movement, and apoptosis (cell death). This coordinated activity influences the size and local morphological features (e.g., the number and shape of digits or skeletal elements) within a relatively fixed phenotypic framework.
Signaling Pathways
: Multiple signaling pathways are involved in development, morphogenesis, and embryogenesis. The authors highlight the Wnt, Hedgehog, Notch, and Transforming Growth Factor (TGF) pathways as particularly relevant to early vertebrate development. These pathways regulate cellular behaviors essential for forming complex structures.
Section 5: Evolution of Animal Form
5.1 Origin of Radial and Bilateral Body Plans
The authors propose that mechanical forces and geometric principles during early development can explain the emergence of both radial and bilateral body plans (baupl��ne). Specifically:
Radial Symmetry
: The initial blastula has a radial configuration. Mechanical events during gastrulation can preserve this symmetry, leading to organisms with radial body plans.
Bilateral Symmetry
: Displacement or migration of cell populations within the apex of the blastula during gastrulation can shift the organism from radial to bilateral symmetry. Mechanical instabilities, such as increased cell divisions and elongation of the gastrula's polar axis, may cause apical cell populations to migrate along a meridian. This migration could account for the development of bilateral features, such as the anterior positioning of limbs in arthropods.
By emphasizing the role of mechanical forces acting on geometrically constrained cell populations, the authors challenge the traditional view that evolution primarily proceeds through natural selection acting on random genetic mutations (the Modern Synthesis). They suggest that physical and mechanical factors significantly contribute to shaping organismal form during development and evolution.
Section 6: Discussion
The origin of animal form remains one of the greatest mysteries in biology. Despite extensive embryological studies since the 19th century, scientists have yet to produce a coherent explanation for how complex body structures arise during development and evolution. The authors cite Balfour's 1880 work, which acknowledges the challenges in interpreting the embryological record due to its imperfections and complexities.
Modern developmental biology is rich in descriptive details and molecular insights, such as the identification of signaling pathways and cell differentiation events. However, it still lacks a comprehensive explanation for the emergence of diverse animal morphologies. The development of an embryo from a small mass of cells does not readily reveal the mechanisms guiding its form, and there appears to be no discernible directive logic in how organs differentiate.
The authors present their model as a hypothetical mechanical reconstruction of a missing embryological sequence between the gastrula stage and the appearance of the embryo. This model suggests that mechanical deformation of the blastula during gastrulation can account for the origin of both embryonic and adult forms, as well as their morphological trajectories during individual development and over the course of evolution.
6.1 A Growing Sphere Within a Fixed Sphere: Mechanical Constraints and Animal Morphology
Building on the early 20th-century work of Oparin, who demonstrated that lipid molecules can form expanding concentric spherical membranes without genetic specification, the authors argue that similar physical principles apply to embryonic development. They note:
Mechanical Constraints
: An expanding, flexible, inelastic spherical cellular membrane (the developing embryo) within a fixed sphere (the extraembryonic membrane) will undergo predictable topological changes due to mechanical constraints.
Cytoskeletal Response
: Cells possess cytoskeletal components and mechanosensing pathways that respond to physical forces. As the inner sphere grows, these components enable cells to adapt to the force fields imposed by the enclosing membrane.
The inevitable sequence of mechanical events resulting from this "sphere-within-a-sphere" topology aligns with observed vertebrate embryonic forms across different developmental stages and species (phylogeny). This perspective suggests that mechanical and geometric factors play a crucial role in shaping the development and evolution of animal morphology.
Conclusion
The authors propose a model that integrates mechanical forces and geometric constraints as fundamental drivers in the conservation and evolution of complex animal forms. By focusing on physical processes like cell division orientations, tissue polarity, gene regulation, and signaling pathways, they offer a new lens through which to view development and evolution.
This model challenges the traditional emphasis on genetic mutations and natural selection by highlighting how predictable mechanical deformations during early embryonic stages can lead to the diverse body plans observed in nature. The authors suggest that a comprehensive understanding of morphogenesis requires considering both top-down (mechanical and geometric) and bottom-up (molecular and cellular) influences.
Implications
Developmental Biology
: The model underscores the importance of mechanical forces and geometric constraints in shaping embryonic development, potentially leading to new research avenues.
Evolutionary Biology
: By proposing that mechanical factors contribute to the emergence of new body plans, the model invites reevaluation of evolutionary mechanisms beyond genetic mutations.
Interdisciplinary Approach
: The integration of physics, geometry, and biology may provide a more holistic understanding of complex biological processes.

Dijiste:
The foregoing, we suggest, provides: 1) a plausible description 
of the mechanical events in gastrulation that induce a variety of 
animal bauplane during development and over the course of evo- 
lution; and 2) a potential road map for future experimental work. 
The proposed mechanical description could conceivably be vali- 
dated through a variety of means, including observation of specif i c 
tissue trajectories using molecular markers to label specif i c cells in 
each of the three dermal layers of the gastrula. A research program 
informed by this model may thus illuminate one of the enduring 
mysteries of modern biology: namely, the origin of complex 
vertebrate form. 
Thispaperprovidesahypotheticaldandlargelygraph- 
icaldreconstruction of the mechanically driven events that both 
yield individual vertebrate form during embryogenesis and ulti- 
mately guided the emergence of multifarious animal bauplane over 
the course of evolution. It reveals a different view of life than that 
which has prevailed since the Modern Evolutionary Synthesis 
nearly 70 years ago: namely that all major animal bauplane are 
shaped by mechanical forces and organized via certain non- 
random biases, rather than solely through selection of purely
and local cellular and molecular events, that have given rise to the 
rich profusion of complex animal morphologies on Earth. 
Like a number of other scientif i c paradigms based on natural 
and physical historical data, the foregoing description of vertebrate 
morphogenesis (and the developmental history of the individual 
and evolutionary historyof vertebratephyla onwhich it bears) does 
not readily lend itself to empirical test. Nevertheless, such theo- 
retical frameworks have previously been accepted as robust sci- 
entif i c enterprises by virtue of copious corroborative (and even 
predictive) examples. Notable instances include evolutionary the- 
ory (e.g., descent with modif i cation) and the related sciences of 
paleontology and geology, much of 20th century physics following 
Einstein (e.g., the Bohr model of atomic structure and the principles 
of quantum mechanics enumerated by Heisenberg and others), 
modern cosmology (e.g., the big bang theory), anddperhaps most 
far af i eldd archaeology (e.g., the founding of processual archae- 
ology as a modern scientif i cdalbeit highly theoreticaldenterprise 
[see Binford, 2001], among others). 
Assessment of the plausibility of the foregoing descriptive 
model must certainly be based on both qualitative and quantitative 
evidence of its predictive power. There is no opportunity for com- 
parisonwith other models, as there are currently no othercausative 
global mechanical models of morphogenesis extant in the modern 
literature. The causal account that the model provides for the 
development of complex vertebrate morphology is necessarily 
presented by a speculative series of schematic images representing 
sequences of key mechanical events during embryogenesis, akin to 
aseriesofblueprints.Thevastdandlargelynon-pictor- 
ialdliterature on this subject does not offer a global mechanism to 
explain the rise of diverse forms of animal phyla. Though highly 
speculative, the model offered here may suggest just such a 
mechanism. The homologous morphological resemblance among 
the phyla may, in fact, be due as much to the inevitable topological 
trajectory of the conf i ned expansion of a primordial spherical 
membrane as it is to common ancestry. Accordingly, the choices 
available to natural selection may be limited to the possible varia- 
tions in proportions of the body parts of otherwise relatively con- 
servative and invariant phyletic forms, rather than simply provided 
by random genetic mutations resulting from errors in transcription. 
Animal form may thus be seen as the product of physical forcesdor 
biasesdacting upon cells and populations of cells with veryspecif i c 
and constrained geometric properties, rather than arising solely 
from the vagaries of chance.

Summary of the Conclusion and Final Thoughts
The authors conclude their paper by emphasizing two main contributions of their model:
Plausible Description of Mechanical Events in Gastrulation:
The model offers a detailed explanation of how mechanical forces during gastrulation can induce a variety of animal body plans (
baupl��ne
) both in individual development and throughout evolution.
It provides a new perspective on the origin of complex vertebrate forms by focusing on mechanical and geometric factors.
Roadmap for Future Experimental Work:
The authors suggest that their model can guide future research aimed at validating the proposed mechanisms.
Experimental validation could involve tracking specific tissue movements using molecular markers to label cells in each of the three germ layers (ectoderm, mesoderm, endoderm) during gastrulation.
Such research may shed light on one of modern biology's enduring mysteries: the origin of complex vertebrate morphology.
A New Perspective Challenging Traditional Views
The paper presents a
hypothetical and largely graphical reconstruction
of the mechanically driven events that shape vertebrate forms during embryogenesis and have guided the evolution of diverse animal body plans.
This model challenges the prevailing view from the Modern Evolutionary Synthesis by proposing that:
Major animal body plans are shaped by
mechanical forces and organized through non-random biases
.
Development and evolution are not solely the result of natural selection acting on random genetic mutations and local cellular events.
The authors argue that mechanical constraints and geometric properties play a significant role in morphogenesis, offering a different lens through which to view life's complexity.
Comparisons with Other Scientific Paradigms
The authors acknowledge that their model, like other scientific theories based on historical and natural data, may not be easily testable through direct empirical means.
They draw parallels with established scientific frameworks that, despite initial challenges in empirical testing, have gained acceptance due to substantial corroborative and predictive evidence. Examples include:
Evolutionary Theory:
Concepts like descent with modification.
Physics:
The Bohr model of the atom and principles of quantum mechanics.
Cosmology:
The Big Bang theory.
Archaeology:
The development of processual archaeology as a theoretical discipline.
By situating their model within this context, the authors suggest that it holds scientific merit based on its explanatory and predictive potential.
Assessment of the Model's Plausibility
The authors emphasize that evaluating their model's plausibility should involve both qualitative and quantitative analyses of its predictive capabilities.
Uniqueness of the Model:
Currently, there are no other causative global mechanical models of morphogenesis in the modern scientific literature.
This lack of alternative models highlights the novelty of their approach.
Speculative Nature and Presentation:
The model is presented through a speculative series of schematic images depicting key mechanical events during embryogenesis, akin to blueprints.
Despite its speculative nature, it aims to fill a gap in understanding the rise of diverse animal forms.
Homologous Morphological Resemblance:
The authors propose that similarities among different animal phyla may result as much from the inevitable topological changes during the expansion of a primordial spherical membrane as from common ancestry.
This suggests that physical forces and geometric constraints could limit the variations available to natural selection.
Role of Natural Selection:
The model implies that natural selection may operate within a narrower scope, fine-tuning proportions of body parts rather than generating entirely new forms through random mutations alone.
Animal forms may thus be shaped significantly by physical forces acting on cells with specific geometric properties, introducing a deterministic element to development and evolution.
Conclusion
The authors advocate for a shift in perspective regarding the origins of complex animal morphologies.
By emphasizing mechanical forces and geometric constraints, they offer a potential mechanism that complements traditional genetic and molecular explanations.
The model encourages interdisciplinary research that integrates physics, geometry, and biology to deepen our understanding of morphogenesis.
While acknowledging the speculative nature of their proposal, the authors believe it opens avenues for future research and experimental validation.
Ultimately, they suggest that animal form arises not solely from chance and genetic mutations but also from predictable physical processes influencing cell behavior during early development.
Implications for Future Research
Experimental Validation:
Future studies could use advanced imaging and molecular labeling techniques to observe and quantify the mechanical events and cell movements predicted by the model.
Interdisciplinary Collaboration:
Combining insights from developmental biology, physics, and mathematics may lead to a more comprehensive understanding of morphogenesis.
Reevaluation of Evolutionary Mechanisms:
The model invites scientists to reconsider the relative contributions of mechanical forces and genetic factors in shaping the diversity of life.
Educational Impact:
Integrating this perspective into biology curricula could foster a more holistic view of development and evolution among students and researchers.
Final Thoughts
The authors present a thought-provoking model that challenges conventional wisdom and highlights the potential significance of mechanical and geometric factors in development and evolution. By proposing that physical forces play a crucial role in shaping animal morphology, they offer a fresh framework that could inspire new research directions and deepen our understanding of life's complexity.
