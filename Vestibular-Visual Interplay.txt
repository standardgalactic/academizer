Vestibular-Visual Interplay
Model: GPT-4
Reading  this, you may believe that you are invincible, and that this effect will not happen to you, but if your visual and vestibular systems are working as they should, you will fall (figuratively and possibly literally) victim to this phenomenon.\n\n\nhttp://www.vortextunnel.com\n\n \n\n\nhttps://cdn8.bigcommerce.com/s-du14j3c/images/stencil/824\u00d7431/uploaded_images/post-concussion-syndrome-dizziness-and-vertigo.jpg?t=1522529700\n\nWhat\u2019s going on?\nWhy do our bodies respond by feeling dizzy and off-balance? In order to understand the illusion, the vestibular system needs to be acknowledged. This \u201csixth sense\u201d is responsible for clear vision when we move, maintaining balance, spatial orientation, and autonomic reflexes such as maintaining blood flow (Wolfe, 2017). Without this system, just like the other senses, things would feel unnatural. The vestibular organs responsible for creating this illusion, the semicircular canals, are found in the inner ear.\n\n\nhttps://www.slideshare.net/CsillaEgri/the-vestibular-system\n\nThe tunnel illusion causes our body to react to a sensory conflict between the vestibular and visual system. Conflict between the two senses causes rotation vection which is an \u201cillusory sense of self-motion caused by moving visual cues when one is not, in fact, actually moving\u201d (Wolfe, 2017). Have you ever sat at a stoplight, completely still, yet felt as if you were rolling backwards when the person next to you was rolling forward? This is a common example of vection, and the same effect occurs with the tunnel illusion. Some individuals may fall down due to the illusion since the visual stimuli fills our entire field, and is moving clockwise. Our brain believes our body is leaning left. As our brain perceives our body leaning left, our brain tells us to lean right so we don\u2019t fall over. Ironically, this compensation actually causes more loss of balance. When we compartmentalize the vestibular sense from the visual sense, everything makes complete sense to our brains. It knows that we are standing still when we look at it just from the vestibular view. But when put together with the visual sense, it plays a mean trick on us, resulting in these effects.\n\nCommon Sensations\nSince vision is so important to balance, the reason we feel as if we are moving is because our brains believe it is more likely we would be moving, rather than the scenery around us. Think about it, is it more likely when staring at a rock, and we detect movement, that it is the rock moving, or because we are moving? This \u201cshortcut\u201d is used in the tunnel illusion because that is what is common in most scenarios. Our sensations integrated together can, and does, alter the way we perceive the world around us. Our brains are incredibly intelligent, but just like so called \u201csmart\u201d phones can have glitches, so can our brains when something contradicts what it is expected to do.\n\nReferences\nHow does our sense of balance work?

The text provided is discussing the interplay between our visual and vestibular systems, and how these interactions can result in visual illusions and sensations of movement when there is none, a phenomenon known as vection.
The vestibular system, found in our inner ear, is responsible for our sense of balance, spatial orientation, and coordination of movements. It works closely with our visual system to perceive and interpret our movements and position in space. However, when these two systems receive conflicting signals, it can lead to a range of sensations and illusions.
For example, the "tunnel illusion" mentioned in the text refers to a phenomenon where one feels a sensation of self-movement or rotation while looking at a moving image or pattern, even though they're actually still. This illusion occurs because the visual stimuli (e.g., a tunnel of lights spinning in a clockwise direction) trick the brain into believing that the body is moving or rotating in the opposite direction. To maintain balance, the brain responds by leaning or moving in the direction of the perceived movement, which in reality can lead to a loss of balance.
The example of feeling as if you're moving backwards when a car next to you at a stoplight moves forward is another illustration of vection. Your visual system perceives the movement of the other car, and your brain misinterprets it as your own movement in the opposite direction.
Overall, these phenomena underscore the importance of the interplay between our senses in creating our perception of the world, and how sensory conflicts can lead to intriguing and sometimes disorienting experiences.
