And one of the great things about having a fully dynamic game engine is all of this just works
In real time and then you run wires that connect them all and again, it just works
I I read on the internet that our games have had a few bugs
And that sometimes it doesn't just work
Over the last decade there seems to have been a rise in triple-a games that have a massive amount of hype and then release to
widespread disappointment and anger from the gaming community
Now it's really clear and easy to point out why these games are such a disappointment
They're usually unfinished and broken products
But these games are everywhere you can find a broken or unfinished game just by sorting new on PlayStation or Steam
so what makes the difference between a game that nobody plays and a game that is such a massive disappointment it makes the news I
Mean it would be easy to just say that it's gamers doing the hype and that would be partially true
I
Remember two years ago seeing an upvoted post on the cyberpunk subreddit suggesting that you could have budding
Relationships with any NPC in the game
Romantically as in you could flirt with them and be successful or unsuccessful have a one-night stand have a relationship with a random
NPC it is not a developers responsibility to build you a robot girlfriend
But even though I would love nothing more to just point and say guys, it's gamers. Thanks. That's the video I
Can't because it's not really their fault the real culprit for these massive massive disappointments is marketing
So, yeah, we have to talk about cyberpunk if we're talking about bad marketing and video games
You can't have a major actor play a rebel rocker boy and not expect me to talk about it
This man revived his career from the ashes like a Phoenix and John Wick and now he's a rebel rocker boy
But Eddie Johnny Silverhand is a very good character with a lot of depth. That's fine. That's okay
But you can't call him a rebel rocker boy and expect me to take that seriously. I'm sorry
So marketing when you're pitching a game to a customer
Yes, you're selling the actual fun systems of the game, but you're also selling an experience
You can't just say the game is fun and people will buy it
You have to sell them on the world on the characters on the narrative
Which is an impossible task if the video game isn't even done when you advertise it
The problem is that's how every game is marketed and with an RPG a role-playing game
You're also selling another reality an experience where you can choose whatever you want to do and
Hopefully the game will carry you along with your imagination
Play it in first person. You can play it in third person. You can walk away whenever you want
Shoot him in the face if you want
So not only is the game not done, but you have to show somebody an
Unfinished reality and let their mind just explore the possibilities of what they could do there
But you haven't like even made chairs yet
And you don't know when you're supposed to make chairs because like making the game is a high priority in all the characters and making
Sure, there's no bugs, but it would be weird if there's no chairs. So when do you make the chairs?
I'm genuinely asking any developer. When do you make the chairs in games? Is that like last but CD Projekt Red pulled it off in the
Witcher 3 it's regarded as one of the greatest RPGs of all time and it delivered on its promises the problem is once you make an RPG a
Modern or future first-person shooter you are now required to make like ten games in one
It's very different than the Witcher 3
Especially when you add driving because now you need almost every single thing that GTA 5 had and GTA 5 is one of the most
Popular and definitive games of all time. You need advanced driving systems Roach in the Witcher 3 can't go 120 miles per
hour or have his rims changed
You need a wanted system a large detailed open world that you can interact with at every corner on top of those systems
So other than being everything GTA is it needs to be an in-depth RPG. We're talking about CD Projekt Red here
That's what's expected of them choices need to matter in the game and change the world and your relationships with characters
You need intelligent NPCs to interact with you
So you feel like you're not talking to a bunch of dummies you need player choices that reflect every type of game play someone who
Wants to play a hero or a villain or a thief or a driver or a rebel rocker boy
You need in-depth dialogue with different dialogue choices that will affect everything and with the current games industry today a game with all
Of that is next to impossible on top of that
It was delayed into a gap of a console generation
So it was required to release on five different versions PC. Oh, so you're a PC gamer
Stop with you Xbox one whatever the fucking Xbox names are I'm not gonna try and remember and list them one s x
What at ps4 and ps5 and PC that's it
So nobody could have met these expectations for the current developer space that we see it's why GTA isn't a role-playing game
It's why we don't see Naughty Dog doing open world and their narrative stories
So do we cut CD Projekt Red some slack because we know nobody could have made this game
No, of course not. They marketed the game. This is so beyond their fault that it's hilarious
Cyberpunk's marketing was some of the most smug shit that we have ever seen online
Welcome to the next generation of open-world adventure
We've greatly enhanced our crowd and community system to create the most believable city in an open-world game

Cyberpunk's biggest problem isn't what didn't make it into the game
It was their marketing that built a false relationship of honesty with their customers
And then when their customers trusted them they promised them the world CD Projekt Red's marketing was the marketing
Embodiment of I'm not like other girls. They shit on other developers
They hyped themselves up and they spit on the idea of releasing an unfinished game while they were simultaneously
Freaking out in the office because the game wasn't even close to done in other words
They lied they lied to everyone and we all know that now, but it's not a unique problem to CD Projekt Red
It's the way video games are marketed that leads developers down this path
I think the very obvious company to point to that does this as well is Bethesda
The first lie Bethesda ever told me when I was paying attention is one of the funniest things that's happened in video game marketing
Todd Howard was making a promotional video for Skyrim on YouTube and he said this
So we're interested in all the little details like this plant here
The medium details of these logs and trees and all the way up to distant mountains
And if you've played our previous stuff, you know that mountain is not just a backdrop
You can walk all the way to the top of that mountain now
There are mountains across Skyrim they border the entire map and there are some smaller mountains in the game
But Todd pointed to the one main mountain in the game
That was super important to the story that was the fleshed-out mountain and was like hmm
I don't know twist my arm here if I had to point but maybe that mountain you could go to I don't know
It's off the top of my head and it was the main part of the map and he was just fucking pretending like he picked a random point
Luckily for Todd Skyrim was a good game
Yeah, people know that was a lie
But he kind of got to escape gamer jail for another year unlike CD project red and we all know Todd is the king of this shit
He told the media that Fallout 3 had two hundred different endings
Being that we are Bethesda
Everything gets a bit big so as of last week were over two hundred endings
That is not an exaggeration who even wants two hundred different endings to a game
They wouldn't be good in satisfying narratives if that were the case like think of your favorite movie and now think of someone coming up with
200 different endings to that movie when destiny was announced they showed a bunch of sweeping beautiful
Landscapes that looked like they were ready to explore the game came out and those were just background
Skyboxes that you couldn't go to and weren't part of the map anthem
We're not even gonna touch anthem most triple-a games are marketed this way
We're promised an experience that privately is not developed into a full game yet
But the developers do their best to match that experience being marketed the difference between a well marketed game and a poor one is the
Game's ability to match the experience being sold God of War wasn't even close to done when they showed it at E3
You know
But scary thing was like we showed 10 minutes and 45 seconds or something and it took a year and a half to get there
And now we have a year and a half left essentially and we have like 30 hours to make
And you're kind of scratching your head like how's that humanly possible?
What we saw at E3 is all that they had but they somehow pulled off making a game that exceeded what we were sold at E3
So what's the difference between God of War and cyberpunk and marketing?
They're still unfinished and being advertised
But the thing is God of War showed us a hundred percent
Gameplay the working game that they had that they were gonna build the rest of the game off of they didn't promise us a bunch of other stuff
I mean, I guess they showed a dragon far away, but they showed us this is what we have
So expect this and we're gonna make more so hopefully you like it
That is nowhere near what cyberpunk did Santa Monica studios didn't suck themselves off on Twitter
They didn't really say anything other than just showing us what they had and then not talking and then giving us the game
They didn't make a shit ton of promises. They didn't make fake gameplay with those promises
They just showed us the game they made more of the game and then they released it
So one thing I think we all know is almost all of the blame usually falls on the publisher and not the developer a lot of
Times the publisher is advertising the game poorly while the developers are maybe busting their ass on a broken game privately
So if you make a game and you promise something that isn't ready or maybe not even possible
Your game is not ready to be announced or at least it's not ready to be talked about in-depth to the press
Maybe you can put a teaser out, but don't talk about it like it is already done
I don't want to see a single reddit AMA until the game systems are ready
The problem with say CD project red with cyberpunk and Bethesda with I don't know all their games is that they publish their own games
They have full control over what they say and do yes
There's investor pressure, but that does not justify gassing yourself up for years and then lying to people
So I think it's very bizarre that some of the biggest disappointments in gaming lately are ones that are published by the developers
They're making all the choices themselves
So a final note making games is really hard and really expensive and if we keep marketing them this way
This is gonna keep happening there needs to be a fundamental change in video game marketing
And it needs to be more about honesty and showing what you actually have and if you don't shut up and don't show the game until it's ready
You
