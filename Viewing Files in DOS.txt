To view the contents of a file like
README.txt
in DOS, especially if it's a long file that doesn't fit on one screen, you can use the
MORE
command. This command displays the content page by page, allowing you to read through the file at your own pace. Here's how you do it:
Open the DOS command prompt.
Type the following command and press Enter:

Copy code
TYPE

README.txt
. You can press the spacebar to move to the next page or use the Enter key to move down one line at a time. When you're done reading, you can exit the
MORE
command by pressing
