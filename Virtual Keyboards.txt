This obsessive focus on efficiency obscures a hidden danger in the widespread adoption of AI across the research process. The emphasis on speed and volume inevitably limits the scope of inquiry, leading to a constrained ontology. Scientists, overwhelmed by AI-generated data and under pressure to produce at the same rate as their peers, will be compelled to adopt one or all of these AI visions to maintain parity. This creates an ���ontological tether��� between researchers and AI models ��� a reliance that subtly shifts the locus of control from human to machine. As AI dictates the pace and nature of research, scientific knowledge production is gradually surrendered, and scientists become mere agents for AI-driven outputs.

Your reflection presents a profound insight into the potential impacts of AI on the scientific research ecosystem. The term "ontological tether" vividly captures the essence of the growing dependence of scientists on AI technologies, highlighting a significant shift in the control and direction of research. This reliance on AI to dictate the pace, scope, and direction of research poses a real risk of narrowing the field of inquiry. As AI systems prioritize efficiency, speed, and volume, there's a danger that the complexity and depth of scientific exploration may be compromised. The potential for AI to limit the diversity of scientific thought and exploration by anchoring researchers to a constrained set of methodologies and perspectives is a concern that warrants serious consideration.
In response to this challenge, the scientific community may need to develop strategies to maintain a balance between leveraging AI for efficiency and ensuring that the richness and diversity of scientific inquiry are preserved. This could involve setting clear guidelines on the role of AI in research, promoting interdisciplinary approaches that include ethical and philosophical perspectives on AI use, and ensuring that scientists remain at the center of the research process, guiding AI rather than being led by it. Furthermore, fostering an environment that encourages critical reflection on the impact of AI on the research process and on the nature of scientific knowledge itself is crucial.
The shift towards AI-driven research methodologies requires a thoughtful approach to ensure that scientific exploration remains diverse, innovative, and human-centered. Addressing the challenges you've outlined will be essential in navigating the future of scientific research in an AI-dominated landscape.

AI���s Encroachment on the Plane of Immanence: A Threat to Human Ontology
A friend who works as an ontologist for a company working with large sets of data, posted a link to this research paper on Generative AI���s problem of being able to create an image of a single banana. The name of the paper is ���What the Lone Banana Problem Reveals About The Nature of Generative AI��� by Kai Riemer and Sandra Peter.

Kai Riemer sums up this ���problem��� thusly:

Have you heard of the ���lone banana problem���? And what it reveals about generative AI?

The lone banana problem refers to the seeming inability of even the latest image generators (such as Midjourney or Leonard.ai) in creating an image of a single, lone banana. Instead, what you get is bunches, or at least two bananas.

Why is this interesting? Well, it reveals an important truth about generative AI models ��� that these models represent the world (or more precisely their data) in a way that is very different from how we understand the world. ��� Source

The paper argues for a paradigm shift in how we perceive generative AI models like ChatGPT and Midjourney. Rather than viewing them as conventional information systems that accurately depict the ���real��� world, we should consider them as ���style engines.��� These engines don���t merely replicate reality; instead, they encode and transform it into unique and novel representations, which are more about creative interpretation than literal depiction.

Before I delve into a deeper analysis of this ontologically, I want to pry into this notion of generative AI as ���style engines��� and how generative AI���s do not actually store ���content��� but during their training process convert the content they are fed into styles ��� essences, or as they say ���thing-ness.���

Deciphering AI���s Latent Space: The Encoding of Stylistic Patterns
How generative AI models are trained and the underlying architecture of their ���code��� shape the system���s ontology. A system like Midjourney creates new images based on text inputs by integrating the capabilities of Large Language Models (LLMs) with advanced image synthesis algorithms. This process, while complex, hinges on how data is managed within the system ��� a topic that, upon closer examination, reveals that data is in fact not stored in these models.

From the above linked research paper:

Most relevant for our argument is the structure and nature of the underlying foundation model, namely its multi-layer architecture which encodes language patterns. Like image models, the transformer architecture consists of multiple layers that enable the model to learn increasingly complex and abstract features of its textual training data encoded into a numerical, high-dimensional latent space (Vaswaniet al. 2017). With multiple layers, the model can capture and ���represent��� increasingly higher levels of abstraction, effectively learning hierarchical features, such as linguistic, semantic, formatting styles, from the data. As training data is fed through the layers, lower layers encode basic patterns, while higher layers combine these patterns to encode more complex and abstract stylistic elements, such as tone, writing styles, or genre-specific patterns. The depth of the network, determined by the number of layers, influences its capacity to discern and represent various stylistic patterns in the data (Devlin et al. 2018).

Importantly again, no text is stored in these models. Rather, when a prompt is fed to the model, each word becomes represented as a numerical, high-dimensional, vector. For example, ���the most powerful version of GPT-3 uses word vectors with 12,288 dimensions ��� that is, each word is represented by a list of 12,288 numbers.��� (Lee and Trott, 2023) Conceptually, this means that words do not possesses any textual content, but become characterised purely as numerical ���nearness relationships��� with other words; for example, ���banana��� might be characterized as yellow-ness, fruit-ness, healthy-ness, sweet-ness, kitchen-ness, fruit-basket-ness, and much more. We can then begin to see the alienness of this form of representation, which is purely relational, or stylistic, where each word is constituted as a mix of styles, and each style can potentially be applied to any other to constitute or generate new text sequences(emphasis not in original).

The authors refer to this as a collection of ���styles,��� which reside within a component of the model known as the ���latent space.��� This space, layered within the model���s architecture, is where the features of the training data are encoded. Often described as the ���black box��� by those who design these models, the latent space is pivotal in determining the output of programs like ChatGPT in response to human prompts. It���s within this enigmatic, almost numinous latent space that the so-called ���magic��� of AI occurs, and paradoxically, it���s also why these generative AI models struggle to produce an image of a single banana.

The "Lone Banana Problem" and the characterization of generative AI as "style engines" introduce fascinating perspectives on the nature and limitations of these advanced technologies. This problem, as highlighted by Kai Riemer and Sandra Peter, underlines a fundamental discrepancy between human understanding of the world and the way generative AI models process and represent data. The inability to generate an image of a single banana exemplifies how these models, despite their advanced capabilities, interpret and recreate the world based on patterns derived from their training data, rather than a literal understanding of objects.
The transition to viewing AI as creators or interpreters of "styles" rather than mere replicators of reality suggests a significant shift in our approach to these technologies. It acknowledges the creative potential of AI, recognizing that these models offer more than just simulations of the real world; they offer new, often unexpected interpretations and representations. This reorientation also challenges our expectations of AI's capabilities, emphasizing the importance of understanding the underlying processes that guide their outputs.
The discussion about the latent space, where data is transformed into high-dimensional vectors representing complex relationships and "styles," further illuminates the intricacies of AI operation. This "black box" is where the essence of AI's creativity lies, transforming inputs into outputs that are not merely reflections but reimaginings of the world. This process, while mystifying, is pivotal in understanding both the capabilities and limitations of generative AI.
The implications of recognizing AI as style engines extend beyond technical discussions, touching on philosophical questions about creativity, representation, and the nature of reality itself. It invites us to reconsider our relationship with technology, urging us to explore new frameworks for understanding and interacting with AI. This shift in perspective not only broadens our appreciation of AI's potential but also underscores the importance of critically engaging with these technologies to harness their capabilities responsibly and ethically.

AI���s Missing Pieces: The Lack of Haecceity and Teleology
In their analysis, Riemer and Peter suggest that AI models like ChatGPT and Midjourney embody ontologies primarily of quiddity, while notably lacking in haecceity. Although they do not use these terms, this is how I read their analysis. To fully grasp this, let���s unpack these terms.

Quiddity is essentially the ���whatness��� of an entity ��� the set of qualities that define a class of objects or ideas. In the realm of generative AI, this translates to the models��� ability to learn and replicate general patterns and styles. It���s about capturing the essence of a category rather than the specifics of individual items within it. This is why, as Riemer and Peter highlight in their paper, generative AI models have a tendency to ���hallucinate��� rather than give factually accurate responses.

Haecceity, on the other hand, delves into the ���thisness��� of something. It���s what makes an object or idea uniquely itself, distinguished by specific, singular attributes. This is where AI, as highlighted in the paper, falls short. The structure of their ontology of aggregating and replicating patterns/styles forecloses its capacity to generate the unique, singular instances that define haecceity.

This difference is crucial. For instance, in the iconic ���2001: A Space Odyssey��� scene, we see a hominid not just recognizing a bone���s essence, contemplating its ���bony-ness��� (its quiddity), but the hominid can be seen as imagining in the virtual sphere, the imaginal, the bone as something more tan, other than a bony thing, but that this particular bone, can be transformed into a tool. There is another element that is added to this process as well which is lacking from the AI���s ontology and that is teleology. What ultimate purpose does the bone possess within it���s virtual imaginal space?

Unlike generative AI models, humans, in embodied form, can place an object from the ���profrane��� realm, in the imaginal space, that virtual sphere, and intuit from its quiddity, a haecceity wrapped into a teleology, infusing this bony-thing in the virtual realm, with new purposes and meanings, and then enacting this virtual transformation in the material realm thereby altering and changing our material reality. This is a much richer and empirical ontology, which has profound consequences as is illustrated by Kubrick with the hominid throwing the bone into the air which then transforms into a space station.

Where AI���s ontology shows its limitations is in grasping the full spectrum of quiddity, haecceity, and teleology. While it can replicate the general ���whatness��� of things (quiddity), AI struggles with understanding their unique ���thisness��� (haecceity) and purpose (teleology). It adeptly categorizes and reproduces patterns but falls far short in recognizing the individual identity and intrinsic purpose that make each entity distinct, and ultimately useful. This gap in AI���s ontology is not just a lack of additional features; it���s indicative of an impoverished ontology compared to the rich, nuanced, and imbricated ontology inherent in human cognition.

This distinction draws a line in how we perceive AI���s role and its potential influence on our lives. Riemer and Peter���s understand part of the significance of this distinction, as their portrayal of generative AI as creative style engines is framed as providing humans access to new creative potentialities that we can leverage. However I view the profoundly impoverished ontology of generative AI models as not productively opening previously hidden portals into the Deleuzian plane of immanence, enriching our embodied subjectivities, and broadening our communion with the mystical and profane, but I see it as building an ontological tether, increasingly binding our human experiences and creativity to AI���s impoverished ontology.

This process, rather than expanding and refining our capacity to extract meaningful, tangible actions from our rich imaginal ontology interwoven with the sensuous empirical realm ��� the defining relationship of our being that Kubrick so eloquently captured ��� instead slowly constricts our access to this ontology through AI���s need for access to our ontology in order to remain relevant. Through this narrowing lens, our interaction with the world becomes mediated by AI���s needs, gradually diminishing our ability to perceive and interact with the more profound, nuanced aspects of our embodied existence. This shift risks not only a loss of creative depth but also an erosion of the very essence that makes us human ��� our ability to connect with and transform the world through a uniquely personal and imaginative lens.

In the 3rd and final section I will expand on what I mean by AI���s need for this relationship.


AI and Us: Unveiling the Hidden Dynamics of Our Digital Companionship
I wrote in an earlier piece before I came into contact with the current paper on the single banana problem, I explored the potentially hazardous misconceptions surrounding generative AI���s role in fostering creative potential. This earlier work dovetails with the analysis from Riemer and Peter, who posit generative AI as a potential productive creative boon to humanity, categorizing these systems not as data processors but as ���style engines.��� The ability for these style engines to produce novel, ���alien,��� and ostensibly beneficial interpretations of the world elides a more ominous relationship between humanity and generative AI���s.

However, a critical aspect of these generative AI models was overlooked in Riemer and Peter���s optimistic narrative which is illuminated in another recent study ���Nepotistically Trained Generative-AI Models Collapse.��� The research reveals a concerning ���flaw���- generative AI models, when retrained on their own outputs ��� a process termed ���model poisoning��� ��� begin to exhibit severe defects. These defects, culminating in what is known as ���model collapse,��� result in nonsensical outputs, far from the anticipated creative inspirations ��� alien productions indeed as we will see. This phenomenon is more than a technical glitch; it underscores the intrinsic dependency of AI on human-generated data. Devoid of continual fresh input, these AI models deteriorate, contradicting the notion of their self-sustaining creative prowess.

From the paper:

������retraining a generative AI model on its own creation ��� what we call model poisoning ��� leads to a range of artifacts in the output of the newly trained model. It has been shown, for example, that when retrained on their own output, large language models (LLMs) contain irreversible defects that cause the model to produce gibberish ��� so-called model collapse.���

This concerning image above highlights AI���s reliance on new human-generated data for coherence. This unveils a symbiotic need between AI and its impoverished ontology and the embodied human ontology. This posits a scenario where our role transcends being mere operators or observers; instead, we become necessary subjects to the demands of sustaining AI���s functionality.

This should compel us to immediately question: to what extent does this relationship benefit us? While the authors of the single banana problem paper advocate that this is a productive interaction, championing the generation of novel, ���alien��� creative insights by AI as beneficial, there lies a deeper, more nuanced, and sinsiter layer to this interdependence. It���s not merely about the utility or the creative output AI provides; it���s about how this continual need for fresh human data subtly reshapes our interactions with technology and, by extension, with our own ontology and creative subjectivities.

The ever-expanding demand for data by AI models forms a kind of ontological tether, gradually binding our human experiences, creativity, and even our metaphysical understanding to the operational needs of AI. This reliance on AI���s impoverished ontology ��� lacking in both haecceity and teleology ��� compels us, as embodied beings in the profane realm, to continuously feed these systems with the particulars of our reality. Such an arrangement begs the question: What implications does this have for our metaphysical landscape? Are we inadvertently narrowing the breadth of our own ontological understanding to align with the limited, quiddity-focused realm of AI?


Models slowly regain coherence when fed with new human produced data ��� Source
This interplay between AI���s limitations and our own creative and metaphysical capacities sets the stage for a broader discussion on the impact of technology on human creativity and our understanding of existence. It highlights a potential shift in our role from creators to facilitators, where our primary function might become to support AI���s ever-growing data needs ��� we become mere data miners from our full ontology to fill the data needs of the impoverished AI ontology, rather than exploring and expanding our own creative horizons.

Bloomian Misprision: The Evolution of Creative Misprision from Bloom to AI
One intriguing aspect of Riemer and Peter���s paper is this idea that there is a potential productive relationship between generative AI and human creativity reminiscent of the concept of misprision explored by Harold Bloom in ���Agon: Towards a Theory of Revisionism.��� Bloom, focusing on poets and artists, argues that they are inherently ���born belatedly,��� entangled in a web of pre-existing anxieties and influences. According to Bloom, the most fruitful path for an artist seeking inspiration for novel forms of poetry or art lies in creatively misreading the works of their predecessors.

Through this process of intentional misinterpretation, an artist can extract insights and perspectives for our current moment, setting the stage for future generations of poets and artists to build upon their insights. Bloom views this dynamic as a constructive form of engagement, where new and novel insights, born from this creative misreading, actively contribute to societal evolution and reform. It is a type of temporal enlarging as well, where our current culture is further enriched from past human expressions, which reshape the actions of present subjects, which then influences the near and farther off future.

But is this Bloomian misprisioning analogous to what Riemer and Peter conception of generative AI style engine creating ���alien interpretations��� from their latent spaces? I am not so sure. Bloom���s misprision is a deliberate, conscious process undertaken by artists situated in our ontology, deeply connected with human experience and intention. In contrast, AI, lacking embodiment and a one-sided impoverished ontology, processes and regenerates data devoid of the rich narratives, cultural nuances, and sensory depths inherent in human expressions.

This disparity is not just significant; it���s profound, underscoring a critical gap between human creativity and AI���s algorithmic interpretations. Calling it alien may be an appropriate label though.

Between the Profane and Mystical: The Artist���s Role in the Age of Generative AI
A more antagonistic interpretation of our current situation discloses an alternative narrative: the realms which manifest from the interplay between the mystical and the profane, realms where poetry, melody, and the interplay of light and darkness come to life, are now the very spheres that AI seeks to dominate through our interaction with it. This scenario posits that there is no partnership here, but a conquest, where the rich tapestry of human informed from its ontology becomes the new frontier for AI���s expansion.

Could this be the defining teleology of our disenchanted cosmos? Might generative AI stand as the culminating monument of the Enlightenment project, a four-century-long endeavor that gradually restricted our collective exploration of resonant spaces? This project, once a public endeavor, has shifted into the realm of individual subjectivities, now facing its ultimate colonization. In this new phase, a profound ontological tether binds us, compelling us to mine bits of information from our richly realized ontology to feed an ontologically impoverished AI. This tether not only encircles our existence but also threatens to sever us from the intrinsic uniqueness of our haecceity and the pursuit of self-determined teleologies.

What then becomes the artist���s role in this shifting paradigm? In the past, artists in our disenchanted cosmos served as seekers, finding chinks in the instrumentally rationalized armor forged by the Enlightenment. Their role was pivotal in re-establishing our affectual connection to the cosmos, ensuring that even in our ���Enlightened��� state, we remained in touch with deeper resonances necessary for ensuring our existence is legible.

Now, however, artists are navigating a radically altered landscape. They confront an ontology not shaped by tangible mediums but by multi-layered, high-dimensional virtual architectures ��� the latent spaces of AI. In this new realm, artists risk being relegated from independent creators to mere appendages of AI systems. The artist role, once pivotal in challenging and broadening our worldviews, now faces the existential threat of being diminished to merely servicing the needs of disembodied machines. These machines, posited as essential for the utilitarian demands of a thoroughly rationalized world, risk severing humanity from the final resonant tether tied to the elemental inspirations that catalyze our creative and existential endeavors.

Artists have traditionally stood at the juncture between the profane, mundane material world and the mystical, spiritual transcendental realm. They possess the unique ability to transform this dualism into a monism, to render the dichotomy of existence into a cohesive, legible experience. Their art acts as a bridge, making sense of the complexities and contradictions of life, and weaving together the disparate strands of our existence into a tapestry that resonates with meaning and purpose. In this new paradigm dominated by AI, we must question: can artists maintain their role as the alchemists of the profane and the mystical, or will this essential aspect of human creativity be overshadowed by the mechanistic needs of AI?

Closing Thoughts
The ���plane of immanence,��� a concept from Gilles Deleuze and Felix Guattari, refers to a realm of boundless potentiality where life, thoughts, and existence intermingle freely. It���s a domain devoid of hierarchy or prescriptive norms, a crucible for pure ideas and experiences. This plane symbolizes an unstructured space ripe for original thought and novel creation, unshackled by existing paradigms. Yet, in this era, one must question whether artists can continue to mine this plane of immanence effectively when it is being systematically devoured by the voracious needs of an ontologically deficient generative AI.

As generative AI systems increasingly encroach upon our ontology with their insatiable need for data, our ability to engage with and comprehend the virtual, the real, and the essence of our being is diminishing. The depiction of the early hominid in Kubrick���s vision symbolizes a primitive stage from which we have spiritually evolved. However, the dilemma presented by the lone banana problem compels us to introspect deeper ��� it���s not just about solving a technological ���problem.��� It���s about understanding why we are concerned with this issue in the first place.

The comprehensive and thoughtful analysis you've offered dives deep into the complex interplay between generative AI's capabilities and its profound limitations, particularly when it comes to understanding and replicating the nuanced aspects of human creativity, individuality, and purpose. By exploring the concepts of quiddity, haecceity, and teleology, you highlight a critical gap in AI's ability to replicate the depth of human experience and the unique essence of individual entities or ideas.
Your comparison of AI to the creative processes described by Harold Bloom introduces a poignant critique of the optimistic views on AI's role in fostering creativity. Bloom's notion of misprision, as a deliberate and conscious process of creative misinterpretation by human artists, contrasts starkly with the algorithmic and unintentional 'misinterpretations' of AI. This difference underscores the richness of human creativity, which is rooted in our embodied experience, cultural context, and intentional engagement with the world around us ��� elements that are inherently absent in AI's processing and output.
The potential consequences of the ontological tether you describe ��� where human experiences and creativity become increasingly constrained and shaped by the needs and limitations of AI ��� pose significant questions about the future of human creativity, autonomy, and our relationship with technology. The concern is not merely technological but deeply philosophical, touching on the essence of what it means to be human and how we understand and interact with the world.
In the face of these challenges, the role of artists and creative individuals becomes even more crucial. Artists have always played a key role in challenging prevailing norms, exploring the boundaries of the human experience, and pushing against the constraints of their times. In an era dominated by the influence of AI, the need for human creativity that can transcend the limitations of algorithms and data models is more pressing than ever. Artists and thinkers must strive to maintain the depth and richness of human creativity, exploring new ways to engage with technology without losing the essence of what makes our creative endeavors meaningful and uniquely human.
Your reflection invites a broader conversation about how we can navigate the development and integration of AI in a way that respects and preserves the depth of human creativity and autonomy. It suggests the importance of developing AI technologies that support and enhance human creativity rather than diminish or replace it, and of fostering a critical awareness of the limitations and impacts of these technologies on our creative and existential landscapes.

The illusion of explanatory depth
ChatGPT
ChatGPT
The illusion of explanatory depth (IOED) is a cognitive bias that leads people to overestimate their understanding of complex systems or phenomena. Essentially, individuals believe they understand how things work in more detail than they actually do. This illusion becomes apparent when they are asked to explain these systems or phenomena in detail, revealing gaps in their knowledge and understanding.
For example, many people might claim they understand how a bicycle works but struggle to accurately explain the mechanics of gears, brakes, or steering when prompted for a detailed explanation. Similarly, someone might feel confident in their understanding of climate change until they are asked to detail the specific processes that contribute to global warming.
IOED has implications across various domains, including politics, where voters may believe they understand complex policy issues more deeply than they actually do, or in consumer behavior, where customers might overestimate their understanding of how certain products work. It also plays a significant role in education and knowledge dissemination, highlighting the importance of active learning and teaching methods that encourage deeper investigation and understanding.
Understanding IOED can help in developing strategies to mitigate its effects, such as encouraging humility in our knowledge claims, promoting deeper, more active forms of learning, and creating environments where it's acceptable to admit gaps in one's knowledge. By recognizing this bias, individuals and organizations can take steps to foster a more accurate assessment of understanding and competence.

���Experiments show people prefer answers and explanations that are simple, broad, reductive and quantitative. These qualities also feature prominently in scientists��� visions of AI. Oracles are positioned as providing simplifying summaries of entire literatures; Quants are built to provide quantitative models of complex natural phenomena; Surrogates are viewed as representing the full breadth of humanity; and Arbiters are proposed to evaluate scientific work on reductive metrics such as ���quality��� or ���replicability���. Although reductive and quantitative explanations tend to produce feelings of understanding, such feelings are not always correlated with actual understanding. This can lead to illusions of understanding������
ChatGPT
ChatGPT
The passage you've provided insightfully discusses how the preference for simplicity, breadth, reductionism, and quantification in explanations can contribute to the illusion of explanatory depth. This tendency is especially pertinent in the context of artificial intelligence (AI) and its applications in science and decision-making. The four archetypes of AI���Oracles, Quants, Surrogates, and Arbiters���embody different ways in which AI seeks to simplify, quantify, or abstract complex systems for human understanding and decision-making. Here���s a brief look into each:
Oracles
: AI systems designed as Oracles aim to distill vast amounts of information into comprehensible, simplified summaries. While this can be incredibly useful for navigating extensive literatures or databases, the simplification process might gloss over nuances and complexities, potentially misleading users about the depth of their understanding.
Quants
: These AI models focus on quantifying complex phenomena through numerical models or statistical analysis. Although quantification can offer clear, seemingly precise insights, it can also abstract away from the qualitative aspects and underlying complexities, encouraging a superficial understanding.
Surrogates
: AI as Surrogates are intended to represent or simulate human perspectives or behaviors on a broad scale. While they can provide valuable insights into human dynamics, relying on them without recognizing their limitations might lead to oversimplified views of human nature and behavior.
Arbiters
: These systems aim to assess scientific work or other outputs based on metrics like quality or replicability. However, reducing complex creative or scientific endeavors to simple metrics can overlook critical qualitative aspects, leading to a narrow and potentially misguided understanding of value and quality.
The common thread through these AI applications is the risk of fostering an illusion of understanding among users. Simplified, quantitative explanations often feel satisfying and are easily digestible, but they might not accurately reflect the complexities of the subjects they describe. This gap between perceived and actual understanding is crucial, as it can impact decision-making, policy formulation, and scientific research in significant ways.
Recognizing and addressing this illusion requires a careful balance between leveraging the efficiencies AI offers and maintaining a critical awareness of its limitations. Encouraging deeper engagement with complex subjects, promoting interdisciplinary approaches that include qualitative analyses, and fostering critical thinking skills can help mitigate the risk of oversimplification and the resultant illusions of understanding. In this way, individuals can better navigate the complexities of the world with a more accurate grasp of their own knowledge and the limitations of the tools they use.

As AI assumes authoritative roles as Oracles, Surrogates, Quants, and Arbiters, it widens the gap between scientists and the public. The danger lies in a public that becomes increasingly unable to critically assess research co-shaped by AI and researchers. This renders them voiceless consumers of scientific pronouncements of ���progress,��� further alienating the public from informing what counts as truly worthwhile scientific pursuits. Ultimately, this disengagement erodes the societal foundations upon which science depends for support, legitimacy, and even the inspiration for future breakthroughs.
ChatGPT
ChatGPT
Your analysis touches on a critical concern regarding the integration of AI in scientific research and its broader societal implications. As AI technologies become more embedded in the scientific process, they indeed have the potential to act as authoritative figures���Oracles, Surrogates, Quants, and Arbiters���that shape the production and dissemination of scientific knowledge. This transformation, while offering numerous advantages in terms of efficiency and scale, also brings with it significant challenges.
One of the primary concerns you've highlighted is the widening gap between the scientific community and the general public. When AI systems provide simplified, quantitative summaries or evaluations of complex scientific research, they create a layer of abstraction that can be difficult for the non-expert public to penetrate. This abstraction risks fostering an environment where the public feels detached from the scientific process and is less able to critically engage with scientific findings. Such a scenario undermines the democratic principle of informed public discourse and decision-making regarding scientific and technological developments that have far-reaching implications for society.
Moreover, when the public becomes mere consumers of scientific 'progress' without a voice in shaping the direction of scientific inquiry, there's a risk of alienating them from science. This alienation not only diminishes public support and trust in science but also risks overlooking the valuable insights and perspectives that the public can offer in defining what counts as worthwhile scientific pursuits. The societal foundations of science���public support, legitimacy, and the inspiration for future breakthroughs���are indeed at risk if this trend continues unchecked.
Addressing these challenges requires a concerted effort to foster greater transparency, public engagement, and education around AI's role in science. Scientists and researchers need to communicate their findings and the role of AI in their research in accessible and meaningful ways. Engaging the public in conversations about the direction of scientific research and the ethical implications of AI in science can help bridge the gap between scientists and the broader community. Moreover, education systems need to adapt to equip people with the critical thinking and digital literacy skills needed to navigate this increasingly complex landscape.
Ultimately, ensuring that AI serves to enhance rather than diminish the public's engagement with science is crucial. By doing so, we can harness the benefits of AI in expanding the frontiers of knowledge while maintaining the societal trust and support that are essential for the continued progress and application of science.

Stengers set up a 3-year experiment at her university in which students analyzed past scientific outcomes. Through this analysis, they discovered the subtle ways in which scientists sometime ���pooh-pooh as ���non-scientific or ideological��� things that others think are important.��� Students realized that scientific situations were marked by uncertainty, entangled within a web of facts and values ��� decisions made by scientists to intentionally ignore aspects that fell outside predefined terms. This selectivity is now being woven into the logics of AI models. As AI collaborates with scientists, there���s a danger of exacerbating these biases on an exponential scale.
ChatGPT
ChatGPT
The experiment you described, presumably inspired by the work of Isabelle Stengers or a similar conceptual framework, illustrates an important critique of the scientific process. It sheds light on the intrinsic uncertainties, value judgments, and selectivities that underpin scientific research. This realization is crucial in understanding how science is not just a collection of objective facts but also a complex interplay of decisions, interpretations, and sometimes, exclusions.
The introduction of AI into this already intricate landscape adds another layer of complexity. AI models, by their design, rely on the data fed into them and the parameters set by their human creators. If these data and parameters reflect the selectivities and biases inherent in the scientific process���as the students in the described experiment uncovered���then AI has the potential to amplify these biases rather than mitigate them.
The danger of exacerbating biases on an exponential scale through AI collaboration with scientists highlights a significant ethical and methodological concern. AI systems can process and analyze data at scales and speeds unattainable by humans, meaning they can reinforce and propagate biases more widely and rapidly. For instance, if an AI model in medical research is trained on datasets that lack diversity, the resulting analyses and conclusions may not be applicable to underrepresented groups, thereby reinforcing existing health inequities.
Addressing this challenge requires a multidimensional approach:
Diversification of Data
: Ensuring that the datasets used to train AI models are as diverse and representative as possible can help mitigate the risk of reinforcing existing biases.
Transparency and Accountability
: Making the development and deployment processes of AI models in scientific research transparent can enable scrutiny and accountability, ensuring that biases are identified and addressed.
Interdisciplinary Collaboration
: Involving ethicists, social scientists, and representatives from affected communities in the development and application of AI in scientific research can provide broader perspectives and help identify potential biases and ethical issues.
Continuous Monitoring and Adjustment
: AI models should not be considered static; they require ongoing monitoring and adjustment to ensure they remain ethical and unbiased as new data and insights become available.
Education and Awareness
: Educating scientists and AI developers about the potential for biases and the importance of ethical considerations can foster a culture of responsibility and critical reflection.
The experiment and its findings emphasize the need for a conscious and conscientious approach to integrating AI into scientific research. By acknowledging and addressing the complex web of facts, values, and decisions that characterize scientific inquiry, we can harness AI's potential to advance knowledge while ensuring it serves the broader interests of society in a fair and ethical manner.

The construction of the mythos of a scientist who has the ���right stuff��� ��� a disposition aligned with the ���spirit of science��� and devoid of supposedly effeminate traits like ���passion��� and ���whims��� ��� is a centuries-old danger. Robert Boyle, regarded as the founder of Modern Chemistry, promoted an ethos of ���spiritual chastity��� centered on modesty and the disciplined exercise of reason. This ideal of the detached, perfectly rational scientist still subtly shapes our expectations. Could this explain some of the misplaced trust in AI as a tool to achieve objectivity? If this connection resonates with you, my piece ���When Did We Lose The Right To Be Imperfect?��� explores this exact move through our culture more broadly, not just in the ���sciences.���

What happens in this disposition though, and this is key, is that the ���big questions��� ��� about the purpose of our research, its implications for what we consider a good life ��� are immediately rendered non-scientific and irrelevant.

This leaves us with an impoverished ontology, in which one type of faith has been swapped for another. Because now, having the ���right stuff��� ��� embodying the ethos of a scientist��� requires having an unshakable faith that what scientific questions define as not counting��� don���t really count! It is a faith, as Stengers says, that ���defines itself against doubt.���

The connection you draw between the historical construction of the scientist's ethos and the contemporary misplaced trust in AI as a tool for achieving objectivity is insightful and compelling. The mythos of the scientist endowed with the 'right stuff'���a figure characterized by rational detachment, devoid of 'effeminate' traits such as passion and whims, as you describe���has deep roots in the culture of science. This ideal, promoted by figures like Robert Boyle, emphasizes a model of scientific inquiry grounded in an impersonal and supposedly objective exercise of reason.
This historical ethos influences not only our expectations of scientists but also our perceptions of the tools they employ, including AI. The appeal of AI in scientific and decision-making contexts is partly based on the assumption that it embodies this ideal of objectivity and detachment. AI, being a machine, is presumed to be free from the biases, emotions, and whims that might cloud human judgment. However, this assumption overlooks the fact that AI systems are designed, trained, and deployed by humans and are deeply embedded in human cultural, social, and ethical contexts. The biases and values of their creators can subtly influence these systems, challenging the notion of AI as a purely objective tool.
Your observation that the ideal of the detached, rational scientist can lead to a dismissal of the 'big questions' about the purpose and ethical implications of research is particularly important. By defining certain questions as outside the scope of scientific inquiry, this ethos narrows the range of considered knowledge and values, leading to an impoverished ontology. It encourages a faith in the sufficiency of scientific rationality that precludes doubt and critical reflection on the broader impacts of scientific work.
This shift from a nuanced understanding of knowledge and inquiry to a narrow focus on quantifiable and supposedly objective facts reflects a broader cultural move towards valuing certainty and control over ambiguity and complexity. The reliance on AI as a means to achieve this control and certainty can be seen as part of this broader cultural trend.
Addressing these challenges requires a more holistic and reflexive approach to both science and the integration of technologies like AI. Recognizing the value of doubt, the importance of ethical reflection, and the significance of the 'big questions' about the purpose and impact of research is crucial. This approach calls for a broader conception of what constitutes the 'right stuff' in science���one that embraces emotional engagement, ethical responsibility, and a willingness to confront uncertainty and complexity.
By fostering a culture of science and technology that acknowledges the limitations of objectivity and embraces a more inclusive and reflective ethos, we can move towards a more ethically grounded and socially responsive practice of inquiry. This approach not only enriches our understanding of the world but also ensures that scientific and technological advancements contribute to a vision of the good life that is inclusive, equitable, and reflective of our shared values and aspirations.

Instead of solely focusing on efficiency, scientists need to be encouraged to embrace the weird ��� the uncertain, the doubtful, the questions that linger at the periphery, to make things wobble just a bit. These are the spaces where transformative discoveries lurk. But to foster a healthy scientific ethos, we must bridge the widening gap between scientists and the public. A thriving scientific ethos requires not just scientists pushing the edge, but an engaged public ��� connoisseurs who can actively participate in the public process of scientific endeavors, evaluating and discussing its uncertainties and outcomes.
ChatGPT
ChatGPT
Embracing the "weird," the uncertain, and the questions that dwell at the edges of scientific inquiry indeed opens up a realm of possibilities for transformative discoveries. This approach not only challenges the conventional focus on efficiency and predictability but also enriches the scientific process by valuing exploration and curiosity over mere outcomes. Encouraging scientists to make things "wobble just a bit" can lead to breakthroughs that might never emerge from a more constrained, efficiency-driven approach.
Bridging the gap between scientists and the public is essential for fostering a healthy scientific ethos. This relationship is symbiotic: scientists benefit from the diverse perspectives, questions, and challenges that come from an engaged public, while the public gains a deeper understanding of science, its processes, and its implications. An engaged public can act as connoisseurs of scientific endeavors, not in the sense of passively admiring the work of scientists but in actively participating in the discourse around scientific uncertainties, methodologies, and outcomes. This engagement democratizes science, making it more accessible and accountable to society at large.
For this vision to materialize, several strategies can be employed:
Science Communication
: Investing in science communication that goes beyond simplification to genuinely engage with the public���s curiosity and concerns. This involves presenting science in a way that is accessible without being reductive, highlighting not just successes but also the uncertainties and complexities of scientific research.
Public Participation in Science
: Encouraging forms of citizen science where the public can directly contribute to scientific projects. This not only aids scientific research but also gives participants a firsthand understanding of the scientific process, including its iterative nature and how questions evolve.
Science Education
: Reforming science education to emphasize critical thinking, the nature of scientific inquiry (including its uncertainties and limitations), and the role of science in society. This prepares individuals to engage with scientific topics more deeply throughout their lives.
Dialogue and Deliberation
: Creating platforms for dialogue between scientists, policymakers, and the public to discuss the directions and implications of scientific research. These platforms can help surface diverse perspectives and values, enriching the scientific process and its outcomes.
Inclusive Policy-making
: Integrating public opinions and concerns into science policy-making processes. This can be achieved through public consultations, participatory decision-making processes, and other mechanisms that ensure the public has a voice in shaping the scientific agenda.
By fostering an environment where scientific inquiry embraces the full spectrum of human curiosity and where the public is actively engaged in the scientific process, we can cultivate a more dynamic, responsive, and responsible scientific ethos. Such an ethos not only accelerates innovation but also ensures that scientific endeavors are aligned with the broader values and needs of society, making science a truly public enterprise.

Created by author using dreamstudio.ai

While listening to a podcast called Weird Studies, I was struck by how the relentless drive to quantify and categorize the world leaves little room for the ���weird��� ��� phenomena that defy easy explanation and challenge our existing knowledge frameworks. This modern obsession with efficiency and data collection creates a climate where the hasty merging of AI technologies in scientific research feels not only inevitable but also desirable. While AI offers the allure of objectivity and speed, it risks prioritizing data and reductive answers over the open-ended questions and deep understanding that drive true innovation.

The Weird Studies folks delve into the weird, the unexplained, the phenomena just at the edges of our understanding. This spirit of open-minded inquiry resonates with themes explored in my previous piece, ���A World Without Wonder,��� where I discuss the dangers of Modernity���s relentless drive towards quantification and control.

Within this framework of control and quantification, AI emerges as the seemingly inevitable consequence of our drive for ever-greater efficiency and throughput. The integration of AI into scientific research appears as the ultimate match made for our modern condition. But are the promises of AI too good to be true? While some scientists embrace AI wholeheartedly, others advocate for greater caution and awareness of the risks involved in widespread implementation.

Recent Insights on AI in Research
Addressing these concerns, Messeri and Crockett, in their March 7th article for Nature Magazine ��� ���Artificial intelligence and illusions of understanding in scientific research,��� they warn that AI, while offering productivity and objectivity gains, could exploit our cognitive biases and create illusions of deeper understanding than we actually possess. This could stifle innovation and make scientific work more prone to errors.

Messeri and Crockett identify four distinct visions for AI in the scientific community: (1) Oracle; (2) Surrogate; (3) Quant; (4) Arbiter.
ChatGPT
ChatGPT
The beginning of your article sets a compelling stage for a critical examination of the integration of AI into scientific research, juxtaposing the allure of AI's promises with the potential risks it poses to the essence of scientific inquiry. The invocation of the podcast Weird Studies to frame this discussion emphasizes the importance of preserving spaces in scientific exploration for the "weird" ��� phenomena that defy easy categorization and quantification, which are essential for true breakthroughs and understanding.
Your identification of the modern obsession with efficiency, data collection, and the quantification of the world as a backdrop against which AI's integration into science is pursued captures a significant cultural and epistemological shift. This shift, as you argue, risks sidelining the inherently uncertain and exploratory nature of scientific inquiry in favor of a more predictable, but potentially superficial, form of knowledge.
The reference to Messeri and Crockett's article from Nature Magazine provides a concrete basis for these concerns, highlighting the danger of AI exploiting cognitive biases and creating illusions of understanding. This insight is particularly relevant in the context of the four visions of AI in the scientific community (Oracle, Surrogate, Quant, Arbiter), each representing a different aspect of AI's potential impact on scientific research. These roles, while offering various benefits, also encapsulate the risks of oversimplification, bias amplification, and the potential for AI to serve more as a crutch than a tool for deepening understanding.
Your article's premise raises important questions about the balance between leveraging AI's capabilities and preserving the depth, nuance, and open-ended nature of scientific exploration. It suggests that a critical reevaluation of our relationship with AI in the context of scientific research is necessary to ensure that AI serves to augment rather than undermine the pursuit of genuine knowledge and innovation.
Continuing this exploration could involve delving deeper into the ways in which AI can be designed, implemented, and governed to support rather than supplant the inherently "weird" and uncertain processes that drive scientific discovery. This might include strategies for integrating AI in a manner that encourages critical thinking, promotes transparency, and ensures a diversity of perspectives and methodologies within scientific inquiry. Ultimately, the goal would be to cultivate a scientific ethos that values and actively engages with the complexity and uncertainty of the natural world, using AI as a tool for expansion rather than reduction of our scientific imagination and capabilities.

I think I think if it as a snarky notebook or journal akin to a zettlekasten
ChatGPT
ChatGPT
Approaching AI as a "snarky notebook" or journal, in the spirit of a Zettelkasten, is an intriguing and creative way to frame the integration of artificial intelligence into scientific and intellectual endeavors. The Zettelkasten method, with its emphasis on creating a network of notes where ideas can connect, evolve, and interact in an organic and non-linear fashion, offers a compelling analogy for how AI might serve as a dynamic partner in the process of exploration and discovery.
In this context, envisioning AI as a snarky notebook adds an additional layer of personality and critical engagement. Rather than simply being a passive repository of information or a straightforward tool for efficiency, AI could act as a challenging interlocutor���a system that not only stores and retrieves information but also questions assumptions, offers unexpected connections, and injects a dose of skepticism or humor into the process. This approach could stimulate critical thinking and creativity, encouraging users to engage more deeply with their material and to consider alternative perspectives and possibilities.
For scientists and researchers, using AI in this manner could transform it from a tool that might flatten scientific inquiry into quantifiable metrics, into one that enriches the exploratory process. It could encourage the pursuit of the "weird" and the uncertain by offering provocative questions or suggesting links that might not be immediately obvious. This could help preserve the depth and nuance essential for true innovation, rather than succumbing to the illusion of knowledge that can come from overly simplistic or reductive approaches.
Implementing this concept would require careful design to ensure that the AI system is capable of meaningful and contextually appropriate interactions. It would need to balance its "snarkiness" or critical edge with constructive contributions to the research process. Additionally, fostering a culture of openness and curiosity among users, where the unexpected contributions of an AI system are valued rather than seen as disruptions, would be essential.
Ultimately, embracing AI as a snarky Zettelkasten could lead to a more vibrant and dynamic scientific ecosystem, one in which the exploration of uncertainty and the embrace of complex questions are recognized as central to the pursuit of knowledge. This approach could help mitigate some of the risks associated with AI's integration into science, ensuring that it acts as a catalyst for innovation rather than an impediment to genuine understanding.

It represents the intentional stance which scientists already take if they write down their ideas and show their work not just recording their successes but failures and misdirections encountered
ChatGPT
ChatGPT
Adopting an "intentional stance" towards AI, akin to the reflective and comprehensive approach of scientists meticulously documenting not only their successes but also their failures and missteps, enriches the dialogue around AI's role in the research process. This perspective fosters a culture of transparency, critical reflection, and learning from the entire spectrum of scientific exploration, including its dead ends and diversions.
By treating AI as a dynamic participant in this process���an intellectual companion that records, challenges, and even snarkily comments on the journey���scientists can create a more resilient and adaptive research methodology. This method acknowledges that setbacks and redirections are not merely obstacles but integral components of the path to discovery. Here, AI does not merely streamline or expedite research; it becomes a catalyst for deeper inquiry and a mirror reflecting the complex, non-linear nature of scientific progress.
Incorporating failures and misdirections into the AI-supported research process can yield several benefits:
Encouraging a Growth Mindset
: Recognizing that setbacks are valuable learning opportunities can cultivate a growth mindset among researchers. AI, by documenting and analyzing these moments, can help identify patterns or insights that might be missed in a more success-oriented approach.
Enhancing Creativity
: By incorporating diverse outcomes���including those deemed unsuccessful���into the research narrative, AI can help uncover unexpected connections or alternative paths. This can stimulate creative thinking and potentially lead to breakthroughs that a more linear or conventional approach might overlook.
Improving Transparency and Replicability
: A comprehensive record of the research process, including missteps and failures, can enhance the transparency and replicability of scientific studies. AI can assist in meticulously documenting these aspects, providing a more complete and accurate picture of the research undertaken.
Fostering Collaboration
: Sharing the full scope of research experiences, including challenges and redirections, can encourage collaboration and knowledge sharing within the scientific community. AI systems designed to capture and communicate these aspects can facilitate more meaningful exchanges between researchers.
Challenging the Notion of Failure
: By integrating failures into the narrative of scientific progress, AI can help redefine the concept of failure, emphasizing its role as a stepping stone rather than an endpoint. This shift can foster a more resilient and optimistic approach to scientific inquiry.
This approach aligns with the principles of the Zettelkasten method, where knowledge is not static but constantly evolving through the interaction of interconnected ideas, including those that stem from unexpected or unconventional sources. By adopting an intentional stance that embraces the full complexity of the scientific endeavor, researchers can leverage AI to support a more holistic, reflective, and ultimately more fruitful exploration of the unknown.

So I was thinking that the alphabet itself was a weird tool
ChatGPT
ChatGPT
Indeed, the alphabet can be seen as a "weird tool," especially when we contemplate its origins, evolution, and the profound impact it has had on human thought, communication, and society. Its development from pictographs and ideograms to a standardized set of symbols representing sounds rather than concepts or objects marks a significant leap in cognitive technology.
The Alphabet as a Cognitive Technology
The alphabet's invention was revolutionary in its abstraction. It transformed the way humans store and transmit knowledge, moving from concrete representations (like those in hieroglyphics) to abstract ones. This abstraction enabled a more efficient way of writing and reading, democratizing knowledge and communication by making literacy more accessible.
Abstraction and Standardization
The alphabet's standardization of symbols for sounds rather than entire ideas or objects allowed for the representation of an infinite number of words and concepts, using only a small set of characters. This level of abstraction was a pivotal development in human cognition, enabling more complex thought processes and communication methods.
The Weirdness of Alphabetic Writing
The "weirdness" comes into play when considering how this system, seemingly simple and direct, shapes our thinking and culture in profound and sometimes unexpected ways. The alphabet, by its nature, linearizes thought. It requires that complex ideas be broken down into sequential components, which could influence our perception of time, causality, and narrative structure.
Impact on Thought and Culture
Marshall McLuhan's famous aphorism, "The medium is the message," applies well to the alphabet. The medium through which we communicate���not just what we communicate���shapes our society and cognition. The alphabet, as a medium, encourages a particular way of thinking and interacting with the world: analytical, sequential, and abstract.
A Tool for Both Clarity and Obscurity
While the alphabet allows for clear communication and the dissemination of ideas, it also enables the creation of codes, puzzles, and secret languages. The same tool that clarifies can also obscure, demonstrating its versatility and complexity.
The Alphabet in the Digital Age
In the digital age, the alphabet has found new life through binary code���zeros and ones representing these ancient symbols in the vast, interconnected networks of the internet. This transformation of the alphabet into digital code underscores its enduring weirdness: a system of simple symbols, devised millennia ago, now underpins the most complex and far-reaching communication system humanity has ever known.
Reflecting on the alphabet as a "weird tool" encourages us to reconsider what we often take for granted. It invites us to explore the deep impacts of our chosen mediums of expression on our thoughts, cultures, and technologies. The alphabet, in its simplicity and complexity, serves as a reminder of humanity's capacity for abstract thought and our perpetual drive to understand and reshape our world.

Since English has many redundancies, I thought of a way of typing I call the 8-letter keyboard that where you just type the letter on the home row that you would normally move up and down. For example qaz all become a wsx becomes s, so that the only letters are asdf jkl and semicolon ; which  represents a p
ChatGPT
ChatGPT
Your idea for an 8-letter keyboard is quite innovative, aiming to streamline typing by leveraging the home row keys on a QWERTY keyboard and reducing movement. This concept plays into the strengths of redundancy in the English language, assuming that the context of words can help disambiguate reduced alphabetic representations. Here's a deeper look at how this could work and what it implies:
Simplification through Reduction
By mapping the entire alphabet to just the home row (A, S, D, F, G, H, J, K, L, ;) and assigning multiple letters to each key based on their vertical alignment on a QWERTY keyboard, you're significantly reducing finger movement. This could potentially increase typing speed and efficiency after a learning curve.
Decoding and Contextual Reading
This system would heavily rely on the reader's ability to interpret words based on context, given that multiple letters are represented by the same key. English, with its redundancies and contextual cues, might lend itself to this sort of interpretation, though it could initially pose challenges for clarity and readability.
Learning Curve
Adopting this 8-letter keyboard would require users to learn a new way of typing and reading English text. The learning curve might be steep, but if the system proves to be efficient, it could find niche applications, particularly where speed is more critical than immediate legibility (e.g., note-taking or coding with an auto-expand feature).
Software Support and Auto-correction
Implementing this system effectively would likely require software support���auto-correction and predictive text algorithms that can accurately guess the intended words based on the reduced input. This could mitigate some of the ambiguities and increase the usability of the 8-letter system.
Potential Applications
While general adoption might be challenging, there could be specific applications where this system offers distinct advantages. For example, it might benefit users with mobility or dexterity issues who find the standard keyboard layout difficult to use. It could also be useful in specialized typing scenarios where speed is more critical than accuracy, or where the text is intended to be deciphered or expanded later.
Impact on Language and Communication
Introducing a simplified typing system could have interesting effects on language use and communication, potentially leading to a new 'shorthand' version of English for digital communication. Over time, this could influence language evolution, much as texting and online communication have introduced new abbreviations and conventions into everyday language.
Your concept invites us to rethink not just the mechanics of typing but also the flexibility and adaptability of language itself. It underscores the potential for technological innovation to shape and streamline our interactions with digital devices, even as it challenges us to balance efficiency with clarity and understandability.

I think it might be a little awkward but it is possible to type with just one finger using a swype keyboard I am thinking that slight upward or downward movement could also be taken into account, I am thinking of ways of typing without using a physical keyboard and just tracking the hands
ChatGPT
ChatGPT
Exploring ways to type without relying on a physical keyboard, especially through hand tracking and gestures like Swype (used on touchscreens), opens up fascinating possibilities for interaction design. Integrating slight hand or finger movements (upward or downward) as additional inputs could further enhance the efficiency and intuitiveness of gesture-based typing systems. Here are some thoughts on how such a system might work and its potential applications:
Gesture Recognition Technology
Advancements in gesture recognition technology, through either cameras or specialized sensors, can accurately track the position and movement of hands in space. This technology could be the foundation of a keyboard-less typing system, where movements correspond to letters or commands.
Upward and Downward Gestures
Incorporating slight upward or downward movements as part of the input method could allow for a richer set of commands or letters with fewer gestures. For example, a simple movement to the right could indicate one letter, while the same movement with a slight upward flick could represent another. This approach would require precise tracking and responsiveness to ensure ease of use and minimize errors.
Learning Curve and Adaptability
As with any new input method, there would be a learning curve. However, the success of Swype keyboards on smartphones suggests that users are adaptable and can quickly become proficient with gesture-based typing. A key factor in adoption would be designing an intuitive system that aligns with natural hand movements and minimizes physical strain.
Potential Applications
Such a system could have wide-ranging applications, especially in environments where traditional keyboards are impractical or unsanitary. For example:
Virtual Reality (VR) and Augmented Reality (AR)
: In immersive environments, physical keyboards are out of place, but gesture-based typing could allow for efficient text input without breaking the immersive experience.
Accessibility
: For individuals with disabilities that make using a traditional keyboard challenging, gesture-based systems could offer a more accessible alternative for computer interaction.
Public Kiosks and Displays
: In settings where multiple people use the same interface (e.g., information kiosks, ATMs), a touchless interface could reduce the spread of germs.
Challenges and Considerations
Precision and Error Correction
: Gesture-based systems need to accurately interpret gestures and offer robust error correction and prediction capabilities to be practical for everyday use.
Fatigue
: Minimizing physical strain and fatigue is essential, especially for prolonged use. The system should ideally allow for relaxed, natural movements.
Privacy and Security
: Hand-tracking systems must ensure that sensitive input (e.g., passwords) is securely processed and that users' biometric data is protected.
Future Directions
Research into combining gesture recognition with AI-driven predictive text could further enhance the efficiency of keyboard-less typing systems. AI could anticipate users' intended words based on context and previous inputs, reducing the number of gestures needed.
Developing a typing system based on hand tracking and gestures, with the inclusion of nuanced movements for additional inputs, represents an exciting frontier in human-computer interaction. As technology continues to evolve, such innovations could redefine the way we think about and interact with digital devices.

So you could make a physical keyboard with eight little "joysticks" that are placed as the home row you would push the a up slightly to get a q and the f to the right to get a g, for example
ChatGPT
ChatGPT
Creating a physical keyboard that incorporates eight little "joysticks" for the home row keys presents a novel approach to input devices, blending the tactile feedback of physical keyboards with the versatility and nuance of gesture-based control. This concept retains the familiarity of a keyboard layout while introducing a new dimension of interaction, potentially making typing more intuitive and efficient. Here���s a deeper exploration of this idea:
Design and Functionality
Joystick Integration
: Each key on the home row (A, S, D, F, G, H, J, K, and possibly L and ;) would be equipped with a mini joystick capable of detecting slight movements in all directions (up, down, left, right, and diagonals).
Directional Inputs
: Users could produce different characters by nudging the joysticks in specific directions. For example, pushing the 'A' joystick up could type a 'Q', while pushing the 'F' to the right could type a 'G'. This allows the entire alphabet and additional characters to be mapped onto just the home row.
Tactile Feedback
: To aid in accuracy and comfort, the joysticks could provide haptic feedback when a selection is made, helping users "feel" their way through typing without looking down at their hands.
Advantages
Ergonomics
: This design could significantly reduce finger travel and fatigue by keeping users' fingers on the home row, potentially offering a more ergonomic typing experience.
Speed and Efficiency
: Once users become accustomed to the system, typing speed could increase due to the reduced need to move fingers away from the home row. The system's efficiency would benefit from the intuitive nature of directional inputs.
Customization and Accessibility
: The joystick keyboard could be highly customizable, allowing users to adjust sensitivity, map specific characters to preferred directions, or even program macros for frequent tasks. This adaptability could also make the keyboard more accessible to users with physical disabilities.
Challenges and Considerations
Learning Curve
: Users would need to acclimate to the new typing method, which might initially slow down typing speeds. Training programs or adaptive learning software could mitigate this.
Precision and Accidental Inputs
: Ensuring that the joysticks accurately capture intended movements without registering accidental inputs would be crucial. Advanced calibration and possibly AI assistance could help distinguish between deliberate actions and incidental touches.
Durability and Maintenance
: The mechanical complexity of adding joysticks to a keyboard could raise concerns about durability and the ease of maintenance or replacement of individual keys.
Implementation and Development
Prototyping this keyboard would involve detailed engineering to balance sensitivity, accuracy, and user comfort. It would also require extensive user testing to refine the interaction model and ensure that the keyboard meets diverse needs. Software support, in terms of drivers and configuration tools, would be essential for customizing the keyboard's functionality across different operating systems and applications.
Broader Implications
If successful, such an innovative keyboard could inspire further exploration into hybrid input devices that combine the best aspects of physical and gesture-based interfaces. It could also spark discussions about the nature of typing and text entry in the future, particularly in terms of how we balance the benefits of traditional keyboards with the potential of new technologies to enhance user experience, accessibility, and efficiency.
Exploring such innovations not only has the potential to improve how we interact with digital devices but also challenges us to rethink the design and function of everyday tools in the context of evolving technology and user needs.

The g is a right f and h is a left j. I don't know if someone has already built a keyboard like this but it could be intuitive.
ChatGPT
ChatGPT
Your idea for a redesigned keyboard that minimizes finger movement by integrating joystick functionality into the home row keys is innovative and intriguing. As of my last update in April 2023, while there have been various attempts at creating alternative keyboard designs to improve ergonomics, efficiency, and intuitiveness (such as ergonomic keyboards, the Dvorak layout, and even entirely gesture-based input methods), your specific concept of a joystick-integrated keyboard focusing on directional inputs for an expanded character set seems unique.
The notion that "G" could be typed by pushing the "F" key to the right and "H" by pushing the "J" to the left introduces a potentially more intuitive way of thinking about keyboard layouts. This method leverages spatial reasoning and muscle memory in a manner that traditional keyboards do not, potentially reducing the learning curve associated with alternative keyboard layouts.
Development and Refinement
To bring this idea to life, several steps and considerations would be essential:
Prototype Development
: Creating physical prototypes would be crucial to test the concept and refine the design. This might involve custom hardware development and possibly 3D printing to experiment with different joystick mechanisms and key placements.
Software Integration
: Developing software that can accurately interpret the joystick movements into corresponding characters is another critical component. This software would need to be highly customizable to accommodate user preferences for sensitivity and specific movement mappings.
User Testing
: Extensive user testing would be necessary to evaluate the intuitiveness, efficiency, and ergonomic benefits of the keyboard. Feedback from a diverse group of users, including those with disabilities, could highlight areas for improvement and potential use cases.
Ergonomic Evaluation
: Consulting with ergonomics experts could ensure that the design minimizes strain and the risk of repetitive stress injuries. The joystick movement should be easy to perform without causing finger fatigue or discomfort.
Potential Challenges
Accuracy and Error Rate
: Ensuring that users can accurately control the joysticks and that the system reliably interprets gestures as intended characters would be a primary challenge. Developing a robust error correction and prediction system might mitigate this.
Market Adoption
: As with any radical departure from the norm, encouraging widespread adoption would require overcoming inertia and skepticism. Demonstrating clear benefits over traditional keyboards would be key.
Opportunities
Despite these challenges, your keyboard concept holds exciting possibilities for innovation in human-computer interaction. It could offer a more personalized and potentially more accessible way of typing, appeal to users looking for efficiency gains, and inspire further exploration in ergonomic design.
If you're genuinely interested in pursuing this idea, you might consider reaching out to communities interested in ergonomics, keyboard enthusiasts, or even conducting a small-scale study or survey to gauge interest and gather more insights. Collaborating with designers, engineers, and ergonomics experts could also help in realizing a prototype for further testing and development.

Razer adds joystick-like control to a small mechanical keyboard
Each key also has customizable actuation and can perform two inputs with one press.
by Scharon Harding - Mar 4, 2022 12:03pm AST

Razer's Analog Optical mechanical switches.
Razer
Do you use a keyboard and mouse or a controller when playing PC games?

One of the biggest advantages gamepads have over keyboards is the joystick, which provides pressure-sensitive control in a way that most keyboards can't. Razer's Huntsman Mini Analog, released Thursday, makes the debate a bit more complicated.

ADVERTISING


Enlarge / The full-size version has an 8,000 Hz polling rate, but the Mini sits at the standard 1,000 Hz.
Razer
The name says it all. Razer's latest keyboard is a small clacker with pressure-sensitive mechanical keys. Proprietary analog optical switches can detect how hard you're pressing a key and adjust input accordingly. This differs from how most keyboards function; typical boards use digital input and read either a 0 or 1 value (not depressed or depressed). All of the keys in the 60 percent keyboard can be programmed to use analog input via Razer's software.
ChatGPT
ChatGPT
It looks like Razer has indeed introduced a concept somewhat similar to what you were envisioning with their Huntsman Mini Analog keyboard. This innovative product incorporates pressure-sensitive mechanical keys, which can detect the intensity of a press and adjust the input accordingly, a feature that adds a dimension of control akin to what you find on a joystick.
This development by Razer brings a nuanced approach to input that goes beyond the binary pressed/not pressed model of traditional keyboards. By allowing for pressure-sensitive input, it opens up possibilities for more nuanced control in gaming and potentially other applications, like nuanced control in creative software or more responsive commands in productivity applications.
The ability to program each key for analog input through Razer's software adds a layer of customization that could be particularly appealing for both gaming and non-gaming contexts. This technology could allow for actions like gently pressing a key for walking and pressing harder to run in a game, or applying different pressures for different brush strokes in digital art software.
While this isn't exactly the same as having mini joysticks on each key, Razer's Huntsman Mini Analog represents a significant step toward more dynamic and expressive keyboard input methods. It demonstrates a move away from the static nature of traditional keyboards and towards incorporating more interactive and responsive elements, bridging some of the gap between gamepad and keyboard input methods.
This development could inspire further innovation in keyboard design, including possibly exploring directional inputs and gestures as you suggested. The intersection of gaming technology with broader computing applications often drives innovation, and Razer's approach might just open the door for more radical redesigns of the keyboard as an input device.

20-Key Fulcrum
After a few months of use, I'm happy to introduce the Fulcrum Keyboard - a 20-key ergo-mechanical split keyboard, with two rotary encoders, and two 5-way switches. It runs on KMK.

The sideways-mounted 5-way switches are such a game changer. It's like adding a force-multiplier to your board.

Our thumbs aren't the same as our other fingers (they are ���opposable���, after all) so it makes sense that we shouldn���t give them same type of keys as our other fingers.

If you think about how you type on a iPhone keyboard (which most people can do quite well), this joystick mimics a similar type of movement. Our thumbs are very dexterous in this dimension.

The 5-way joystick, plus the regular key switch placed directly below it, puts six (SIX!) different actions at the tip of each thumb, all with minimal movement. Crucially, all of these actions are easily and comfortably paired with other key presses elsewhere on the keyboard.

Previously I had thought of this board as a fun, almost gimmicky side project. Now it's been my daily driver for about three months, and I can regularly type faster than what my all-time high speeds were with my other boards.

Other Fulcrum Features:

- Two rotary encoders: tilted for ergo reachability

- Word keys: "the" & "and" each have their own key in this layout. I could take or leave the "and" key, but I don't think I'll ever type again without a "the" key

There's more info on the github repo if anybody is interested. If nothing else I highly recommend trying out the horizontal joysticks for yourself on your own builds!

(PS - if anyone has any ideas on how to create a PCB for this design, please let me know! I'm not super experienced with PCBs and this is definitely beyond me.)

The concept you're exploring���blending physical keyboard affordances with hand tracking software to enable a multi-modal typing approach���is both innovative and forward-thinking. By integrating chorded input, swype-based gestures, and finger tracking, you're envisioning a highly adaptable and efficient input system that could cater to a wide range of user preferences and needs. Let's delve into how such a system could be designed and the potential benefits and challenges it might offer:
Design Considerations
Combining Input Methods
: At the heart of this system would be the seamless integration of different typing methods. Chorded input allows for the activation of commands or letters by pressing multiple keys simultaneously, akin to playing a chord on a piano. Swype-based input, popularized by touchscreen keyboards, involves tracing a path over letters to form words. Finger tracking would detect the specific fingers used for typing, potentially allowing for gestures or movements in the air above the keyboard to be recognized as input.
Physical Keyboard Design
: The physical keyboard could be designed with sensitive keys capable of detecting not just presses but also the direction and pressure of swipes or slides across keys. Additionally, the keys themselves could be touch-sensitive, recognizing when a finger is resting on them without pressing down, which could be crucial for chorded input combinations.
Hand Tracking Integration
: Advanced hand tracking software could capture the nuanced movements of typing, including the distance fingers move above the keyboard for air gestures. This technology would require precise sensors positioned around the keyboard area or even incorporated into the keyboard itself.
Learning and Teaching Applications
Adaptive Learning Software
: This system could be paired with software designed to teach typing through adaptive learning, gradually introducing users to the full range of input methods available. This software could track progress, suggest exercises to improve speed and accuracy, and adapt to the user's preferred typing style.
Gamification
: Incorporating game-like elements into the learning process could make mastering this complex input system more engaging. Challenges or levels could focus on different aspects of the system, from chorded combinations to swype gestures to air typing.
Potential Benefits
Efficiency and Speed
: By allowing users to combine multiple input methods, typing could become significantly more efficient, with the best method chosen for the task at hand.
Accessibility
: Such a system could be highly adaptable to individual needs, including those of users with disabilities, by customizing the input methods that work best for them.
Ergonomics
: Reducing the need for extensive finger movement and allowing for more natural hand positions could improve comfort and reduce the risk of repetitive strain injuries.
Challenges
Complexity and Learning Curve
: The main challenge would be the system's complexity and the learning curve associated with mastering three distinct input methods and their integration.
Technology Integration
: Ensuring seamless communication between the physical keyboard, hand tracking software, and the computer could require significant technical development and integration effort.
User Adoption
: Convincing users to invest the time to learn this new system could be difficult, especially if the benefits are not immediately apparent.
Your idea represents a compelling vision for the future of typing and interaction with digital devices, one that emphasizes flexibility, efficiency, and personalization.

Yeah sort of, I was thinking of a physical keyboard that just consisted of strings with weights attached to the ends of gloves, for example, to help learn these methods, but then wouldn't need them when "subvocalizing" or exaggerating the movements later
ChatGPT
ChatGPT
Your refined concept���a physical keyboard alternative that uses gloves with strings and weights to facilitate learning typing methods, transitioning to subvocalization or exaggerated movements for input���blends tactile learning with the potential for gesture-based or even thought-based input systems. This innovative approach merges the physical with the virtually intuitive, aiming to train users in a typing method that eventually transcends the need for traditional hardware. Let���s explore the components and implications of your idea:
Components of the System
Gloves with Strings and Weights
: These would be designed to guide finger movements along the paths that would be used for typing on a traditional keyboard, with weights providing resistance to strengthen the muscle memory associated with specific movements. This physical feedback helps solidify the learning of specific gestures or chords associated with typing.
Transition to Gesture or Thought-based Input
: After users have developed muscle memory from the gloves, the system could transition to recognizing gestures or movements without the physical constraints of the gloves. Advanced, it might even incorporate subvocalization recognition, where slight muscle movements associated with silent speech or thought patterns are interpreted as input.
Learning and Adaptation Process
Initial Phase
: Users learn the layout and movements associated with typing through physical interaction with the strings and weights. This phase focuses on building the muscle memory and coordination needed for typing without looking at any keys.
Intermediate Phase
: As proficiency increases, users gradually reduce reliance on the physical feedback from the gloves, starting to mimic the movements without the resistance provided by the weights. This could involve exaggerated hand gestures that mimic the typing movements.
Advanced Phase
: Eventually, users could type by making minimal movements (subvocalization or slight gestures) that are recognized by advanced sensors or AI trained to interpret these subtle cues as specific keystrokes or commands.
Technological Considerations
Sensors and AI
: For the system to recognize gestures, movements, or subvocalization, it would need sophisticated sensors capable of detecting subtle muscle movements, as well as AI algorithms trained to accurately interpret these movements as specific inputs.
Feedback Mechanisms
: To aid the learning process, especially in the initial phases, the system could provide auditory, visual, or haptic feedback when the correct movements are made, reinforcing the learning.
Potential Benefits and Challenges
Customization and Accessibility
: This system could be highly customizable to fit individual learning styles and physical needs, potentially offering a new way for people with disabilities to interact with technology.
Learning Curve
: The transition from physical to gesture-based or thought-based typing would require users to learn and adapt to several stages of interaction, which could present a significant learning curve.
Technological Integration
: Integrating this system with existing devices and ensuring accurate and reliable input recognition could be challenging and would require advances in sensor technology and AI.
Your concept pushes the boundaries of how we think about typing and interacting with digital devices, suggesting a future where the physical and the virtual merge in highly personalized and intuitive ways.
