Summarize and explain: Self-Reference and Computational Complexity

much longer work-in-progress, it is for introductory purposes only. If anyone finds any errors

Introduction: The Problematic Role of Self-Reference in Mathematics 
Self-reference is an ever-popular topic in recreational mathematics, where it is usually 
characterized as a pathological rarity that must be treated with great care in order to avoid 
vicious paradoxes like this statement is false. To some extent, this reflects the history of 
mathematics; scarcely had Bertrand Russell presented his eponymous paradox in set 
theory, namely "the set of all sets that do not include themselves as elements", than he 
proposed to outlaw it with a stupefyingly complex theory that boiled down to a blanket 
prohibition on self-inclusion and its semantic equivalent, self-reference. Since then, 
mathematicians have regarded themselves as having two choices with regard to self- 
reference: follow Russell’s prescription and avoid it, or use it (with great care) for the 
express purpose of extracting paradoxical inconsistencies from, and thereby disproving, 
certain especially problematic conjectures. 

Mathematical reasoning equates to the direct or indirect derivation of theorems from 
primitive axioms. Ordinarily, a mathematical conjecture is proven correct by direct 
(deductive or inductive) derivation within an axiomatic system, or by showing that its 
negation leads to a contradiction or an absurdity within the system; similarly, a conjecture is 
proven incorrect by either directly deriving its negation, finding a counterexample, or 
showing that it leads to a contradiction or an absurdity, again within a single axiomatic 
system. Where each of these maneuvers is confined to a formal axiomatic system, and 
where the symbols, formulae and rules of inference of a formal system are taken to refer 
only to each other, they unavoidably involve self-reference. Indeed, any algebraically closed 
language treated apart from external meaning is self-referential by definition, and so is any 
process relying on the properties of such a language. To the extent that mathematics 
consists of such languages, mathematical reasoning is such a process. It follows that 
mathematics as a whole is implicitly self-referential in nature.

But certain limits are maintained nonetheless. For example, in order to avoid introducing a 
forbidden subjective component into what is supposed to be an objective enterprise (the 
quest for "absolute" mathematical truth), at no point is a mathematician ever supposed to be 
caught referring to himself or his own thought processes as part of a mathematical proof. 
Even when deliberately employing self-reference in proving a conjecture, the mathematician 
must punctiliously externalize and thereby objectivize it, hygienically confining it to a formula 
or abstract machine model. By confining self-reference to the object level of discourse, the 
mathematician hopes to ensure the noncircularity of a higher level of discourse from which 
the predicates true and false can be downwardly assigned with no troublesome rebound…a 
level hopefully inhabited by the mathematician himself. By avoiding self-reference on the 
"business" level of discourse, he hopes to avoid having his own reasoning falsified "from 
above" on the basis of what would otherwise be its circularity. In short, the trapper does not 
propose to be caught in his trap. 

Unfortunately, this is a philosophically dubious position. It begins to unravel as we approach 
the foundations of mathematics, where the object is to trace the roots and account for the 
very origins of mathematical reasoning. At this stage of explanation, it becomes impossible 
to avoid the realization that in order to be consistent, mathematics must possess a kind of 
algebraic closure, and to this extent must be globally self-referential. Concisely, closure 
equals self- containment with respect to a relation or predicate, and this equates to self- 
reference. E.g., the self-consistency of a system ultimately equates to the closure of that 
system with respect to consistency, and this describes a scenario in which every part of the 
system refers consistently to other parts of the system (and only thereto). At every internal 
point (mathematical datum) of the system mathematics, the following circularity applies: 
"mathematics refers consistently to mathematics". So mathematics is distributively self- 
referential, and if this makes it globally vulnerable to some kind of implacable "meta- 
mathematical" paradox, all we can do in response is learn to live with the danger. 
Fortunately, it turns out that we can reason our way out of such doubts…but only by 
admitting that self-reference is the name of the game. 

When a language self-refers, it stratifies or separates into levels, with reference flowing 
directionally from metalanguage to language. E.g., each the following statements – "this 
statement is about itself", "the subject of this statement is this statement", and "this formula 
x is a description of x" – is actually a statement and the object of a statement, with 
statement and object occupying the metalanguage and object levels respectively. The 
operative rule in such cases is that reference never flows upward from object to statement, 
but only downward (from metalanguage to object) or laterally (from object to object, by 
virtue of the expression of these objects within a higher-level metalanguage mediating their 
mutual influence). This stratification is very important from a proof-theoretic standpoint, as 
the following example shows. 

Theorem: "This statement is false" is false. 
Proof: If the statement in quotes is indeed false, then it is true. On the other hand, if it is 
true, then it is false. This is a contradiction. Since the quoted statement generates a 
contradiction, it is logically inconsistent and therefore false. (Q.E.D.) 
But wait! Unfortunately, if the quoted statement is false, then it is true (as stated in the 
proof). This would seem to contradict not only the overall statement including the quoted 
statement, i.e. the "theorem", but the proof as well…unless we have a rule saying that the 
statement in quotes can refer to neither the overall statement of which it is part, nor to the 
proof of the overall statement. In that case, it can invalidate only itself, which is exactly what 
it is taken to be doing, and can do so only within a metalanguage capable of expressing the 
reflexive self-invalidating relationship. It should be noted that technically, "this statement is 
false" is invalid on purely formal grounds; it is in fact a forbidden instance of self- reference. 
But since it is analogous to any statement that implies its own negation in an axiomatic 
context- and such statements are routinely dealt with in mathematics without immediate 
concern for their "bad syntax"- its clarity makes it valuable for illustrative purposes. 
In the above example, self- reference is confined to a formula that pronounces itself false. 
Because this formula refers negatively to its own veracity, it is a self-contained paradox 
attempting to double as its own falsifying metalanguage and thus possessing a whole new 
level of "falsehood". But aside from true or false, what else could a formula say about itself? 
Could it pronounce itself, say, unprovable? Let’s try it: "This formula is unprovable". If the 
given formula is in fact unprovable, then it is true (and therefore a theorem). But sadly, we 
cannot recognize it as such without a proof. On the other hand, suppose it is provable. Then 
it is false (because its provability contradicts what it states of itself) and yet true (because 
provable)! It seems that we still have the makings of a paradox…a statement that is 
"provably unprovable" and therefore absurd.

Summary and Explanation: Self-Reference and Computational Complexity
Christopher Michael Langan's paper, "Self-Reference and Computational Complexity," explores the significant role of self-reference in mathematics, particularly in the context of the P=NP problem.

Self-Reference in Mathematics
Historical Background:

Self-reference often leads to paradoxes, such as "this statement is false."
Bertrand Russell's paradox (the set of all sets that do not include themselves) led to the development of theories to avoid self-reference in set theory.
Mathematicians typically avoid self-reference or use it carefully to disprove problematic conjectures.
Mathematical Reasoning:

Involves deriving theorems from axioms within a formal system.
A formal system is inherently self-referential because its symbols and rules refer only to each other.
Mathematics, therefore, is implicitly self-referential.
Avoiding Self-Reference in Proofs:

Mathematicians externalize self-reference to avoid subjectivity.
They use formulas or abstract models to keep self-reference at the object level, ensuring non-circularity in higher-level discourse.
Global Self-Reference:

Mathematics must be algebraically closed and thus globally self-referential to be consistent.
This leads to the realization that mathematics refers to itself consistently.
Although this global self-referential nature could expose mathematics to paradoxes, it is an inherent characteristic.
Stratification and Directionality in Self-Referential Systems:

Self-referential statements stratify into levels, with reference flowing from metalanguage to language.
Example: "This statement is false" creates a paradox because it is self-referential.
Dealing with Paradoxes:

Self-referential paradoxes, such as "This statement is false," are handled by confining self-reference within a metalanguage.
Another example, "This formula is unprovable," also creates a paradox, illustrating the complexities of self-reference.
Implications for Computational Complexity
The paper sets the stage for a deeper exploration of the P=NP problem by highlighting the foundational role of self-reference in mathematical logic and reasoning. Understanding self-reference is crucial because it influences how we approach proofs and the inherent limitations of formal systems.

But what if we now introduce a distinction between levels of proof, calling one level the 
basic or "language" level and the other (higher) level the "metalanguage" level? Then we 
would have either a statement that can be metalinguistically proven to be linguistically 
unprovable, and thus recognizable as a theorem conveying valuable information about the 
limitations of the basic language, or a statement that cannot be metalinguistically proven to 
be linguistically unprovable, which, though uninformative, is at least not a paradox. Presto: 
self-reference without the possibility of paradox! In the year 1931, an Austrian mathematical 
logician named Kurt Godel actually performed this magic trick for the entertainment and 
edification of the mathematical world. 

Undecidability: the Power of Paradox 
As part of his Erlangen Program for 20th century mathematics, the eminent German 
mathematician David Hilbert had wanted to ascertain that mathematics is "complete" when 
formalized in a system like the predicate calculus…i.e., that all true theorems (and no false 
ones) can be proven. But after helpfully setting out to show that every true formula 
expressed in the predicate calculus is provable, Kurt Godel sadly arrived at a different 
conclusion. As it turns out, not even arithmetic is complete in this sense. In any consistent 
formal system containing arithmetic, there are true but unprovable statements. Although 
their truth can be directly apprehended, they cannot be formally derived from a finite set of 
axioms in a stepwise fashion. 

First, Godel posited axioms and rules of inference for deriving new true formulas from true 
formulas already in hand. These were just the axioms and rules of the first- order predicate 
calculus, comprising the logic of proof throughout the mathematical world. To these he 
adjoined the Peano postulates of standard arithmetic, a set of axioms and rules for the 
natural numbers. These consist of 6 basic axioms incorporating the equality symbol "=", 3 
additional axioms to define the meaning of that symbol, and a rule of induction 
corresponding to the meta-level rule of inference adjoined to the six basic axioms of the 
predicate calculus. The predicate calculus and the Peano postulates, together comprising 
15 axioms and 2 rules of inference, define a powerful and comprehensive system for the 
expression and proof of arithmetical truth. 

After defining his arithmetical system, Godel’s next step was to enable the formulation of 
self-referential statements within it. Because arithmetic refers to numbers, this meant 
assigning numbers to arithmetical formulae. He accomplished this by (1) assigning a natural 
number or "code number" Î {1,2,…,15} to each of the 15 distinct logical and arithmetical 
symbols employed in the system; (2) numbering the symbols in each formula from left to 
right with the consecutive prime "placeholder" numbers 2,3,5,7,…; (3) raising each prime 
placeholder number to a power equal to the code number of the symbol in that place; and 
(4) multiplying all of the resulting (large but computable) numbers together to get the Godel 
number of the formula (note that this procedure is reversible; given any Godel number, one 
may compute the expression it encodes by factoring it into a unique set of prime factors). In 
addition, Godel numbered proofs and partial derivations, i.e. deductive sequences of r 
consecutive formulae, with the products of r numbers 2 
m ´ 3n ´ 5p ´ …, where the bases are 
the first r primes and the exponents m, n, p,… are the Godel numbers of the first, second, 
third,… formulae in the sequence. 

In this way, every arithmetical predicate expressible by a formula or sequence of formulae is 
Godel-numbered, including the predicate "is a proof of (some formula)" and "(this formula) 
cannot be proven" [equivalent formulations with universal and existential quantifiers: "for all 
numbers x, x is not the Godel number of a proof of (this formula)"; "there does not exist a 
number…that is the Godel number of a proof of (this formula)"]. It is important to realize that 
these predicates actually correspond to real numeric relationships "isomorphically 
hybridized" with logical relationships. The biological flavor of this terminology is not 
accidental, for the isomorphism guarantees that numeric relationships areheritable as their 
logical isomorphs are derived. When one logical formula is derived by substitution from 
another, they become numerically related in such a way that a distinctive numeric predicate 
of the Godel number of the ancestral formula is effectively inherited by the Godel number of 
the descendant formula. This maintains a basis for consistency, ensuring that the negation 
of the numeric predicate of a formula cannot be derived from the numeric predicate of the 
formula itself.

Levels of Proof and Godel's Incompleteness Theorem
Levels of Proof:

Introducing a distinction between levels of proof helps avoid paradoxes.
A statement could be proven at a higher "metalanguage" level to be unprovable at the basic "language" level, providing valuable insights without paradox.
Kurt Godel's work in 1931 demonstrated this principle effectively.
Godel's Incompleteness Theorem:

David Hilbert's Program:
Hilbert aimed to prove that mathematics is complete, meaning all true statements can be formally proven.
Godel's Conclusion:
Godel proved that in any consistent formal system containing arithmetic, there are true statements that cannot be proven within the system.
This implies that mathematics is inherently incomplete.
Godel's Method:

Formal System:
Godel used the first-order predicate calculus and Peano postulates for arithmetic.
The system includes 15 axioms and 2 rules of inference, defining a comprehensive framework for arithmetic.
Encoding Formulas:
Godel assigned natural numbers to arithmetical symbols and formulas, creating "Godel numbers".
This coding system allows formulas to refer to themselves.
Numbering Proofs:
Proofs and derivations were encoded using products of prime numbers raised to powers representing the Godel numbers of the formulas.
This process ensures that every formula and proof sequence can be uniquely represented by numbers.
Self-Referential Statements in Arithmetic:

Godel Numbering:
Allows the creation of self-referential statements like "this formula cannot be proven".
These statements can be expressed and manipulated arithmetically.
Consistency and Isomorphism:
Godel's system maintains consistency by ensuring that numeric relationships mirror logical relationships.
The "isomorphically hybridized" relationship ensures that the numeric properties of formulas are preserved through logical derivations.
Implications for Mathematics and Computational Complexity
Undecidability:

Godel's work demonstrates the power and limitation of self-reference.
It highlights the existence of true but unprovable statements, challenging the notion of completeness in mathematics.
Computational Complexity:

Understanding self-reference is crucial in exploring problems like P=NP.
The methods and insights from Godel's work provide foundational tools for analyzing the limits of formal systems and computational problems.
By recognizing the stratification of proof levels and employing self-referential techniques, mathematicians can navigate the complexities of formal systems, enhancing our understanding of mathematical truth and computational complexity.

Let us be a bit more specific. Godel’s idea was to express the logical syntax of arithmetic, 
which is ordinarily formulated in terms of logical and arithmetical symbols, in terms of pure 
numeric relationships. To do this, the various logical relationships within and among 
syntactic formulae must be mirrored by numeric relationships among the (Godel-numeric) 
images of these formulae under Godel’s logic-to-number mapping. The key property that 
allows this mirroring to occur is called representability. An n-ary numeric relation R(x1,…,xn) 
is representable in the first-order Peano arithmetic N iff there is in N a formula A(a1,…,an) 
with n free variables such that for all natural numbers k1,…,kn, the following conditions hold: 
1. If R(k1,…,kn) holds, then |--NA(k1,…,kn), i.e. A(k1,…,kn) is provable in N 
2. If R(k1,…,kn) does not hold, then |--N~A(k1,…,kn) 

In this case, we say that A(a1,…,an) represents the numeric relation R. E.g., let R be 
the "less than" relation among natural numbers. Then R is representable in N because there 
is a formula x<y with two free variables (x and y) such that for any natural numbers k1 and 
k2, (1) k1<k2 is provable in N whenever k1 is less than k2, and (2) 
not-( k1<k2) is provable in N whenever k1 is not less than k2. Representability is similarly 
defined for numeric functions (as opposed to relations). 

Now consider the predicate "Proof(x,y,z)", meaning "x is the Godel number of a proof X of a 
formula Y which has one free variable, Godel number y, and the integer z substituted for its 
free variable". This predicate corresponds to a rather long expression which includes 
several computable procedures reducible to formulae, including (1) given an integer, find 
the string of which it is the Godel number; (2) given a string, determine whether it is a 
formula (i.e., syntactically well-formed); and (3) given a sequence of formulae, determine 
whether it is a proof for the last formula in the sequence. 

Suppose that the Godel number y of a formula Y is substituted for its one free variable, 
resulting in the formula "Proof(x,y,y)", and construct an expression which denies the 
existence of a proof of this formula within formal arithmetic: ~$xProof(x,y,y) ("x is the Godel 
number of a proof X of a formula Y which has one free variable, Godel number y, and its 
own Godel number y substituted for its free variable"). This formula G, which already makes 
a statement about the "self-referential" formula Y, obviously has a Godel number g; to make 
the entire formula G "self-refer" like Y, we need merely write ~ $xProof(x,g,g) = G’, where G’ 
has Godel number g’ (G’ is a logical descendant of G whose Godel number is related to that 
of G in a distinctive way).

This leads to Godel’s theorem: ~$xProof(x,g,g) is true but unprovable in formal arithmetic. 
Metamathematical Proof: Suppose there is a proof P for ~$ xProof(x,g,g). If so, let its 
Godel number be p, so that Proof(p,g’,g’) is true. But this contradicts the content of the 
formula ~$xProof(x,y,y) represented by g, which is the ancestor of ~$xProof(x,g,g), an 
integral part of Godel’s theorem that inherits its characteristic arithmetical attribute. The 
contradiction is not merely formal; Proof(p,g’,g’) expresses an arithmetical relationship that 
is the negation of that expressed by ~$xProof(x,g,g) . Consequently, P cannot exist; it lacks 
(and in fact negates) the required arithmetical attribute. Form is out of sync with content; in 
the variable g’, P = Proof(p,g’,g’) contains its antithesis, ~$xProof(x,g,g). But this is just the 
content of the theorem to be proven. (Q.E.D.)

Summary and Explanation: Godel's Theorem and Representability in Arithmetic
Representability in Arithmetic
Representability:

A numeric relation 
𝑅
( 𝑥 1 , … , 𝑥 𝑛) R(x 1 ​ ,…,x n ​
 ) is representable in first-order Peano arithmetic ( 𝑁 N) if there is a formula 
𝐴 ( 𝑎 1 , … , 𝑎 𝑛) A(a 1 ​ ,…,a n ​) such that:
𝑅 ( 𝑘 1 , … , 𝑘 𝑛)    ⟹    ⊢ 𝑁 𝐴 ( 𝑘 1 , … , 𝑘 𝑛) R(k 1 ​ ,…,k n ​)⟹⊢ N ​ A(k 1 ​ ,…,k n ​) ¬ 𝑅 ( 𝑘 1 , … , 𝑘 𝑛)    ⟹    ⊢ 𝑁 ¬ 𝐴 ( 𝑘 1 , … , 𝑘 𝑛) ¬R(k 1 ​ ,…,k n ​)⟹⊢ N ​ ¬A(k 1 ​ ,…,k n
​
 )
Example: The "less than" relation 
𝑥 < 𝑦 x<y is representable because for any 𝑘 1 k 1 ​ and 𝑘 2 k 2 ​ , ⊢ 𝑁 𝑘 1 < 𝑘 2 ⊢ N ​ k 1 ​ <k 2 ​ holds if 𝑘 1 k 1 ​ is less than 𝑘 2 k 2 ​ , and ⊢ 𝑁 ¬ ( 𝑘 1 < 𝑘 2) ⊢ N ​ ¬(k 1 ​ <k 2 ​) holds otherwise.

Godel Numbering:

Godel assigned numbers to arithmetical and logical symbols, encoding formulas and proofs numerically.
The predicate "Proof(x, y, z)" means "x is the Godel number of a proof X of a formula Y (with Godel number y) where the integer z is substituted for its free variable".
Godel's Incompleteness Theorem
Constructing Self-Referential Formulas:

Consider the formula 
Proof ( 𝑥 , 𝑦 , 𝑦) Proof(x,y,y) and construct ¬ ∃ 𝑥 Proof ( 𝑥 , 𝑦 , 𝑦)
¬∃x Proof(x,y,y),
meaning "there is no proof x for the formula Y with Godel number y, with y substituted for its free variable".
Let 𝐺 G represent this formula, which has its own Godel number 𝑔 g.  To make 𝐺 G self-referential, write ¬ ∃ 𝑥 Proof ( 𝑥 , 𝑔 , 𝑔)
¬∃x Proof(x,g,g), denoted as 
𝐺 ′ G ′ , with Godel number 𝑔 ′ g ′ .
Godel's Theorem:

The formula ¬ ∃ 𝑥 Proof ( 𝑥 , 𝑔 , 𝑔) ¬∃xProof(x,g,g) (denoted 𝐺 ′ G ′) is true but unprovable within formal arithmetic.

Proof of Godel's Theorem:

Metamathematical Proof:
Suppose there is a proof 
𝑃 P for ¬ ∃ 𝑥 Proof ( 𝑥 , 𝑔 , 𝑔) ¬∃xProof(x,g,g) with Godel number 𝑝 p, so Proof ( 𝑝 , 𝑔 ′ , 𝑔 ′)
Proof(p,g ′ ,g ′) is true.  This contradicts ¬
∃ 𝑥 Proof ( 𝑥 , 𝑦 , 𝑦) ¬∃xProof(x,y,y) represented by 𝑔 g, the ancestor of ¬ ∃ 𝑥 Proof ( 𝑥 , 𝑔 , 𝑔) ¬∃xProof(x,g,g).
The contradiction arises because 
Proof ( 𝑝 , 𝑔 ′ , 𝑔 ′) Proof(p,g ′ ,g ′) asserts an arithmetical relationship opposite to ¬ ∃ 𝑥 Proof ( 𝑥 , 𝑔 , 𝑔) ¬∃xProof(x,g,g).  Therefore, 𝑃 P cannot exist, confirming the unprovability of ¬ ∃ 𝑥 Proof ( 𝑥 , 𝑔 , 𝑔) ¬∃xProof(x,g,g). (Q.E.D.)

Implications for Computational Complexity and Mathematics
Self-Reference and Paradoxes:

Godel's technique of representing logical syntax with numeric relationships demonstrates that self-reference can lead to true but unprovable statements.
This profound insight shows the inherent limitations of formal systems and challenges the notion of completeness in mathematics.
P=NP Problem:

Understanding Godel's Incompleteness Theorem helps in exploring the boundaries of formal systems and computational problems.
The methods of encoding and representability are foundational tools in analyzing complex problems in computational theory, such as the P=NP problem.
Godel's work underscores the deep connection between self-reference, formal systems, and the limits of mathematical provability, providing crucial insights into the nature of mathematical truth and computational complexity.

Notice that Godel utilizes the same levels of reference that we utilized in proving the 
theorem "This sentence is false" is false. The statement ~$xProof(x,g,g) corresponds to 
"This sentence is false"; the metastatement ~$xProof(x,g,g) is true but unprovable in formal 
arithmetic corresponds to "This sentence is false" is false; and the proof of each 
metastatement resides on a higher level still (the genius of Godel’s proof is the way in which 
all of these levels of "metamathematical" discourse, including formal arithmetic, are mapped 
into the number system, thus letting the number system serve as the logical metalanguage 
of its own arithmetical syntax). Godel’s proof is called metamathematical because it 
effectively refers to every part of mathematics incorporating the principle of transfinite 
induction. I.e., in proving that there exists a true but axiomatically unprovable theorem of 
arithmetic, it is proven that mathematics as a whole contains such theorems. This is just 
what David Hilbert and many other mathematicians had not wanted to hear. 

Concisely, Godel was able to show that if his formula ~$xProof(x,g,g) were provable, then 
its negation or "formal contradictory" would be provable as well; conversely, if the negation 
were provable, then so would be the formula. But any set of axioms from which both a 
formula and its negation can be derived is inconsistent. So if the axioms of formal arithmetic 
are consistent, then neither the formula nor its negation is demonstrable. In other words, 
mathematics – which includes formal arithmetic- cannot be both complete and consistent; if 
it is consistent, then it is necessarily incomplete (note that the converse is not implied; 
consistency does not necessarily follow from incompleteness). The technical name for this 
eternal tug-of-war between consistency and completeness is undecidability. As we have just 
seen, the predicate undecidable, as applied to individual formulae, is synonymous with "true 
but unprovable" within a given formal system, implying that the system in question is 
consistent but incomplete. 
In some respects, proving a theorem is like solving a problem. Indeed, the proof of a 
theorem is merely the "solution" of the "problem" of how to derive the theorem, and the 
rules of proof, i.e. of derivation from axioms, thus define a problem-solving procedure or 
"algorithm". Conversely, using an algorithm to find a solution Y for any problem X amounts 
to deriving a theorem stating that Y is a solution of X. Prior to Godel, it had been thought 
that all theorems were axiomatically provable, and thus that all problems were 
algorithmically soluble. But with Godel’s results came the realization that problems can to 
some extent be classified according to their "degree of solubility". Obviously, those 
problems whose solutions were not axiomatically (or algorithmically) derivable comprised a 
new and previously unknown class, that of undecidable problems in general. 
Loosely, a complexity class is a set of distinct but similar problems sharing the same worst- 
case requirements for computing a solution (at the time of Godel’s proof, there was no 
obvious way to express these requirements, and thus a shortage of distinct complexity 
classes).

In effect, Godel’s proof was a diagonalization taking all members of the complexity 
class of solvable or decidable problems, constructing an element differing from each of 
these members (~ $xProof(x,g,g)), and adjoining this element to the original class in order 
to create an extension thereof. By the nature of the construction of this element, it clearly 
belongs to a new and distinct complexity class…the one embodied by the extension. This 
gives rise to new kind of theorem, a separation theorem asserting the distinctness of two 
complexity classes, those of decidable and undecidable problems respectively. Since 
Godel’s day, many other separation theorems and related conjectures have been 
introduced. But to follow the action, we need to know how to formulate the computational 
requirements for solving problems.

Summary and Explanation: Godel's Incompleteness Theorem and Its Implications for Computational Complexity
Levels of Reference and Godel's Proof
Levels of Reference:

Godel's proof uses multiple levels of reference similar to the proof that "This sentence is false" is false.
The formula ¬ ∃ 𝑥 Proof ( 𝑥 , 𝑔 , 𝑔) ¬∃xProof(x,g,g) corresponds to the statement "This sentence is false".  The metastatement ¬
∃ 𝑥 Proof ( 𝑥 , 𝑔 , 𝑔) ¬∃xProof(x,g,g) is true but unprovable in formal arithmetic, corresponding to "This sentence is false" is false.
Godel's genius lies in mapping all levels of metamathematical discourse, including formal arithmetic, into the number system, making it the logical metalanguage of its own arithmetical syntax.
Metamathematical Nature:

Godel's proof is metamathematical because it applies to all of mathematics incorporating transfinite induction.
Proving there exists a true but axiomatically unprovable theorem of arithmetic implies that mathematics as a whole contains such theorems, a conclusion David Hilbert and others did not want.
Inconsistency and Incompleteness:

Godel showed that if 
¬ ∃ 𝑥 Proof ( 𝑥 , 𝑔 , 𝑔) ¬∃xProof(x,g,g) were provable, then its negation would also be provable, leading to inconsistency.
If formal arithmetic is consistent, then neither the formula nor its negation can be proven, making the system incomplete.
Thus, a consistent formal system cannot be complete, and this eternal conflict between consistency and completeness is known as undecidability.
Undecidability:

An undecidable formula is true but unprovable within a given formal system, indicating that the system is consistent but incomplete.
Implications for Computational Complexity
Theorem-Proving and Problem-Solving:

Proving a theorem is analogous to solving a problem; the proof is the solution derived from axioms using a problem-solving procedure or algorithm.
Before Godel, it was believed that all theorems were axiomatically provable, and all problems were algorithmically solvable.
Classification of Problems:

Godel's results led to the realization that problems could be classified by their degree of solvability.
Problems whose solutions are not axiomatically or algorithmically derivable are classified as undecidable problems.
Complexity Classes:

A complexity class is a set of problems sharing the same worst-case requirements for computing a solution.
Godel's proof was a diagonalization method that added an element ( ¬ ∃ 𝑥 Proof ( 𝑥 , 𝑔 , 𝑔) ¬∃x Proof(x,g,g) ) to the class of decidable problems, creating a new complexity class of undecidable problems.
This method gives rise to separation theorems, which assert the distinctness of complexity classes, such as those of decidable and undecidable problems.
Formulating Computational Requirements:

Understanding how to formulate computational requirements for solving problems is crucial for following developments in computational complexity.
Since Godel, many other separation theorems and related conjectures have emerged, expanding the landscape of computational complexity.

Conclusion
Godel's Incompleteness Theorem has profound implications for mathematics and computational complexity. It highlights the inherent limitations of formal systems, demonstrating that consistent systems cannot be complete. This realization leads to the classification of problems into complexity classes, distinguishing between decidable and undecidable problems. Godel's diagonalization method and the resulting separation theorems lay the foundation for understanding the computational requirements and complexity of solving various problems, a crucial aspect of modern computational theory.

Conveniently, modern logic affords a new level of analytical precision with respect to the 
Cartesian and Kantian dichotomies. Specifically, the branch of logic called model theory 
distinguishes theories from their universes, and considers the intervening semantic and 
interpretative mappings. Calling a theory an object language and its universe of discourse 
an object universe, it combines them in a metaobject domain consisting of the 
correspondences among their respective components and systems of components, and 
calls the theory or language in which this metaobject domain is analyzed a metalanguage. 
In like manner, the relationship between the metalanguage and the metaobject domain can 
be analyzed in a higher-level metalanguage, and so on. Because this situation can be 
recursively extended, level by level and metalanguage by metalanguage, in such a way that 
languages and their universes are conflated to an arbitrary degree, reality can with unlimited 
precision be characterized as a “metalinguistic metaobject”. 

In this setting, the philosophical dichotomies in question take on a distinctly mathematical 
hue. Because theories are abstract, subjectively-formed mental constructs23, the mental, 
subjective side of reality can now be associated with the object language and 
metalanguage(s), while the physical, objective side of reality can be associated with the 
object universe and metauniverse(s), i.e. the metaobject domain(s). It takes very little effort 
to see that the mental/subjective and physical/objective sides of reality are now combined in 
the metaobjects, and that Cartesian and Kantian “substance dualism” have now been 
transformed to “property dualism”24 or dual- aspect monism. That is, we are now talking, in 
mathematically precise terms, about a “universal substance” of which mind and matter, the 
abstract and the concrete, the cognitive-perceptual and the physical, are mere properties or 
aspects. 

Translating this into the scientific status quo is not difficult. Science regards causality as 
“objective”, taking its cues from observation while ignoring certain philosophical problems 
involving the nature of objectivity. But science also depends on theoretical reasoning, and 
this involves abstract analogues of causality to which science is equally indebted. To the 
extent that scientific theories accurately describe the universe, they are isomorphic to the 
universe; in order that nature be amenable to meaningful theorization, science must 
therefore assume that the basic cognitive ingredients of theories, and for that matter the 
perceptual ingredients of observations, mirror the corresponding ingredients of nature up to 
some minimal but assured level of isomorphism. Consistent theories of science thus require 
that physical and abstract causation be brought into basic correspondence as mandated by 
this necessity. 

Abstract analogues of physical causation are already well-understood. Logically, causality is 
analogous to implication, an active or passive relationship between antecedents and 
consequents; theoretically, it is analogous to the application of rules of inference to 
expressions formulated within a theory; linguistically, it amounts to substitution or production 
according to the rules of a generative grammar; and mathematically, it amounts to the 
application of a rule, mapping, function, operation or transformation. In every case, the 
analogue is some form of recursive25 or iterative morphism to which a nonlogical 
interpretation may be attached.26 The object is therefore to understand physical reality in 
terms of such operations defined on an appropriate form of dual-aspect monism. 
This leads directly to the structure problem.

Summary and Explanation: Model Theory and Dual-Aspect Monism in Analytical Philosophy
Modern Logic and Analytical Precision
Model Theory:

Model theory distinguishes between theories (object languages) and their universes (object universes).
It examines the semantic and interpretative mappings between these components in a metaobject domain.
The theory or language used to analyze the metaobject domain is called a metalanguage.
This relationship can be recursively extended, creating higher-level metalanguages, allowing for a precise characterization of reality as a "metalinguistic metaobject".
Philosophical Dichotomies:

The mental/subjective aspect of reality can be associated with the object language and metalanguages.
The physical/objective aspect of reality can be associated with the object universe and metauniverses (metaobject domains).
This transforms Cartesian and Kantian substance dualism into "property dualism" or dual-aspect monism, suggesting a universal substance with mind and matter as mere properties or aspects.
Scientific Perspective:

Science views causality as objective, based on observation, while theoretical reasoning involves abstract analogues of causality.
For scientific theories to accurately describe the universe, they must be isomorphic to it, implying that cognitive and perceptual elements mirror natural elements to some extent.
Consistent scientific theories require a correspondence between physical and abstract causation.
Abstract Analogues of Physical Causation
Understanding Causality:

Causality is analogous to implication in logic, an active or passive relationship between antecedents and consequents.
In theory, causality is like applying rules of inference to expressions.
Linguistically, it resembles substitution or production according to generative grammar rules.
Mathematically, it is similar to applying a rule, mapping, function, operation, or transformation.
Operations and Dual-Aspect Monism:

The goal is to understand physical reality through operations defined on dual-aspect monism.
These operations are recursive or iterative morphisms with nonlogical interpretations.
Conclusion
By utilizing model theory and recursive analysis, modern logic allows for precise examination of philosophical dichotomies. The transformation of substance dualism into property dualism or dual-aspect monism offers a unified view of mind and matter as properties of a universal substance. This perspective aligns with scientific principles, emphasizing the need for isomorphism between theories and the universe and highlighting the correspondence between physical and abstract causation. Understanding physical reality through recursive operations on dual-aspect monism addresses the structure problem, integrating abstract theoretical constructs with observable phenomena.

The Structure Problem 
A description or explanation of causality can only be formulated with respect to a particular 
“model universe” in which space, time and matter are defined and related to each other in 
such a way as to support the description. This relationship must account for the laws of 
nature and their role in natural processes. A little reflection should reveal that both neo- 
Darwinism and ID theory, as well as all other scientific theories, are currently deficient in this 
regard. At best, scientists have a very limited idea where the laws of nature reside, how 
they came to be, and how they work, and due to the limitations of their empirical 
methodology27, they have no means of clarification. 

We have already encountered Aristotle’s four modes of causation: material, efficient, formal 
and final. These follow no special prescription, but are merely generic answers to questions 
about certain features of Aristotle’s mental representation of nature…his model universe. 
There are as many additional modes of causation as there are meaningful questions 
regarding the structure and dynamics of a given model universe. For example, in addition to 
Aristotle’s questions of what, who and how, what and why, we could also ask where 
(positional causation), when (order or timing of causation), by virtue of what (facilitative 
causation), and so forth. Thus, we could say that something happened because it was 
positioned in a medium containing its material cause and supporting its efficient cause, 
because the time was right or certain prerequisites were in place, because certain 
conditions were present or certain tools were available, et cetera. 

On what kinds of model universe can a causality function be defined? Among the 
mathematical structures which science has long favored are coordinate spaces and 
differentiable manifolds. In differentiable coordinate spaces, laws of physics formulated as 
algebraic or differential equations may conveniently define smooth geometric curves which 
faithfully represent (e.g.) the trajectories of physical objects in motion. A model universe 
based on these constructs supports certain causal relationships to an impressive level of 
accuracy. However, it fails with respect to others, particularly those involving discrete or 
nonlocal28 changes or requiring high levels of coherence. In particular, it is incapable of 
modeling certain generative processes, including any generative process that might have 
led to its own existence, and beyond a certain point, its “continuity” attribute has eluded a 
completely satisfactory explanation.29 

These and other difficulties have prompted some theorists to suggest model universes 
based on other kinds of mathematical structure. These include a new class of models to 
which the concepts of information and computation are essential. Called “discrete models”, 
they depict reality in terms of bits, quanta, quantum events, computational operations and 
other discrete, recursively-related units. Whereas continuum models are based on the 
notion of a continuum, a unified extensible whole that can be subdivided in such a way that 
any two distinct points are separated by an infinite number of intermediate points, discrete 
models reflect the fact that it is impossible to describe or define a change or separation in 
any way that does not involve a sudden finite jump in some parameter. Discrete models 
reflect the rising investment of the physical sciences in a quantum-theoretic view of reality, 
and the increasing dependence of science on computer simulation as an experimental 
tool.30 

Discrete models have the advantage that they can more easily incorporate modern 
cybernetic concepts, including information, computation and feedback, which conduce to an 
understanding of reality as a control and communication system. In the context of such 
models, informational and computational reductionism is now pursued with a degree of 
enthusiasm formerly reserved for attempts to reduce the universe to matter and energy. 
However, certain difficulties persist. Discrete models remain dualistic, and they still cannot 
explain their own origins and existences. Nonlocality is still a problem for them, as are the 
general-relativistic spacetime deformations so easily formulated in continuum models. 
Because they allow the existence of discrete gaps between events, they tend to lack 
adequate connectivity. And in the shadow of these deficiencies, they can illuminate the 
interrelationship of space, time and object no more successfully than their continuum 
counterparts.

Summary and Explanation: The Structure Problem in Scientific Theories
The Challenge of Describing Causality
Model Universe:

Describing causality requires a specific "model universe" where space, time, and matter are defined and interrelated to support the description.
This model must account for the laws of nature and their role in natural processes.
Current scientific theories, including neo-Darwinism and Intelligent Design (ID), are limited in their understanding of the origins, residence, and operation of these laws.
Aristotle's Modes of Causation:

Aristotle identified four modes: material, efficient, formal, and final causes.
Additional modes can be defined based on meaningful questions about a model universe, such as positional, timing, and facilitative causation.
Mathematical Structures in Science
Coordinate Spaces and Differentiable Manifolds:

Traditionally, science uses coordinate spaces and differentiable manifolds to model causality.
These models define laws of physics through algebraic or differential equations, representing smooth geometric curves and physical trajectories.
However, these models struggle with discrete or nonlocal changes and high coherence levels, and cannot model generative processes that might lead to their own existence.
Discrete Models:

In response to these limitations, some theorists propose discrete models based on bits, quanta, quantum events, and computational operations.
Discrete models reflect a quantum-theoretic view of reality and the increasing use of computer simulations in science.
These models incorporate concepts of information, computation, and feedback, portraying reality as a control and communication system.
Advantages and Limitations of Discrete Models
Advantages:

Discrete models can incorporate modern cybernetic concepts.
They allow for informational and computational reductionism, providing a new way to understand reality beyond matter and energy.
Limitations:

Despite their advantages, discrete models still face issues:
They remain dualistic and cannot fully explain their own origins.
Nonlocality and general-relativistic spacetime deformations are challenging to model.
They tend to lack adequate connectivity due to the existence of discrete gaps between events.
They do not illuminate the interrelationship of space, time, and objects more effectively than continuum models.
Conclusion
The structure problem in scientific theories involves finding suitable model universes that can accurately describe causality and account for the laws of nature. Traditional models based on coordinate spaces and differentiable manifolds have limitations in handling discrete changes and generative processes. Discrete models, which use concepts from information theory and computation, offer new insights but also face significant challenges, such as explaining origins, dealing with nonlocality, and maintaining connectivity. Understanding these limitations is crucial for developing more comprehensive and accurate scientific theories.

However, this ploy does not always work. Due to the longstanding scientific trend toward 
physical reductionism, the buck often gets passed to physics, and because physics is 
widely considered more fundamental than any other scientific discipline, it has a hard time 
deferring explanatory debts mailed directly to its address. Some of the explanatory debts for 
which physics is holding the bag are labeled “causality”, and some of these bags were sent 
to the physics department from the evolutionary biology department. These debt-filled bags 
were sent because the evolutionary biology department lacked the explanatory resources to 
pay them for itself. Unfortunately, physics can’t pay them either. 

The reason that physics cannot pay explanatory debts generated by various causal 
hypotheses is that it does not itself possess an adequate understanding of causality. This is 
evident from the fact that in physics, events are assumed to be either deterministic or 
nondeterministic in origin. Given an object, event, set or process, it is usually assumed to 
have come about in one of just two possible ways: either it was brought about by something 
prior and external to it, or it sprang forth spontaneously as if by magic. The prevalence of 
this dichotomy, determinacy versus randomness, amounts to an unspoken scientific axiom 
asserting that everything in the universe is ultimately either a function of causes external to 
the determined entity (up to and including the universe itself), or no function of anything 
whatsoever. In the former case there is a known or unknown explanation, albeit external; in 
the latter case, there is no explanation at all. In neither case can the universe be regarded 
as causally self-contained. 

To a person unused to questioning this dichotomy, there may seem to be no middle ground. 
It may indeed seem that where events are not actively and connectively produced according 
to laws of nature, there is nothing to connect them, and thus that their distribution can only 
be random, patternless and meaningless. But there is another possibility after all: self- 
determinacy. Self-determinacy involves a higher-order generative process that yields not 
only the physical states of entities, but the entities themselves, the abstract laws that govern 
them, and the entire system which contains and coherently relates them. Self-determinism 
is the causal dynamic of any system that generates its own components and properties 
independently of prior laws or external structures. Because self-determinacy involves 
nothing of a preexisting or external nature, it is the only type of causal relationship suitable 
for a causally self-contained system. 

In a self- deterministic system, causal regression leads to a completely intrinsic self- 
generative process. In any system that is not ultimately self-deterministic, including any 
system that is either random or deterministic in the standard extrinsic sense, causal 
regression terminates at null causality or does not terminate. In either of the latter two 
cases, science can fully explain nothing; in the absence of a final cause, even material and 
efficient causes are subject to causal regression toward ever more basic (prior and 
embedding) substances and processes, or if random in origin, toward primitive acausality. 
So given that explanation is largely what science is all about, science would seem to have 
no choice but to treat the universe as a self-deterministic, causally self-contained system.34 
And thus do questions about evolution become questions about the self-generation of 
causally self-contained, self-emergent systems. In particular, how and why does such a system self-generate?

ChatGPT
Summary and Explanation: The Self-Determinacy in Understanding Causality
Explanatory Debts in Physics and Biology
Physical Reductionism:

There is a trend in science to reduce explanations to physics, seen as the most fundamental discipline.
Other fields, like evolutionary biology, pass explanatory debts to physics, but physics struggles to address these, especially concerning causality.
Causality in Physics:

Physics traditionally views events as either deterministic (caused by prior events) or nondeterministic (random).
This dichotomy implies that everything is either a function of external causes or random, leaving no room for a causally self-contained universe.
Introducing Self-Determinacy
Self-Determinacy:

Self-determinacy is a higher-order process where a system generates its components, properties, laws, and the entire system itself.
This concept suggests that a system can be causally self-contained, generating everything internally without external influences or preexisting laws.
Implications of Self-Determinacy:

In a self-deterministic system, causal regression leads to an intrinsic self-generative process.
In systems that are not self-deterministic, causal regression either leads to null causality or does not terminate, preventing complete scientific explanations.
Necessity of Self-Determinism in Science:

For science to fully explain the universe, it must treat the universe as a self-deterministic system.
This perspective frames evolution and other scientific phenomena as questions about the self-generation of causally self-contained, self-emergent systems.
Conclusion
To address the limitations of current scientific explanations regarding causality, the concept of self-determinacy is introduced. Unlike traditional views that rely on deterministic or random origins, self-determinacy suggests that systems can generate themselves and their properties internally. This approach resolves the problem of causal regression and provides a framework for understanding the universe as a causally self-contained system. Consequently, scientific inquiries, including those in evolutionary biology, must consider how and why such systems self-generate, fundamentally altering our approach to causality and explanation in science.

Synthesis: Some Essential Features of a Unifying Model of Nature and Causality 
Classical mechanics, inarguably one of the most successful theories in history, is often cited 
as a model of theoretical progress in the sciences. When certain problems arose that could 
not be solved within its conceptual framework, it was extended to create a metatheory in 
which it exists as a “limiting case”. In fact, this was done thrice in fairly rapid succession. 
The first extension created the Special Theory of Relativity, in which classical mechanics 
holds as a low-to-medium velocity limit. The second created the General Theory of 
Relativity, in the curved spacetime manifold of which the flat Minkowskian manifold of 
Special Relativity holds as a local limit. And the third created quantum mechanics, in which 
classical mechanics holds as a “decoherence limit”.51 Indeed, whenever a theory is 
extended by adjoining to it one or more new concepts, this creates a metatheory expressing 
the relationship between the adjoint concept(s) and the original theory. 

The model universe of neo-Darwinism is just a special-purpose refinement of the 
continuous coordinate spaces of classical mechanics, and its causal limitations are shared 
by neo-Darwinism and most other scientific theories. This is because most sciences, not 
including certain branches of physics and engineering, have been unable to absorb and 
utilize the relativistic and quantum extensions of the classical model, each of which suffers 
in any event from many of the same difficulties with causality. It follows that another 
extension is required, and since neo-Darwinism holds true within a limited causal domain, it 
must hold in this extension as a limiting case (minus its inessential philosophical baggage). 

In other words, causality must become the objective, distributive limit of metacausality. 
Such an extension has already been described52, and it embodies solutions for all of the 
problems discussed in this paper. Concisely, it embeds physical reality in an extended 
logico-algebraic structure, a Self-Configuring Self-Processing Language or SCSPL. SCSPL 
incorporates a pregeometric53 conspansive manifold in which the classical spacetime 
manifold is embedded as a limiting configuration. SCSPL brings formal and physical 
causality into seamless conjunction by generically equating the laws of nature with SCSPL 
syntax, and then contracting the semantic, model-theoretic correspondence between syntax 
and state (or laws and observables)54 so that they coincide in syntactic operators, physical 
quanta of self-transducing information.

Through properties called hology (syntactic self- similarity) and triality (space-time-object
conflation), total systemic self-containment is achieved. In particular, the system is
self-deterministically closed under causation. 

SCSPL evolves by telic recursion, a higher-order process55 of which causality is the physical 
limit (as required). In standard causality, physical states evolve according to laws of nature; 
in telic recursion, syntax-state relationships evolve by maximization of intrinsic utility. The 
temporal phase of telic recursion is conspansion, a dual-aspect process coordinating 
formal/telic and physical modes of evolution. By virtue of conspansive duality, SCSPL 
simultaneously evolves like a (metacausal, telic-recursive) generative grammar and a 
physical dynamical system, at once implementing top-down and bottom-up causation. 

Conspansion involves an alternation between self-replication and self-selection, thus 
constituting a generalization of Darwinian evolution in which specificational and replicational 
probabilistic resources are rationally linked. In this way, neo-Darwinist and design-theoretic 
(bottom-up and top-down) modes of causality become recognizable as complementary 
aspects of a single comprehensive evolutionary process.

Synthesis: Essential Features of a Unifying Model of Nature and Causality
Extensions in Theoretical Physics
Classical Mechanics and Its Extensions:
Special Theory of Relativity: Extends classical mechanics to high-velocity regimes.
General Theory of Relativity: Extends it to include curved spacetime.
Quantum Mechanics: Extends it to account for phenomena at the quantum level.
Each extension forms a metatheory where classical mechanics remains valid as a limiting case.
Neo-Darwinism and Causal Limitations
Current Model Universe:

Neo-Darwinism is based on the continuous coordinate spaces of classical mechanics.
Many sciences haven't fully incorporated the relativistic and quantum extensions.
Neo-Darwinism and other theories share causal limitations due to this reliance on classical mechanics.
Need for Another Extension:

To address these limitations, a new extension must incorporate and transcend classical, relativistic, and quantum mechanics.
This extension must treat causality as the distributive limit of metacausality.
Self-Configuring Self-Processing Language (SCSPL)
SCSPL Model:

Logico-Algebraic Structure: Embeds physical reality in an extended structure.
Pregeometric Conspansive Manifold: Classical spacetime is a limiting configuration within this manifold.
Formal and Physical Causality: Seamlessly unified by equating the laws of nature with SCSPL syntax.
Properties and Processes:

Hology: Syntactic self-similarity.
Triality: Conflation of space, time, and objects.
Telic Recursion: Higher-order process driving the evolution of the system, with causality as its physical limit.
Conspansion: Dual-aspect process that coordinates formal/telic and physical modes of evolution.
Evolutionary Dynamics:

Self-Replication and Self-Selection: Alternation between these processes generalizes Darwinian evolution.
Intrinsic Utility Maximization: Evolution driven by maximizing utility.
Top-Down and Bottom-Up Causation: Integrated within the SCSPL framework, blending neo-Darwinist and design-theoretic modes of causality.
Conclusion
The unifying model proposed is the Self-Configuring Self-Processing Language (SCSPL), which addresses the limitations of existing scientific theories by embedding physical reality within a logico-algebraic structure. This model unifies formal and physical causality, evolving through telic recursion and conspansion, and incorporates both top-down and bottom-up causation. The SCSPL framework thus offers a comprehensive solution that integrates classical, relativistic, and quantum mechanics, providing a cohesive understanding of causality and evolution that transcends the limitations of current scientific paradigms.

User
From a formal standpoint, SCSPL has several unique and interesting features. Being based 
on logic,56 it identifies itself with the logical syntax of its perceptual universe on grounds of 
logical-perceptual isomorphism. This eliminates the conventional model-theoretic distinction 
among theory, universe and theory-universe correspondence, contracting the problematic 
mapping between abstract and concrete reality on the syntactic (nomological) level. This 
brings the physical world into coincidence with its logical counterpart, effecting dual-aspect 
monism and putting logical attributes on the same explanatory footing as physical attributes. 
SCSPL thus adjoins logic to nature, injecting57 nature with the abstract logical infrastructure 
of perception and theorization and endowing physical reality with the remedial conceptual 
apparatus demanded by the problems, paradoxes and explanatory deficiencies straining its 
classical descriptions. At the same time, it adjoins nature to logic in the form of perceptual 
categories and necessary high-level properties including closure, comprehensiveness, 
consistency and teleo-nomological coherence, thus opening logical routes to physical 
insight. 

SCSPL offers yet further advantages. In defining nature to include logic and cognition, it 
relates physics and mathematics on a basic level, thus merging the rational foundations of 
mathematics with the perceptual foundations of physics and letting each provide crucial 
support for the other. By affording an integrated conceptual framework for prior conflicting 
extensions of classical reality, it sets the stage for their ultimate reconciliation. And its cross- 
interpretation of the cognitive and physical aspects of nature renders the universe self- 
explaining and self-modeling, thus effecting self-containment on the theoretic and model- 
theoretic levels. That is, SCSPL self-containment effects not just causal and generative 
closure, but closure under the inverse operations of explanation and interpretation, thus 
permitting nature to physically model and teleo-nomologically justify its own self- 
configurative determinations. In SCSPL, natural laws and physical states are seen as 
expressions of the intrinsic utility of nature by and for nature. 

The reflexive self-processing and (telic) self-configuration functions of SCSPL imply that 
nature possesses generalized functional analogues of human self-awareness and volition, 
and thus a generalized capacity for utilitarian self-design. The self-design and self- 
modeling capacity of nature suggests that the universe is a kind of stratified “self-simulation” 
in which the physical and logico-telic aspects of reality can be regarded as respectively 
“simulated” and “simulative” in a generalized quantum-computational sense. This makes 
SCSPL relevant to self-organization, emergence and other complexity-theoretic phenomena 
increasingly attractive to the proponents of neo-Darwinism and other causally-challenged 
theories. At the same time, the fact that SCSPL evolution is both nomologically coherent 
and subject to a rational intrinsic utility criterion implies that the universe possesses 
properties equivalent to generalized intelligence, suggesting the possibility of an integrated 
SCSPL approach to the problems of consciousness and evolution. 

The overall theory which logically extends the concepts of nature and causality to SCSPL 
and telic recursion, thereby merging the perceptual manifold with its cognitive and telic 
infrastructure, is known as the Cognitive-Theoretic Model of the Universe or CTMU, and its 
approach to biological origins and evolution is called Teleologic Evolution.58 Based on the 
concept of telic-recursive metacausation, Teleologic Evolution is a dynamic interplay of 
replication and selection through which the universe creates itself and the life it contains. 
Teleologic Evolution is a stratified process which occurs on levels respectively associated 
with the evolution of the cosmos and the evolution of life, thus permitting organic evolution 
to mirror that of the universe in which it occurs. It improves on traditional approaches to 
teleology by extending the concept of nature in a way eliminating any need for 
"supernatural" intervention, and it improves on neo-Darwinism by addressing the full extent 
of nature and its causal dynamics.

Features of SCSPL (Self-Configuring Self-Processing Language)
Logical-Perceptual Isomorphism:

SCSPL aligns the logical syntax of its perceptual universe, eliminating the distinction between theory, universe, and their correspondence.
This alignment contracts the problematic mapping between abstract and concrete reality, making physical and logical attributes equally explanatory.
Integration of Logic and Nature:

By injecting nature with logical infrastructure, SCSPL addresses the problems, paradoxes, and deficiencies of classical descriptions.
Nature is endowed with perceptual categories and high-level properties like closure, comprehensiveness, consistency, and teleo-nomological coherence.
This integration opens logical routes to physical insight.
Relating Physics and Mathematics:

SCSPL merges the rational foundations of mathematics with the perceptual foundations of physics, allowing mutual support.
It provides an integrated framework for reconciling conflicting extensions of classical reality.
Self-Containment:

SCSPL renders the universe self-explaining and self-modeling, achieving closure under explanation and interpretation.
Natural laws and physical states are expressions of nature's intrinsic utility.
Functional Analogues of Self-Awareness and Volition:

SCSPL implies nature has generalized self-awareness and volition, enabling utilitarian self-design.
The universe can be seen as a self-simulation where physical aspects are simulated and logical-telic aspects are simulative.
Implications for Theories of Evolution and Consciousness
Relevance to Complexity-Theoretic Phenomena:

SCSPL's relevance extends to self-organization, emergence, and other complexity-theoretic phenomena, addressing the gaps in neo-Darwinism.
The universe possesses properties equivalent to generalized intelligence, suggesting a unified approach to consciousness and evolution.
CTMU (Cognitive-Theoretic Model of the Universe):

CTMU extends nature and causality concepts to SCSPL and telic recursion, merging perceptual and cognitive-telic infrastructures.
This model views the universe as a stratified self-simulation with cognitive and physical aspects.
Teleologic Evolution:

Teleologic Evolution is the dynamic interplay of replication and selection, through which the universe and life create themselves.
This approach mirrors the evolution of the cosmos and the evolution of life, addressing the full extent of nature's causal dynamics without requiring supernatural intervention.
Conclusion
The Cognitive-Theoretic Model of the Universe (CTMU) and its approach, Teleologic Evolution, present a comprehensive framework for understanding the universe and its processes. By integrating logic and nature through SCSPL, CTMU provides a unified explanation for physical reality, consciousness, and evolution. This model addresses the limitations of classical, relativistic, and quantum theories, offering a coherent and self-contained system that extends beyond traditional scientific paradigms.

Due to their implicit reliance on different notions of causality, teleology and evolution were 
once considered mutually exclusory. While teleology appears to require a looping kind of 
causality consistent with the idea that ends are immanent in nature (even in beginnings), 
evolution seems to require that mutation and natural selection exhibit some combination of 
nondeterminacy and linear determinacy. In contrast, the phrase Teleologic Evolution 
reflects their complementarity within a coherent self-configurative ensemble identifying 
nature with its own utilitarian self-actualization imperative. In the associated metacausal 
extension of physical reality, the two central processes of evolution, replication and 
selection, are seen to occur on at least two mutually-facilitative levels respectively 
associated with the evolution of the universe and that of organic life.59 Meanwhile, the 
intrinsic utility criterion of self-selection implies that nature, as rationally defined in the 
CTMU, possesses a generalized form of intelligence by which all levels of evolution are 
driven and directed, equating selection with specification and metacausally relating it to 
replication.60 Reality is united with its generative principle by the rational linkage between 
the domain and codomain of the teleological, meta-Darwinian level of natural selection. 

Because nature consists of all that is logically relevant to perception, and logic consists of 
the rules of thought and therefore comprises an essential theory of cognition, the CTMU 
couples mind and nature in a way suggestive of Ouroboros divided and reunited…two 
intimately entwined constrictors, estranged centuries ago by mind-body dualism but now 
locked in a renewed embrace, each swallowing the other’s entailments. Perhaps this 
reunion will deter the militant torch-bearers of scientific naturalism from further reneging on 
their explanatory debts and fleecing mankind of its millennial hopes and dreams after all. 
And if so, then perhaps mankind can snuff the rapidly dwindling fuse of its insidious 
ontological identity crisis while these hopes and dreams still have a fighting chance of 
realization, and the intrinsic utility of mankind is still salvageable. 

1 ”Meaning” entails recognition, referring specifically to a recognizable and therefore 
informational relationship among related entities. Since information is abstract, so is 
recognition, and so is meaning (whether or not the related entities are themselves physical 
and concrete). Naturalism, of which the theory of evolution is an example, is an essentially 
materialistic viewpoint which denies or disregards abstract modes of existence, thus limiting 
meaning to “material” drives and instincts. But where the abstract contains the physical, 
capturing its structure in the form of meaningful informational patterns called “laws of 
nature”, abstraction and meaning are plainly essential to both science and nature.

3 Science is a two-step, two-level process concerned with (1) formulating hypotheses 
about nature, and (2) proving or disproving these hypotheses to some degree of 
confirmation. Relative to level 1, level 2 requires a higher level of discourse incorporating 
truth-functional criteria independent of any particular falsifiable hypothesis. Because 
maintaining this distinction helps to insure that false hypotheses do not figure in their own 
“validation”, purportedly falsifiable (level 1) theories like neo-Darwinism should not be 
confused with the confirmational level of science.

Meaning and Naturalism
Recognition and Meaning:

Meaning involves recognition and informational relationships among entities.
Information and recognition are abstract, making meaning abstract as well.
Naturalism limits meaning to material aspects, ignoring abstraction.
Abstract and Physical:

The abstract contains the physical, capturing its structure as laws of nature.
Abstraction and meaning are essential to both science and nature.
Science as a Two-Level Process
Hypothesis Formulation and Testing:
Science involves formulating hypotheses (level 1) and testing them (level 2).
The second level requires independent truth-functional criteria.
This distinction ensures that false hypotheses do not validate themselves.

Conclusion
The Cognitive-Theoretic Model of the Universe (CTMU) and its concept of Teleologic Evolution offer a framework that reconciles teleology and evolution, viewing them as complementary aspects of a self-configurative system. By integrating logic and nature, the CTMU addresses both abstract and physical aspects of reality, providing a unified explanation for evolution, consciousness, and the structure of the universe. This approach suggests that nature is driven by a generalized form of intelligence, uniting the perceptual and cognitive realms and potentially resolving longstanding philosophical and scientific dilemmas.

Could I get some analogies and metaphors to explain these ideas?

ChatGPT
Certainly! Here are some analogies and metaphors to help explain the ideas from Christopher Michael Langan's "Self-Reference and Computational Complexity":

Teleologic Evolution and Complementarity
Teleology and Evolution:
Analogy: Think of a garden that grows flowers (teleology) versus a garden that evolves naturally with wildflowers (evolution). Teleology involves planting seeds with the end goal of blooming flowers in mind, whereas evolution involves random seeds falling and growing based on environmental factors. Teleologic Evolution is like a gardener who plants seeds and also lets wildflowers grow, understanding that both contribute to the beauty of the garden.
Generalized Intelligence:

Metaphor: Imagine a chef who not only follows recipes (rules and determinism) but also experiments with new ingredients and techniques (creativity and randomness). This chef’s kitchen represents nature, where the fusion of strict recipes and creative experimentation leads to delicious and innovative dishes. This reflects the universe’s ability to evolve through both predetermined rules and creative, self-generative processes.
The Cognitive-Theoretic Model of the Universe (CTMU)

Logical and Perceptual Integration:
Metaphor: Picture a puzzle where each piece represents a concept of nature or logic. Traditional science sees the pieces separately. CTMU, however, assembles these pieces into a coherent picture, showing that they all fit together to reveal a comprehensive image of the universe.
Mind-Body Dualism Reunification:

Analogy: Consider a dancer and the dance. Traditionally, the dancer (mind) and the dance (body) are viewed separately. The CTMU sees them as inseparable; the dance is a direct expression of the dancer. Similarly, mind and nature are intertwined, each influencing and reflecting the other.

The Role of Meaning in Naturalism
Abstract Recognition:

Analogy: Think of a book filled with words (abstract) that describe a forest (physical). The book’s text captures the essence and structure of the forest, even though it is made of paper and ink. Similarly, abstract information and meaning encapsulate the physical world’s structure and laws.
Science as a Two-Level Process

Hypothesis and Testing:
Metaphor: Imagine building a house (hypothesis formulation). The first step is designing blueprints (level 1). The second step is constructing the house based on these blueprints and ensuring it stands firm (level 2). Just as a sturdy house validates its blueprints, scientific hypotheses must withstand rigorous testing to be confirmed.
SCSPL (Self-Configuring Self-Processing Language) Features
Logical-Perceptual Isomorphism:

Analogy: Consider a map that perfectly matches the territory it represents. SCSPL aligns the logical structure of the universe with our perception of it, just as a map mirrors the physical features of a landscape.
Nature and Logic Integration:

Metaphor: Imagine a software program (nature) and its code (logic). SCSPL integrates them so seamlessly that the program can modify its own code to improve and adapt. This self-modifying program represents the universe embedding logical structures within its physical reality.
Mathematics and Physics Relation:

Analogy: Think of music theory (mathematics) and the actual performance of music (physics). SCSPL unites them, showing that understanding the theory enhances the performance and vice versa.
Self-Containment:

Metaphor: Picture a library that not only stores books but also writes and updates them based on new information. This self-contained library represents the universe, which explains and evolves itself through intrinsic processes.
Functional Analogues:

Analogy: Imagine a robot designed to repair and upgrade itself. This robot represents the universe, possessing self-awareness and the capability to evolve and adapt without external intervention.

How does CTMU relate to my theory, Relativistic Scalar Vector Theory? 𝘙𝘦𝘭𝘢𝘵𝘪𝘷𝘪𝘴𝘵𝘪𝘤 𝘚𝘤𝘢𝘭𝘢𝘳 𝘝𝘦𝘤𝘵𝘰𝘳 𝘗𝘭𝘦𝘯𝘶𝘮 𝘛𝘩𝘦𝘰𝘳𝘺

— Ok you're right that does sound like a massive undertaking. I wonder how this theory ties into my other ideas?

Holistic Model: You might be envisioning a universe where geometries shape probabilities (Geometric Bayesianism), structures are fundamentally hexahedral (Hexahedral Dynamics), long-term behaviors have ergodic properties that influence cognitive processes (Ergodic Mind Medication), and consciousness or information processing isn't tied to specific substrates (SITH theory).

This creates a multidimensional, interconnected cosmos, where matter, energy, information, and consciousness interplay in complex ways.

— Write another introduction to Relativistic Scalar Vector Plenum theory.

Introduction to Relativistic Scalar Vector Plenum (RSVP) Theory

The cosmos, with its vast stretches of darkness punctuated by brilliant luminous bodies, has always posed questions that challenge the very essence of our understanding.

Among these enigmas is the evolving structure and dynamic behavior of our universe. While conventional theories suggest an expanding universe, the Relativistic Scalar Vector Plenum (RSVP) theory offers a different perspective, proposing that the universe itself remains static in size.

Instead, it posits that the scale at which meaningful work and interactions occur is in a state of continual flux.

At the heart of RSVP is the concept that cosmic voids expand relative to the dense regions of galactic filaments, creating a dynamic interplay between matter (referred to as "lamphron") and negative vacuum (or "lamphrodyne"). This interplay is crucial during the formation of the inflaton field.

One of the most intriguing proposals of the RSVP theory is its cyclical nature of the universe. According to this framework, over vast epochs spanning trillions of years, material that has moved beyond our observable horizon during inflaton field expansion is eventually reintegrated.

This cycle, repeated perpetually, suggests a universe that doesn't simply have a beginning and an end but undergoes phases of transformation and rebirth.

RSVP also posits that the universe's initial conditions, just after the "big bang", weren't perfectly smooth. Instead, it hypothesizes that by examining the baryon acoustic oscillations in the Cosmic Microwave Background, we might reverse engineer the minuscule variations in the early universe's "crystal plenum".

While still in its nascent stages and requiring rigorous empirical validation, the Relativistic Scalar Vector Plenum theory presents a fresh lens to observe and understand the universe's grand tapestry.

Summary of "Why Does Anything Exist?" Article
The article explores why anything exists instead of nothing, proposing that attempts to define "nothingness" inherently involve something, as specifying any state requires information. Quantum mechanics suggests reality may consist of a superposition of states, implying the total information content of reality could be zero. This idea is likened to a "quantum Library of Babel," where the complexity of reality arises from an underlying zero-information ontology. The article also touches on the implications for consciousness and the nature of reality.

For more details, you can read the full article here.

Relating CTMU and RSVP to the Article's Concepts

Quantum Library of Babel: Envision a library that contains every possible book, but where selecting any book affects the entire library's structure, representing the interconnected and superpositional nature of reality.
User
What does it mean to say that the information content of reality may turn out to be zero? Informally, perhaps consider the (classical) Library of Babel. (cf. The Library of Babel) The Library of Babel contains all possible books with all possible words and letters in all possible combinations. The Library of Babel has zero information content. Yet somewhere amid the nonsense lies the complete works of Shakespeare – and you and me. However, the Library of Babel is classical. Withdrawing a book from the Library of Babel yields a single definite classical outcome – thereby creating information. Withdrawing more books creates more information. If we sum two ordinary non-zero probabilities, then we always get a bigger probability. All analogies break down somewhere. Evidently we aren’t literally living in Borges’ Library of Babel.

So instead of the classical Library of Babel, let us tighten the analogy. Imagine the quantum Library of Babel. Just as in standard probability theory, if there are two ways in QM that something can happen, then we get the total amplitude for something by summing the amplitudes for each of the two ways. If we sum two ordinary non-zero probabilities, then we always get a bigger probability. Yet because amplitudes in QM are complex numbers, summing two amplitudes can yield zero. Having two ways to do something in quantum mechanics can make it not happen. Recall again the double-slit experiment. Adding a slit to the apparatus can make particles less likely to arrive somewhere despite there being more ways to get there. Now scale up the double-slit experiment to the whole of reality. The information content of the universal state vector is zero. (cf. Jan-Markus Schwindt, “Nothing happens in the Universe of the Everett Interpretation“).

The quantum Library of Babel has no information

ChatGPT
Understanding Zero Information Content in Reality
Library of Babel Analogy:

Classical Library of Babel: Contains all possible books, each combination of words and letters, resulting in zero information content due to its exhaustive nature. Selecting a book creates information.
Quantum Library of Babel:

Quantum Mechanics (QM): Unlike classical probability, QM uses complex numbers for amplitudes, which can sum to zero, implying no information content.
Double-Slit Experiment: Demonstrates that adding possibilities can cancel out, leading to zero net probability in certain scenarios.
Relating to CTMU and RSVP
CTMU:

Logical and Physical Integration: The idea that reality's information content is zero aligns with CTMU's self-configuring universe, where logical structures inherently balance and self-sustain.
RSVP:

Dynamic Cycles: The cyclical nature of RSVP fits with the concept of zero information content, suggesting a universe that perpetually renews and balances itself, maintaining a stable yet dynamic state.
Metaphor:

Self-Knitting Yarnball: Represents a universe that continuously knits itself from within, maintaining overall zero information content by balancing creation and cancellation of patterns.
Conclusion:

The quantum Library of Babel and the zero information content perspective suggest a universe where complexity arises from balanced internal dynamics, aligning with the self-contained, self-generative principles in CTMU and RSVP.

Connection with  following:
Topological Geometrodynamics (TGD): We discussed Matti Pitkanen's theory, TGD, which posits that physical space-times are 4-dimensional surfaces in a higher-dimensional space. This theory seeks to provide a unified description of fundamental interactions, distinct from traditional theories like GUTs and superstring models. TGD offers a novel understanding of energy, quantum numbers, and fundamental physical processes through a geometric and topological lens.

Geometric Bayesianism: We delved into the concept of Geometric Bayesianism, inspired by an article on Bayesian Geometry by Michael Larionov. This approach visualizes Bayesian inference using geometric constructs, treating probability distributions as vectors in a Hilbert space and employing geometric tools like inner products to understand statistical relationships. This framework not only enriches the traditional Bayesian approach but also makes statistical concepts more accessible through visualization.

Cognitive Theories: The idea that emotions might be understood as topological phenomena was mentioned, drawing on Joscha Bach's hypothesis about emotions being a topological substrate for symbolic calculations. This suggests a potential interdisciplinary bridge connecting cognitive science with geometric and topological theories.
