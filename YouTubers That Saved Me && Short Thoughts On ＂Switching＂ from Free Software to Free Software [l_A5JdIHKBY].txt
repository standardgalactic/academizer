hello everybody sorry I've been away for so long my last final just ended
moments ago I turned it in just a few minutes ago well I guess actually it's
844 now I turned it in 8 so it's been a little while trying to calm down since
then trying to get more content out that's the you know you guys know the
whole story can't do content wine wine wine blah blah blah but I wanted to say
a couple of things today about switching between free software products
and I just want to say that really quickly and then I'll go on to the
second topic which is just gonna be youtubers I really like it I've been
watching during this semester that I enjoy also I'm about to sniff I
apologize for my disgusting human noises I'm having allergies really badly and
the pollen here is really bad so I apologize in advance I'll try to edit
all that out as best I can so I recently installed open bsd on my one of
my main machines this is not that one this one is still a have neofetch on
here I do this one's still Cali as always on my other one though I installed
open bsd and I was talking to someone about installing open bsd and they
said oh why did you switch and I thought that's a really stupid way of thinking
of things because when we're talking about free software switching is switching
should not be a binary operation you should just change what you're using
at the current moment so when I think of switching I think of those old Mac and
PC commercials where John Hodgman and Guy from accepted are talking about well
here's why you should use my product over my product oh but my Mac is better
for this reason it's kind of you know embarrassing at this point like back
then it made a lot of sense because they were really competitive but now there's
so many other options it's kind of like whatever people argue about whether you
should use Arch versus Debian it's just like a it's not a realistic there's no
there's not a switch it's not like an actual binary switch like when Apple
tries to do it they try to get you sucked in to their Apple ecosystem so when
they say switch from Windows what they mean is by only Apple slash alphabet
products going forward meaning an iPhone and a Mac an iMac a weird TV thing they
do I don't know what that's called they have pencils now that's what they mean
in the context of free software I think what we should just mean is using at the
current moment because these things aren't in competition that's the entire
design the design is meant to be free and freely usable at any time you want
it's not like a financial investment thankfully to switch and air quotes
between a Linux and or BSD system however I am I have installed a BSD system my
next video will be on BSD I installed open BSD 6.9 which so far seems to be
just fine but I installed it on a much more resource constrained machine so I
I think I'll be using FF M peg which actually that's relates to what I'm
about to talk about instead of OBS to record my screen and my audio we'll
talk about that in a second so I wanted to say like I said I've been busy I've
been doing a lot of work a lot of school it's over now I'm in the summertime so I
will hopefully be able to make more content but I wanted to share some of
the videos or the channels of people who I've watched during this time and these
people they're not going to care they're not going to care at all I'm hoping that
at least one person on my channel I don't have very many subscribers but I'm
hoping at least one person will not know of these people all three of them or four
of them I don't remember actually the number we'll see in a second and get
something out of it these people all have way more subscribers than me there's
probably a lot of overlap in fact probably total overlap but let's do it
anyway who cares so there's this YouTube channel called old tech bloke now
this guy is a I'm doing these in order of reverse precedence by the way you can
see the spoilers up there in the headers sorry I didn't think to hide that I'm
doing these in a reverse order of precedence you should watch these
channels in these orders if you hang out on the Linux side of YouTube and what I
mean by that is old tech bloke is a great example so old tech bloke fantastic
channel he's basically he does everything distro tube does however in my
opinion he oftentimes is more entertaining and has a bit more perspective
on things from a technological point of view I'm not trying to downgrade or
dis distro tube at all distro tubes a fantastic channel in fact he's the only
reason I have over a hundred subscribers thanks to that one call out he
gave me which I deeply appreciate but this guy only recently in the past year
has blown up before this he was kind of a nobody and I said I don't mean that a
rude way either gosh I'm just coming across as rude he just didn't have very
many subscribers but he does a lot of window manager videos a lot of
distribution Linux distribution videos as you can see here I'm if you're just
listening I'm just scrolling through his videos at this moment and there's videos
right now I've just stopped on stepping into the void which is talking about
installing void Linux talking about how to install arch who are Linux users a
bunch of DDE I don't know what that is I haven't seen that video what is a bunch
of DDE well whatever doesn't make a difference first BSD installation oh I'm
about to do that now there we go okay so he does videos like this very distro
tube like but I think he's been around longer and doesn't have as many
subscribers for a reason that is completely unknown to me so second if
you've seen my channel you've almost certainly seen Brody Robertson's channel
Brody Robertson's channel is fine it's okay I'm not a big fan and I don't mean
that in any way other than this he has another channel called tech over T which
I find vastly superior to his main channel and for some reason it only has
569 subscribers as of the time of this viewing I listen to this all the time he
puts up clips to eventually he'll become a professional Joe Rogan style
youtuber and have a separate clips channel but if you just go to watch the
full videos in particular I'm not trying to say anything bad against Brody but in
particular the ones that aren't him doing something solo you see there's a
couple of solo episodes here the ones where he at the we as a guest they are
very interesting he comes with a list of topics and he that he wants to discuss
but he also allows for much free-form conversation a whole lot of free-form
conversation which results in a lot of interesting conversation and he has
people who are technologically invested interested in tech etc other Linux
youtubers on his channel as well again for those of you just listening I'm
scrolling through right now we have a video called life of a full-time indie
dev featuring Tim Krief or Christ I'm not sure how you say that gaming and
online nonsense library odyssey in the circus of course that's library odyssey
the video platform you know videos like this where he's interviewing people who
either work with these things or on these things and it's again not trying to
trash talk him in any way whatsoever but I think this grossly under subscribed
channel is way better than his actual channel where he does reviews on tech
like things or you know goes on about tech like things
brian clef one of my favorite channels of all time I've actually done videos that
were just the actual terminal work oh sorry I'm on the wrong tab here the
actual terminal work of his of these videos so brian clef is a gentleman
from Arizona who he uploads a like every time someone posts something he
uploads a how do I say this they have like a linux users meetup in
arizona in phoenix in particular and every time he thinks to do it he records
these and uploads them the quality is rather high in my opinion I won't play
one now but it's rather high and it's on topics that people who watch my channel
who care about this side of youtube will care about so I'll read a couple of the
topics now intro to the new ice cat intro to secure computing introduction
introduction to wi-fi hacking hiding from the internet technical debts and
digital assets and uh introduction to shodans actually one that took off that
one got quite a few views it's not normal it's more likely he has fewer than a
thousand views for some reason I can't figure out uh intro to cryptography
parts one and two uh introduction to defensive database the point is this is
a linux users group that is uh seemingly focused on uh cybersecurity and defensive
cyber oh here's a video on the fish at the fish show I haven't seen that's from
five years ago so he's been doing this for a while as well
but everything he uploads is incredibly interesting it's a um
well I should mention this now I'm looking at this and I see that you can see
which videos I've watched versus which ones I haven't I have another couple
youtube accounts for different reasons so uh if it looks like I'm just talking
about this youtube channel even though I've only watched a few videos on it
that's not true I promise I haven't watched the fish video though though I
should it's only 16 minutes anyway these are all the format for this is talks
done by speakers who aren't brian clef in fact brian clef I don't think has ever
presented on this channel I haven't seen any of his videos now we're getting
back into the time we're having watched anything there we go uh anyway
interesting channel well worth checking out a lot of great information and these
are like as best I can tell people who are professionals and they just are
kind of doing this for free to letting brian upload them record them and
upload their content for free
and finally there is bugs writer who is my favorite youtuber he has 2.45
thousand subscribers for reasons that will never be known to me
this guy is I love his content it is it's the same kind of stuff that if
you're on this side of youtube you've seen it
you've enjoyed it it's stuff about actually that's what I mentioned before
earlier I want to record with ffmpeg and he has a great video on doing
screen and audio recordings with ffmpeg which I loved and I'm gonna
basically just copy that to get the next video I don't open bsd
so for those of you listening there's some videos we're scrolling past
keeping my friends happy with linux let's create a software manager for unix
how to find commands you wrote in the past like a pro
uh virgin youtube website versus chat bash command
that's actually his first oh I didn't even realize this I haven't scrolled
all the way back on his channel he only started four months ago so
this guy only started four months ago and he's just totally embarrassing me
with his subscriber count so that tells you what I need to do which is
up my production value up my content quality
and up my upload increments or rather decreasing well would that be
doesn't matter you know what I mean upload more frequently
I watched this tuxi video excellent excellent excellent stuff tuxi the first
one and the second one great stuff uh check it out
really good well anyway that's all I had to say
I uh like I mentioned before I've been busy hopefully it's a little bit
easier now but um wanted to call out some youtubers who have
kept me sane over this quarantine and over this semester
and uh you'll see more content from me soon
thanks
