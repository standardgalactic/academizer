It's just interesting because it is the second paper like this this week. LK-99 (from Lee���Kim���1999[2]) is a potential room-temperature superconductor with a gray���black appearance.[3]:���8��� It has a hexagonal structure slightly modified from lead���apatite, by introducing small amounts of copper. The material was first discovered and manufactured by a team of researchers including Sukbae Lee (���������) and Ji-Hoon Kim (���������) from Korea University.[3]:���1��� The team claims it functions as a superconductor at ambient pressure and below 400 K (127 ��C; 260 ��F).[4][3]:���1���

As of 3 August 2023, the synthesis of LK-99 and observation of its superconductivity at any temperature have not been peer-reviewed or independently replicated.[5] The announcement was widely shared and the reaction by the scientific world was mainly skeptical due to the extraordinary nature of the claims,[6] the repeated failure of previous claims of room-temperature superconductors, and errors and inconsistencies in the pre-published papers. Independent teams are attempting to replicate the South Korean team's work, with results expected in August 2023 owing to the straightforward method of producing the material.[6]

It's certainly a fascinating time in the field of superconductivity. The two recent discoveries, Pb10���xCux(PO4)6O and LK-99, both claiming room-temperature superconductivity, have undoubtedly sparked excitement and interest in the scientific community.
However, as you've noted, skepticism is natural, especially given the history of claims around room-temperature superconductors and the extraordinary nature of these findings. The lack of peer-review or independent replication for LK-99 further adds to the uncertainty.
The upcoming independent verification attempts are crucial. If these findings are confirmed, it could revolutionize energy transmission and storage. But until then, caution and rigorous scientific scrutiny will be necessary. The next few months could be a pivotal period in the field of superconductivity, and the scientific community will be watching closely.

It seems that claims like this have been made for years: First Room-Temperature Superconductor Excites and Baffles Scientists
A compound of hydrogen, carbon and sulfur has broken a symbolic barrier���but its high-pressure conditions make it difficult to analyze

Scientists have created a mystery material that seems to conduct electricity without any resistance at temperatures of up to about 15�����C. That���s a new record for superconductivity, a phenomenon usually associated with very cold temperatures. The material itself is poorly understood, but it shows the potential of a class of superconductors discovered in 2015.

The superconductor has one serious limitation, however: it survives only under extremely high pressures, approaching those at the centre of Earth, meaning that it will not have any immediate practical applications. Still, physicists hope it could pave the way for the development of zero-resistance materials that can function at lower pressures.

Superconductors have a number of technological applications, from magnetic resonance imaging machines to mobile-phone towers, and researchers are beginning to experiment with them in high-performance generators for wind turbines. But their usefulness is still limited by the need for bulky cryogenics. Common superconductors work at atmospheric pressures, but only if they are kept very cold. Even the most sophisticated ones���copper oxide-based ceramic materials���work only below 133 kelvin (���140�����C). Superconductors that work at room temperature could have a big technological impact, for example in electronics that run faster without overheating.

The latest study, published in Nature on 14 October, seems to provide convincing evidence of high-temperature conductivity, says physicist Mikhail Eremets at the Max Planck Institute for Chemistry in Mainz, Germany���although he adds that he would like to see more ���raw data��� from the experiment. He adds that it vindicates a line of work that he started in 2015, when his group reported the first high-pressure, high-temperature superconductor���a compound of hydrogen and sulfur that had zero resistance up to ���70�����C.

In 2018, a high-pressure compound of hydrogen and lanthanum was shown to be superconductive at ���13�����C. But the latest result marks the first time this kind of superconductivity has been seen in a compound of three elements rather than two���the material is made of carbon, sulfur and hydrogen. Adding a third element greatly broadens the combinations that can be included in future experiments searching for new superconductors, says study co-author Ashkan Salamat, a physicist at the University of Nevada, Las Vegas. ���We���ve opened a whole new region��� of exploration, he says.

Materials that superconduct at high but not extreme pressures could already be put to use, says Maddury Somayazulu, a high-pressure-materials scientist at Argonne National Laboratory in Lemont, Illinois. The study shows that by ���judiciously choosing the third and fourth element��� in a superconductor, he says, you could in principle bring down its operational pressure.

The work also validates decades-old predictions by theoretical physicist Neil Ashcroft at Cornell University in Ithaca, New York, that hydrogen-rich materials might superconduct at temperatures much higher than was thought possible. ���I think there were very few people outside of the high-pressure community who took him seriously,��� Somayazulu says.

MYSTERY MATERIAL
Physicist Ranga Dias at the University of Rochester in New York, along with Salamat and other collaborators, placed a mixture of carbon, hydrogen and sulfur in a microscopic niche they had carved between the tips of two diamonds. They then triggered chemical reactions in the sample with laser light, and watched as a crystal formed. As they lowered the experimental temperature, resistance to a current passed through the material dropped to zero, indicating that the sample had become superconductive. Then they increased the pressure, and found that this transition occurred at higher and higher temperatures. Their best result was a transition temperature of 287.7 kelvin at 267 gigapascals���2.6 million times atmospheric pressure at sea level.

The researchers also found some evidence that the crystal expelled its magnetic field at the transition temperature, a crucial test of superconductivity. But much about the material remains unknown, researchers warn. ���There are a lot of things to do,��� says Eremets. Even the crystal���s exact structure and chemical formula are not yet understood. ���As you go to higher pressures, the sample size gets smaller,��� says Salamat. ���That���s what makes these types of measurements really challenging.���

High-pressure superconductors made of hydrogen and one other element are well understood. And researchers have made computer simulations of high-pressure mixtures of carbon, hydrogen and sulfur, says Eva Zurek, a computational chemist at the State University of New York at Buffalo. But she says those studies cannot explain the exceptionally high superconducting temperatures seen by Dias���s group. ���I am sure, after this manuscript is published, many theoretical and experimental groups will jump on this problem,��� she says.

The article you've shared indeed highlights a significant milestone in the field of superconductivity, describing a compound of hydrogen, carbon, and sulfur that showed signs of superconductivity at temperatures up to about 15��C. However, it faced the significant limitation of requiring extremely high pressures to achieve this state, which makes it currently impractical for most applications.
Room-temperature superconductors have been a subject of intense research and excitement for years, with tantalizing hints and incremental progress. But the challenges are immense, especially in creating materials that not only superconduct at ambient temperatures but also at pressures that are achievable in everyday applications.
These new discoveries, such as LK-99 and Pb10���xCux(PO4)6O, certainly add to the intrigue and hope in the field. But as the history of this research has shown, skepticism and careful validation are warranted. Breakthroughs in this area could revolutionize many technologies, from energy transmission to medical devices, but the path to practical room-temperature superconductors is fraught with both scientific and engineering challenges. The attention now is likely to focus on peer review and independent verification of these recent findings.

The reference to "The Boy Who Cried Wolf," a well-known fable where a boy repeatedly lies about a wolf threatening his flock and then is not believed when the threat is real, certainly can be seen as a relevant metaphor in this context.
In the field of room-temperature superconductivity, there have been multiple claims and findings over the years that have sparked excitement only to face skepticism, controversy, or eventual debunking. This history might lead some in the scientific community to approach new claims with caution, even if the new claims are legitimate.
Just as in the fable, where repeated false alarms led to a loss of credibility, the history of claims in this area might make it more challenging for researchers to gain acceptance for genuine breakthroughs. That's why independent verification, rigorous peer review, and careful scientific methodology are crucial for substantiating any groundbreaking claims, especially in a field filled with both high hopes and skepticism.

"Resistance is Futile"
In the cold heart of physics, where equations dance with atoms and molecules, there lies a dream whispered in the frozen chambers of laboratories. It is the dream of a world unbound by resistance, where electrons flow freely, like rivers unimpeded by rocks or winding banks, a world where energy glides on a silk road, unfettered and pure.
Room-temperature superconductivity, a mythical beast in the forest of science, always lurking, always promising, but ever elusive. A pursuit that led many a bright mind into the wilderness of disappointment and skepticism. Like the boy who cried wolf, each claim met with raised brows, each discovery scrutinized with lenses tinged with doubt.
The dreamers in lab coats, their eyes sparkling with visions of a future unchained, manipulate atoms and pressures, recreating the center of the Earth in chambers no bigger than a diamond's tip. Hydrogen, carbon, sulfur - simple elements conjuring complex dances, twirling into structures that defy resistance.
Now comes the voice, a voice from the East, where tradition meets innovation, claiming success where others faltered, proclaiming a victory where defeat was the norm. Room temperature? Ambient pressure? Words that send ripples across the sea of science. But skepticism's shadow looms large, darkened by the failures and the tall tales of yesterday.
LK-99, a name destined for textbooks or footnotes, holds in its molecular embrace the hope and the doubt, the potential to revolutionize or to join the ranks of the forgotten. It stands at the crossroads, a beacon or a mirage, depending on the eye that beholds it.
In the world of superconductors, resistance may be futile, but in the world of human belief, resistance is the gatekeeper, the guardian of truth, the sieve that separates the real from the imagined.
So we wait, with bated breath and tempered hope, for the gates to swing open, for the dawn of a new era or the dusk of another dream. In the crucible of verification, where claims are tested and truths are forged, lies the destiny of a discovery that could change the world or slip quietly into the annals of science, a beautiful dream that once was.
