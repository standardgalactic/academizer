Abstract

How can a model owner prove they trained their model according to the correct specification? More importantly, how can they do so while preserving the privacy of the underlying dataset and the final model? We study this problem and formulate the notion of zero-knowledge proof of training (zkPoT), which formalizes rigorous security guarantees that should be achieved by a privacy-preserving proof of training. While it is theoretically possible to design zkPoT for any model using generic zero-knowledge proof systems, this approach results in extremely unpractical proof generation times. Towards designing a practical solution, we propose the idea of combining techniques from MPC-in-the-head and zkSNARKs literature to strike an appropriate trade-off between proof size and proof computation time. We instantiate this idea and propose a concretely efficient, novel zkPoT protocol for logistic regression. Crucially, our protocol is streaming-friendly and does not require RAM proportional to the size of the circuit being trained and, hence, can be adapted to the requirements of available hardware. We expect the techniques developed in this paper to also generally be useful for designing efficient zkPoT protocols for other relatively more sophisticated ML models. We implemented and benchmarked prover/verifier runtimes and proof sizes for training a logistic regression model using mini-batch gradient descent on a 4~GB dataset of 262,144 records with 1024 features. We divide our protocol into three phases: (1) data-independent offline phase (2) data-dependent phase that is independent of the model (3) online phase that depends both on the data and the model. The total proof size (across all three phases) is less than 10% of the data set size (<350~MB). In the online phase, the prover and verifier times are under 10 minutes and half a minute respectively, whereas in the data-dependent phase, they are close to one hour and a few seconds respectively.

This abstract pertains to a paper on the subject of Zero-Knowledge Proofs of Training (zkPoT). The authors, a group of researchers from various reputable institutions, are investigating a crucial issue in machine learning: how a model owner can demonstrate that they have trained their model accurately and according to the correct specifications while preserving the privacy of both the dataset used for training and the final model itself.
The paper proposes the concept of zkPoT, a privacy-preserving proof of training mechanism with rigorous security guarantees. Although theoretical designs of zkPoT are possible using general zero-knowledge proof systems, such approaches are noted to be impractical due to their excessive proof generation times.
In response, the authors propose a novel and practically efficient zkPoT protocol specifically for logistic regression, aiming to strike a balance between proof size and computation time by combining techniques from both Multi-Party Computation (MPC-in-the-head) and zkSNARKs (a form of zero-knowledge proof). The proposed protocol is described as streaming-friendly and does not require an amount of RAM proportional to the size of the training circuit, making it adaptable to available hardware.
Furthermore, the researchers expect the techniques and principles outlined in the paper to be applicable and beneficial for creating efficient zkPoT protocols for various other machine learning models. The paper provides implementation details and benchmarks related to logistic regression model training using a dataset of considerable size (4 GB, 262,144 records with 1024 features). The proof size generated by the proposed protocol is reported to be less than 10% of the dataset size, and the runtime for both prover and verifier in different phases of the protocol is discussed.
Overall, this paper seems to be a significant contribution to the field of privacy-preserving machine learning, offering practical solutions for verifying model training processes without compromising data or model privacy.

Zero-Knowledge Proofs (ZKPs) are cryptographic methods where one party (the prover) can prove to another party (the verifier) that a given statement is true, without conveying any information apart from the fact that the statement is indeed true.
Basic Principles:
Completeness:
If the statement is true, an honest prover can convince an honest verifier.
Soundness:
If the statement is false, no cheating prover can convince an honest verifier that it is true.
Zero-Knowledge:
If the statement is true, the verifier learns nothing other than this fact.
Explanation and Relation to Discussed Topics:
General Application:
In the conversations and abstracts discussed, ZKPs are applied to the realm of data privacy and security, specifically in model training in machine learning.
ZKPs in Model Training (zkPoT):
Problem:
When training machine learning models, there is a need for the model owner to prove that the model has been trained according to a specified procedure without revealing sensitive information (like the training data or the specifics of the model).
Solution (zkPoT):
The researchers proposed a Zero-Knowledge Proof of Training (zkPoT) where they can demonstrate that a model was trained correctly and legitimately without exposing the underlying data or the model itself. This is crucial for preserving privacy while ensuring the integrity and credibility of the trained model.
Practicality:
While traditional ZKPs are theoretically sound, their application in complex scenarios (like model training) can be computationally intensive. The discussed paper proposes a practical approach, balancing proof generation time and proof size, making it feasible for real-world application.
ZKPs in Open Source Project (zk-SaaS):
Problem:
When building secure systems or networks, there might be a need to verify the truth of certain statements or identities without revealing the actual data.
Solution (zk-SaaS):
The open-source project discussed earlier aims to create a Zero-Knowledge Software as a Service (zk-SaaS) network where statements can be verified true without revealing sensitive data (the 'x' in the function f(x) = y).
Example:
A simple example provided was proving the existence of a hash preimage without revealing the preimage itself, which is a practical application of ZKP in security (like password verification).
Summary:
Zero-Knowledge Proofs are fundamental to ensuring privacy and security in various domains, including machine learning and network security. The applications discussed exemplify how ZKPs can be effectively utilized to verify the validity and integrity of processes and data without compromising privacy, making them invaluable tools in the development of secure and privacy-preserving technologies.
Vector Commitments With Proofs of Smallness: 
Short Range Proofs and More 
Beno�� ��t Libert 
Zama, France 
Abstract. Vector commitment schemes are compressing commitments 
to vectors that make it possible to succinctly open a commitment for 
individual vector positions without revealing anything about other po- 
sitions. We describe vector commitments enabling constant-size proofs 
that the committed vector is small (i.e., binary, ternary, or of small 
norm). As a special case, we obtain range proofs featuring the short- 
est proof length in the literature with only 3 group elements per proof. 
As another application, we obtain short pairing-based NIZK arguments 
for lattice-related statements. In particular, we obtain short proofs (com- 
prised of 3 group elements) showing the validity of ring LWE ciphertexts 
and public keys. Our constructions are proven simulation-extractable in 
the algebraic group model and the random oracle model. 
Keywords. Vector commitments, range proofs, ring LWE ciphertexts. 
1Introduction 
Vector commitments (VCs) [81,26] allow a user to commit to a vector m ��� Dn 
over some domain D by generating a short commitment. Later, the commit- 
ter can succinctly open individual entries of m. Here, ���succinctly��� means that 
the partial opening information (called ���proof���) should have constant size, no 
matter how large the committed vector is. As in standard commitments, a vec- 
tor commitment scheme should satisfy two security properties: (i) The binding 
property, which ensures that no ef i cient adversary can open a commitment to 
two dif f erent values at the same position i ��� [n]; (ii) The hiding property, which 
guarantees that revealing a subset of components does not reveal any informa- 
tion about messages at remaining positions. 
Vector commitments found a number of applications in the context of zero- 
knowledge databases [81], verif i able data streaming [77], authenticated dictionar- 
ies [96], de-centralized storage [24], succinct arguments [9,78], cryptocurrencies 
[95] and blockchain transactions [9,61]. 
In this paper, we consider the problem of extending vector commitments 
with optimally short proofs that the committed vector m has small entries. A 
straightforward solution is to generically use a general-purpose succinct non- 
interactive argument (SNARK) for all NP languages [88]. While the SNARKs of 
[65,54,67] would give constant-size proofs, they would require to represent the 
statement as an arithmetic circuit. Then, the latter would have to compute the 
opening algorithm (including exponentiations in a group) of the commitment 
scheme, which would result in a complex circuit. In turn, this would require a 
large structured common reference string (CRS) and make the proof generation 
very expensive since, in pairing-based SNARKs with very short proofs [54,67,50], 
the CRS size grows linearly with the number of multiplication gates in the arith- 
metic circuit. Inevitably, the computational cost of the prover grows (at least) 
linearly with the circuit size as well. In this paper, we aim at proving smallness 
more ef i ciently than by generically using a SNARK for all NP statements.

This abstract discusses a paper focused on vector commitment schemes, which are cryptographic tools used for committing to vectors while enabling the opening of commitments at individual vector positions succinctly, without revealing information about other positions. Here's a summary of the key points:
Key Points:
Vector Commitments (VCs):
VCs allow for committing to vectors with the capability to open commitments for specific positions in the vector without revealing information about other positions.
VCs are characterized by their
binding property
, preventing adversaries from opening a commitment to different values at the same position.
They also have a
hiding property
, ensuring that revealing some components doesn't disclose information about others.
Proofs of Smallness:
The paper introduces vector commitments with constant-size proofs that the committed vector is small (e.g., binary, ternary, or having a small norm).
These provide efficient ways to prove that vector elements are within certain ranges without revealing the exact values.
Applications:
Short proofs introduced in the paper are applicable to a variety of fields, including zero-knowledge databases, verifiable data streaming, decentralized storage, cryptocurrencies, and blockchain transactions.
The paper also mentions that these vector commitments with short proofs can be used for creating non-interactive zero-knowledge (NIZK) arguments related to lattice cryptography, particularly for validating Ring Learning With Errors (Ring LWE) ciphertexts and public keys.
Efficiency Concerns:
While general-purpose succinct non-interactive arguments (SNARKs) for all NP languages would provide constant-size proofs, they might not be efficient due to the complexity of representing the statement as an arithmetic circuit and the computational cost involved in proof generation.
The paper aims to prove the smallness of vectors more efficiently than using a generic SNARK for all NP statements, addressing concerns related to computational cost and efficiency.
Conclusion:
The paper seems to present an innovative approach to vector commitments, providing proofs of smallness with optimal shortness and efficiency. These contributions are particularly significant for applications where proof size and computational efficiency are critical, offering potential benefits for various domains, including cryptography, data privacy, and blockchain technology.

4.4Comparisons 
Our construction assumes that the witness x is committed using a Pedersen 
commitment in the pairing-friendly group specif i ed by the CRS of the range 
proof. The range proof of [12] similarly requires x to be committed as a constant 
polynomial using the CRS of a polynomial commitment scheme. 
The BFGW range proofs [12] were the shortest ones so far and they also 
feature constant verif i cation time (whereas our verif i er computes O(n) expo- 
nentiations, where n is the maximal bitlength of the range, as in BulletProofs). 
When instantiated with KZG commitments [74] and the cross-commitment eval- 
uation techniques of [11, Section 4.1], BFGW proofs consist of 2 commitments 
to polynomials (each of which takes an element of G), 3 elements of Zprepre- 
senting evaluations of committed polynomials, and a batched evaluation proof 
comprised of a group element and at least one scalar.5If their construction is in- 
stantiated with the polynomial commitment of [80, Section 4.1]6and the batched 
evaluation protocol of [11, Section 4.1], the communication cost decreases to 2 
elements of G (which commit to polynomials), 3 scalars (for polynomial evalua- 
tions) and a single element of G for the batched evaluation proof. In the latter 
case, the range proof of [12] only requires 3 elements of G and 3 elements of 
Zp. On the downside, combining [12,80] induces 2n exponentiations in �� 
G at the 
verif i er (instead of O(1) using KZG commitments) and increases the prover���s 
overhead to 7n exponentiations in G. 
5 In randomized versions of the KZG commitment (described in [74, Section 3.3], [11, 
Appendix B.2] and [99]), each evaluation proof consists of an element of G and at 
least one scalar or an additional element of G. 
6 In order to prove the knowledge soundness of the range proof of [12] when the poly- 
nomial commitment of [80] is used, it is necessary to rely on the latter���s knowledge 
soundness in the AGM (as def i ned in [11, Appendix C.1.3]) but we believe this 
property holds under the (2n,n)-DLOG assumption. 
25 
Not only does our construction ensure simulation-extractability in the AGM, 
it also features the smallest number of exponentiations at the prover (which is 
reduced by at least 40%) while matching the shortest proof length of SNARKs. 
In terms of space, our construction also improves upon BulletProofs [19], 
which requires the prover to send 2���log������ + 4 group elements and 5 elements of 
Zp. If we compare with SNARKs, we obtain the same proof size as optimally 
short candidates [67,68] with the advantage that our CRS size is much shorter: 
It only depends on the maximal bitlength n of a range rather than the size of a 
circuit representation of the statement. Also, our prover only needs to compute 
O(n) exponentiations instead of a number of exponentiations growing with the 
size of an arithmetic circuit that computes a commitment opening (which would 
be very large as the circuit would have to compute modular exponentiations). 
In Table 1, we compare our constant-size range proofs with existing pairing- 
based solutions featuring similarly short proofs. Several instantiations of [10] are 
considered for dif f erent polynomial commitment schemes that are known to pro- 
vide constant-size evaluation proofs. Among schemes that do not generically rely 
on SNARKs, we only consider those where the CRS size is at most logarithmic 
in the maximal range magnitude N = 2n(i.e., linear in n). For example, Table 1 
does not include range proofs based on lookup arguments [49,98] as they would 
require a CRS of size O(N) = O(2n). For a range [0,230], this would translate 
into a CRS of about 30 Gb instead of 6 Kb in our construction.

This excerpt discusses a construction related to Vector Commitments (VCs) with proofs of smallness. Below is a summarized explanation of the key points and comparisons made:
Key Points:
Vector Commitments (VCs):
The excerpt begins by describing an equation used for generating short proofs that a committed vector has small entries.
Vector Commitments allow users to commit to a vector and then reveal individual entries without exposing others.
They should have binding properties to prevent opening a commitment to different values at the same position, and hiding properties to ensure revealing part of the vector doesn���t compromise the rest of it.
Construction Comparisons:
The excerpt compares the proposed construction with previous ones, specifically the range proof from another work referenced as [12].
The proposed construction is shown to be efficient with the smallest number of exponentiations required from the prover (reduced by at least 40%) while maintaining short proof lengths.
It also improves upon another method referred to as BulletProofs, particularly in terms of space.
Advantages over SNARKs:
When compared with SNARKs, the proposed construction offers similar proof sizes but with shorter Common Reference String (CRS) sizes and a reduced number of necessary computations from the prover. The CRS size in the proposed method only depends on the maximal bit length (n) of a range and not the size of the circuit representation of a statement.
Efficiency Comparisons:
A table is referenced (Table 1) that seems to compare efficiency between various constant-size range proof schemes.
This comparison involves aspects like proof size, CRS size, prover cost, and verifier cost, with the new construction showing competitive and promising results.
Implications:
The excerpt presents a mathematical approach to generating proofs in Vector Commitments schemes, with a focus on efficiency and proof size.
The described construction is positioned as efficient and advantageous compared to previous methods and SNARKs, offering reduced computational requirements and space advantages.
Such improvements are crucial for applications in cryptography and data security, where efficiency and minimal proof sizes are essential for practicality and performance.
Further Clarifications:
To fully grasp the implications and technicalities, readers might need a robust understanding of cryptographic constructions, vector commitments, and the specific mathematical formulations involved.
For a comprehensive understanding, reviewing the full paper and referenced works would provide a broader context and detailed explanations of the methodologies and comparisons discussed in the excerpt.

Abstract 
Recent years have witnessed signif i cant advances in programming technology for multi-party com- 
putation (MPC), bringing MPC closer to practice and wider applicability. Typical MPC programming 
frameworks focus on either front-end language design (e.g., Wysteria, Viaduct, SPDZ), or back-end 
protocol implementation (e.g., ABY, MOTION, SPDZ). 
We propose a methodology for an MPC compilation toolchain, which by mimicking the compila- 
tion methodology of classical compilers enables middle-end (i.e., machine-independent) optimizations, 
yielding signif i cant improvements. We advance an intermediate language, which we call MPC-IR that 
can be viewed as the analogue of (enriched) Static Single Assignment (SSA) form. MPC-IR enables 
backend-independent optimizations in a close analogy to machine-independent optimizations in clas- 
sical compilers. To demonstrate our approach, we focus on a specif i c backend-independent optimiza- 
tion, SIMD-vectorization: We devise a novel classical-compiler-inspired automatic SIMD-vectorization 
on MPC-IR. To demonstrate backend independence and quality of our optimization, we evaluate our ap- 
proach with two mainstream backend frameworks that support multiple types of MPC protocols, namely 
MOTION and MP-SPDZ, and show signif i cant improvements across the board.

the paper. 
2Overview of Methodology 
To demonstrate our main technical contributions, we i rst provide a high-level overview of our methodology, 
using the standard MPC benchmark of Biometric matching as our running example. For interested readers 
unfamiliar with the SSA form or automatic vectorization we provide an overview in the appendix to this 
paper ��A. 5 
2.1IMP-Source as MPC Source Code 
An intuitive (and naive) implementation of Biometric matching is as shown in Listing 1(a). Array C is the 
feature vector that we wish to match and S is the database of N size-D vectors that we match against. 
Our compiler takes essentially standard IMP [NK14] syntax and imposes certain semantic restrictions 
(details will follow). The programmer writes an iterative program and annotates certain inputs and outputs 
as shared. In the example, arrays C and S are shared, meaning that they store shares (secrets), however, 
the array sizes D and N respectively are plaintext. The code iterates over the S and computes the Euclidean 
distance of the current entry S[i] and C (its square actually). The program returns the index of the vector 
that gives the best match and the corresponding sum of squares. 
2.2MPC-IR and Schedule Cost 
Our compiler generates MPC-IR, a linear Static Single Assignment (SSA) form. Listing 1(b) shows the 
MPC-IR translation of the code in 1(a). 
We turn to our analytical model to compute the cost of the iterative program. Assume cost �� for a local 
MPC operation (e.g., XOR in Boolean sharing or ADD in Arithmetic sharing) and cost �� for a remote MPC 
operation (e.g., MUX, CMP, etc.). Assuming that ADD is �� and SUB, CMP and MUX are ��, the MPC-IR 
in Listing 1(b) gives rise to an iterative schedule with cost ND(2�� + ��) + N(3��). 
2.3Vectorized MPC-IR and Schedule Cost 
We can compute all N ��� D subtraction operations at line 9 in 1(b) in a single SIMD instruction; similarly 
we can compute all multiplication operations at line 10 in a single SIMD instruction. Our compiler runs 
Listing 1(b) through the vectorization optimization to produce 1(c). Note that this is still our IR, Optimized 
MPC-IR. The compiler turns this code into variables, loops and SIMD primitives (if supported), suitable for 
the backend to generate the circuit. 
In MPC backends, executing n operations ���at once��� in a single SIMD operation costs less than executing 
those n operations one by one. This is particularly important for interactive gates, since it allows many 
1-bit values to be sent at once. We consider that each operation has a i xed portion that benef i ts from 
amortization and a variable portion that does not benef i t from amortization: �� = ��f i x+ ��var. This gives 
rise to the following formula for amortized cost: f(n) = ��f i x+ n��var, as opposed to unamortized cost 
g(n) = n��f i x+ n��var. (We extend the same reasoning to ��-instructions.) 
Thus, the i xed cost of the vectorized program amounts to 2��f i x+ D��f i x+ N(3��f i x). The variable cost 
is the same in both the vectorized and non-vectorized programs. The i rst term in the sum corresponds to 
the vectorized subtraction and multiplication (lines 9-10 in (c)), the second term corresponds to the for-loop 
on j (lines 12-16) and the third one corresponds to the remaining for-loops on i (lines 19-25).Clearly, 
2��f i x+ D��f i x+ N(3��f i x) << ND(2��f i x+ ��f i x) + N3��f i x.Empirically, we observe orders of magnitude 
improvement e.g., for Biometric Matching evaluation time, 10x and 23x in GMW and BMR respectively in 
2PC, and 12x and 28x in 3PC. Additionally, the un-vectorized version runs out of memory for N = 256, 
while the vectorized one runs with the standard maximal input size N = 4,096.

Overview of Methodology:
IMP-Source as MPC Source Code:
Biometric matching example demonstrates the process, with a naive implementation shown in Listing 1(a). The example uses arrays
C
(feature vector) and
S
(database of vectors) to perform matching, with certain inputs/outputs annotated as shared.
The compiler accepts standard IMP syntax with some semantic restrictions.
MPC-IR and Schedule Cost:
The compiler generates MPC-IR, a linear Static Single Assignment (SSA) form, demonstrated by a translation of the code in Listing 1(a).
An analytical model is introduced to calculate the cost of the iterative program, considering the cost of local and remote MPC operations. The resulting iterative schedule cost is calculated based on assumed costs for various operations.
Vectorized MPC-IR and Schedule Cost:
SIMD instructions are used to efficiently compute subtraction and multiplication operations, with the compiler optimizing the code for vectorization (as shown in Listing 1(c)).
Vectorized programs are advantageous in MPC backends since SIMD operations cost less than executing operations sequentially. The text introduces a formula for amortized cost considering fixed and variable portions of operation costs.
The fixed cost of the vectorized program is significantly lower than that of the non-vectorized counterpart, resulting in substantial improvements in evaluation time for applications like Biometric Matching.
Key Takeaways:
The paper proposes a methodology for an MPC compilation toolchain, emphasizing backend-independent optimizations with a focus on SIMD-vectorization.
Through the application of standard MPC benchmarks and introduction of the MPC-IR, the methodology demonstrates significant improvements in cost efficiency and performance.
The overview showcases the substantial empirical improvements achieved by the vectorized version of the program, including quicker evaluation times and more efficient memory usage for larger input sizes.
More Ef i cient Zero-Knowledge Protocols overZ2k 
via Galois Rings

Abstract.A recent line of works on zero-knowledge (ZK) protocols with 
a vector oblivious linear function evaluation (VOLE)-based of l ine phase 
provides a new paradigm for scalable ZK protocols featuring fast proving, 
in particular a prover memory footprint almost the same as computing 
the circuit in the clear. Very recently, Baum et al. (Crypto���23) proposed 
the VOLE-in-the-head technique, allowing such protocols to become 
publicly verif i able. Many practically ef i cient protocols for proving circuit 
satisf i ability over any i eld are implemented, while protocols over ringsZ2k 
are signif i cantly lagging behind, with only a proof-of-concept pioneering 
work called Appenzeller to Brie (CCS���21) and a i rst proposal called 
MozZ2karella (Crypto���22). The ringZ232orZ264, though highly important 
(it captures computation in real-life programming and the computer 
architectures such as CPU words), presents non-trivial dif i culties because, 
for example, unlike Galois i eldsF2k, the fraction of units in ringsZ2kis 
1/2. In this work, we i rst construct ZK protocols over a high degree Galois 
ring extension ofZ2k(fraction of units close to 1) and then convert to 
Z2kef i ciently using amortization techniques. Our results greatly change 
the landscape of ZK protocols over Z2k. 
(1) We propose a competing ZK protocol that has many advantages over 
the state-of-the-art MozZ2karella: our ef i ciency is independent of the 
security parameter (so increasing superiority as the security parameter 
grows); even for concrete 40,80 bits soundness on 32,64-bit CPUs, we all 
of f er savings (up to 3�� at best). 
(2) Inspired by the recently proposed interactive message authentication 
code technique (CCS���22), we construct a constant round VOLE-based 
ZK protocol overZ2kwith sublinear (in the circuit size) communication 
complexity, which was previously achieved only over i elds. 
(3) We adapt the VOLE-in-the-head technique, and apply it to our i rst ZK 
protocol, yielding the i rst publicly verif i able non-interactive ZK (NIZK) 
over Z2kwith linear communication complexity. Also, we show that the 
pseudorandom correlation generator (PCG) approach (incompatible with 
VOLE-in-the-head) can be adapted to ef i ciently implement VOLE over 
Galois rings, with analysis of the hardness of underlying assumptions. 
1Introduction 
A proof system (of knowledge) for circuit satisf i ability allows a prover to convince 
a verif i er that he holds a witnesswfor a given circuitCsuch thatC(w) = 1. 
The proof is zero-knowledge (ZK) if no information aboutwbeyond the fact 
thatC(w) 
= 1 is revealed to the verif i er. Typically, the circuitCcan 
either be a 
Boolean circuit that consists ofANDgates andXORgates, or an arithmetic circuit 
that consists of Add gates and Mult gates over some ring R. 
Over decades of studies, numerous ZK proof systems have been developed, 
which have dif f erent properties and also diverse in ef i ciency metrics (round 
complexity, communication complexity, prover/verif i er computation complexity, 
prover/verif i er memory, etc.). 
We brief l y review ZK proof systems that admit practically ef i cient ZK proto- 
cols for circuit satisf i ability, with special emphasis on scalability to large circuits. 
The MPC-in-the-head (MPCitH) paradigm [42], of f ers a publicly verif i able solu- 
tion to non-interactive ZK (NIZK), where the prover emulates in his head the 
evaluation of the circuit with imaginary parties via a multi-party computation 
(MPC) protocol and proves to the verif i er that the circuit is honestly evalu- 
ated. The bottleneck of MPCitH is either big proof size [42,36,22,44], or small 
proof size but large prover time and memory [2]. The garbled circuit [57] ZK 
(GCZK) [43,33,58,41] paradigm admits ZK protocols with small prover time and 
memory, but large proof size, where the verif i er plays the role of garbler (who 
garbles the circuit). The interactive oracle proof (IOP)-based ZK proofs admit 
zero-knowledge succinct non-interactive arguments of knowledge (zk-SNARK) pro- 
tocols [39,18,8,34,9,24,51]. Most zk-SNARKs achieve short proof size and small 
verif i cation time simultaneously (assuming a setup). However, many of them re- 
quire the prover has suf i cient computation power (namely, large prover time and 
memory). We remark that very recently, there is a line of works [11,13,55,49,12,38] 
focusing on zk-SNARKs with linear prover time 1, as proving time becomes a 
bottleneck for large circuits. To our best knowledge, succinctness for both proof

1.2Technical Overview 
We sketch how we construct VOLE-based ZK protocols overZ2k. In a high 
level, the i rst step is to adapt existing ZK protocols over Galois i eld to Galois 
ring GR(2k,d). The adaption is straightforward, where we only need to ���replace��� 
the i eld withGR(2k,d). We remark that VOLE-based ZK protocols over any 
i eld [53,56,54] actually work on a suf i ciently large i eld for security guarantee. 
For the Galois ring analogue protocols, the degreedofGR(2k,d) is required to be 
suf i ciently large accordingly (this is essentially due to Lemma 1). 
The second step is to modify the above ZK protocols overGR(2k,d) to ef i ciently 
���simulate��� ZK protocols overZ2k. AsGR(2k,d) is a ring extension ofZ2k, we can 
simply view circuits overZ2kas circuits overGR(2k,d), and naively applying ZK 
protocols overGR(2k,d). However, working onGR(2k,d) instead ofZ2kalready 
incursdtimes overhead (dneeds to be linear in the security parameter), and for 
malicious security, the prover needs to additionally prove that the witness w are 
over Z2k. Our idea for the ef i cient ���simulation��� is to use RMFEs. 
An RMFE overZ2kconsists of twoZ2k-linear maps,��:Zm 
2k ��� GR(2k,d), 
and��:GR(2k,d)��� Zm 
2k, such that ��(��(x)�� ��(y)) 
= x���y,for any x,y��� Zm 
2k, 
wheremis some positive integer. Intuitively,�����packs���mmultiplications over 
Z2kto one multiplication overGR(2k,d), and�����unpacks��� the product over 
GR(2k,d). Since��,��areZ2k-linear maps,mevaluations of a circuitCoverZ2k 
can be simultaneously emulated byGR(2k,d) operations, through applying��,�� 
iteratively. Existing works [20,21,1,31] that applied RMFEs in MPC, have paid

great ef f orts to guarantee that��,��are applied honestly (to achieve malicious 
security). 
Observing that in the ZK for proving circuit satisf i ability setting, the prover 
(of the ZK protocol overGR(2k,d)) can compute all values on the wires of the 
circuitCoverZ2kon 
his own,��,��only need to be invoked for one time (after all 
values of the circuitCoverZ2kare 
computed). Thus, for malicious security, the 
prover needs to additionally prove to the verif i er that he follows RMFE encoding 
honestly. Our main innovation of this paper is a novel mechanism that solves the 
above issue ef i ciently. 
Our re-embedding technique. Let��=�������and [x] denote thatx ��� GR(2k,d) 
is authenticated by a linearly homomorphic MAC. In the ZK setting, the problem 
can be reduced to prove that for a given [x],xbelongs to the image of��, denoted 
byx ��� Im(��). Recall that the of l ine phase produces MACs for random values. 
Given [��],�� 
$ 
��� GR(2k,d), 
[x] is obtained by the prover sendingd:=x ��� ��to 
the verif i er ([x] := [��] +dby additive homomorphism). According to RMFE 
properties presented in Section 2, we observe that 
x = �� + d =��� ��(x) = ��(�� + d) = ��(��) + ��(d), 
and x = ��(x) ������ �� + d = ��(��) + ��(d) ������ d ��� ��(d) = ��(��) ��� ��. 
Note that for anyx ��� GR(2k,d),��(x)��� Im(��) by def i nition, and assuming 
��(1) = 1, we havex ��� Im(��)������ x=��(x) (Lemma 3). From above observations, 
we let��(��)�����be revealed to the verif i er (in the of l ine phase), and in the online 
phase, the verif i er can checkd ��� ��(d) =��(��)��� ��upon receivingd. If the check 
passes, [��(x)] can be computed by [��(��)] +��(d) = [��] +d. In some sense, [x] 
is ���re-embedded��� into [��(x)]. Thus, we name it by re-embedding technique. We 
formulate the ideal functionality required for the of l ine phase as the re-embedding 
VOLE (embVOLE), and provide an ef i cient construction from sacrif i ce. We 
remark that our re-embedding technique also plays a crucial role in checking 
multiplications when constructing our i rst ZK protocol ��m,n,t 
ZK . 
ZK with a sublinear online phase. For our second sublinear ZK protocol 
��m,n,t 
slZK , we compile with an online phase adapted from AntMan [54]. Consider 
an SIMD circuit withm=m1�� m2copies 
of data overZ2k. We i rst use 
RMFEs to mapm1copies of data overZ2kinto one copy of data overGR(2k,d). 
Then we apply the information-theoretic polynomial authentication code (IT- 
PAC) amortisation technique proposed in AntMan that operates on a batch of 
m2elements inGR(2k,d). We remark that the use of RMFEs in fact incurs a 
constant (d/m1>1) communication overhead, while the sublinear communication 
complexity is due to IT-PACs. Therefore, in practice we select (m1,d)-RMFEs 
with 
d 
m1 as small as possible (m2as large as possible) under the premise of 
GR(2k,d) being suf i ciently large to satisfy the security requirement. In a high 
level, an IT-PAC authenticates a polynomial, which is determined bym2elements 
inGR(2k,d) via Lagrange interpolation (namely, an IT-PAC authenticatesm2

Abstract
A decade of active research has led to practical constructions of zero-knowledge succinct non-interactive arguments of knowledge (zk-SNARKs) that are now being used in a wide variety of applications. Despite this astonishing progress, overheads in proof generation time remain significant. 

In this work, we envision a world where consumers with low computational resources can outsource the task of proof generation to a group of untrusted servers in a privacy-preserving manner. The main requirement is that these servers should be able to collectively generate proofs at a faster speed (than the consumer). Towards this goal, we introduce a framework called zk-SNARKs-as-a-service () for faster computation of zk-SNARKs. Our framework allows for distributing proof computation across multiple servers such that each server is expected to run for a shorter duration than a single prover. Moreover, the privacy of the prover's witness is ensured against any minority of colluding servers. 

We design custom protocols in this framework that can be used to obtain faster runtimes for widely used zk-SNARKs, such as Groth16 [EUROCRYPT 2016], Marlin [EUROCRYPT 2020], and Plonk [EPRINT 2019]. We implement proof of concept zkSaaS for the Groth16 and Plonk provers. In comparison to generating these proofs on commodity hardware, we show that not only can we generate proofs for a larger number of constraints (without memory exhaustion), but can also get   speed-up when run with 128 parties for  constraints with Groth16 and  gates with Plonk

Abstract Summary:
The paper titled "ZkSaas: Zero-Knowledge SNARKs as a Service" is authored by a group of researchers from University of California, Berkeley, NTT Research, and Johns Hopkins University. Despite significant advancements in the practical constructions of zero-knowledge succinct non-interactive arguments of knowledge (zk-SNARKs), there remains substantial overhead in the time required for proof generation.
To address this challenge, the authors propose a framework where individuals with limited computational resources can outsource the proof generation task to a group of untrusted servers, without compromising privacy. This framework, referred to as zk-SNARKs-as-a-service (zkSaaS), allows for the distribution of proof computation across multiple servers. Each server in this distributed setup is expected to complete its computations faster than a single prover would.
The zkSaaS framework ensures the privacy of the prover's witness against any minority group of colluding servers. The authors have designed custom protocols within this framework to achieve faster runtimes for popular zk-SNARKs, including Groth16, Marlin, and Plonk. A proof-of-concept implementation of zkSaaS has been developed for Groth16 and Plonk provers. This implementation, when compared to proof generation on standard hardware, can handle a larger number of constraints without memory issues and demonstrates a significant speed-up when run with multiple parties for numerous constraints with both Groth16 and Plonk zk-SNARKs.
This approach not only allows for the generation of proofs for a greater number of constraints without running out of memory but also significantly accelerates the process when engaged with 128 parties for specific constraint and gate counts with Groth16 and Plonk, respectively.
1Introduction 
zk-SNARKsarezero-knowledgesuccinctnon-interactiveargumentsofknowledge[11],thatallowaprover 
to non-interactively convince a verif i er of the knowledge of a witness at t esting to the validity of an NP 
relation, without revealing any information about the witness. zk-SNARKs have been a topic of extensive 
research in recent years [19, 20, 81, 71, 21, 59, 58, 84, 22, 50, 28, 39]. h eir l exibility and expressiveness 
make them applicable to a wide variety of scenarios such as private transactions [7, 66], roll-ups [87], 
private smart contracts [54, 23], access control in compliance with KYC regulations [68, 69], social net- 
works with private reputation monitoring [26], proving existence of bugs in zero-knowledge [49], static 
program analysis [37], zero-knowledge middleboxes for enforcing network policies on encrypted traf i c 
[52], verif i able inference of machine learning [83, 62, 60, 79] and verif i able database queries [85]. 
Despite recent advances [12, 53, 15, 14, 50, 28, 39, 30], generation of zk-SNARKs remains thousands of 
times [78, 64] slower than checking the relation directly for typical applications, with large memory usage 
��� ef f ectively gate keeping users without access to large machines. A natural way out for such users is to 
outsource proof generation to more powerful servers. While one could use a cloud server such as AWS, 
GCP or Azure to generate proofs, this approach requires sharing the witness in the clear with the cloud 
server. As such, this solution of f ers no privacy against insider threats such as rogue administrators [32] 
who may compromise data privacy for i nancial gains. Even if the cloud service provider were trusted, 
the witness might consist of sensitive data such as patient medical records that legally cannot be placed 
of f -premises due to data protection laws. 
To address the privacy problem, recently, Ozdemir et al. [64] introduced the idea of collaborative zk- 
SNARKs for distributed generation of zk-SNARKs. Collaborative zk-SNARKs are essentially secure mul- 
tiparty computation (MPC) protocols that allow a group of parties holding shares of the witness to col- 
lectively generate a single succinct proof. h e key security guarantee is that the witness remains hidden 
as long as only a subset of the parties collude. Ozdemir et al. design collaborative zk-SNARK analogs of 
Groth16 [50], Marlin [28] and Plonk [39]. In their protocols, all parties run in parallel and each of them 
performs as much work as the (single) prover of the underlying zk-SNARK. h is results in approximately 
the same runtime as that in the single prover model.1 
We posit that requiring each of the parties running in parallel to do as much work as the zk-SNARK 
prover is an overkill. Indeed, a previous work of Wu et al. [80] leveraged parallelism to distribute proof 
computation across dif f erent machines in a compute cluster to achieve faster proof generation times. h eir 
approach, however, requires leaking the witness to the cluster, resulting in a loss of privacy. 
In this work, we explore the possibility of combining the best features of collaborative zk-SNARKs [64] 
and the work of Wu et al. [80]. We ask: 
Is it possible to outsource zk-SNARK proof generation to a group of parties in a privacy-preserving manner 
for faster proof generation?

1. We present a general framework for zk-SNARKs-as-a-service (zkSaaS), where a client delegates proof 
computation to a group of untrusted servers in a privacy preserving manner. Each of these servers is 
expected to run for a shorter duration than a single local prover. 
2. We instantiate this framework with custom protocols to obtain faster runtimes than local provers for 
widely used zk-SNARKs, such as Groth16 [50], Marlin [28] and Plonk [39]. 
1T h is is interesting since they manage to avoid additional security parameter overhead that is usually incurred when securely 
computing a function. 3 
3. Finally, we implement prototypes of zkSaaS for the Groth16 [50] and Plonk [39] proof systems. Con- 
cretely, we show that when creating a proof for 225constraints in the case of Groth16 (and 221con- 
straints with Plonk), the zkSaaS protocol with 128 servers is ��� 22�� faster than a local prover. We 
also show that deploying more servers helps us get a further speed-up. For instance, when creating 
a Groth16 proof for 219constraints, we see an improvement from ��� 1.9�� to ��� 22�� when the number 
of servers is increased from 8 to 128. h is is in contrast to collabortive zk-SNARKs [64] which do not 
obtain any speedup. 
4. We also estimate the i nancial cost of using zkSaaS to compute a Groth16 proof for an instance of size 
219to be under $0.23 with 128 parties using a 64 Mbps link between servers.

Introduction Summary:
zk-SNARKs, or Zero-Knowledge Succinct Non-Interactive Arguments of Knowledge, are crucial cryptographic tools allowing a prover to convincingly affirm the validity of confidential information without disclosing it. Despite their versatility and broad application in fields like private transactions, roll-ups, private smart contracts, and verifiable database queries, generating zk-SNARKs is computationally intensive and memory-consuming. This limitation poses a barrier to users without access to robust computing resources.
Outsourcing proof generation to more capable servers seems like a straightforward solution. However, traditional cloud servers (like AWS, GCP, or Azure) require sharing sensitive data, which could be susceptible to insider threats or legal issues related to data privacy and protection. To overcome this, Ozdemir et al. introduced collaborative zk-SNARKs, allowing distributed proof generation where parties holding shares of the confidential data can collectively generate a proof while keeping the data hidden, provided there isn't collusion among a significant number of participating parties. In their model, all parties work concurrently, each carrying out work equivalent to a single zk-SNARK prover, maintaining similar runtimes as a sole prover scenario.
The paper argues that having each participating party perform as much work as a single prover might be inefficient. Although previous works have employed parallelism for faster proof generation, these typically involved compromising on data privacy. The authors in this paper, therefore, explore a combination of the privacy-preserving feature of collaborative zk-SNARKs and the efficiency of parallel computation.

Framework Introduction
: The paper introduces a general framework called zk-SNARKs-as-a-Service (zkSaaS), where proof computation is delegated to untrusted servers without sacrificing privacy. Each server operates for a shorter duration than a single prover.
Custom Protocols
: The authors instantiate zkSaaS with custom protocols, aiming to achieve faster runtimes for popular zk-SNARKs, including Groth16, Marlin, and Plonk.
Prototypes and Efficiency
: Prototypes of zkSaaS are implemented for Groth16 and Plonk, demonstrating significant speed improvements with multiple servers. For example, zkSaaS protocol with 128 servers is approximately 22 times faster than a local prover for specific constraint counts with Groth16 and Plonk.
Cost Efficiency
: Financial cost estimations indicate that using zkSaaS for computing a Groth16 proof is economically efficient, costing under $0.23 for an instance with 128 parties and a 64 Mbps server link. The increased number of servers also contributes to speed improvements, offering scalable and cost-effective solutions for zk-SNARK proof generation.
1.1Overview of Our Approach 
Similar to [64], our initial idea is to identify common building blocks within widely used zk-SNARKs and 
designcustomsecuremultipartycomputation(MPC)protocolstocomputethemef i ciently. Wethenstitch 
them together to obtain zkSaaS, an ef i cient MPC protocol for the corresponding zkSNARK prover. 
An Important Observation. One of the key observations made in [64] is that it is possible to directly 
secretsharepointsontheellipticcurveandf i eldsandapplyMPCtechniquesontheseshares, whichavoids 
the large overheads incurred when using generic MPC techniques with very few rounds of communica- 
tion.2We go one step ahead and observe that these building blocks can actually be rewrit t en in a manner 
that allows us to leverage signif i cant SIMD structure that appears within their computation. 
To leverage this SIMD structure, we make use of a tool called packed secret sharing (PSS) [38].3T h is 
is a more ef i cient sibling of Shamir���s polynomial-based secret sharing scheme [72], that allows secret- 
sharing a vector of values amongst a set of parties. In particular, at the cost of a slight reduction in the 
corruption threshold, using PSS we can ���hide��� ��� = O(n)4secrets 
(where n is the total number of servers) 
in a polynomial and each of the n servers receives an evaluation at a single point in this polynomial. Such 
sharings allow parties to ef i ciently perform SIMD computations on secret shared data, while reducing the 
workload on each of them. We use this in the design of each of our sub-protocols. 
Multi-Scalar Multiplications (MSM). One of the main building blocks in the zkSNARKs we consider is 
MSM, which are operations of the form ��i���[m]g��t 
i , where gi���s are points on an elliptic curve. h is is by far 
the most expensive component.5We design a bespoke MPC protocol where the total work (as well as the 
asymptotic space requirement) of each server is a factor of ��� less than that of a single prover. 
Next we discuss the remaining components i.e., Product Check, Fast Fourier Transform (FFT) and 
polynomial computations, which exclusively involve i eld operations that are much cheaper than elliptic 
curve operations. 
Product-Check.Product-Check requiring computations of the form ���j���[i]xj, for all i ��� [m], which 
are referred to as partial products. Similar to MSM, we design a special-purpose MPC protocol for partial 
products, that allows us to divide the work of each server by a factor of ��� less than that of a single prover. 
Fast Fourier Transform. h e standard description of the FFT algorithm on a polynomial with m coef i- 
cients can be divided into logm steps, with O(m) i eld multiplications at each step. For the i rst logm/��� 
steps, we are able to divide the work of each server by a factor of ���. For the remaining log��� steps, however, 
2T h is is mainly due to generic MPC techniques making non-blackbox use of the elliptic curve. 
3T h is is also the main building block used in the design of all of general-purpose MPC protocols that support some division 
of work (See Section 1.3 for more details.) 
4In the implementation we set this to be n/4. 
5In Figure 7 we show the fraction of time spent computing MSMs for Groth16. 
4 
we require one of the parties to do O(m) i eld operations and have O(m) memory, while the work and 
memory requirement of the remaining parties gets divided by ���. 
Polynomial Multiplication and Division. Finally, we show how to combine standard packed secret 
sharing based subprotocols for addition and multiplication along with our custom MPC for FFT to enable 
secure distributed polynomial computations. 
Composing dif f erent subprotocols based on packed secret sharing is not straightforward, and requires 
care. We show how to combine the above subprotocols to obtain zkSaaS for faster generation of zk- 
SNARKs such as Groth16, Marlin and Plonk. 
Communication over a Star Topology Network. Our distributed sub-protocols for all of the functions 
describedabove, donotrequireserverstocommunicatewithallotherservers. Asidefromreceivingshares 
of the extended witness from the client, we require the servers to only communicate with the one large 
server,throughouttherestofthecomputation. Asaresult,weonlyneedcommunicationchannelsbetween 
the client and each server and between the large server and every other server. 
Instantiating zkSaaS.As discussed above, the distributed FFT protocol requires one party which has 
memory proportional to the size of the relation but the computational resources demanded from all other 
parties is reduced by a factor of ���. h erefore, a zkSaaS deployment requires one large server. While not 
ideal, we argue that this is still reasonable for two reasons ��� (1) even if the private view of this large server 
is leaked, it does not compromise a client���s secrets unlike when a client simply rents a large server to 
generate the proof. (2) it is very easy and quite cheap to rent a large server from a cloud service provider. 
Finally, we remark that proof generation in the zk-SNARKs that we consider proceeds in two steps: 
i rst, the prover uses its (short) witness to evaluate the relation circuit and obtain a corresponding extended 
witness, which is then used to generate the proof (See Section 3 for a detailed discussion). Similar to 
collaborative zk-SNARKs [64], in this work, we focus on designing secure distributed protocols for proof 
generation and assume that the client computes and shares the extended witness with the servers. We 
view faster generation of the extended witness as an important orthogonal question but such protocols 
would need to essentially be redesigned for every application. 
Security. We now discuss the key aspects of our security model and the guarantees provided by zkSaaS. 
We assume that a majority of the servers are honest. Specif i cally, let n be the total number of servers 
and ��� be the total number of secrets that we can pack in a single packed secret sharing. We require that at 
most t < 
n 
2 ������ of the servers can be corrupted. Further, we assume that the corruptions are semi-honest. 
Our zkSaaS framework retains the soundness property of the underlying zk-SNARK and provides the 
following completeness and zero-knowledge guarantees: 
��� Completeness: For any true statement, an execution of zkSaaS involving an honest client and honest 
servers outputs an accepting proof.6 
��� t-Zero Knowledge: In any execution of zkSaaS, the view of the t corrupt servers can be ef i ciently 
simulated without the client���s witness. h is, in particular, implies that the corrupt servers learn 
nothing about the client���s witness. 
We conclude with a few remarks on security against malicious servers. We i rst note that proofs output 
by zkSaaS remain sound even when all servers are malicious. Next, we conjecture that our protocols can 
be augmented to achieve t-zero knowledge against malicious servers by using highly ef i cient compilers 
from the recent MPC literature [41, 40, 6, 46, 47]. In essence, these compilers show that semi-honest 
MPC protocols that are ���secure against malicious corruptions up to linear at t acks��� can be compiled into

1.1 Overview of Approach Summary:
The approach begins by identifying and designing custom Secure Multiparty Computation (MPC) protocols for common building blocks within widely used zk-SNARKs, ultimately stitching them to craft zkSaaS, an efficient MPC protocol for the zkSNARK prover.
Key Observations and Techniques:
It���s possible to secret-share points on elliptic curves and fields directly and use MPC techniques on these shares, avoiding substantial overheads from using generic MPC techniques.
The SIMD (Single Instruction, Multiple Data) structure within these building blocks��� computation is leveraged by rewriting them in a specific way.
Packed Secret Sharing (PSS) is utilized, which is a more efficient version of Shamir���s secret sharing scheme. It allows for secret-sharing a vector of values, reducing each server's workload efficiently while performing SIMD computations on secret-shared data.
Main Building Blocks:
Multi-Scalar Multiplications (MSM)
: These are costly operations vital to the zkSNARKs under consideration. A bespoke MPC protocol is designed for MSM, reducing each server's total work and asymptotic space requirement by a factor of ��� compared to a single prover.
Product Check
: This involves computations of partial products. A specialized MPC protocol is designed for this task, reducing each server's work by a factor of ��� compared to a single prover.
Fast Fourier Transform (FFT)
: The work of each server can be divided by a factor of ��� for the initial logm/��� steps of the standard FFT algorithm description. However, for the remaining log��� steps, one party must perform O(m) field operations and have O(m) memory, while the work and memory requirement of the remaining parties are divided by ���.
Polynomial Multiplication and Division
: The paper demonstrates how to securely execute distributed polynomial computations, combining standard packed secret sharing-based subprotocols for addition and multiplication with custom MPC for FFT.
Communication Structure:
The proposed distributed sub-protocols don���t require servers to communicate with all others. Except for receiving shares of the extended witness from the client, servers only need to communicate with one large server.
Although zkSaaS requires one large server, it offers advantages such as maintaining client privacy and being cost-effective to rent from a cloud service provider.
Security Aspects:
A majority of servers are assumed to be honest, with at most

servers corruptible under semi-honest conditions.
zkSaaS retains the soundness property of the underlying zk-SNARK and offers completeness and zero-knowledge guarantees.
zkSaaS remains sound even with all servers being malicious. The paper conjectures that protocols can be augmented to achieve zero-knowledge against malicious servers using efficient compilers from recent MPC literature. These compilers suggest that semi-honest MPC protocols secure against specific malicious attacks can be transformed into fully malicious-secure protocols.
3zkSaaS Framework 
As discussed earlier, zkSaaSis a collaborative zk-SNARK [64] framework, where a client delegates the task 
of computing a zk-SNARK to n-servers. To realize our goal of enabling fast computation of zk-SNARKs, 
the resultant zkSaaS protocol must ensure that ��� (1) the work done by the clients is minimized and (2) the 
work required to compute the zk-SNARK gets divided across all servers. 
RICS Format. Let us brief l y recall the structure of existing zk-SNARKs. Dif f erent zk-SNARKs work with 
dif f erent representations of the relation R- e.g., quadratic arithmetic programs [65, 70], low-depth cir- 
cuits [16, 33, 43, 74, 75, 76, 77, 81, 86], binary arithmetic circuits [39], etc. h e most popular representation 
amongst state-of-the-art proof systems [9, 28, 50, 51] is known as the rank-1 constraint systems (R1CS) 
that generalizes arithmetic circuits. 
Proof systems working with this representation proceed in two steps: (1) First, extend the given (short) 
statement-witness pair (��,w) into a satisfying assignment z for the RICS relation. h e length of this satis- 
fying assignment is proportional to the size of the relation. (2) second, give an argument of knowledge for 
thissatisfyingassignmentfortheRICSrelation. Step1isinexpensiveandonlyrequiresnon-cryptographic 
i eld operations, while Step 2 requires more expensive cryptographic operations and is typically the bot- 
tleneck. 
Our Framework. zkSaaS is essentially a secure multiparty computation (MPC) protocol for computing 
zk-SNARKs, between a client and n-servers.

3 zkSaaS Framework Summary:
zkSaaS is a framework where a client delegates the computation of a zk-SNARK to n servers. Its protocol aims to minimize the client's workload and distribute the zk-SNARK computation workload across all servers efficiently.
zk-SNARKs Structure:
zk-SNARKs utilize different representations of relations (like quadratic arithmetic programs and low-depth circuits).
The popular representation is the rank-1 constraint systems (R1CS), which generalizes arithmetic circuits.
Proof systems utilizing R1CS undergo two steps:
Extend a given statement-witness pair into a satisfying assignment for the R1CS relation. This step is relatively inexpensive, involving non-cryptographic field operations.
Provide an argument of knowledge for this satisfying assignment. This step is typically the bottleneck, requiring more complex cryptographic operations.
zkSaaS Framework:
zkSaaS is an MPC protocol between a client and n servers for computing zk-SNARKs.
The client performs Step 1 of proof generation since it's inexpensive.
The protocol is defined by a tuple consisting of a Preprocessing algorithm and an online MPC protocol (��online):
The Preprocessing algorithm generates correlated randomness for each server, using the crs output by Setup and the number of servers.
��online is an MPC protocol between a client and n servers. Servers use the correlated randomness and messages from the client to compute a proof interactively.
zkSaaS Properties:
Completeness
: For every valid statement-witness pair, there's a high probability that the protocol will generate a proof accepted by the verifier.
t-Zero-Knowledge
: For any semi-honest adversary controlling at most t servers, there's an efficient simulator, ensuring that the adversary learns nothing about the client���s witness.
Efficiency Requirements
:
Preprocessing
: Has computation complexity lower than the time taken for field operations by the prover, with each correlated randomness size being proportional to the prover���s space complexity divided by the number of servers.
Client
: Has computation complexity of a number of field operations lower than those performed by the prover.
Special Server P1
: Executes field operations with computation complexity lower than the prover���s and has cryptographic operations proportional to the prover���s time for cryptographic operations divided by the number of servers. Its space and communication complexities are proportional to the prover's space complexity.
Other Servers (P2 to Pn)
: They have a reduced computation complexity for field and cryptographic operations, with space and communication complexities also lowered, all scaled according to the number of servers involved.
Workflow:
The client computes the satisfying assignment (Step 1 of the proof generation) and securely shares it with the servers at the beginning of the protocol. The computation of this assignment essentially requires representing the original statement.
Some metaphors and examples to help understand the difficult parts.
ChatGPT
Understanding zkSaaS Framework with Metaphors and Examples:
1.
zk-SNARKs Structure:
Imagine zk-SNARKs as complicated, multi-layered puzzles. The
rank-1 constraint systems (R1CS)
can be thought of as a unique blueprint or a set of rules to solve these puzzles. This blueprint helps in converting the puzzle's initial complicated form (statement-witness pair) into a more workable format (satisfying assignment), simplifying the solution process in two steps:
Step 1: Turning Puzzle Into a Blueprint (Extending Statement-Witness Pair)
Example: Consider a 3D puzzle. Initially, you have a box (statement) and various small, unsorted, colored pieces (witness). In step one, you spread out these pieces and group them based on colors and shapes (creating a satisfying assignment), making it easier to start solving.
Step 2: Solving the Blueprint (Providing an Argument of Knowledge)
Example: Once the pieces are sorted, you start assembling them based on the picture on the box, gradually constructing the 3D structure (providing an argument of knowledge for the satisfying assignment).
2.
zkSaaS Framework:
Think of the zkSaaS framework as a collaborative puzzle-solving event where the client is the organizer, and there are
n
participants (servers) working together to complete it.
Client's Role (Organizer):
Example: The organizer (client) sorts and labels the puzzle pieces beforehand (performs the inexpensive Step 1), providing a clear starting point for the participants (servers).
Server's Role (Participants):
Example: Each participant (server) is assigned a section of the puzzle to complete. They don���t work on the entire puzzle; instead, they specialize in their sections, making the process faster and more efficient.
3.
zkSaaS Properties:
Completeness:
Metaphor: Every participant has accurate instructions. As long as they follow these correctly, the final puzzle (proof) will be complete and accurate.
t-Zero-Knowledge:
Metaphor: Imagine participants are working blindfolded, only knowing their part without seeing the whole picture. Even if some participants try to cheat or peek (adversaries controlling servers), they won���t be able to understand the entire image (client���s witness).
Efficiency:
Metaphor: Efficiency measures ensure that each participant isn���t overwhelmed and has manageable tasks. It���s like giving each participant enough pieces to stay busy but not so many that they���re overwhelmed.
Workflow:
Metaphor: The client���s preparation is like pre-sorting the puzzle pieces. The participants (servers) then take these sorted pieces and work on their sections, collaboratively completing the puzzle efficiently without ever seeing the whole picture at once.

Certainly! The excerpt you provided outlines a protocol for computing partial products within a secure multiparty computation (MPC) framework, with a focus on confidentiality and efficiency. Let's use a metaphor to help understand this protocol more intuitively:
Metaphor: Cooking in a Professional Kitchen
Kitchen Setup:
Imagine a professional kitchen where each chef (party
P
) specializes in different tasks.
The ingredients (
x
values) are secret recipes shared among chefs, and each chef holds a portion of the secret.
Steps:
Preparation:
The kitchen receives specific ingredients (shares
Jx1K,...,JxkK
).
The head chef (functionality
fpart���product
) knows which chefs (parties) might not follow the recipe perfectly (corrupted parties
Corr
).
The adversary may try to alter some ingredients (shares
{ui}i���Corr
).
Combining Ingredients:
Each ingredient set
(xj,xm/���+j,...,xm(������1)/���+j)
is opened and combined to create intermediate dishes (
z1,...,zm
).
These dishes are further combined and shared amongst honest chefs, while ensuring that the adversary���s changes are taken into account.
Cooking Process (
��part���prod
protocol):
Chefs receive their secret ingredients (values to be multiplied
Jx1K,...,JxkK
).
They invoke specific tools and techniques (
fprand2k, fpack���mult, etc.
) to process these ingredients.
For each ingredient set, chefs collaboratively work to create intermediate dishes (
Js���1jK, JyjK, Jz[1,j]K, etc.
), with the head chef coordinating and checking their work.
Intermediate dishes are further processed and combined to create the final dish (
JoutjK
), with each chef contributing to the process.
Outcome:
Every chef (party) in the kitchen ends up with a portion of the final dish, created through their collaborative effort while keeping the original recipes confidential.
Explanation:
The protocol described ensures that all participating parties can collaboratively compute the partial products of given vectors without revealing their individual inputs.
Each party holds "packed secret shares" of vectors, and through a series of computations (akin to preparing and combining ingredients), they arrive at the desired outcome while ensuring confidentiality and integrity.
The metaphor simplifies the computational process, providing an intuitive understanding of how inputs are shared, processed, and combined securely within the protocol.
I think you can simplify it even more. The cooks don't see what the other cooks are making. They have an ingredient list for what they other cooks made last time, but not this time. They have a chart with the current prices of each ingredient and the preparation time. They have only 50$ to spend and have to make five different meals, but only one side from each dish will be chosen for the customer.
ChatGPT
Absolutely! Let���s simplify further:
Metaphor: Blindfolded Chefs Creating a Meal
Kitchen Setup:
Each blindfolded chef (party
P
) has a secret ingredient list.
They know what others used previously but not what they have now.
There���s a budget ($50) and time constraint.
Steps:
Preparation:
Each chef gets a secret ingredient list for today (shares
Jx1K,...,JxkK
).
They are aware of potential mistakes from others (corrupted parties
Corr
).
Combining Ingredients:
Chefs blindly prepare their part of dishes using their secret ingredients.
The combination of these parts creates potential side dishes without revealing the exact ingredients used by each chef.
Cooking Process:
Each chef starts cooking based on their secret ingredients and knowledge from previous meals.
They have a guideline (the protocol) to combine their part efficiently without overspending.
Through this process, they create potential sides for the final meal, unaware of what the others have made.
Final Selection:
In the end, only one side from each prepared dish is selected to serve to the customer. The combination of these sides forms the complete meal, but the chefs still don���t know the details of others��� ingredients.
Outcome:
Each chef has contributed to a collective meal without knowing the other chefs��� specific ingredients. This results in a variety of side dishes that are combined to form a complete meal while staying under budget and time constraints.
Explanation:
This simplified metaphor demonstrates how each party contributes to the final outcome without revealing their inputs. The protocol ensures that this process is done efficiently and securely, resulting in the desired computation (meal) without exposing each participant's information (ingredients).

A metaphor for understanding zero-knowledge proofs based on this. In the basement there is a supercomputer and fractal coal harddrives that is heating the kelp pond.
ChatGPT
Certainly, let's construct a metaphor:
Metaphor: Zero-Knowledge Proofs as a University's Basement Supercomputer
In our ideal university, the
"Basement Supercomputer"
represents the
zero-knowledge proof system
. Just like the supercomputer, the zero-knowledge proof is highly powerful, capable of processing complex tasks while keeping the information secure and confidential.
Supercomputer���s Tasks:
The supercomputer in the basement is performing intricate computations. It is utilizing fractal coal hard drives (which are efficient and self-replicating storage units) and generating heat as it processes information.
Heating the Kelp Pond:
The heat generated is used beneficially to warm a kelp pond located adjacent to it. This represents the utility derived from zero-knowledge proofs. The heat (or value) is transferred without revealing the specifics of the computations (or data) being processed.
Zero-Knowledge in Action:
Students and faculty (users) are aware that the supercomputer is performing tasks and providing value (heating the kelp pond), but they do not have access to or knowledge of the specific data being processed. This reflects the principle of zero-knowledge - receiving utility without compromising on the confidentiality of data.
Interaction with Users:
When students need to use the supercomputer (implement a zero-knowledge proof), they don���t directly interact with it. Instead, they submit their problems (transactions or data) to a secure interface, which ensures that the supercomputer performs the required task without exposing sensitive data to anyone.
Conclusion:
This metaphor elegantly encapsulates the essence of zero-knowledge proofs:
Secrecy:
Like the inaccessible basement supercomputer, the details within a zero-knowledge proof remain confidential.
Utility:
The computations provide value (like heating the kelp pond) without revealing the details of the process.
Interaction:
Users can engage with the system confidently, knowing that it's secure and their data won���t be exposed.
This system, much like a zero-knowledge proof, enables a secure, confidential, and efficient exchange of value and information, reinforcing the core principles of privacy and utility in a digital environment.
I am basing some of my ideas on the world of null-A and general semantics
ChatGPT
The world of Null-A and general semantics, as introduced by A.E. van Vogt and Alfred Korzybski respectively, present a fascinating framework to understand and reinterpret how humans perceive and interact with reality.
Null-A
Non-Aristotelian Logic
: Null-A or Non-Aristotelian logic refers to a way of thinking that goes beyond, or is alternative to, traditional Aristotelian logic. In Null-A, there is an emphasis on avoiding identification of words and things, recognizing that the map (language) is not the territory (reality).
General Semantics
Understanding and Reaction
: General semantics focuses on the way individuals understand and react to the events happening around them, rather than the events themselves. It���s about the interpretation and the meaning that we assign to those events.
Applying to Your Ideas:
Interpretation of Knowledge
: Your university metaphor can be seen through the lens of general semantics and Null-A as a symbol of how knowledge is interpreted, processed, and utilized without being directly accessible or understood by all.
Understanding Zero-Knowledge Proofs
: Zero-Knowledge Proofs can be perceived as a form of non-Aristotelian processing of information where the 'territory' (actual data) is never fully revealed, but the 'map' (proof) is still effectively communicated.
Enhanced Learning Experience
: The subjects you've listed (Cattailology, kelpology, etc.) are specialties that demand an understanding beyond traditional classification and identification, aligning with a non-Aristotelian approach to learning and comprehension.
Conclusion:
Using the frameworks of Null-A and general semantics allows for a richer, more nuanced understanding of your concepts. It provides a unique lens to view and develop your ideas around privacy, knowledge, and education in a way that challenges traditional thinking and opens up new possibilities for interpretation and application.
The Games Machine, a vastly powerful computer that plays a major role in A. E. van Vogt's The World of Null-A (serialized in Astounding Science Fiction in 1945)
ChatGPT
Certainly, The Games Machine in "The World of Null-A" is a crucial and interesting concept to delve into.
Description:
Role
: The Games Machine plays a pivotal role in the novel, serving as a mechanism that tests individuals' cognitive abilities and assigns them to societal roles and positions based on their performances. It represents an authority that oversees and structures the society described in the book.
Function
: It operates by assessing individuals' proficiency in Non-Aristotelian (Null-A) logic and thinking, which is a departure from conventional Aristotelian logical structures. Null-A promotes a more flexible, adaptable, and holistic approach to thinking and understanding.
Impact
: The Games Machine significantly influences the lives of individuals and the society at large, as its assessments determine individuals' careers, social status, and even their self-worth and identity.
Analogy for Understanding Zero-Knowledge Proofs:
Knowledge Assessment Without Revelation
: The Games Machine can be analogized to a Zero-Knowledge Proof in that it evaluates individuals��� capabilities without revealing or exposing the details of their minds or thought processes. The assessment is done in a way where the specific knowledge within an individual is not made public, yet their proficiency is verified and acknowledged, much like how a Zero-Knowledge Proof verifies the validity without revealing the information itself.
Authoritative Verification
: Similar to Zero-Knowledge Proofs, The Games Machine serves as an authoritative verifier that can confirm the authenticity or validity of a piece of information (in this case, a person���s cognitive abilities) without disclosing the information itself.
Privacy Preservation
: Both concepts underline the importance of privacy and confidentiality. In the context of the novel, individuals maintain the privacy of their thought processes and cognitive functions, while in Zero-Knowledge Proofs, the privacy of crucial information is preserved even as its validity is confirmed.
Conclusion:
Drawing parallels between The Games Machine and Zero-Knowledge Proofs can offer unique insights into the significance and application of privacy, authority, and knowledge verification in different contexts. Both concepts explore how information can be validated and utilized without being fully disclosed, reflecting broader themes of privacy, identity, and knowledge in society.

I think the title zero-knowledge roots also refers to being born without developed ideas, a blank slate, and that can multiple people can work together on a project without knowing the end result or fully integrated product
ChatGPT
Absolutely, that���s a thoughtful interpretation. The term "Zero-Knowledge Roots" can indeed be seen as a metaphor representing the inception of ideas and learning, akin to a blank slate or tabula rasa. Here's a bit of unpacking based on your interpretation:
Zero-Knowledge Roots as Learning and Collaboration:
Blank Slate (Tabula Rasa):
Every individual is born without inherent ideas or knowledge, much like a system initialized with zero knowledge. As they grow, they acquire knowledge and form ideas through experience and learning, much like how systems in computing gradually accumulate and process data.
Collaborative Creation:
In a collaborative project, contributors may work on individual components without a complete understanding of the final product. Each contributor adds their 'knowledge' or expertise to the project, building towards an outcome that no single contributor could achieve alone. This process can be seen as building a complex system from zero knowledge, where each contributor adds a piece to the puzzle.
Unpredictable Outcomes:
Just as individuals can't predict the exact course of their learning and personal development, project contributors may not foresee the final result of their combined efforts. The end product is often more than the sum of its parts, reflecting the synergy of diverse contributions and the dynamic process of collaborative creation.
Connecting with Previous Topics:
Learning Process:
The ideal university model discussed earlier fits well with this interpretation. Students enter the educational system with limited knowledge, gradually acquiring and integrating new information and skills as they navigate through various unique and specialized subjects.
Innovative Projects:
The technological ideas like fractal coral computation, robotic spiders, and other innovative technologies represent the culmination of collaborative efforts and creative thinking, with contributors possibly unaware of the eventual impactful outcomes of their individual work.
Zero-Knowledge Proofs:
In the realm of cryptography and secure communication, the principle of zero-knowledge proofs allows for verification without revealing the underlying information, aligning with the concept of working towards a goal without complete visibility of all components.
Conclusion:
"Zero-Knowledge Roots" metaphorically encapsulates the essence of learning, development, and collaboration from a foundational level. It beautifully ties together the concepts of individual growth, collective creation, and the secure, incremental building of knowledge and technology.
