ZOOpt is a python package for Zeroth-Order Optimization.

Zeroth-order optimization (a.k.a. derivative-free optimization/black-box optimization) does not rely on the gradient of the objective function, but instead, learns from samples of the search space. It is suitable for optimizing functions that are nondifferentiable, with many local minima, or even unknown but only testable.

ZOOpt implements some state-of-the-art zeroth-order optimization methods and their parallel versions. Users only need to add serveral keywords to use parallel optimization on a single machine. For large-scale distributed optimization across multiple machines, please refer to Distributed ZOOpt.

ZOOpt is a toolkit designed to navigate the complex landscape of optimization problems that resemble a maze with hidden treasures, minus the traditional map: the gradient information. In the realm of optimization, gradients act as a compass, directing search algorithms towards the minimum (or maximum) of a function. However, when this compass is unavailable���either because the function is as inscrutable as a coded message or as rugged as a mountain range with countless valleys���zeroth-order optimization techniques, like those implemented in ZOOpt, step in as a form of cartography that relies on exploration rather than precise navigation.
The Ackley function serves as an ideal testing ground for such techniques. Picture it as a multidimensional landscape filled with hills and valleys, where the goal is to find the lowest point without a clear line of sight. Each evaluation of the Ackley function provides a glimpse into the terrain at a specific location, but without the gradient, there's no direct indication of which way to proceed. Instead, ZOOpt and its zeroth-order methods sample the terrain at various points, akin to sending out scouts in different directions to report back on the lay of the land. Over time, and through a process akin to piecing together a map from these reports, ZOOpt gradually hones in on the location of the treasure���the global minimum.
The ability to operate without gradients makes ZOOpt a versatile tool for a wide array of problems, especially those where the function's form is a mystery or its surface is too jagged for gradient-based methods to navigate effectively. By relying on samples and smart exploration strategies, ZOOpt sidesteps the limitations that gradients impose, offering a path to optimization that is more akin to an expedition into unknown territories than a straightforward march down a well-trodden path.

ZOOpt: Toolbox for Derivative-Free Optimization

Abstract 
Recent advances in derivative-free optimization allow eff i cient approximation of the global-optimal 
solutions of sophisticated functions, such as functions with many local optima, non-differentiable 
and non-continuous functions. This article describes the ZOOpt (Zeroth Order Optimization) tool- 
box that provides eff i cient derivative-free solvers and is designed easy to use. ZOOpt provides 
single-machine parallel optimization on the basis of python core and multi-machine distributed 
optimization for time-consuming tasks by incorporating with the Ray framework ��� a famous plat- 
form for building distributed applications. ZOOpt particularly focuses on optimization problems in 
machine learning, addressing high-dimensional and noisy problems such as hyper-parameter tun- 
ing and direct policy search. The toolbox is maintained toward a ready-to-use tool in real-world 
machine learning tasks.

1. Derivative-Free Optimization 
Optimization, taking x���= argminx���Xf(x) 
as a general representative, is fundamental in machine 
learning. Derivative-free optimization, also termed as zeroth-order or black-box optimization, in- 
volves a class of optimization algorithms that do not rely on gradient information. In recent years, 
derivative-free optimization has achieved remarkable applications in machine learning, including 
hyper-parameter optimization (Thornton et al., 2013; Feurer et al., 2015), direct policy search (Sal- 
imans et al., 2017; Hu et al., 2017), subset selection (Qian et al., 2015), image classif i cation (Real 
et al., 2017), etc. Representative derivative-free algorithms include evolutionary algorithms (Hansen 
et al., 2003), Bayesian optimization (Shahriari et al., 2016), optimistic optimization (Munos, 2014), 
model-based optimization (Yu et al., 2016), etc. 
2. Classif i cation-based Optimization

ods usually vary in the design of the model. For example, cross-entropy methods (de Boer et al., 
2005) may use Gaussian distribution as the model, Bayesian optimization methods (Snoek et al., 
2012) employ Gaussian process to model the joint distribution, and the estimation of distribution 
algorithms have incorporated many kinds of learning models. Classif i cation-based optimization 
algorithms learn a particular type of model: classif i cation model, leading to theoretical grounded 
properties of optimization performance. A classif i cation model learns to classify solutions into two 
categories, good or bad. Then solutions are sampled from the good areas. SRACOS(Hu et al., 
2017) is a recently proposed classif i cation-based optimization algorithm. Unlike other model-based 
optimization algorithms, the sampling region of SRACOSis learned by a simple classif i er, which 
maintains an axis-parallel rectangle to cover all the positive but no negative solutions. SRACOS 
shows outstanding performance in empirical studies. With the aim of supporting machine learning 
tasks, ZOOpt implements a set of classif i cation-based methods that are eff i cient and performance- 
guaranteed, with add-ons handling noise and high-dimensionality.

The section you've outlined provides a concise yet comprehensive guide to utilizing ZOOpt for optimization tasks, illustrating the process with the classic Ackley function example. This framework is particularly adept at navigating the intricacies of optimization in environments where the landscape is not only rugged but also obscured by the absence of gradient information. Let's explore the essence of this process, akin to charting a course through uncharted waters using innovative navigational tools.
Single-Machine Optimization
At the heart of ZOOpt's approach to single-machine optimization are three conceptual pillars:
Objective
,
Parameter
, and
Opt.min
. These components act as the navigator, compass, and oars of your optimization journey, respectively.
Objective
: This is where you map out the terrain, defining both the function to minimize (or maximize) and the space within which to search. It's akin to setting the destination and boundaries of your expedition.
Parameter
: Here, you select your tools and provisions, specifying the parameters that will govern the optimization algorithm's behavior. This step is like choosing the best gear for your journey, ensuring you're prepared for the conditions ahead.
Opt.min
: Acting as the command to embark, this interface launches the optimization process. With your destination set and provisions packed, this is where you push off from the shore, initiating the search for the optimal solution.
The provided example for optimizing the Ackley function���a challenging multidimensional landscape filled with numerous local minima���serves as a testament to ZOOpt's capability to find the lowest valley in a range of mountains shrouded in fog. By defining the problem and its constraints within the
Objective
and
Parameter
objects, the process of optimization is reduced to a single command. This simplicity masks the complexity of the task at hand, much like a skilled sailor making a difficult maneuver seem effortless.
Optimization in High-Dimensional Spaces
The example also touches on the challenges of high-dimensional optimization, a scenario comparable to navigating a vast ocean with currents moving in all directions. In such spaces, traditional methods falter, much like a ship without a compass in stormy seas. ZOOpt, with its efficient and strategic search mechanisms, is designed to navigate these tumultuous waters, finding a path to the desired destination against all odds.
Parallel Optimization
For time-consuming tasks, ZOOpt introduces the concept of parallel optimization, akin to deploying multiple ships in a coordinated search across the ocean. This approach allows for the distribution of the computational burden across several "vessels," each exploring different parts of the search space simultaneously. By setting the
parallel
parameter to
True
and specifying the number of "server_num" or parallel units, ZOOpt can significantly expedite the journey towards the optimal solution, showcasing its ability to adapt and scale according to the challenge at hand.

Ouroboros: Speculative Decoding with Large Model Enhanced Drafting
Weilin Zhao, Yuxiang Huang, Xu Han, Chaojun Xiao, Zhiyuan Liu, Maosong Sun
Drafting-then-verifying decoding methods such as speculative decoding are widely adopted training-free methods to accelerate the inference of large language models (LLMs). Instead of employing an autoregressive process to decode tokens sequentially, speculative decoding initially creates drafts with an efficient small model. Then LLMs are required to conduct verification and correction in a non-autoregressive fashion to minimize time overhead. Generating longer drafts can lead to even more significant speedups once verified, but also incurs substantial trial and error costs if it fails. Suffering from the high verification failure probability, existing decoding methods cannot draft too much content for verification at one time, achieving sub-optimal inference acceleration. In this paper, we introduce Ouroboros, which constructs a phrase candidate pool from the verification process of LLMs to provide candidates for draft generation of the small model. Thereby, Ouroboros can further improve the efficiency and effectiveness of the initial drafts. The experimental results on typical text generation tasks show that Ouroboros achieves speedups of up to 1.9x and 2.8x compared to lookahead decoding and speculative decoding, respectively
ChatGPT
ChatGPT
The paper titled "Ouroboros: Speculative Decoding with Large Model Enhanced Drafting" introduces a novel method to enhance the efficiency and effectiveness of language model inference, particularly focusing on accelerating the process without sacrificing accuracy. This method represents a significant advancement in the realm of natural language processing (NLP) by optimizing the way large language models (LLMs) generate text.
Conceptual Overview
The core innovation of Ouroboros lies in its unique approach to decoding, which diverges from traditional autoregressive methods that generate text sequentially. Instead, it employs a two-stage process:
Drafting with a Small Model
: Initially, a smaller, more efficient model is used to create drafts. This step represents a departure from the computationally intensive process of generating text token by token, aiming to lay down a rough outline of the desired output with minimal time investment.
Verification and Correction with LLMs
: Following the initial draft, a large language model steps in to perform non-autoregressive verification and correction. This phase is crucial for ensuring the quality and coherence of the generated text, refining the draft into a polished output.
The Innovation of Ouroboros
What sets Ouroboros apart is its strategy for minimizing the verification failure probability, a common challenge that limits the effectiveness of speculative decoding methods. Traditional approaches often hesitate to draft extensive content at once due to the high risk of errors, which would necessitate costly corrections. Ouroboros overcomes this by constructing a phrase candidate pool derived from the LLM's verification process. This pool then informs the drafting stage, allowing the small model to generate more accurate and extensive drafts that are likely to pass verification with fewer errors.
Performance and Impact
Ouroboros demonstrates remarkable improvements in inference speed, achieving up to 1.9x and 2.8x faster performance compared to lookahead and speculative decoding methods, respectively. This efficiency does not come at the cost of accuracy or coherence, thanks to the innovative use of a candidate pool that guides the drafting process.
Implications for NLP and AI
The significance of Ouroboros extends beyond its immediate performance gains. By enabling faster and more reliable text generation, it opens new avenues for real-time NLP applications, from conversational agents to content creation tools, where speed and accuracy are paramount. Furthermore, this method illustrates a broader principle in AI development: leveraging the strengths of both small and large models in a complementary fashion can lead to substantial advancements in efficiency and effectiveness.
In essence, Ouroboros symbolizes a leap forward in the quest for more agile and accurate language models, embodying a cyclical process of drafting and verification that mirrors the mythological ouroboros���a serpent eating its tail, representing cyclicality and renewal. This approach not only marks a significant technical achievement but also illustrates the potential for creative and symbiotic interactions between different scales of AI models in advancing the frontiers of natural language understanding and generation.
