n: Glossary of algebraic topology

Sure, here's a basic overview of some common terms you might encounter in algebraic topology:

1. **Topology**: This is the mathematical study of the properties of space that are preserved under continuous transformations. It's often described as "rubber sheet geometry" because it doesn't concern itself with things like distances or angles.

2. **Algebraic Topology**: This is a branch of mathematics that uses tools from abstract algebra to study topological spaces. The basic goal is to find algebraic invariants that classify topological spaces up to homeomorphism, though most classify up to homotopy equivalence.

3. **Homotopy**: Two continuous functions from one topological space to another are called homotopic if one can be "continuously deformed" into the other.

4. **Homology**: This is a way of assigning a sequence of abelian groups or modules to a topological space that can, in a sense, be used to count the number of holes of different dimensions in the space.

5. **Cohomology**: This is a tool from algebraic topology, the dual concept to homology. Cohomology groups are used to classify the 'holes' in a space, but from a co-dimension perspective.

6. **Fundamental Group**: This is the group of all possible loops in a space that can be shrunk to a point (while staying within the space). It is one of the most basic invariants in algebraic topology.

7. **Homotopy Groups**: These are generalizations of the fundamental group, which capture information about the different possible "paths" or "loops" within a topological space.

8. **Fiber Bundle**: This is a topological space that is locally a product space, but globally may have a different topological structure.

9. **Manifold**: This is a space that is locally similar to Euclidean space. Manifolds can be used to describe a variety of physical and mathematical objects, such as surfaces or the space-time in general relativity.

10. **Vector Bundle**: This is a topological construction that makes precise the idea of a family of vector spaces parameterized by another space.

11. **Sheaf**: This is a tool for systematically tracking locally defined data attached to the open sets of a topological space.

Please note that these definitions are very basic and each of these topics can be explored in much greater depth. Algebraic topology is a complex field that builds upon many layers of mathematical knowledge.

ghost@gpt-4 3> topology glossary

Sure, here are some basic terms you might encounter in topology:

1. **Topology**: The mathematical study of the properties of space that are preserved under continuous transformations.

2. **Topological Space**: A set of points, along with a set of neighbourhoods for each point, that satisfies a set of axioms relating points and neighbourhoods.

3. **Open Set**: A set that, intuitively, does not include its "boundary". More formally, a set is open if for every point in the set, there exists a neighborhood entirely contained within the set.

4. **Closed Set**: A set whose complement is an open set.

5. **Compact Space**: A topological space in which every open cover has a finite sub-cover. This is a generalization of the concept of a closed and bounded set in Euclidean space.

6. **Connected Space**: A topological space that cannot be divided into two disjoint nonempty open sets.

7. **Continuity**: A function between topological spaces is continuous if the pre-image of every open set is open.

8. **Homeomorphism**: A continuous function between topological spaces that has a continuous inverse function. Homeomorphisms are the isomorphisms in the category of topological spaces—that is, they are the mappings that preserve all the topological properties of a given space.

9. **Metric Space**: A set where a notion of distance (called a metric) is defined.

10. **Hausdorff Space**: A topological space where for any two distinct points there exist neighbourhoods of each which are disjoint from each other.

11. **Basis (or Base) of a Topology**: A collection of open subsets of a topological space that can be used to generate the entire topology.

12. **Subspace**: A subset of a topological space that inherits the topology from the larger space.

13. **Manifold**: A topological space that near each point resembles Euclidean space.

Remember, topology is a complex field with many more definitions and concepts. These are just some of the basics.

1. **Topological Space**: This is the most fundamental object in topology. It is a set of points, along with a set of neighborhoods for each point, satisfying a set of axioms related to points and neighborhoods.

2. **Basis (Base) for a Topology**: A collection of subsets (called "basis elements") that, in a certain sense, generate the topology.

4. **Continuity**: A function between topological spaces is continuous if the pre-image of every open set is open.

5. **Homeomorphisms**: These are continuous functions from one topological space to another that have a continuous inverse function. They are the isomorphisms in the category of topological spaces, preserving all the topological properties of a given space.

6. **Compactness**: This is a property that generalizes the notion of a subset of Euclidean space being closed (that is, containing all its limit points) and bounded (that is, having all its points lie within some fixed distance of each other).

7. **Connectedness and Disconnectedness**: These are properties that describe whether a space can be split into disjoint nonempty open sets.

8. **Convergence**: This concept describes the behavior of a sequence of points within a topological space, particularly how they approach a specific point.

9. **Separation Axioms**: These are conditions that a topological space may or may not meet. The most common are the Hausdorff conditions.

10. **Metric Spaces**: These are a specific type of topological space where a metric (a function defining a concept of distance) is defined.

11. **Covering Spaces**: This is a space that maps onto another space. The properties of covering spaces are used in algebraic topology.

12. **Uniform Spaces**: This is a set with a uniform structure, which is a slightly more general concept than a metric space.

These are just a few of the many topics in general topology, which is a field that provides a foundational framework for many branches of mathematics.

ghost@gpt-4 6> List of geometric topology topics

Sure, here are some major topics within the field of geometric topology:

1. **Manifolds**: These are spaces that are locally similar to Euclidean space. Manifolds can be used to describe a variety of physical and mathematical phenomena.

2. **Differential Topology**: This is the field dealing with differentiable functions on differentiable manifolds. It is closely related to differential geometry and together they make up the geometric theory of differentiable manifolds.

3. **Knot Theory**: This is the study of mathematical knots. While inspired by knots which appear in daily life in shoelaces and rope, a mathematician's knot differs in that the ends are joined together so that it cannot be undone.

(0.7/8192/2807): default
ghost@gpt-4 8> Topological property

In mathematics, a topological property or topological invariant is a property of a topological space that is invariant under homeomorphisms. That is, a property of spaces is a topological property if whenever a space X possesses that property every space homeomorphic to X possesses that property as well.

Here are a few examples:

1. **Compactness**: A topological space is said to be compact if any of its open covers has a finite subcover. This property is preserved under homeomorphisms.

2. **Connectedness**: A space is said to be connected if it cannot be divided into two disjoint non-empty open sets. This is also a topological property.

3. **Countability Properties**: These include properties such as separability (existence of a countable dense subset), first countability (existence of a countable base at each point), and second countability (existence of a countable base for the topology).

4. **Dimension Properties**: These refer to various notions of the dimension of a topological space, including Lebesgue covering dimension and inductive dimension.

5. **Metric Properties**: These are properties that can be defined for metric spaces, and are invariant under homeomorphisms, such as complete metric, bounded metric, etc.

6. **Homotopy Properties**: These include properties like simple connectedness (every loop can be continuously shrunk to a point).

7. **Topology of Continuity**: A property of a function that can be defined in terms of the continuity of functions into or out of the space is a topological property. For example, compactness can be defined in terms of the continuity of functions from the space into the real numbers.

Remember, a topological property, by definition, must be preserved under homeomorphism. If a property is not preserved under homeomorphism, it is not considered a topological property.

ghost@gpt-4 9> Simplex

number
In geometry, a simplex is a generalization of the notion of a triangle or tetrahedron to arbitrary dimensions. The simplex is the geometric figure formed by connecting a set of points in a space in such a way that the simplest possible polygon/polyhedron can be formed.

Here are some examples of simplexes in different dimensions:

- A 0-simplex
is a point.
- A 1-simplex
is a line segment (a pair of points connected by a line).
- A 2-simplex
is a triangle (three points forming a polygon).
- A 3-simplex
is a tetrahedron (four points forming a polyhedron).
- In
general, an n-simplex is the convex hull of (n+1) affinely independent points in a Euclidean space.

These are often used in computational geometry, computer graphics and in the construction of meshes for the numerical solution of partial differential equations. Also, they are vastly used in algebraic topology, specifically in simplicial complexes, which are topological spaces made up by gluing simplexes together.

(0.7/8192/3432): default
ghost@gpt-4 10> Simplicial complex

A simplicial complex is a set composed of points, line segments, triangles, and their n-dimensional counterparts (all of which are called simplices) that satisfies two specific properties:

1. Every face of a simplex in the set is also in the set. A face of a simplex is any subset of its vertices (for example, a triangle's faces include its vertices, its edges, and the triangle itself).

2. The intersection of any two simplices in the set is a face of each of them.

Essentially, a simplicial complex is a space that is built up from simple pieces. Each piece is a simplex, and the complex satisfies the two properties listed above.

Simplicial complexes are used in algebraic topology to help define homology groups, which are used to classify topological spaces up to homeomorphism. They are also used in the study of finite topological spaces and are helpful in forming a geometric understanding of topological spaces.

(0.7/8192/3644): default
ghost@gpt-4 11> Polytope

In geometry, a polytope is a general term for a geometric object with flat sides, which exists in any general number of dimensions. A polygon is a 2-dimensional polytope, a polyhedron is a 3-dimensional polytope, and in general, an n-dimensional polytope is often called an "n-polytope".

Here are examples of polytopes in different dimensions:

- A 0-polytope
is a point.
- A 1-polytope
is a line segment.
- A 2-polytope
is a polygon (including triangles, squares, pentagons, etc.).
- A 3-polytope
is a polyhedron (like a cube, tetrahedron, dodecahedron, etc.).
- A 4-polytope
(in four dimensions) is also known as a polychoron or a 4D polyhedron. An example is a tesseract or a 4D "cube".
- In
general, an n-polytope is a bounded region of an n-dimensional space.

These polytopes can be further defined and studied in various ways depending upon the branches of mathematics such as combinatorics, topology, and linear programming.

(0.7/8192/3917): default
ghost@gpt-4 12> Triangulation

In the field of mathematics and more specifically in topology, a triangulation of a topological space X is a subdivision of X into simplices with the property that the intersection of any two simplices in the subdivision is either empty or a face of each of them. Triangulations are often used to study topological spaces by approximating them with the simpler simplices.

More generally, in the context of geometry and computer graphics, triangulation often refers to the process of dividing a geometric object into triangles. This can be applied in various practical scenarios. For example, in computer graphics, complex surfaces are often broken down into triangles in order to render them on a screen.

In the field of numerical methods, particularly those for the solution of partial differential equations, triangulations are used to generate unstructured grids of triangles (in 2D) or tetrahedra (in 3D) that form the basis for finite element and finite volume methods.

In computational geometry, triangulation is also used to solve problems such as the planar point location problem and the polygon triangulation problem.

(0.7/8192/4150): default
ghost@gpt-4 13> Barycentric subdivision

A barycentric subdivision is a standard way of dividing an arbitrary convex polygon, polyhedron, or polytope into simplices (triangles, tetrahedra, or their higher-dimensional analogs).

In the barycentric subdivision, the original complex is subdivided by adding a vertex at the barycenter (center of mass) of each simplex in the original complex, and then connecting these barycenters to each other and to the vertices of the original simplex.

Here's a simple example in two dimensions: consider a square. The barycentric subdivision of this square would involve drawing lines from the center of the square to each of its vertices, thus dividing the square into four triangles.

In topology, barycentric subdivisions are often used because they can make a complex "nicer" in certain ways, and they can be used to define the notion of a "subdivision" of a topological space, which is an important concept in the theory of simplicial homology.

ghost@gpt-4 15> Abstract simplicial complex

An abstract simplicial complex is a purely combinatorial description of the geometric notion of a simplicial complex, which is a topological space of a certain kind, built up of simplices.

In an abstract simplicial complex, we don't explicitly think about the geometry of the simplices, but just about the combinatorial data of how they are connected to each other.

Formally, an abstract simplicial complex is a set of non-empty finite sets closed under the operation of taking non-empty subsets. Each of these finite sets is considered a simplex. For example, if {1,2,3} is in the complex, then so must be {1,2}, {1,3}, {2,3}, {1}, {2}, and {3}. The integer elements {1}, {2}, {3}, etc. are often interpreted as vertices, pairs {i,j} as edges, triples {i,j,k} as 2-dimensional faces, and so on.

Abstract simplicial complexes are often used in computational geometry and algebraic topology. For instance, they provide a combinatorial approach to homology theory.

(0.7/8192/4641): default
ghost@gpt-4 16> Simplicial set

A simplicial set is a mathematical concept used in the field of algebraic topology. It's a way of describing a space by the simplices it contains, and their relationships.

Formally, a simplicial set is a collection of sets, one for each non-negative integer, along with certain maps between them. The set corresponding to the integer n is thought of as the set of n-dimensional simplices. The maps describe how these simplices are assembled to form the space.

The maps include face maps, which describe how an n-simplex is bounded by (n-1)-simplices, and degeneracy maps, which describe how an n-simplex can be seen as lying inside an (n+1)-simplex.

Simplicial sets are used to define a very general notion of space called an "infinity-topos", and they also provide one of the standard ways of defining homotopy groups. They are a fundamental tool in modern algebraic topology.

(0.7/8192/4855): default
ghost@gpt-4 17> Simplicial category

In mathematics, the simplicial category is a category denoted Δ (or sometimes Δ^op) which serves as the index category for the construction of simplicial objects in other categories, which are used to define simplicial sets and simplicial complexes.

The objects of the simplicial category are finite ordered sets [n] = {0, 1, ..., n} for n ≥ 0, and the morphisms are order-preserving maps.

The simplicial category has a very special property: it is what is known as a "skeletal" category, which means that each of its objects is isomorphic to exactly one object in a full subcategory consisting of a single object from each isomorphism class.

In terms of its role in algebraic topology, the simplicial category provides a combinatorial framework for dealing with topological spaces and continuous maps. The concept of a simplicial object in a category generalizes the notion of a chain complex in an additive category. Simplicial methods are used throughout algebraic topology, algebraic geometry, and in theoretical computer science.

(0.7/8192/5097): default
ghost@gpt-4 18> Chain (algebraic topology)

In algebraic topology, a branch of mathematics, a chain is a formal linear combination of simplices (or cells) of a given degree.

More formally, let's consider a simplicial complex K. The n-chain group of K, denoted C_n(K), is the free abelian group (or free module over a given ring) whose generators are the n-dimensional simplices of K. An element of C_n(K) is called an n-chain and can be written as a finite formal sum of n-simplices with coefficients in the chosen ring (often the ring is the integers, in which case we speak of singular homology, or the field with two elements, in which case we speak of mod 2 homology).

Chains are used to define homology groups, which are fundamental algebraic invariants in algebraic topology. The boundary operation on chains (which subtracts the ends of a chain) is used to define these homology groups: the nth homology group is the nth chain group modulo the image of the (n+1)st chain group under the boundary operation.

(0.7/8192/5339): default
ghost@gpt-4 19> Betti number

In algebraic topology, a branch of mathematics, the Betti numbers are used to distinguish topological spaces based on the connectivity of n-dimensional simplicial complexes. They are named after the Italian mathematician Enrico Betti.

More specifically, the nth Betti number refers to the rank of the nth homology group, which roughly measures the number of n-dimensional holes in a given space.

For example:

- The
0th Betti number represents the number of connected components.
- The
1st Betti number represents the number of "circular holes" (for example, a doughnut shape has a 1st Betti number of 2, because there are two distinct holes).
- The
2nd Betti number represents the number of "voids" or "cavities" (for example, a hollow sphere has a 2nd Betti number of 1, because there is one enclosed void in the shape).

Betti numbers are an important tool in understanding the topology of a space, and are used in fields as diverse as data analysis, physics, and computer graphics, as well as in pure mathematics.
