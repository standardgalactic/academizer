Aniara : a review of man in time 
and space 

By Harry Martinson

My first meeting with my Doris 
beams
with light to make the light itself
more fair.
But let me simply say about my 
first
and just as simple meeting with my 
Doris
that now it forms a picture all can
see

every day before them in all the 
halls
sluicing refugees to lift-off 
zones
for urgent excursions to the 
tundrasphere
these present years, when Earth,
become unclean
with toxic radiation, is accorded
a time of calm, repose and 
quarantine.

She fills in cards, her five small 
nails a-glint
like dim lamps through the 
concourse twilight.

 
She says: Sign your name on this 
line here,
where the light is pouring down 
from my blond hair.

She says: You’re asked to keep 
this card at hand,
and should some danger of the 
kind that stand
listed here on page two hundred 
eight
threaten havoc to our time and 
state,
then you come here and in the 
space assigned

 
put down exactly what you have in
mind.
The part of Mars where you’d 
prefer to go,
the tundra east or west, is 
checked off here.
One jar of uncontaminated soil
is owed by everyone, as stated 
there.
At least three cubic feet, as 
sealed by me,
will be recorded for each 
traveler’s share.

She looks at me with the disdain 
that beauty

 
so easily conceives when looking 
round
at folk on twisted paragraphic 
crutches
scrambling up and down the steps 
at lift-off ground.
Off through the fire-exit, 
numbers more and more
she watches disappear, to new 
worlds bound.

The monumental foolishness of 
living
is thus made obvious to one and all
who’d spent years hunting for 
one crevice giving

 
access for a gleam of hope to fall
into that hall where processed 
emigrants
start up each time thev hear
a rocket-siren squall.

Goldonder Aniara shuts, the siren 
gives the wail
for field-egression by the known 
routine
and then the gyrospinner sets in 
towing
the goldonder upward to the 
zenith light,

 
 
where magnetrinos blocking field-
intensity
soon signal level-zero and field-
release occurs.
And like a giant pupa without 
weight,
vibrationless, Aniara gyrates clear
and free of interference out 
from Earth.
A purely routine start, no 
misadventures,
a normal gvromatic field-release.
Who could imagine that this very 
flight
was doomed to be a space-flight 
like to none,

which was to sever us from Sun 
and Earth,
from ‘Mars and Venus and from 
Dorisvale.

A swerve to clear the Hondo 
asteroid
(herewith proclaimed discovered) 
took us off our course.
We came too wide of Mars, slipped 
from its orbit
and, to avoid the field of Jupiter,
we settled on the curve of 
I.C.E.-twelve

 
 
within the Magdalena Field’s 
external ring;
but, meeting with great swarms of 
leonids,
we headed farther off to Yko-
nine.
In the Field of Sari-sixteen we 
gave up attempts
to turn around.
As we held our curve, a ring of 
rocks
echographically gave back a torus-
image
whose empty center we sought 
eagerly.

We found it too, but at such 
dizzying angles
that the passage to it led to 
breakdown
of the Saba Unit, which was hit 
hard by space-stones
and great swarms of space-
pebbles.
When the ring had moved off and 
space had cleared,
turning back was possible no 
longer.
We lay with nose-cone pointed at 
the Lyre
nor could any change in course be 
thought of

We lay in dead space, but to our 
good fortune
the gravitation-works were still 
in service,
and heating elements as well as 
lighting
were not disabled.
Of other apparatus some was 
damaged
and other parts less damaged 
could be mended.
Our ill-fate now is irretrievable.
But the mima will hold (we hope) 
until the end.

 
 
That was how the solar system 
closed
its vaulted gateway of the purest
crystal
and severed spaceship Aniara’s 
company
from all the bonds and pledges of 
the sun.
Thus given over to the shock-
stiff void
we spread the call-sign Aniara 
wide
in glass-clear boundlessness, but 
picked up nothing.
Though space-vibrations 
faithfully bore round

our proud Aniara’s last 
communiqué
on widening rings, in spheres and 
cupolas
it moved through empty spaces, 
thrown away.
In anguish sent by us in Aniara
our call-sign faded till it failed: 
Aniara.

The pilots are more nonchalant 
than we
and fatalists of that most recent 
stamp

 
 
which only vacant spaces could 
have formed
through seeming-changeless 
stars’ hypnotic force
on human souls agog for mysteries.
And death fits altogether 
naturally
into their scheme, a constant 
crystal-clear.
But still one sees that after 
five years now
they too look down the pinnacle of
fear.

At some unguarded moment, close-
regarded

 
By me who read the features of 
their faces,
grief can shimmer like a 
phosphorescence
from their observer-eyes.
It’s seen most clearly in our 
female Pilot.
She often sits and stares into the 
mima
and afterward her lovely eyes 
are altered.
They gather a mysterious sheen
of nebulosity, the iris of the eye
is filled with mournful fires,
a hunger-fire searching after 
fuel

for spiritual light, lest that light
fail.
A year or so ago she once 
remarked
that, personally, she would be 
quite willing
for us to polish off death’s 
bitter pill,
make that our farewell dinner 
and be gone.
And many must have thought like 
her—but the passengers
and all the naive emigrants on 
board
who even now scarce know how 
waywardly we lie,

to them the Cabin has its bounden 
duty
and now that Cabin’s duty is 
eternal.

The mima tuned us in to signs of 
life
spread far and wide.
But where, the mima gives no word
of.
We pull in traces, pictures, 
landscapes, scraps of language
being spoken someplace, only 
where?
Our faithful Mima

 
 
does all she can and searches, 
searches, searches.
And her electron-works haul in,
electro-lenses give her 
screener-cells
their coded programs and the 
focus-works collect
the tacis of the third 
indifferent webe
and sounds and scents and pictures
emanate
out of lavish fluxes.
But where their sources lie she 
gives no word of.
That lies outside and always far 
beyond

a mima’s technics and her powers 
of hauling in.

She fishes metaphorically her 
fish
in other seas than those we now 
traverse,
netting metaphorically her cosmic 
catch
from woods and dales in 
undiscovered realms.
I tend the mima, calm the 
emigrants,
cheering them with scenes from 
far-flung reaches

 
of things in thousands which no 
human eye
had ever dreamt of seeing, but 
the mima tells no lies.
And most do understand: they 
know, a mima
can’t be bribed, she is all probity.

They know that the mima’s 
intellectual
and selectronic sharpness in 
transmission
is three thousand eighty times as 
great
as mankind’s could attain if it 
were Mima.

 
As before an altar they bow down
whenever I come in to start the 
mima.
And many times I’ve heard them 
whispering:
Imagine, though, if one could be 
like Mima.

So it’s to the good that the mirna 
has no feelings,
that pride has no place in the 
mima’s insides,
that as from habit she delivers 
images
and tongues and scents from 
undiscovered countries

 
and tends to this unmoved by 
blandishments,
secured by probity, unstirred by 
incense.

She takes no notice that in this 
darkroom
a sect of mima-worshippers bows 
down,
fondling the mima’s pedestal and 
praying
the noble mima’s counsel for the 
journey,
which now has entered on its sixth
long year.

 
 
Then suddenly I see how all has 
changed.
How all these people, all these 
emigrants
are realizing that what once had 
been
has been and gone. And that the 
only world
which we are given is this world in
Mima.
And while we voyage on toward 
certain death
in spaces without land and without
coasts,
the mima gains the power to soothe
all souls

and settle them to quiet and 
composure
before the final hour that man 
must always
meet at last, wherever it be 
lodged.

We still pursue the customs 
formed on Earth
and keep the usages of Dorisvale.
Dividing time into a day and night,
we feign the break of day, the 
dusk, the sunset.
Though space around us is eternal
night

 
 
so starry-cold that those who 
still abide
in Dorisvales have never seen its 
like,
our hearts have joined with the 
chronometer
in following the sunrise and the 
moonrise
and both their settings viewed 
from Dorisvale,
Now it is summer night, Midsummer 
night:
the people stav awake hour after
hour
In the great assemblv-room thev 
all are dancing

save those on watch in the 
infinitude.
Thev’re dancing there until the 
sun comes up
in Dorisvale. Then smack comes 
claritv,
the horror that it never did come
up,
that life, a dream before in Doric 
vales,
is even more a dream in Mima’s 
halls.
And then this ballroom in 
infinitude
fills with whimperings and human 
dreams

and open weeping none hides 
anymore.
Then the dancing stops, the music 
dies,
the hall is emptied, all move to 
the mima.
And for a while she can relieve 
the strain
and rout the memories from the 
shores of Doris.
For frequentlv the world that 
Mima shows us
blots out the world remembered 
and abandoned.
If not, the mima never would have
drawn us

and not been worshipped as a holv 
being,
and no ecstatic women would have 
stroked
in trembling bliss the dais of the 
deity.

Our soul is spent on dreams, 
we’re ever rubbing
dream on dream for want of 
something real,
and each new mummery becomes a 
ladder
to the latest dream-beset 
vacuity.

 
 
And evervthing far off becomes 
our home;
indeed, beyond all pales lies our 
relief—
I share with Dorisvale my every 
grief,
and longing ceaselessly to sojourn 
there
itself is health, is artful living 
here.

Seldom do we take the slightest 
note
of our majestic wonder of a boat,
and only during sermons at a grave

 
does this world dawn on us as all 
we have;
then come a multitude of black 
thoughts flapping
through these vaults that hold 
us bound
filled with the echoes of a prior 
life
and threading an outlandish void 
of sound.
Then we scurry to the mima to 
beseech
those comforts we may see but may
not reach.

 
Then thousands mill in an 
unending flock
through every corridor to Mima’s 
hall.
Then suddenly we might remember
in a flash
that this craft’s length is 
sixteen thousand feet,
its width three thousand and the 
population
milling in its vaults eight thousand
souls,
that it was built for large-scale 
emigration,
that this is onlv one ship out of 
thousands

which all, of like dimensions, like 
design,
ply the placid routes to Mars and 
Venus,
that we alone had canted off our 
course
until one day the ranking 
astrolobe
informed us that we were no 
longer lying
in the inner field, but evervthing
that could be done would 
certainly be done
so life within the outer field 
would be
a pioneering voyage and a probe,

the farthest so far toward the 
field beyond.

When afterwards it struck the 
High Command
that there would never be a 
turning back
and laws obtaining in the outer 
field
were different from those in 
clear control
of placid flight-routines in inner 
space,
first panic set in, then came 
apathy

 
laying between the tempests of 
despair
its chillv doldrum-world of dead 
emotion
till the mima, like a soothing 
friend in need
and filled with specimens of life 
from other worlds,
to soothe us all unlocked her 
vision chest.

There are in the mima certain 
features
it had come up with and which 
function there

 
 
in circuitry of such a kind
as human thought has never 
traveled through.
For example, take the third 
webe’s action
in the focus-works
and the ninth protator’s 
kinematic read-out
in the flicker phase before the 
screener-cell
takes over everything, allots, 
combines.
The inventor was himself 
completely dumbstruck
the day he found that one half 
of the mima

he’d invented lay beyond 
analysis.
That the mima had invented half 
herself.
Well, then, as everybody knows, 
he changed
his title, had the modesty
to realize that once she took full
form
she was the superior and he 
himself
a secondary power, a mimator.
The mimator died, the mima stays 
alive.
The mimator died, the mima found 
her style,

progressed in comprehension of 
herself,
her possibilities, her limitations:
a telegrator without pride, 
industrious, upright,
a patient seeker, lucid and plain-
dealing,
a filter of truth, with no stains 
of her own.
Who then can show surprise if I, 
the rigger
and tender of the mima on Aniara,
am moved to see how men and 
women, blissful
in their faith, fall on their 
knees to her.

And I pray too when they are at 
their prayer
that it be true, all this that is 
occurring,
and that the grace this mima is 
conferring
is glimpses of the light of perfect
grace
that seeks us in the barren house
of space.

The sterile void of space is 
terrifying.
Glass-like is the stare encircling 
us

 
 
and the systems of stars hang 
frozen and still
in the round crystal windows of 
our ship.
Then is the time to cherish visions
in dreams
from Dorisvales and preserve, 
here in the sea
where no water, where no waves 
are moving,
everv dream and every rush of 
feeling.
The smailest sigh is like a gentle 
wind,
all weeping a fountain, the ship 
itself a hind

dashing in silence toward the 
starry Lyre
which, all too far for any human 
mind
to understand the distances or 
times,
has not slid one small inch to 
either side.
Everything looks as if solidified
and frozen to the mount of 
Everlasting,
like grains of diamond in a crystal 
sheath
encompassing the very 
boundlessness

in a massive, radiant hall of utter
distance.
But all the words that have been
used to death,
misused on mountains and on tracts
of water
and landscapes where they never 
did belong
were drawn on in advances by a 
race
with no thought that the words 
which they were wearing down
might at some future date be 
sorely needed
right where they suited best: 
right here, on board

this space ship on its way out to 
the Lyre.

What has been left for us who 
most have need
of every word answering to 
limitless
immeasurably far-outlying Hades?

We are compelled to seek out 
other words
able to shrink and shrivel all to 
comfort us.
The word for Star has now become 
indecent,

 
 
the low names high for loins and 
woman’s breast.
The brain is now a shameful body-
part,
for Hades harvests us at its 
behest.

A man from High Command stands 
amid the people
in the great assembly-halls 
abaft.
He pleads with them not to 
despair, but view their fate
in the clear light of science. He 
maintains

 
 
that it is not the first time this 
has happened.
Sixty years ago a large goldonder
with fourteen thousand souls on 
board was lost,
had instrument-failure heading 
for Orion
and plunged with rapidly 
increasing speed
toward Jupiter, got swallowed in 
its wastelands
and buried in that giant star’s 
dense husk,
its evil death-quilt of gelid 
hydrogen

which to a depth of near ten 
thousand miles
armors that devil-star in helium 
and cold.
It could have turned out just as 
badly here.
But we are favored people. 
We’ve not crashed
on any star or stellar satellite.
Instead we have our trek ahead 
of us,
a lifelong journey onward to an 
end
which would have come in any case,
and comes.

 
The orchestra plays fancies and 
we take the floor.
The girl I lead about is hors 
concours.
Originally she’s from Dorisburg,
but though she’s danced here 
now for several years
in Aniara’s ballroom she insists
that, far as she’s concerned, she
hears
no difference whatsoever in the 
yurg
they dance here and the one in 
Dorisburg.

 
And when we dance the yurg it’s 
evident
that everything called yurg’s 
magnificent
when Daisy Doody wriggles in a 
vurg
and chatters in the slang of 
Dorisburg:

You’re gamming out and getting 
vile and snowzy.
But do like me, I never sit and 
frowzy.

I’m no sleeping chadwick, Daisy 
pouts,

 
 
my pipes are working, I am flamm 
and gondel,
my date’s a gander and my fate’s 
a rondel
and wathed in taris, gland in delt 
and yondel.

And lusty swings the vurg, I’m 
tempest-tossed—
the grief I’m nursing threatens 
to be lost
upon this womanchild who, filled 
with yurg,
slings at Death’s void the slang 
of Dorisburg.

 
 
In the sixth year Aniara fared
with undiminished speed toward 
Lyra’s stars.
The chief astronomer gave the 
emigrants
a lecture on the depth of outer 
space.
In his hand he held a splendid 
bowl of glass:
We’re slowly coming to suspect 
that the space
we’re traveling through is of a 
different kind
from what we thought whenever 
the word “space”

 
was decked out by our fantasies on
Earth.
We’re coming to suspect now that 
our drift
is even deeper than we first 
believed,
that knowledge is a blue naiveté
which with the insight needful to 
the purpose
assumed the mystery to have a 
structure.
We now suspect that what we say 
is space
and glassy-clear around Aniara’s 
hull

is spirit, everlasting and 
impalpable,
that we are lost in spiritual seas.

Our space-ship Aniara travels on
in something that does not possess 
a brain-pan
and does not even need the stuff
of brains.
She’s traveling on in something 
that exists
but does not need to take the 
path of thought.
Through God and Death and 
Mystery we race

 
on space-ship Aniara without goal 
or trace.
O would that we could turn back 
to our base
now that we realize what our 
space-ship is:
a little bubble in the glass of 
Godhead.
I shall relate what I have heard 
of glass
and then you’ll understand. In 
any glass
that stands untouched for a 
sufficient time,
gradually a bubble in the glass 
will move

infinitely slowly to a different 
point
in the glazen form, and in a 
thousand years
the bubble’s made a vovage in its 
glass.

Similarly, in a boundless space
a gulf the depth of light-years 
throws its arch
round bubble Aniara on her march.
For though the rate she travels 
at is great
and much more rapid than the 
swiftest planet,

 
her speed as measured by the 
scale of space
exactly corresponds to that we 
know
the bubble makes inside this bowl 
of glass.

Chilled at such certitude, I take 
flight
out of the mima-hall to the 
ruddy light
filling the dance-hall and, 
finding Daisy there,
I seek admission to her womb of 
hair,
in her savior-arms I beg a tryst

 
where death’s cold certitude 
does not exist.
There’s where life remains in 
Mima’s room;
the Doric valleys live in Daisy’s 
womb
as in ourselves, no cold or threat 
to hound us,
we lose track of the spaces that 
surround us.

A sect that’s called the Ticklers 
has sprung up.
They gather to be tickled and to 
tickle.

 
 
It’s mostly women, but the chiefs 
are men
and called the Tinkers,
an old word from the pre-
goldonder age.
The word is cited in the Blue 
Archive
and has to do somehow with 
feeding
in the older manner, and with 
flames.

More I do not know.
As a child in school, of course I 
saw
on some occasion natural fire.

 
It was kindled, I remember, from a
piece of wood
which then was shown around, 
emitting smoke
and some heat too.
When everyone had looked, the 
wood was dipped in water.
The piquant little flame was 
quenched,
Wood was a rare material. Had 
existed
in pre-goldondic times, but later 
dwindled
steadily through nuclear 
catastrophes.

It rather moved us, I remember, 
watching
in a circle as the wood-chunk gave
out light.
But that is long ago, ah me, so 
long.

I shut down the mima, walk one 
round and listen
to the emigrants, the crewmen,
and hear an old space-mariner 
tell of Nobby,
doubtless the great love of his 
life:

 
 
By normal standards she was 
hardly pretty,
pale little Nobby, radiation-
mangled.
Three times she was branded and 
came very near
to fluttering away, but was 
pulled back
with help from gammosal and 
Tebe-rays.

And after a year or more in 
dreary wards
of barracks-hospitals on Tundra 
Two

 
she took a bargain-fare goldonder
home
from Mars to Earth, resuming her
assistance
to refugees and regular 
collections
for people needing help on Mars 
and Venus.

All Marsfolk needed respite from
the tundra-cold;
the Venusfolk, safety from their
swampy climate.
Did she wear her health down? 
Rest assured.
Nonetheless I held her very dear,

 
my little Nobby, and cannot forget
the scanty moments when we 
snatched our dreams
on Tundra Two on my rare visits 
there.
At that time I was just a 
volunteer
aboard Goldonder Fifteen—name 
of Max,
an old tramp off the Venus run, 
converted
for shipping aid and exiles to the 
tundraball.

The Thirty-second War had just 
then ended,

 
Control Plan Three was being 
closely followed.
You’re all aware how all of that 
turned out:
new Dick on top, hot times in the 
cellar
for those who’d voted nay to 
Dick. The others,
whipped to shape already, got 
their rucksacks
and were sped on Prison Spacecraft
Seven
to three years’ gathering peat on
Tundra Nine,
among the worst tundras you could
run into

on that slum planet. We went out 
there once.
But enough of outsides. All the 
inward changes
that followed with the punch-
card age were worse.
The heartlessly hard, the 
nonsensically gentle
changed places on the punch-cards
many times.

With regularity the good in man
was moved to a punch-card hole 
for cruelty.
In this melancholy jungle of 
controls

 
we have to admire the mima, who 
can order
a chaos of numbers we wish we 
never knew.
For everyone was playing at least 
four roles
in political games of specters’ 
peek-a-boo.

Through doors that are forever 
whirling round
like turnstiles for the torrents 
of mankind,
some voices rise triumphant from 
the hum

 
that blends them all: despair, 
good faith, high mind.
And there are scattered voices 
singing songs
of burdens such as mystics might 
have sung
in seeking incombustibility
from vacant space and from the 
mima’s visions:

“Soon the time will come of cast-
iron and balm
when I may keep intact while fire 
and cold
consume the forms of life around 
my calm.

 
Soon the time will come of cast-
iron and balm.”

But on the humming swells, all 
seek the mima
and cry aloud as at a wailing-wall,
till from lost worlds the mima’s 
comforts bring
her illustrations of a far-off 
spring.

The mima caught for us the 
blessed shore,
shining for hours in full 
beatitude.

 
 
But now the world of blessings is 
no more,
hurled into a new infinitude.
Among dark shades that splendor 
has been drowned,
by torrents that no mima can turn 
round.
And we again are shivering and 
unsound.

The spuriously deep descents you 
make
to those supposed depths you’d 
gambled on

 
 
are all without the slightest 
value here
for here there are no depths to 
undertake.
Here we can follow the descent 
you make
and see how very far it is, how 
sheer.
It’s never stunning on the 
crystal screen
where we can see how your 
maneuver turns
spiraling back to where you dove 
before.
Now we believe in your descents 
no more.

The space-aware makes no dives as
a rule,
and if he does dive in the lucid 
pool
he’s quickly back and puts off 
happily
what science gave of outdoor 
finery
for shorter expeditions on this 
sea.

His business merely was to cast an 
eye
upon the only cloud in this cold 
sky,

 
 
that long hard cloud made of a 
white alloy,
luminously painted and standing 
there
motionless, stiff and still, what 
though she fare
at a velocity to curl the hair
of those who don’t know of the 
speeds we muster
as Aniara moves on toward the 
Lyre cluster.

Once I was sent outside for an 
inspection
of Mima’s cell-works and, from 
this direction,

 
almost eight thousand meters 
radially,
our Aniara was a magnitude.

From that celestial ocean, 
stirred, I viewed
our good old craft from Doris come
so far
approaching the Lyre from cosmic 
Zanzibar
with cargo that the tooth of time 
had chewed.
Ivory of that kind is heaviest of 
all
as, marked with hard names born 
of metaphor,

 
from a hidden world of hostile 
force
it cruelly bears down on Aniara’s 
course.

Efforts at escape through flights
of mind
and slipping back and forth from 
dream to dream—
such methods were to hand.
With one leg drowned beneath a 
surge of feeling
the other braced by feeling dead 
and gone
we’d often stand.

 
 
Myself I questioned, but gave no 
reply
I dreamt myself a life, then lived
a lie.
I ranged the universe but passed 
it by—
for captive on Aniara here was l.

Our female pilot steps inside the 
mima-
chamber. Wordlessly she signals 
me
How grand she is, how 
unapproachable.

 
 
She wounds you in the way that 
roses wound,
though not, as has been often 
said, with thorns.
A rose will always wound you with 
its rose
and, though the sore may be a 
briar-scratch,
still more often it may be a wound
from utter beauty, utter burning
beauty.
The lovely Doris, in the sixth 
year now
changed ever more into a distant 
star,

a sun that like a cinder burns my 
eye
and stabs its infinitely long gold 
pin
into my heart across dizzying-
bright spaces—
she burned more broadly when 
she was close by,
but stings more deeply when 
she’s far away,
I start the mima, take a seat and 
wait
to see in little time the features
brighten
with wondrous alteration on the 
face

of our fair pilot, frostily 
withholding
the subtlest modulation of her 
beauty.
But the mima’s running, making 
all things clear.
The fair one’s white cheeks 
brighten instantly
and hotly blush: she fills with 
heavenly transport
when the mima shows her 
everything there is
of pleasure inaccessible in worlds 
of space.
She smiles, she laughs, ecstatic 
and engrossed

as though she suddenly were 
seized by gods.
But just when she seems cleared 
for perfect bliss
the third webe shifts the mima’s 
focus-values
and the world’s other glimmering 
guises flood the mima.
The fair one’s face soon turns 
another shade.

I close down the mima. It is there 
for comfort,
not for making human beings 
shudder

 
at worlds like-featured with the
one they left.
Pains and problems we were all 
enmeshed in
when we were stirring in the 
Dorisvales
are nothing to exhibit to this 
woman.
I stroke her softly when I close 
the mima,
for the mima’s truth is 
incorruptible,
a frank display of everything 
created.

 
The fair one rises up and nods to 
me
her sober thanks for closing down 
the mima.
At the door she turns, asks me to 
call
for her should the mima ever 
have received—
she doesn’t say the word, but I 
can guess.

The warming Doris and the kindly 
Doris,
the distant Doris now a noble star
to pine for
Now she is the star of stars.

 
O could I but know where she is 
gleaming
in this sixth year, so inconspicuous
among the suns of space I’ll 
never find
that star again. The noble star of 
Doris.

All that we had long dreamt of 
receiving—
distant views of torments gone 
before
and joys exhausted long ago—we 
take

 
 
in the mima from the troughs of 
waves of yore.
The picture shifts in ripples far 
remote
and in a cryptic echo-curve it’s 
hurled
labyrinthine round the endless 
world,
and all the cosmic tidings reach us 
all.
Through space the evil tidings 
ever stream;
there are good tidings, but with 
tracks less clear,
for goodness has no part in active 
life,

its light is the same light
this year and every year.

But doubt is an acid that corrodes 
more dreams
than any dreamer ever could 
propose,
and only through the mima can we 
see again
the warmth and beauty of our 
dreaming-shows.
For this reason I preserve what 
matters:
what bears comfort’s colors and 
resembles life.

 
 
And on our ship, whenever anxiety
patters
and dread and unease play havoc 
with our nerves
I serve up helpings of the mima’s 
dream-preserves.

Meanwhile the doctor who 
observes our eyes
and sees in them that lust for 
life is fading
flinches at the lacus lacrimalis
where no more does the crocodile 
go wading.

 
 
Such flooding tears in halls where
Mima reigns
are highest praise for Doris’s 
green plains.
And even so it is as if those tears
for all their authenticity were 
cold
insensate waters rising from the 
depths.
Their fall is too transparently 
designed,
like drops of rain too pure to 
touch the soil:
our lucid tears in an Aniara of the
mind.

 
The senior astrolobe came to our 
aid,
expert in the blazes far stars 
made.
But, without warning, reason’s 
star went dead
inside the senior astrolobe’s own 
head.
Forced to its death by bodings 
unallayed,
his brain broke down and died, 
soul-deep afraid.

Impotence runs wild in its own way,

 
 
 
blaspheming, execrating time and 
space.
But many think that now we’ve 
come to face
just punishment as toward the 
Lyre we pace.
For we ourselves by space-law 
rigorous
have locked us into this 
sarcophagus
and honor our live burial on high
till our vainglory puts its scepter 
by.
In thousands or in myriads of 
years

a distant sun shall capture and 
enfold
a moth that flies toward it as 
toward the lamp
when it was harvest time in 
Doriswold.
Then we shall end our journey 
through these regions,
then deep asleep shall lie 
Aniara’s legions
and all be swiftly changed in 
Mima’s hold.

We ride in our sarcophagus in 
silence,

 
 
no longer offering the planet 
violence
or spreading deathlv quiet on our 
kind.
Here we can question freely, 
true
while the vessel Aniara, gone 
askew
in bleak tracts of space, leaves 
vile time behind.

The stone-dumb deaf man started
to describe
the worst sound he had heard. It 
was past hearing.

 
 
Though just when his eardrums 
were exploding
came a sound like the sough of 
sorrowing sedge, the last
when the phototurb exploded 
Dorisburg.
It was past hearing, so the deaf 
man ended.
My ear could not keep up with it
when mv soul burst and scattered
and body burst and shattered
and ten square miles of city 
ground were wrung
inside outside
as the phototurb was bursting

the mighty city once called 
Dorisburg.

So he spoke, the deaf man, who 
was dead.
But as, so it’s been said, stones 
shall cry out,
so the dead man did his speaking in 
a stone.
From the stone he cried out: can 
you hear me?
From the stone he cried out: 
don’t you hear me?

My native city once was Dorisburg.

 
 
 
Then the blind man started his 
report
upon the light horrificallv 
intense
that blinded him.
He was unable to describe it.

He mentioned only one detail: he 
saw by neck.
His entire skull became an eye
blinded by a brightness beyond 
flashpoint
lifted and sped off in blind 
reliance
on the sleep of death. But no 
sleep came.

 
In this respect he is much like the
deaf man.
And as, so it’s been said, stones 
shall cry out,
so he cries out from stones as 
does the deaf man.
So they cry out from stones one 
with the other
So they cry out from stones as did 
Cassandra.

I rush in to the mima as though I 
could
prevent the ghastly deed by my 
distress.

 
 
But she shows all, candid and 
upright,
unto the last projecting fire and 
death,
and, turning to the others, I cry 
out
my pain of pains beholding Doris’s 
death:
There is protection from near 
everything,
from fire and damages by storm 
and frost,
oh, add whichever blows may come 
to mind.
But there is no protection from 
mankind.

When there is need, none sees 
with clarity.
No, only when the task is to beat 
down
When there is need, none sees 
with clarity.
No, only when the task is to beat 
down
and desolate the heart’s own 
treasury
of dreams to live upon in cold and 
evil years.

Then the mima’s blinded by a 
bluish bolt

 
 
and I am dumbstruck at events 
that pour
on wretched Earth; out here 
their lightnings bore
down through my heart as through
an open sore.
And I the mima’s faithful priest 
in blue
receive in blood run cold the evil 
news
that Doris died in far-off 
Dorisburg.

My only comfort left I beg of 
Daisy.

 
 
She is the only woman left who 
speaks
that lovely Dorisburgian, while 
I’m
the last man left who 
understands what Daisy
with her splendid tongue, bright 
as a decoy-call,
babbles in her lovely dialect.

Come rock me loose and fancy, 
Daisy wheedles.
Go dorm tremenzy and go row me 
dondel:
my date’s a gander, I am flamm 
and gondel

 
and wathed in taris, gland in delt 
and yondel.

And I who know that Dorisburg was 
razed
to nothing ever after by the 
phototurb,
I let Daisy be just what she is.

What use is there in breaking the 
enchantment
which only Daisy kept up, 
unawares,
so well that she, now lying free 
of cares

 
and squirming hotly when the 
dance is done,
knows not that she herself some 
hours ago
was widowed of the town of 
Dorisburg.

She urges me to sing along, and I 
take up
the ballad of cast-iron that I 
learned
about the town of Gond that 
melted down in war.

But Daisy babbles gladly, 
unawares,

 
 
and her entire existence was 
created
to sing the praise of dance in 
whirling yurgs.

What would I be? A brute, if I 
should break
the spirited enchantment she has 
mined
from out her breast, from her 
heart itching for joy.

She babbles as in fever till she 
sleeps.
Round where we lie Aniara’s 
senses fade,

 
 
but not to sleep. The clear mind is
alert
to Earth which here it has to do 
without.
Only Daisy’s heart beats safe and
sound
on Aniara, to its brightmare bound.

With Dorisburg molten, the mima 
ailed for days
with heavy static from the 
phototurb,
her third webe battling as against 
a cloud
