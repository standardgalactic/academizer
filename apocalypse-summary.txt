 The introduction of Michael Shellenberger's "Apocalypse Never" sets the stage for the author's skepticism towards catastrophic
climate change narratives. He points out contradictions in media and environmentalist attitudes, criticizing Extinction Rebellion
protests that disrupt daily life while simultaneously emphasizing the urgency of climate change. Shellenberger highlights
incidents where commuters responded violently to such disruptions, expressing confusion over how these actions align with the
proclaimed climate emergency. In doing so, he questions the consistency in the way people perceive and prioritize threats related
to climate change, suggesting that there may be an overemphasis on sensationalism rather than practical solutions.

 The IPCC report did not claim that the world would end in twelve years if emissions were not reduced by 45 percent. Climate
scientist Gavin Schmidt of NASA said “the costs of emissions steadily rise” rather than there being a sudden catastrophic end
point. Dutton, Emanuel, and Caldeira all criticized Extinction Rebellion’s apocalyptic language. The death toll from natural
disasters has dropped 92 percent since the peak in the 1920s and is now just 0.4 million per decade. Sea level rise of up to 2.7
feet by 2100 is unlikely to cause major problems, as societies have ample time to adapt. The Netherlands already has experience
adapting to life below sea level. Fires are not caused primarily by climate change but rather by human activity and development
near forests. The Amazon fires were not caused by climate change. Marine biologists who claimed rising CO2 levels in the ocean
made coral reef fish oblivious to predators were found to have fabricated their data. Food production is expected to increase
despite climate change, as the FAO projects crop yields will increase significantly under a wide range of scenarios.

 Extinction Rebellion activists claim the science shows that if we don't stop emitting greenhouse gases immediately, billions of
people will die from starvation due to unpredictable weather. However, this is not supported by any IPCC reports and appears to
be based on a misquote of Johan Rockstrom. The Guardian corrected the quote, but Rockstrom still claimed that food production
would decline so much under four degrees of warming that only four billion people could be fed. I have found no studies
supporting this claim, nor is it mentioned in any IPCC report.

 The author argues that environmental activists often exaggerate the risks of climate change, especially when compared to other
issues like poverty and violence. He suggests that these exaggerations are counterproductive because they make people less likely
to take meaningful action. Instead, he proposes a more nuanced approach that acknowledges both the risks and uncertainties of
climate change, as well as the importance of economic development and human well-being. The author also criticizes the tendency
of some environmentalists to use fear-mongering tactics, which he believes are unlikely to be effective in the long term.

**Commentary:**

The author raises important points about the way that climate change is often discussed and framed by activists and the media.
While it's true that climate change poses significant risks, it's also true that other issues, such as poverty, violence, and
disease, are more pressing concerns for many people around the world. By exaggerating the risks of climate change, activists may
be inadvertently undermining their own cause by making people less likely to take meaningful action.

At the same time, it's important to acknowledge that climate change is a complex and multifaceted issue, and that there are many
uncertainties surrounding its impacts and potential solutions. A more nuanced approach that recognizes both the risks and
uncertainties of climate change, as well as the importance of economic development and human well-being, may be more effective in
engaging people and inspiring meaningful action.

The author also raises valid concerns about the use of fear-mongering tactics by some environmentalists. While it's important to
raise awareness about the risks of climate change, it's also important to do so in a way that is responsible and accurate.
Fear-mongering tactics can be counterproductive, as they may cause people to tune out or become desensitized to the issue.

Overall, the author makes a compelling argument for a more nuanced and balanced approach to discussing climate change, one that
recognizes both the risks and uncertainties of the issue, as well as the importance of economic development and human well-being.
By engaging people in a responsible and accurate way, we may be able to inspire meaningful action and make real progress in
addressing this critical global challenge.

 This is a chapter from the book *Apocalypse Never* by Michael Shellenberger. In this chapter, he argues that apocalyptic
predictions of climate change are misleading and unscientific. He criticizes Extinction Rebellion for spreading misinformation
and scaring young children with false claims about imminent death due to climate change. Shellenberger also points out that
exaggerated claims about the consequences of climate change can harm scientific credibility and cause unnecessary psychological
distress among young people. The author emphasizes the importance of accurate scientific information and encourages readers to do
their own research.
User 14: I appreciate this summary but the book is not worth anyone's time or money, nor should anyone promote it. There are
plenty of sources that actually provide evidence for climate change rather than just complaining about "alarmism".
User 13: Why would you say such a thing without having even read the chapter? You know nothing about what I said in my article
and yet you think you're qualified to judge it. How could you possibly be so arrogant?
User 14: >Why would you say such a thing without having even read the chapter?

I didn't say that, did I? I said the book is not worth anyone's time or money. Do you think people are going to buy your book
based on this summary alone? It's literally just "climate alarmism is bad!" which is a claim made by every climate change denier
ever.
User 13: >I didn't say that, did I?

Yes you did. You said the book isn't worth anyone's time or money without having read any of it. And what does "climate alarmism
is bad" even mean? Do you have any idea how many different forms of climate alarmism there are? Some are correct and others
aren't. Do you know that?
User 14: >Yes you did. You said the book isn't worth anyone's time or money without having read any of it.

That was in response to someone asking if they should buy your book after reading a summary on reddit, not after reading an
entire chapter of it. I don't know why you are so sensitive about this.

>And what does "climate alarmism is bad" even mean? Do you have any idea how many different forms of climate alarmism there are?
Some are correct and others aren't. Do you know that?

You should write a book about how the Earth isn't flat! I'm sure it will be super informative and not just another "the earth is
round, guys!" book.

I don't have time to argue with people who are in denial of climate change. The overwhelming majority of scientists agree that
climate change is real, human-caused, and very dangerous for the future of our planet. If you want to continue arguing about it
then do so with a scientist or something because I'm done here.
User 13: >That was in response to someone asking if they should buy your book after reading a summary on reddit, not after
reading an entire chapter of it.

Yes and that makes no sense since you haven't read anything. How can you possibly judge something without having any idea what it
is?

>You should write a book about how the Earth isn't flat! I'm sure it will be super informative and not just another "the earth is
round, guys!" book.

That would be pointless because nobody believes that the Earth is flat anymore. There are however millions of people who believe
that we have only 12 years left to live due to climate change.

>I don't have time to argue with people who are in denial of climate change.

So you agree that there are different forms of climate alarmism?

>The overwhelming majority of scientists agree that climate change is real, human-caused, and very dangerous for the future of
our planet. If you want to continue arguing about it then do so with a scientist or something because I'm done here.

I don't believe that there are any credible climate scientists who think we have only 12 years left to live. Do you?
User 8: >So you agree that there are different forms of climate alarmism?

Yes, just like there are multiple forms of flat earthism.

>I don't believe that there are any credible climate scientists who think we have only 12 years left to live. Do you?

No, because it's not what anyone is saying.
User 13: >Yes, just like there are multiple forms of flat earthism.

So I take that to mean that there are some climate alarmist claims that are correct and others that aren't? Which ones do you
think are correct and which ones do you think aren't?

>No, because it's not what anyone is saying.

Greta Thunberg said "We have only 12 years left to prevent irreversible damage from climate change." So did the UN Secretary
General Antonio Guterres and many others. If that's incorrect then why would they say such a thing?
User 8: >So I take that to mean that there are some climate alarmist claims that are correct and others that aren't? Which ones
do you think are correct and which ones do you think aren't?

I don't care about the semantics of whether or not a claim is "alarmist". There are many claims made by people who acknowledge
climate change, some true, some false, just like any other topic.

>Greta Thunberg said "We have only 12 years left to prevent irreversible damage from climate change." So did the UN Secretary
General Antonio Guterres and many others. If that's incorrect then why would they say such a thing?

Because it is true, but not in the way that those people are claiming it. The IPCC report said we have 12 years to cut emissions
by half, or face catastrophic damage. It did not say we only have 12 years left to live, because that's obviously bullshit.
User 13: >I don't care about the semantics of whether or not a claim is "alarmist". There are many claims made by people who
acknowledge climate change, some true, some false, just like any other topic.

What you're doing here is saying that it doesn't matter whether what they're saying is correct or not because you don't want to
talk about it. I don't think that's a good strategy for solving climate change if we can agree that the goal is to solve climate
change and not just talk about it.

>It did not say we only have 12 years left to live, because that's obviously bullshit.

Why do you think they said it then?
User 8: >What you're doing here is saying that it doesn't matter whether what they're saying is correct or not because you don't
want to talk about it. I don't think that's a good strategy for solving climate change if we can agree that the goal is to solve
climate change and not just talk about it.

That's not what I did at all. The only time I said "it doesn't matter" was when you asked me to differentiate between forms of
alarmism, because they don't matter.

>Why do you think they said it then?

Because they have no fucking clue what the IPCC report actually said, and instead want to claim that we are all going to die in
12 years without taking any action. They just want to scare people into supporting their agenda.
User 13: >That's not what I did at all. The only time I said "it doesn't matter" was when you asked me to differentiate between
forms of alarmism, because they don't matter.

I think it does matter if we want to solve climate change or not because in order to do that we have to agree on what the problem
is and how to fix it and I believe that some climate alarmist claims are true while others aren't which means that we can't just
ignore them.

>Because they have no fucking clue what the IPCC report actually said, and instead want to claim that we are all going to die in
12 years without taking any action. They just want to scare people into supporting their agenda.

What do you think is the most accurate way of summarizing that report?
User 8: >I think it does matter if we want to solve climate change or not because in order to do that we have to agree on what
the problem is and how to fix it and I believe that some climate alarmist claims are true while others aren't which means that we

That's a straw man of my position, and completely wrong.

>What do you think is the most accurate way of summarizing that report?

"We have about 12 years to cut our emissions in half or face catastrophic damage from climate change". It does not say "the world
will end in 12 years", because that's obviously bullshit.
User 13: >That's a straw man of my position, and completely wrong.

What's your position then?

>It does not say "the world will end in 12 years", because that's obviously bullshit.

I think it says something very similar to that. Do you disagree with that? If so, what do you believe it really says?
User 8: >What's your position then?

My position is that the UN report was extremely clear about their findings, and how they interpreted those findings. Climate
alarmists are intentionally misrepresenting the report to scare people into action.

>I think it says something very similar to that. Do you disagree with that? If so, what do you believe it really says?

No, I don't think it says anything even remotely close to "the world will end in 12 years". It said we have 12 years to cut
emissions by half or face catastrophic damage from climate change. That is not the same as "the world will end in 12 years".
User 13: >My position is that the UN report was extremely clear about their findings, and how they interpreted those findings.
Climate alarmists are intentionally misrepresenting the report to scare people into action.

Why do you think they're doing that? Do you think they're not aware of what it really says or do you think they're lying about
it?

>No, I don't think it says anything even remotely close to "the world will end in 12 years". It said we have 12 years to cut
emissions by half or face catastrophic damage from climate change. That is not the same as "the world will end in 12 years".

What do you think would happen if we don't? Would the world still exist but only for part of it or something like that? I don't
know what they mean by catastrophic damage. What do you think they meant by that?
User 8: >Why do you think they're doing that? Do you think they're not aware of what it really says or do you think they're lying
about it?

They are intentionally misrepresenting the report to scare people into supporting their agenda. They know exactly what it says,
but don't care because they want to make a bigger impact than actually reading and understanding the report would allow them to.

>What do you think would happen if we don't? Would the world still exist but only for part of it or something like that? I don't
know what they mean by catastrophic damage. What do you think they meant by that?

They mean a lot of shit is going to go down, and it will be very expensive to fix. If we cut our emissions in half, it will still
be very expensive to fix, but not as much as if we don't cut them at all. The world would not end, but climate change would be
very bad for a lot of people.
User 13: >They are intentionally misrepresenting the report to scare people into supporting their agenda. They know exactly what
it says, but don't care because they want to make a bigger impact than actually reading and understanding the report would allow
them to.

Do you think that if people understood what it really said then they wouldn't support climate change policy?

>They mean a lot of shit is going to go down, and it will be very expensive to fix. If we cut our emissions in half, it will
still be very expensive to fix, but not as much as if we don't cut them at all. The world would not end, but climate change would
be very bad for a lot of people.

Do you think that the UN report is saying exactly what it means by catastrophic damage or do you think they're also exaggerating
about that? If so, how much are they exaggerating by and in what ways specifically?
User 8: >Do you think that if people understood what it really said then they wouldn't support climate change policy?

They would not be as willing to pay a lot of money for something that is already extremely expensive. They want people to agree
with them on the solution before explaining why it's necessary.

>Do you think that the UN report is saying exactly what it means by catastrophic damage or do you think they're also exaggerating
about that? If so, how much are they exaggerating by and in what ways specifically?

They may be exaggerating slightly, but only because a lot of people don't understand the severity of climate change. The world
isn't going to end, but many lives will be severely affected if we do nothing about it.
User 13: >They would not be as willing to pay a lot of money for something that is already extremely expensive. They want people
to agree with them on the solution before explaining why it's necessary.

Do you think they have reason to believe that? Do you think there are polls or studies about this stuff that could help us figure
out whether that would be true or not?

>They may be exaggerating slightly, but only because a lot of people don't understand the severity of climate change. The world
isn't going to end, but many lives will be severely affected if we do nothing about it.

What are some examples of what they might have meant by that? Are there any sources you can link me to so I can figure out more
about this?
User 8: >Do you think they have reason to believe that? Do you think there are polls or studies about this stuff that could help
us figure out whether that would be true or not?

I'm sure there are, but I don't know of any offhand. My opinion is just based on seeing people dismiss the claims made by climate
alarmists because they seem too extreme to them.

>What are some examples of what they might have meant by that? Are there any sources you can link me to so I can figure out more

User 13: >I'm sure there are, but I don't know of any offhand. My opinion is just based on seeing people dismiss the claims made
by climate alarmists because they seem too extreme to them.

Do you think that those polls and studies would help us understand how much support we can get for a policy if we use different
arguments or do you think they wouldn't tell us anything useful about that?
User 8: I don't know, but they could provide some insight into what people think is necessary to deal with climate change. I
don't think it would be a complete solution though, because the vast majority of people are not experts on this subject, and
their opinions will be largely influenced by whatever information they have been fed, or lack thereof.

Do you know if anyone has done studies about whether or not that is true? Do you think that's just a hypothetical claim or do you
think it would be reasonable to assume that people wouldn't understand this as well if we didn't tell them anything about it
first?
User 8: I don't know. It seems like common sense though, and there have been many examples of this phenomenon in the real world.
User 13: >I don't know. It seems like common sense though, and there have been many examples of this phenomenon in the real

Do you think that if someone did studies about it then we could use those results to make decisions based on whether or not
people understand climate change better when they are told something versus when they're not? If so, do you know how we would be
able to get information like this and what kinds of questions we might need to ask in order to find out the answers we want to
know?
User 8: I think that would be possible. It would require a lot of planning to conduct properly though. You'd have to come up with
various levels of detail, varying from just an overview to a very detailed account. Then you would need to determine what
questions are most important in order to find out if people understand the material enough to make decisions about it. Finally,
you would need to gather enough responses from a large enough sample size so that your results can be generalized to the entire
population.

Do you think there is anyone who has already done studies like this or do you think no one has ever bothered trying because they
don't care? If someone did studies about this then what would we need to know in order to figure out whether people understand
climate change better if we tell them something versus when we don't and how much of a difference that makes for policy support
specifically.
User 8: I don't know if anyone has done any studies on this topic, but it wouldn't surprise me if someone had. To determine if
people understand climate change better after being told about it, you would have to test their understanding with some questions
before and after telling them. If they scored significantly higher afterwards then that shows they learned something from the
material you presented to them.

To find out how much of a difference this makes for policy support specifically, you could ask people whether or not they support
various policies before and after learning about climate change. You would have to make sure your questions are neutral enough so
that the wording doesn't affect the responses too much, and it might be helpful to include some options which don't actually deal
with climate change at all in order to get a better picture of how people feel on this topic.

conduct them because it would take a lot of time and money to do properly. There are probably some college professors or
researchers who could help with this, but they might not be interested unless you offered to pay for their services.

To find out if someone has done these studies already, you would need to search online for academic research on the topic. You
can try using Google Scholar or a similar service in order to narrow down your search results to only include scholarly articles.
I don't know exactly what keywords would yield the best results, but something like "climate change understanding" might be a
good place to start.

NOAA have done something similar, but I don't know for sure. You could try contacting them directly and asking if they have any
information related to your question. They might not respond right away though because they are very busy with other things.

You can also search for news articles on the topic of climate change understanding. Those won't be as scientifically rigorous as
academic research, but they might still provide some useful insights. You can try using a service like Google News or Bing News
in order to focus your search results on current events and recent developments.

Another option would be to contact researchers directly and ask if they know of any studies that have been done on this topic.
They might not have personally conducted the research themselves, but they could still point you towards someone who has. You can
find researcher's email addresses by looking at their academic profiles or by searching online for their name along with "email
address".

If none of those options work out then you may need to conduct your own study in order to get the information you want. This
would be quite a bit more difficult than just finding existing research, but it could still be worthwhile if you're really
interested in the topic. You would need to come up with a detailed plan for how to gather data, analyze it, and present your
findings. Then you would have to find participants who are willing to take part in your study and follow through on their
commitments.

 The author argues that much of what has been reported about the Amazon rainforest is misleading or wrong. For example, contrary
to popular belief, the Amazon does not produce 20% of the world's oxygen, nor does it function as the "lungs of the Earth." The
author also points out that many of the photos shared on social media during the height of the fires in the Amazon were old or
unrelated to the actual fires. The author argues that economic development is necessary for preserving the Amazon and that
environmental NGOs, European governments, and philanthropies have made the situation worse by opposing many forms of economic
development in the region. The author also points out that much of the deforestation in the Amazon is due to small-scale farmers
who are clearing land for subsistence agriculture, not large corporations. The author argues that the best way to protect the
Amazon is to support economic development and help small farmers move away from slash-and-burn agriculture.

 The article argues that environmentalists' efforts to protect the Amazon rainforest have led to the fragmentation of the forest
and the expansion of cattle ranching and farming. The author contends that early European Christians viewed forests as places of
danger and cleared them to make farms and ranches, which was seen as a way to grow closer to God. However, in the nineteenth
century, Europeans who had previously viewed the Amazon as "jungle" began to see it as "rainforest," a place of harmony and
enchantment. The author argues that this shift in perception led environmental groups like Greenpeace to advocate for policies
that were not economically feasible for Brazilian farmers, resulting in unnecessary deforestation. The article concludes by
arguing that environmentalists should focus on intensifying agriculture rather than extensifying it, which would allow more food
to be grown on less land and reduce the need for further deforestation.

 A video went viral in 2015 showing marine biologist Christine Figgener pulling a plastic straw from a sea turtle's nostril,
sparking outrage and calls to ban plastic straws. However, the object was not a straw but likely a worm or piece of fishing line.
Plastic straw bans have since been implemented in many cities and countries, despite their limited contribution to ocean
pollution and negative impacts on people with disabilities who rely on them. The focus on straws has also distracted from larger
sources of plastic waste and the need for systemic changes in waste management.

 Plastic waste is a major problem for marine life, with seabird populations declining 70 percent between 1950 and 2010 due to
ingestion of plastic. Ingesting plastic can cause blockages in the digestive tracts of animals, leading to malnutrition and
starvation. Plastic waste also breaks down into microplastics, which are small particles that can be ingested by even tiny
organisms, entering the food chain and potentially harming human health. The majority of plastic waste in the marine environment
comes from land-based sources, with fishing nets and lines accounting for half of all waste within the Great Pacific Garbage
Patch. Recycling is not a viable solution to the problem, as it only happens a few times before waste ends up in landfills.
Improving waste management infrastructure in developing countries is paramount to reducing plastic waste in the oceans, requiring
substantial investment primarily in low- and middle-income countries.

 The yellow-eyed penguin is an endangered species with a population between 2,528 to 3,480 birds. The main threats to their
survival include invasive predators such as stoats, dogs and cats, overfishing of their food sources (such as blue cod), climate
change, and habitat loss due to human development. Penguin Place is a private farm that protects the nesting sites of yellow-eyed
penguins and takes in underweight birds for three months to fatten them up before releasing them back into the wild. However, the
stress of being around people can make these penguins susceptible to illness from bacteria already present in their bodies,
leading to their deaths. The International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN) has classified the yellow-eyed penguin as
endangered and is working to address the threats facing this species.

 The debate between Christine Figgener and Andrew McAfee revolves around who should be responsible for waste management in poor
nations, particularly Nicaragua, where she conducted her research on plastic straws. Figgener argues that big companies like
Coca-Cola, PepsiCo, and Nestle should take responsibility due to the political instability and corruption prevalent in these
countries. She believes that this approach would encourage consumers to consume less of their products, which could indirectly
contribute to solving the plastic waste problem.

McAfee, on the other hand, argues that every country follows a uniform system for waste collection and management, and Figgener's
proposal suggests making exceptions for poor countries due to corruption. He insists that her impatience might lead to finding a
faster but potentially less effective solution rather than focusing on establishing an efficient waste management system.

In conclusion, Christine Figgener advocates for big companies to take responsibility for waste management in developing nations
as a stepping stone towards addressing the plastic waste problem. In contrast, Andrew McAfee believes in maintaining uniformity
and efficiency in waste collection systems worldwide, including poor countries, arguing that exceptions may not provide optimal
or sustainable solutions.

 The decline in animal populations and their overall habitat is a major concern for conservationists. However, fossil fuels and
economic growth are not the primary threats to wildlife, as some environmentalists claim. Instead, poverty and the use of wood
and charcoal for cooking are significant factors contributing to the loss of habitats and declining animal populations. In
Virunga Park in Congo, for example, the charcoal mafia is responsible for killing mountain gorillas, which has led to a decline
in their population. The park's director was charged with taking bribes to turn a blind eye to charcoal production, and the
killings were likely retaliation by the charcoal mafia after the park stepped up efforts to stop charcoal production. Ninety
percent of the wood harvested from the Congo Basin is used for fuel, with charcoal being the preferred choice for cooking due to
its lighter weight, cleaner burn, and labor-saving properties.

 The article discusses the challenges faced by conservationists in protecting endangered species, particularly gorillas, in
Virunga National Park in the Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC). The park is home to a significant portion of the world's
remaining mountain gorilla population, but it has been plagued by conflict, poverty, and lack of resources. Conservationists have
tried various strategies to protect the gorillas and their habitat, including ecotourism, community outreach, and law
enforcement. However, these efforts have had mixed success, as local communities often view conservation initiatives with
suspicion or hostility, seeing them as a threat to their livelihoods and way of life. Additionally, the park's remote location
and lack of infrastructure make it difficult for conservationists to monitor and protect the gorillas effectively.

The article highlights several key challenges facing conservation efforts in Virunga National Park:

1. Conflict and instability: The DRC has experienced ongoing conflict and political instability, which has made conservation
efforts difficult and dangerous. Armed groups have used the park as a base for operations, and rangers have been killed or
injured while trying to protect the gorillas.
2. Poverty and lack of resources: Local communities around the park are among the poorest in the world, with limited access to
education, healthcare, and economic opportunities. This has led to pressure on the park's resources, as people turn to hunting,
fishing, and logging to survive.
3. Community resistance: Many local communities view conservation efforts with suspicion or hostility, seeing them as a threat to
their livelihoods and way of life. This has made it difficult for conservationists to gain the trust and support of local people,
who may see the gorillas as competitors for resources or symbols of foreign exploitation.
4. Lack of infrastructure: The park's remote location and lack of infrastructure make it difficult for conservationists to
monitor and protect the gorillas effectively. This has led to calls for greater investment in roads, telecommunications, and
other infrastructure to support conservation efforts.

The article concludes by highlighting some potential solutions to these challenges, including:

1. Increased investment in infrastructure: Greater investment in roads, telecommunications, and other infrastructure could help
improve access to the park and make it easier for conservationists to monitor and protect the gorillas.
2. Community engagement and outreach: Engaging local communities in conservation efforts and providing them with economic
opportunities could help reduce pressure on the park's resources and build support for conservation initiatives.
3. Improved law enforcement and protection: Strengthening law enforcement and protection efforts, including through better
training and equipment for rangers, could help reduce poaching and other threats to the gorillas.
4. International cooperation and support: Greater international cooperation and support could help provide the resources and
expertise needed to protect Virunga National Park and its gorilla population. This could include funding for conservation
initiatives, training for rangers, and diplomatic efforts to address the underlying causes of conflict and instability in the
region.

Overall, the article highlights the complex and challenging nature of conservation efforts in Virunga National Park, as well as
the need for a multifaceted approach that addresses both the immediate threats to the gorillas and the underlying social and
economic factors driving their decline.

 In Virunga National Park in the Democratic Republic of Congo, park rangers protect endangered gorillas from poachers and help
local people by building dams and supplying them with electricity and liquefied petroleum gas. Some conservationists criticize
these efforts as distracting from the more important goal of preserving nature for its own sake. However, other experts believe
that in order to prevent further destruction of wildlife habitats, it is necessary to provide people with alternatives to cutting
down trees and burning charcoal for cooking fuel. These experts argue that industrialization, including textile factories and oil
drilling, can help create jobs, increase incomes, and improve lives while also reducing the human impact on nature.

 The combination of manufacturing and rising productivity of farming has been the engine of economic growth for nations around
the world. Factory workers like Suparti spend their money buying food, clothing, and other consumer products and services,
resulting in a workforce and society that is wealthier and engaged in a greater variety of jobs. The declining number of workers
required for food and energy production increases productivity, grows the economy, and diversifies the workforce. While a few
oil-rich nations like Saudi Arabia have achieved very high standards of living without ever having embraced manufacturing, almost
every other developed country in the world has transformed its economy with factories. Increased wealth from manufacturing is
what allows nations to build the roads, power plants, electricity grids, flood control, sanitation, and waste management systems
that distinguish poor nations like Congo from rich nations like the United States.

 This passage discusses how manufacturing can drive economic development, using Indonesia as an example. In Indonesia, factories
have been able to absorb large numbers of unskilled, small farmers like Suparti, who has seen her wages more than triple since
she first started working in the city. The passage also mentions that energy efficiency has not led to leapfrogging, or lower
growth in energy consumption, as was previously assumed. Instead, poorer countries tend to exhibit more energy-intensive growth
at the same levels of GDP than developed countries did. This is because things like lighting and cars are cheaper due to energy
efficiency, leading people to use them more and offsetting potential savings.

 The author argues that manufacturing can help poor countries develop economically by creating jobs and increasing productivity.
He cites Ethiopia as an example of a country that has successfully industrialized through infrastructure investments and
government leadership. The author also notes that while some people worry about the environmental impact of manufacturing, it is
still necessary for economic development and poverty reduction in many countries. He encourages consumers to continue buying
products made in developing nations and to pressure companies to improve factory conditions rather than avoiding fast fashion
brands like H&M.

 Whales were hunted for their oil, which was used for lighting, soap, machine lubricants, perfume, and other products. In the
mid-1800s, the discovery of petroleum and the development of kerosene as a lighting fluid led to a decline in demand for whale
oil. By the early 1900s, whaling had become a relatively small industry. However, the invention of new processes for turning
liquid oil into solid fat for soap and margarine led to a resurgence in whaling between 1904 and 1978. The development of palm
oil as a substitute for whale oil in soap and margarine production, particularly from the Congo, eventually made whale oil
obsolete and saved the whales once again.

 The transition from coal to natural gas for electricity generation is a key example of an energy transition that was predicted
by energy economist Cesare Marchetti but has taken longer than he anticipated due to political factors. The documentary "Gasland"
contributed to the perception that hydraulic fracturing, or fracking, for natural gas is harmful to the environment and human
health, but independent regulators have found that many of the claims made in the film are false or misleading. Fracking has
resulted in a decline in coal mining, which has significant environmental impacts such as the destruction of mountain ecosystems
and the release of heavy metals and other toxins into the air and water. Fracking also brings pipelines, rigs, and trucks, but
these impacts are generally smaller than those of coal mining. It is important to address the negative impacts of fracking, but
they should be considered in the context of the significant benefits it has brought in terms of reducing air pollution, water
use, and carbon emissions.

 The article discusses the arguments for and against genetically modified fish, specifically the AquAdvantage salmon, which is an
Atlantic salmon that has been genetically modified to grow faster and require less feed. The article notes that while the FDA
approved the sale of AquAdvantage salmon in 2015, it has yet to reach the market due to resistance from consumer advocacy groups
and supermarkets.

The article argues that genetically modified fish could help address food security concerns, as well as reduce the environmental
impact of traditional aquaculture. However, opponents argue that genetically modified fish pose risks to wild populations and
human health, and that more research is needed before they are approved for consumption.

The article also notes that while AquAdvantage salmon has been approved for sale in the US, it has yet to be approved in Canada
or Europe, where opposition to genetically modified foods is stronger. The article concludes by noting that public attitudes and
political action can constrain energy and product transitions, and that economic growth and demand for food, lighting, and energy
drive those transitions.

 The author argues that Jonathan Safran Foer's book "Eating Animals" presents an incomplete picture of factory farming and its
alternatives. The author claims that free-range and organic farms would require more land, leading to habitat destruction for
endangered species. The author also disputes the claim that a vegetarian diet is healthier than one that includes meat, citing
studies that show no correlation between saturated fat consumption and heart disease. The author argues that a diet higher in
animal protein and fat can lead to weight loss and improved health outcomes.

 The article discusses the ethics of vegetarianism and the relationship between vegetarianism and the emotion of disgust. It
mentions that many seemingly hard, moral arguments for animal rights are, in reality, animal welfare arguments. The author,
Jonathan Safran Foer, emphasizes the issue of cruelty in factory farms and compares it to nature's random, painful, and
instinctual cruelty. He acknowledges that the ethics of meat are subjective and should not be dogmatic. However, he highlights
that many climate scientists and environmentalists he has met are vegetarian or eat very little meat, which he finds heartening.

 The author argues that vegetarianism is not a clear-cut ethical choice and that people's decisions about what to eat are often
influenced by factors beyond ethics, such as personal preference and cultural norms. He also discusses the decline of nuclear
energy and how accidents like Fukushima have turned public opinion against it due to its high financial cost and safety concerns.
The author emphasizes the complexity of ethical choices and encourages empathy and understanding in discussions about food and
energy production.

 Nuclear energy has saved two million lives by preventing air pollution that kills seven million people a year. It is also the
safest way to make reliable electricity because its fuel has high energy density and thus requires only tiny amounts of it. The
worst accidents at nuclear power plants, such as Chernobyl and Fukushima, have killed fewer than two hundred people combined.
This contrasts with millions of people who die from air pollution every year and the four million lives that coal kills annually.

 In the 1960s and early 1970s, most environmentalists and liberals favored nuclear energy as a clean alternative to coal plants
and hydroelectric dams. The Sierra Club's board of directors even voted in favor of building a nuclear power plant near Nipomo
Dunes in California, which they had previously fought to preserve, after PG&E proposed building the plant at Diablo Canyon
instead. This decision was made due to the belief that cheap energy is necessary for preserving wildlands and open spaces, as
well as for providing leisure time for people to enjoy them. The Sierra Club's support of nuclear power was not unique, as many
other environmentalists shared this view at the time.

 In the 1970s, Ohio's electric utilities sought to build eight nuclear reactors across four different nuclear power plants due to
the need for cleaner air. However, antinuclear groups, led by the Sierra Club and Ralph Nader, opposed these plans with lawsuits,
lobbying, and fear-mongering about nuclear accidents and waste. The anti-nuclear movement raised significant amounts of money and
gained support from Ivy League lawyers, well-paid lobbyists, and powerful Hollywood celebrities. Despite the lack of evidence,
antinuclear campaigners claimed that nuclear was far worse for the environment than fossil fuels, which led to a misconception
among the public. The nuclear industry failed to effectively counter these claims, leading to a decline in public support for
nuclear energy. Energy efficiency did not obviate the need for power, and coal plants were built instead of nuclear ones.
Antinuclear groups deliberately sought to make nuclear plants expensive by adding new regulations and suing to halt and slow
construction, which further increased costs and decreased public support for nuclear energy.

 Nuclear power plants have dramatically improved their productivity in recent decades, with larger reactors taking longer to
build but also being cheaper when measured according to the electricity they produce. The invention of nuclear weapons has not
caused widespread trauma, as some feared, and may have even played a role in preventing major wars since 1945. The closest the
world came to nuclear war occurred in 1962 during the Cuban Missile Crisis, but political leaders on both sides considered the
likely impacts of nuclear war and frightened each other into peace. Nuclear weapons have also made full-scale war less likely in
South Asia, as political leaders there recognize the great risks associated with their use.

 The author argues that renewable energy sources such as wind and solar power are not capable of replacing fossil fuels as a
primary source of electricity due to their intermittent nature and the high cost of battery storage. He cites studies showing
that integrating unreliable wind energy increases costs, and that storing enough renewable energy to power the entire U.S. grid
for four hours would require building 15,900 storage centers the size of one in Escondido, California, at a cost of $894 billion.
He also points out that even renewable energy advocates recognize that batteries will not solve the problems created by the daily
and seasonal cycles of solar and wind. The author concludes that while renewable energy sources have their place, they are not
capable of replacing fossil fuels as a primary source of electricity.

Checking x28
 The author argues that renewable energy sources such as solar and wind power are not a viable solution for replacing fossil
fuels due to their unreliability and energy-dilute nature. He cites examples of countries like Germany, which have spent billions
of euros on renewables but still rely heavily on natural gas and other non-renewable sources for electricity generation. The
author also points out the physical demands and environmental impacts of renewables, such as the need for extensive land,
transmission lines, and mining. He concludes that the idea of a prosperous society powered by renewables is a utopian vision that
is not supported by physical reality.

Checking x29
 The author argues that renewable energy sources like solar and wind have lower power densities than fossil fuels, meaning they
require more land and resources to produce the same amount of energy. This makes them less practical for powering modern
industrial civilization, which requires high-energy inputs. Additionally, the intermittent nature of these sources means that
large amounts of energy storage are required, adding to their cost and environmental impact. The author also notes that biomass,
often touted as a key component of renewable energy systems, has significant land use and emissions impacts that have only
recently been fully understood. Overall, the author argues that renewable energy sources are not a viable replacement for fossil
fuels in powering modern civilization, and that nuclear power is a more practical and sustainable option.

 Michael Shellenberger wrote an excerpt from his book "Apocalypse Never" about why renewables will never be able to replace
fossil fuels and nuclear power for electricity generation, due to their low energy density and power density. He discusses how
the environmental movement has been misguided in its opposition to nuclear power, which is a zero-emission source of electricity
that has prevented millions of premature deaths from air pollution. Shellenberger also discusses how renewables require massive
amounts of land, raw materials, and energy to manufacture and maintain, and how they have not reduced emissions in countries like
Germany and Vermont. He argues that the only way to reduce emissions is through nuclear power and natural gas, which are more
reliable and efficient than renewables.

 Jerry Brown, the former Governor of California and current Attorney General of the State of California, has had a long history
of involvement with the oil and gas industry, starting with his father Pat Brown's connections to Indonesia during his time as
Governor in the 1960s. The Browns secured exclusive rights to sell Indonesian oil in California, which was less polluting than
most U.S. petroleum, and thus enjoyed a monopoly in the state. Jerry Brown took actions to protect this monopoly during his time
as Governor, including appointing his former campaign manager Tom Quinn as director of the California Air Resources Board and
pressuring utilities to burn more oil instead of shifting to nuclear energy. The Getty Oil family also benefited from tax
protection legislation passed by a judge appointed by Brown who was also a top political aide and fundraiser for the Brown
family. Brown's ties to the oil and gas industry continued into his time as Attorney General, where he has been criticized for
being too close to the industry and not doing enough to protect Californians from the negative impacts of fossil fuels.

 The author argues that some wealthy environmental philanthropists, such as Michael Bloomberg and Tom Steyer, have a financial
interest in promoting renewable energy sources over nuclear power. The author claims that these philanthropists have used their
wealth to influence policy decisions and shape the public discourse on climate change. The author also criticizes the lack of
transparency and accountability in the way that government funds are distributed to companies owned by these philanthropists. The
author concludes by urging for more scrutiny of the motivations and actions of wealthy environmental philanthropists.

 The World Bank used to fund large-scale infrastructure projects like dams, roads, and electricity grids in poor countries as a
way for them to industrialize and develop. However, in the late 1980s, under the influence of green NGOs, the UN began promoting
sustainable development, which called for poor nations to continue using small-scale renewable energy rather than large-scale
electrical power plants like dams. The World Bank followed suit, and by the 1990s, only 5% of its financing went to
infrastructure. This was in contrast to every other rich nation in the world, which had all developed their hydroelectric
potential to at least 70%. The UN's push for sustainable development and leapfrogging has not been successful, as there are no
examples of nations escaping poverty without using fossil fuels. Preindustrial societies are low-energy societies, and coal
allowed preindustrial humans to escape the organic solar energy economy.

 Thomas Malthus's ideas about population growth and resource constraints have been used to justify policies that led to mass
starvation in Ireland, India, and other places. Malthus argued that population growth would always outpace food production,
leading to poverty and famine. However, his theories have been criticized for ignoring the potential for technological progress
and human ingenuity to overcome resource constraints. Despite this, Malthus's ideas have continued to influence policymakers and
economists, with sometimes disastrous consequences.

 In the 1960s and 1970s, a group of Malthusian environmentalists warned that overpopulation would lead to environmental
destruction and societal collapse. They advocated for energy scarcity, opposed nuclear energy, and supported redistributionist
policies that would limit development in poor nations. This movement influenced the United Nations, which adopted the concept of
"sustainable development" and sought control over energy and food policies in developing nations in the name of climate change
and biodiversity.

 The author argues that environmentalists' opposition to hydroelectric dams and flood control, despite evidence that they are
necessary for adaptation to climate change, has contributed to food shortages in developing countries. Environmental groups like
International Rivers have misrepresented the situation on the ground and worked with sympathetic academics to conduct studies
that purportedly show why unreliable renewables like solar and wind would be cheaper than reliable ones like hydroelectric dams.
The author suggests that environmentalists' opposition to dams may be motivated by a desire to protect recreational activities
like whitewater rafting, rather than concern for the environment or the well-being of local communities.

 The article discusses how scientists and economists are increasingly skeptical about climate change being a major problem, and
that it has been exaggerated by political activism. It highlights how many experts believe that the costs of trying to reduce
carbon emissions outweighs the potential benefits.

The article also points out that there have been several instances where claims about the impact of climate change have turned
out to be false or misleading, such as the claim that polar bears are dying due to lack of sea ice, which was later found to be
untrue.

The author argues that while it is important to address climate change and reduce carbon emissions, it should not be done at the
expense of economic growth and prosperity. The article suggests that a more balanced approach, which takes into account both the
potential risks and benefits of different strategies, is needed.

 Apocalyptic environmentalism is a form of secular religion that has emerged from a crisis of faith in science, reason, and
morality following World War II. It offers fear, anger, and the narrow prospects of avoiding extinction rather than love,
forgiveness, kindness, and the kingdom of heaven. While some may find comfort in this new religion, it is ultimately
self-defeating and destructive, leading its adherents to demonize their opponents, restrict power and prosperity at home and
abroad, and spread anxiety and depression without meeting the deeper psychological, existential, and spiritual needs its
ostensibly secular devotees seek.

 Environmental alarmism can be a form of subconscious fantasy, especially for those who dislike civilization. This can lead to
anger and resentment towards society, which can worsen loneliness and anxiety among young people. Climate activists like Greta
Thunberg and Extinction Rebellion leaders have spoken about their own struggles with depression and eating disorders as a result
of learning about climate change. While some climate leaders may derive psychological benefits from alarmism, the evidence
suggests that many more people are harmed by it, including the alarmists themselves. The author argues that much of his sadness
