What Can Science Really Tell Us About Our Feelings？ ｜ The Feelings Lab： Ep 0 Clip 1⧸4.txt
 Science cannot directly study or measure personal feelings as they are qualitative experiences that cannot be observed
objectively. Instead, science can observe and study emotional expressions, behaviors, and verbalizations related to emotions.
Through observation of these external factors and the use of common language and analogies, scientists can identify
regularities and similarities in emotional experiences across individuals. This allows for a general understanding and
scientific exploration of emotions.

How Emotion Science Has Changed Since Darwin ｜ The Feelings Lab： Ep 0 Clip 2⧸4.txt
 Jack had been working in the field of emotion research for some time, with a deep appreciation for the historical
philosophical perspectives on emotions. When Alan Tversky introduced new data and methods using big datasets, Jack's initial
reaction was one of epiphany. He saw this as an expansion of the field's understanding of emotions, moving beyond the
traditional six emotion categories to recognize the complexity and nuance of emotional experiences.

Jack described it as a revelation, likening it to discovering a rich painting that brought to light the intricacies of emotions
through scientific investigation. This new approach validated the richness and complexity of emotions and opened up new avenues
for research in this field.

The New Era of Technology Designed for Human Emotion ｜ The Feelings Lab： Ep 0 Clip 3⧸4.txt
 Danielle describes her experience founding the Google Empathy Lab, which focuses on emotion in tech, design, and the real
world. She notes the paradox of living intimately with technology yet striving for optimization and efficiency, which ignores
our deep social species' need for emotional connection. The importance of acknowledging emotions and addressing them is
critical to creating products or technologies that serve wholeness and nourishment rather than just focusing on what people do
with their brains and hands. Empathy and emotion are the foundational language for understanding individuals' inner lives,
goals, and motivations.

Do Animals Have Feelings？ ｜ The Feelings Lab： Ep 0 Clip 4⧸4.txt
 The speaker mentioned some research in Emotion Science about vocalizations made by animals, particularly mice and dogs, during
play behavior. These vocalizations can resemble human laughter, and the open-mouthed smile is also observed in many mammals
during this kind of play. Researchers have been studying rough and tumble play and its relation to emotion and vocalization
across various species. The speaker expressed interest in exploring this topic further and possibly dedicating an entire
episode to it.

Why We Feel Awe and How It Affects Us ｜ The Feelings Lab： Ep 1 Awe Clip 1⧸4.txt
 Awe is the experience of encountering vast mysteries that our minds cannot fully comprehend, resulting in astonishment and a
desire to make sense of things. It creates a state of wonder, dissolving the ego and helping us explore life's deeper
mysteries. We should start by defining awe as this concept before exploring further.

How Does Awe Relate to Spirituality？ with Tami Simon ｜ The Feelings Lab： Ep 1 Awe Clip 2⧸4.txt
 The speaker is discussing Oprah Winfrey's idea that experiencing awe leads one to believe in God. The speaker shares their
personal perspective on awe, which they define as an appreciation for the preciousness and beauty of life. They suggest that
feeling awe can inspire a desire to care for the world around us and reduce over-consumerism. The speaker does not necessarily
connect awe to spirituality or God specifically, but rather sees it as a celebration of life's wonder and value.

Is It Possible for Animals to Feel Awe？ ｜ The Feelings Lab： Ep 1 Awe Clip 3⧸4.txt
 The speaker believes that humans have a unique ability for collective problem solving and vocalizing emotions, particularly
awe, which brings people together. They argue that while other species may exhibit similar behaviors, humans excel at this due
to our capacity for storytelling and self-reflection. The speaker also expresses a desire for other species, such as whales and
honeybees, to experience collective effervescence and interconnectivity in their own ways.

Awe in the Midst of Global Change ｜ The Feelings Lab： Ep 1 Awe Clip 4⧸4.txt
 The speaker expresses her connection with Matt's story about the pandemic taking away familiar things and the impact on brain
activity. She believes that as we become accustomed to our reality, we feel less connection to it and experience less brain
activity due to habituation. The return of these things brings a sense of awe and appreciation for what was once taken for
granted, highlighting the importance of recognizing the value of novelty and change in our lives.

Emotional Contagion with Dacher Keltner ｜ The Feelings Lab： Ep 2 Embarrassment Clip 1⧸5.txt
 The speaker described an experiment where people were videotaped singing and then made to watch their performances. This
description elicited a feeling of second-hand embarrassment or cringe from the speaker, even though they weren't the one
performing. The speaker reflected on how our emotions are linked to those around us, and how seeing someone make a mistake can
lead to feelings of mortification for both the person making the mistake and those observing it. This phenomenon is known as
contagious emotion or empathy, and some people are more prone to experiencing it than others.

Do Animals Feel Embarrassment？ with Jessica Tracy  ｜ The Feelings Lab： Ep 2 Embarrassment Clip 2⧸5.txt
 The speaker argues that animals, specifically non-primate ones like dogs, do not experience embarrassment. They may exhibit
submissive behaviors in response to punishment or disapproval, but these actions are likely learned responses for rewards,
rather than true feelings of embarrassment. The speaker uses the example of a dog reacting to destroying something and compares
it to a chimpanzee's recognition of itself in a mirror. The speaker believes that only primates with self-awareness can
experience embarrassment, as evidence by the chimp's ability to recognize itself in a mirror and exhibit self-examination.

Emotional Contagion in Comedy with Ali Kolbert ｜ The Feelings Lab： Ep 2 Embarrassment Clip 3⧸5.txt
 The speaker shares their experience in handling crowds and the importance of managing emotions contagiously during comedy
sets. They learned that being too aggressive or mean towards individuals can negatively affect the whole audience, causing a
collective shutdown. Instead, they now focus on giving verbal affection to engaged audience members and winning over the crowd
by making them feel special and appreciated. Even when things go wrong, such as an interruption, the speaker emphasizes the
importance of recovering quickly and regaining the crowd's favor. The audience is described as having a hive mind and emotional
sensitivity that can be influenced by the performer's actions and reactions.

Embarrassment Across Time and Age with Alan Cowen ｜ The Feelings Lab： Ep 2 Embarrassment Clip 4⧸5.txt
 The speaker believes that people, especially the younger generation, present different ideal selves online through social
media, leading to more embarrassment during face-to-face interactions. This may result from fewer in-person encounters and a
lack of clarity regarding social norms. In adolescence, when one's ideal self changes rapidly and status becomes important,
embarrassment can be particularly mortifying. The speaker shares that their own levels of embarrassment have increased but also
their awareness of it, which can help them navigate awkward situations. Expressing embarrassment can serve as an icebreaker but
comes at the cost of potentially lowering one's perceived status.

* * *

The Positive Role of Embarrassment w⧸Jessica Tracy ｜ The Feelings Lab： Ep 2 Embarrassment Clip 5⧸5.txt
 Embarrassment is often seen as a negative experience, but some argue that it is actually a positive emotion. This perspective
comes from the idea that embarrassment connects us to other people and builds relationships. Embarrassment sends a social
signal that appeases others and makes us likable. While the fear of embarrassment can be detrimental, especially in children,
allowing ourselves to experience it can lead to stronger social connections.

Alan Cowen and Dacher Keltner on Desire and Addiction ｜ The Feelings Lab Ep 3 Desire Clip 1⧸4.txt
 The brain's reward system, specifically dopaminergic cells, plays a role in predicting and experiencing pleasure or reward.
When we don't receive enough reward, there can be a negative response, leading to a desire for more. This concept is relevant
to understanding the feeling of being unfulfilled even after acquiring desired things. The opioid system is also involved in
savoring and enjoying experiences, providing a sense of belonging and comfort with possessions. Neuroscience helps us explore
the distinction between desire, enjoyment, and living with acquired things.

Monét X Change on the Creating Magical Performances ｜ The Feelings Lab Ep 3 Desire Clip 2⧸4.txt
 The interviewee, who is a drag performer, acknowledges that sex has been a natural and easy way to provoke reactions from
audiences in the past due to the raunchy origins of drag. However, with the increased exposure and diversity of audiences,
including young children, they have had to adapt their performances to cater to a wider demographic. This challenge led the
performer to explore ways of evoking desire and mysticism through non-sexual means, which they find to be an opportunity for
personal growth and expansion as a performer.

* * *

Monét X Change Mastered the Power of Performance ｜ The Feelings Lab Ep 3 Desire Clip 3⧸4.txt
 The speaker shares their experience of feeling a collective ecstasy or mystical energy during live performances, using
Beyonce's 2009 concert at Madison Square Garden as an example. They reflect on how they strive to create such experiences for
audiences through their own performances and the importance of owning one's magic on stage.

Gambling Monkeys and Fruit Fly Sex： Animal Desire Parallels ｜ The Feelings Lab Ep 3 Desire Clip 4⧸4.txt
 The dopaminergic circuitry, which plays a role in reward and motivation, is present in various animals including fruit flies.
Animals desire rewards like food and sex, and the uncertainty of when or if they will receive a reward increases their desire
for it. This concept can be observed in gambling behaviors. Researchers have studied the effects of dopamine and rewards in
various animals, including primates and even spiders. Capuchin monkeys have been part of experiments where they are given money
and establish trade societies to obtain pornography using tokens. These monkey societies exhibit behaviors similar to human
economies.

Why Pride？ Its Role in Social Hierarchies with Dacher Keltner ｜ The Feelings Lab Ep 4 Pride Clip 1⧸5.txt
 Pride is a complex emotion deeply ingrained in our social lives as it helps establish and maintain hierarchies by signaling
our competence and elevated status to others, encouraging collaboration and imitation. However, problems arise when pride
becomes hubristic, leading us to believe we are superior to everyone else and causing potential conflicts and harm.

* * *

Pride and Shame： A Study in Opposites with Alan Cowen ｜ The Feelings Lab Ep 4 Pride Clip 2⧸5.txt
 The speaker is discussing the complexity of studying the neuroscience of emotion, specifically focusing on pride. Pride is a
social and complex emotion that involves different brain systems such as self-consciousness, hierarchy, reward, and social
salience. While there are distinct bodily expressions of pride, such as expanded posture and chest thumping in animals,
understanding its neurological underpinnings has been challenging due to its complexity. Psychology studies have shown that
pride increases admiration and group cohesion, while the opposite emotion is shame. Despite these findings, mapping the exact
brain activity related to pride is still a work in progress. Experts like Jess Tracy have studied the distinctive expressions
of pride across different cultures and species, making it somewhat easier to study.

Pride and Humility in Olympic Team Competition ｜ The Feelings Lab Ep 4 Pride Clip 3⧸5.txt
 Cassidy emphasizes the importance of both pride and humility in Olympic competitions, particularly in a team setting. She
believes that having pride in oneself is necessary but recognizing the value and importance of teammates is equally essential
for success. Additionally, she highlights the need to respect opponents and understand that everyone at this level is
exceptionally skilled. Competition is seen as an opportunity to strive together and push each other to improve.

* * *

Chest-Beating Gorillas： A Model of Prideful Behavior ｜ The Feelings Lab Ep 4 Pride Clip 4⧸5.txt
 The speaker discusses parallels between human emotions, specifically pride and shame, and behaviors observed in animals. Pride
is exhibited through chest-beating and posturing in gorillas and alpha males in primates, while shame is shown by an animal's
submission and making itself small after victimization. The speaker also mentions an experiment with capuchin monkeys where
they pay for pictures of alpha males, demonstrating their admiration and identification with high-status individuals. No
information was given about the monkeys trading or possessing the photos once obtained.

* * *

Authentic Versus Hubristic Pride ｜ The Feelings Lab Ep 4 Pride Clip 5⧸5.txt
 The speaker and Danielle were discussing the concept of pride, specifically focusing on authentic versus hubistic pride, based
on research by psychologist Jessica Tracy. Authentic pride leads to calmness, friendliness, creativity, deeper connections, and
increased perseverance. In contrast, hubistic pride can result in negative consequences such as pressure to sustain glory,
which can lead to behaviors like doping, as seen in the case of Lance Armstrong. The speaker emphasized that understanding the
motivations and training behind individuals' actions is important in distinguishing between authentic and hubistic pride.

Horror as an Aesthetic Experiences with Dacher Keltner ｜ The Feelings Lab Ep 4 Horror Clip 1⧸6.txt
 The speaker is proposing a distinction between two types of experiences under the umbrella of human culture: manufactured
horror (such as in art, films, and theme parks) and naturally occurring events. They argue that this delineation is significant
because evolution has given us emotions like fear, love, and desire, which are then transformed by culture into aesthetic
experiences. The speaker sees art as a valuable tool for understanding these emotions and experiences.

* * *

Fred Armisen Connects Horror and Comedy ｜ The Feelings Lab Ep 5 Horror Clip 2⧸6.txt
 The speaker expresses their fascination with the rules or recipes for creating horror, using examples from films like "The
Shining" and "The Omen." They note that these elements, while capable of eliciting fear, also have a universal appeal and bring
happiness to audiences. The speaker suggests that these horror tropes serve as a kind of distorted power chord in storytelling,
unifying audiences through their shared emotional response.

Watching Zombie Films Builds Resilience ｜ The Feelings Lab Ep 5 Horror Clip 3⧸6.txt
 A study published in a scientific journal by researchers at the University of Chicago suggested that people who watch horror
films, specifically those in the genres of alien invasion, zombie, or apocalyptic movies, are more resilient. These types of
films, referred to as "prepper films," expose viewers to various stressors and help them cope, much like exposure therapy.
According to the study, during times of crisis, such as the COVID-19 pandemic, horror fans may be better equipped to deal with
the challenges.

Fred Armisen Finds Horror Fans Gentle ｜ The Feelings Lab Ep 5 Horror Clip 4⧸6.txt
 The topic of discussion revolves around the paradoxical relationship between horror fans and empathy. An article from the New
York Times featured a vegan horror restaurant, sparking a conversation about whether or not horror fans lack empathy due to
their interest in the genre. While there is some research suggesting that fiction, including horrifying stories, can promote
empathy, there isn't definitive evidence on this topic. The speaker shares their personal observation that many horror fans and
individuals drawn to dark music genres like heavy metal are actually sensitive and gentle people. They see them as quiet,
soft-spoken, and introspective rather than tough or aggressive. However, this is a generalization and may not apply to all
individuals in these communities. The broader question of how experiencing horror could make someone more empathetic remains
open for further exploration and debate.

* * *

Fred Armisen Is Not a Fan of Forests ｜ The Feelings Lab Ep 5 Horror Clip 5⧸6.txt
 The speaker mentions that they were greatly affected by the "Blair Witch Project" film, as it effectively tapped into their
fear of being lost in a forest during dusk. They admit to not feeling prepared in such situations and find forests intimidating
due to their vastness and lack of control. They also mention having a fear of heights. The speaker reflects on how people's
fears vary and wonders about the origins of their own fear of forests.

* * *

Do Animals Experience Horror？ ｜ The Feelings Lab Ep 5 Horror Clip 6⧸6.txt
 Horror as experienced in the animal kingdom and observed by scientists is a complex topic. Animals exhibit various reactions
to fear, empathic pain, disgust, and startle responses similar to humans. However, there's no evidence that animals enjoy
horror or have high-level existential dread unique to horror. The latter requires self-awareness of one's mortality and
temporary nature as a body. Some animals, like elephants and whales, show signs of mourning their dead, suggesting an awareness
of loss and sadness. Though it's challenging to definitively say, there might be elements of fear and other emotions related to
horror in animal behavior.

Whatever Gets You Through The Night： Coping Mechanisms ｜ The Feelings Lab Ep 6 Anxiety Clip 1⧸4.txt
 The speaker is discussing different mechanisms people use to deal with difficult situations. They identify some of these
methods as coping mechanisms, specifically those that involve emotional regulation. The term "ugly coping" is used for
strategies that may not be considered healthy or effective in the long term but can help get someone through a particularly
challenging moment. The speaker acknowledges that the use of such coping mechanisms frequently could raise concerns, but
emphasizes their utility in specific situations to help individuals get past difficult parts. The reference to John Lennon's
lyrics "Whatever gets you through the night" is used to highlight the importance of finding ways to cope with adversity.

The Evolution of Anxiety and the “Lion in the Bush” ｜ The Feelings Lab Ep 6 Anxiety Clip 2⧸4.txt
 The speakers are discussing the evolutionary advantage of emotions such as awe, desire, and horror, which bring people
together. They also touch upon anxiety and its role in our evolution. Anxiety can be seen as an early warning system for
potential threats, allowing some individuals to be more attuned to danger and alert others. However, not all warnings prove
accurate, leading to a diversity of anxiety levels within a group being beneficial for survival. The speakers also touch upon
the comparison between the monkey in the bush expression and the canary in a coal mine story, with the former having a more
positive connotation in this context.

* * *

Build Coping Strategies When Life is Calm ｜ The Feelings Lab Ep 6 Anxiety Clip 3⧸4.txt
 The reasons why some people find it harder to manage anxiety than others are complex and not fully understood. One factor is
the size of an individual's "repertoire" or the number of behaviors and strategies they have at their disposal for coping with
anxiety. People with larger repertoires may find it easier to use exercise, productivity, or other methods to alleviate
anxiety. However, not everyone finds these methods effective, and for some people, attempting to use new skills or strategies
can even exacerbate anxiety. Developing new coping mechanisms is challenging, especially during stressful times, but building a
larger repertoire can ultimately help individuals better manage their anxiety.

* * *

Anxiety is a Social Beacon... in Mice？ ｜ The Feelings Lab Ep 6 Anxiety Clip 4⧸4.txt
 Mice exhibit empathic behaviors towards distressed mice, showing signs of "empathic distress." This behavior is important as
it helps the distressed mouse and can even lead to unlocking their cage if locked from the outside. The expression of distress
plays a critical social role in these interactions. The idea that sadness acts as a "beacon" is a beautiful thought,
highlighting the social function of emotions.

John Hodgman is Moved to Mirth ｜ The Feelings Lab Ep 7 Mirth Clip 1⧸3.txt
 The guest on the show is John Hodgman, an author, actor, and humorist. He expresses his excitement about the topic of mirth,
as according to research from Google Books and Graham Viewer, the use of the word peaked around the 1820s but declined
significantly for the following century. Hodgman finds it ironic that this was a time when significant events like the First
Industrial Revolution, child labor, slavery, and the Missouri Compromise occurred. He makes a sarcastic comment about how fun
it must have been to invent the state of Maine to balance out the slave state of Missouri.

The Laugh That Doesn't Exist： Flavors of Amusement ｜ The Feelings Lab Ep 7 Mirth Clip 2⧸3.txt
 The speakers discuss how amusement, or finding something entertaining, is not a single emotion but rather a complex experience
with various flavors or subtypes. They account for these differences by mixing them with other emotions or categorizing them as
distinct types of amusement. Some examples given include physical comedy, empathic amusement, and different kinds of laughs
like acknowledging a joke without it being funny or laughing at another's pain. The speakers also mention the development of
cultures and contexts around these flavors of amusement.

* * *

Jokes Help Us Survive ｜ The Feelings Lab Ep 7 Mirth Clip 3⧸3.txt
 The speaker is discussing the importance and function of jokes with John Stuart. They mention how Stuart would appreciate a
good joke due to his experience in the field. However, not all moments allow for enjoyment, especially when in a rush. The
speaker also reflects on the significance of stories and jokes throughout history, suggesting they serve various purposes such
as social cohesion, creating group myths, and providing distraction. Jokes are seen as short narratives, each telling a little
story.

Is Doubt an Emotion？ ｜ The Feelings Lab Ep 8 Doubt Clip 1⧸3.txt
 Doubt is an emotion that can be separated into logical and feeling components. The logical version is simply not believing
something to be true, while the feeling aspect can be described as suspicion, skepticism, or a sense of unease. Doubt lies near
emotions such as confusion, contempt, interest, and surprise on the emotional map. It is expressed through a facial expression
often referred to as the "not face," which includes elements of both disgust and confusion. The vocal expression of doubt may
also be distinctive.

* * *

Doubt： The Most Important Emotion？  ｜ The Feelings Lab Ep 8 Doubt Clip 2⧸3.txt
 Doubt and skepticism are related but distinct concepts. Doubt refers to having an uncertain or questioning attitude towards
something, including oneself. It can be a feeling or emotion, and is not necessarily based on logical or factual
considerations. Skepticism, on the other hand, is a philosophical position that emphasizes doubt and questioning of knowledge
claims. It involves applying critical thinking and logic to evaluate the evidence and arguments for and against a belief or
claim. Cartesian skepticism, in particular, is a form of skepticism that doubts the foundations of knowledge, and has had a
significant impact on Western philosophy and the scientific revolution. In this sense, doubt can be seen as an important
feeling that drives skepticism and intellectual progress.

* * *

Doubt versus Curiosity ｜ The Feelings Lab Ep 8 Doubt Clip 3⧸3.txt
 Amy Lamott expresses her belief that doubt and curiosity are interconnected rather than opposing sides. She explains that in
order to be curious about something, one must also question what is currently known or missing from an explanation. Doubt can
lead to new discoveries and deeper understanding, acting as the negative space that forms the image of knowledge. Curiosity
arises from this doubt and the desire to fill in the gaps and improve existing explanations.

* * *

How Awe is ＂Edged＂ with Doubt  ｜ The Feelings Lab Ep 8 Doubt Clip 4⧸3.txt
 The speaker is discussing the relationship between doubt and curiosity, framing them as complementary ways of exploring and
making sense of the world that are unique to humans. Doubt helps ensure integrity and truth, while curiosity drives open-ended
exploration. Mystical experiences, which involve doubt about the fundamental nature of beliefs, are an example of how these
emotions intersect. The speaker suggests that through this process of being open and wild, we can determine what holds water in
the end.

Greeks Love A LOT Says Melina Kanakaredes ｜ The Feelings Lab Ep 9 Love Clip 1⧸4.txt
 In Greek culture, there are multiple words for love, estimated to be between seven and eight variations. Some of these
include:

* * * Philia (φιλία): friendship or brotherly love
* * * Philotomy (φιλότομία): love of friendship
* * * Eros (ἔρως): romantic and sexual love
* * * Ludus (λύδος): playful or unrequited love
* * * Agape (αγάπη): selfless, unconditional love
* * * Pragma (πραγματική): long-term, enduring love
* * * Mania (μάνια): obsessive or insane love
* * * Platonic (πλατώνικη): deep emotional connection without a romantic component
* * * Self-love (φιλοσέβεια / αγαπή της αυτού): loving oneself, as a prerequisite for loving others

These concepts of love have been influenced by ancient Greek philosophers such as Plato and Aristotle.

* * *

Love Changes the Calculus of Social Living ｜ The Feelings Lab Ep 9 Love Clip 2⧸4.txt
 The speaker is discussing the importance of love and how it goes beyond self-interest, which is often the focus in economics
and neuroscience. Love involves sacrifice, caring for others, and the release of oxytocin that shuts down the amygdala,
allowing us to fully engage in new experiences. Love changes our calculus in life by making us less focused on individual gains
and more concerned with the well-being of others. This shift from self-interest is essential for human connection and growth.

* * *

Psychedelics Catalyze a Search for Deeper Love ｜ The Feelings Lab Ep 9 Love Clip 3⧸4.txt
 The speaker expresses their curiosity about the authenticity of the love experienced during psychedelic use, suggesting it
could be a byproduct of the drug or an access to something inaccessible otherwise. They acknowledge the growing interest and
use of psychedelics for therapeutic purposes, especially among veterans and those suffering from various conditions. They also
emphasize that psychedelics are not about romantic love but rather a deep love of life and fellow human beings. The speaker
believes that psychedelics expand one's perspective, opening up to the wonders of life, and that it's essential to explore ways
to sustain this expanded awareness in everyday life. They share a personal story of a friend who went on a hero's journey with
psychedelics, eventually leading him to India to seek spiritual guidance and ultimately discovering unconditional love as his
teaching for the rest of his life. The speaker concludes by emphasizing the importance of understanding one's role in this
grand mystery and stretching the boundaries of love as far as possible.

* * *

Why Feeling Love Isn't a Choice ｜ The Feelings Lab Ep 9 Love Clip 4⧸4.txt
 The question at hand is about the inability to consciously choose who we love and the role of biology, specifically the
release of chemicals like oxytocin in the brain, in forming relationships. While we cannot consciously decide to feel a burst
of oxytocin, there are studies suggesting that the degree of pair bonding is correlated with an increase in oxytocin receptors
in certain areas of the brain. These changes are believed to be involuntary and part of our evolutionary response to form
lasting relationships for the purpose of nurturing offspring. However, conducting definitive experiments on humans is difficult
due to ethical concerns and the complexity of emotions involved.

Jason Silva is Bittersweet About New Years ｜ The Feelings Lab Ep 10 Holiday Emotions Clip 1⧸5.txt
 Jason describes his childhood holidays as exciting due to traveling to the U.S., shopping, and gifts. However, he developed a
bittersweet relationship with New Year's, particularly due to the passing of another year and the feelings of fleeting time and
mortality it brings. This is represented in the song "Old Lang Syne," which celebrates loved ones while acknowledging the
transience of life. Jason finds this theme of impermanence both sad and intriguing, and he continues to enjoy the emotional
intensity it brings despite the underlying anxiety.

Dacher Keltner Talks Tears ｜ The Feelings Lab Ep 10 Holiday Emotions Clip 2⧸5.txt
 The speaker is discussing the depth and complexity of tears, beyond just being associated with sadness. They mention an
analysis by psychologist Dan Siegel about how tears can be linked to recognizing the sacred and fleeting nature of experiences,
particularly during holidays. Tears serve multiple functions, including resolving dissonance, relieving stress, and allowing us
to digest and metabolize grief. The speaker also mentions the role of art and music in providing aesthetic distance for
processing emotions, using the example of the film "Love Actually" and its use of the song "God Only Knows." Overall, the
speaker is emphasizing the importance of acknowledging and working through the grief inherent to the human condition.

Alan Cowen on Nostalgia ｜ The Feelings Lab Ep 10 Holiday Emotions Clip 3⧸5.txt
 Nostalgia is an emotion that sits somewhat isolated on the map. It's related to static appreciation and transmit awe but is
unique due to its association with visiting old memories and feeling like you've stepped back into your past self. The feeling
arises from revisiting patterns of neurons in your brain that haven't been active for some time, typically connected to
specific memories or experiences. Unlike other emotions, the experience of nostalgia is a return to a previous state of mind,
making it a distinct emotional experience.

The Primal Origin of our Holiday Emotions ｜ The Feelings Lab Ep 10 Holiday Emotions Clip 4⧸5.txt
 The speaker is discussing the significance of holidays and how they tap into our biological and primal senses, particularly
during the winter season. They mention the cyclical nature of time passing and how holidays align with this, providing a sense
of reflection and relaxation. The speaker also touches upon the history of Christmas and how it was once a debaucherous holiday
before becoming the festive celebration we know today. They suggest that the need for an annual catharsis and appreciation for
what we have may be a pattern predisposed in humans, with food celebrations being one of the oldest forms of culture. The
speaker also highlights the importance of considering earlier predecessors to these holidays and their significance in bringing
people together.

Jason Silva Evokes Sacred Space and Time ｜ The Feelings Lab Ep 10 Holiday Emotions Clip 5⧸5.txt
 Jason finds the holidays a time for contemplation and reflection due to the rituals and excuses they provide for
introspection. He prefers to be in nature during this period, particularly open landscapes with vast horizons, as it allows him
to assess his life and set new goals. The holidays offer a temporary suspension of time, creating a liminal zone for adventure
and play.

Robots： The Next 20 Years ｜ The Feelings Lab Season Ep 11 Compassion and Robots Clip 2⧸3.txt
 The speaker believes that to avoid potential negative outcomes from advanced robotics and AI in the future, we should focus on
giving them social awareness and the ability to optimize for human well-being. This can be achieved through projects like
Moxie, which aims to give robots an understanding of human emotions and needs. Embodiment and control over the physical world
also expand the input and output space for AI, making it crucial to consider how they are programmed to accomplish goals with
consideration for human well-being.

Pop Culture Sci-Fi Robots Explained ｜ The Feelings Lab Season Ep 11 Clip Compassion and Robots 3⧸3.txt
 The speaker believes that while pop culture robots like Wally, R2-D2, and Baymax are entertaining, they may not accurately
depict the future of robotics. They suggest that the focus in the field is currently on creating intelligent, disembodied
agents and gradually introducing them into physical forms. These digital assistants will learn and adapt to individual users,
potentially even developing different personalities for each interaction. The speaker also predicts that within the next five
years, we will see the realization of voice agents like in the movie "Her," which could lead to advanced therapeutic
interventions using AI. Overall, the emphasis is on creating intelligent, empathetic, and emotionally connected robots rather
than childlike or anthropomorphic ones.

 In summary, Greg is discussing the potential uses of digital avatars with physical forms in enhancing customer experiences,
particularly in a digital world where differentiation among brands and companies is becoming increasingly challenging. He
mentions exploring areas like e-commerce stores, digital cooking coaches, skin care consultants, banking advisors, and
healthcare companions to create personalized brand experiences. The advantage of having a body for these avatars is that they
can recreate the real-world connection and interaction that people have with their favorite brands or retail stores, providing

Beyond Words： How We Build Trust ｜ The Feelings Lab Ep 23 Compassion and Customer Service Clip 1.txt
 The science behind why we share bad experiences more than good ones is rooted in our social nature and the way we interpret
interactions. We are relationship-oriented beings, and our assessment of how well we're being treated is based on nonverbal
cues and the speed of response to our needs or queries. A negative experience, such as being treated disrespectfully or
ignored, triggers a strong response in us, prompting us to share it with others to warn them or seek validation. On the other
hand, positive experiences might not seem as noteworthy, making us less inclined to share them. Our decision about whether
we've been well-treated is not based on what people say but rather on how they interact with us and respond to our needs in a
timely manner.

Fundamental Advances in Understanding Nonverbal Behavior ｜ Keynote by Alan Cowen ｜ ICML 2022.txt
 Alan Cowan, Chief Scientist of HUM AI and former Google Researcher and UC Berkeley PhD, discussed the importance of
understanding nonverbal expressions as they are a significant part of human communication, particularly when expressing wants,
needs, emotions, and sentiments. He introduced semantic space theory as a new way of thinking about emotions and expression,
which allows for deriving taxonomies from data without making assumptions about the nature of expressive behavior. Cowan talked
about the limitations of traditional approaches like the six basics approach and affective circumplex approach, and presented
findings from his research on human expressive behavior. He discussed how they spent five years gathering new types of data to
characterize semantic spaces in different modalities of expressive behavior, including vocal bursts, facial expressions, speech
prosody, and social context. Cowan also introduced the Hume VB dataset, which includes about 300,000 vocal bursts from
different cultures and demographics. He mentioned that vocal bursts are incredibly rich signals conveying many dimensions of
meaning and how they can be used to predict emotions and mental states with high accuracy using machine learning models. Cowan
also discussed the potential applications of this data in areas such as mental health, AI value alignment, and accessibility.
The Hume Initiative is also working on establishing guidelines for these use cases.

The Rise of Non-Peer-Reviewed Emotion Science ｜ The Feelings Lab Myths About Emotion Science Clip 2.txt
 The speaker argues that facial expressions are an important tool in animation and visual art to convey emotions and tell
stories. However, the correlation between facial expressions and emotions has been a subject of debate since the 19th century,
with some scientists arguing for and against the significance of facial expressions in expressing emotions. The speaker
criticizes a non-peer reviewed study that gained popular attention for suggesting that there is no correlation between facial
expressions and emotions as misinterpreted and oversimplified. The speaker emphasizes that facial expressions are just one
aspect of human expression, which also includes voice, body language, gaze, touch, gesture, blushing, tearing, and breathing.
The speaker argues that the importance of these various aspects of human expression has been overlooked due to the popularity
of the idea that facial expressions do not correlate with emotions. The speaker asserts that more research is needed to
understand the complex relationship between emotions and their expression through various channels.

Can AI Measure Our Emotions？ ｜ The Feelings Lab Ep 25 Misconceptions in Emotion Science Clip 3.txt
 The speaker argues against the critique that AI should not be used to measure expressions due to potential scientific flaws.
They explain that expressions are a combination of involuntary and voluntary responses, and serve as important tools for
communication. While some expressions may not directly reflect emotions, they can still provide valuable insights into what
people are trying to convey. The speaker also emphasizes the importance of being able to measure and control expressions using
technology, as these representations exist in large language models whether we like it or not. They caution against the harm
caused by arguments that dismiss the significance of measuring expressions with AI.

What Darwin Really Said About Expressions ｜ The Feelings Lab Ep 25 Myths About Emotion Science 4⧸6.txt
 The speaker believes that there is enough information available from Darwin's writings, particularly his work on the
expression of emotion in men and animals, to have a solid understanding of his thoughts. They emphasize that there may be
debates over the meanings of certain terms used by Darwin, but these can be resolved through careful study. The speaker also
distinguishes between Darwin's ideas and those of later researchers such as Paul Ekman, who studied facial expressions of
emotion. The speaker criticizes the idea that Darwin believed in essential or static expressions of emotion, arguing instead
that Darwin recognized the variability within each emotional category. Overall, the speaker argues that modern research on
emotion is building on the foundation laid by Darwin and that misunderstandings arise from confusing later theories with
Darwin's original ideas.

Examining the Origins of Expression ｜ The Feelings Lab Ep 25 Myths About Emotion Science Clip 5.txt
 The question at hand is how we can determine if expressions are universal. There are various sources of evidence to support
this claim. One such source is observing similar expressions in animals, such as the growl as a threat display in many mammals.
Another source is studying infants before they have much opportunity to learn about expressions. For instance, studies have
shown that infants react differently based on the expressions they see, like crossing a bridge only when their parents are
smiling. Cross-cultural studies, while challenging, have also provided evidence for the universality of expressions. By
conducting large-scale studies in which people from different cultures label and report the meanings of various expressions,
researchers have found that between 60 and 80% of expression meaning is shared across cultures.

The Facial Expressions Debate ｜ The Feelings Lab Ep 25 Myths About Emotion Science Clip 6.txt
 The debate over the significance and purpose of facial expressions in emotion science is long-standing and contentious.
Historical precedent, including the legacy of famous researchers like Paul Ekman, justifies continued research and publication
in this area. The visual nature of facial expressions made them easier to study and disseminate through books and journals than
other forms of expression such as sound. However, with advances in technology and the internet, there is now more focus on
vocal expressions and their role in emotion communication. This shift may lead to a more comprehensive understanding of
emotional expression in the future.

Emotions as Antennae ｜ The Feelings Lab Ep 26 The Emotion Revolution in Psychology Clip 2.txt
 In the work and research I've been involved in, emotion plays a significant role as it helps us detect relevance and
importance in our environment. Emotions act as "antennas," picking up on what is valuable or worthy in our surroundings. As
individuals, we can only learn about certain things from our own experiences. However, by observing the emotions of others, we
can gain insights into what they consider important or relevant, which can be useful for us. This learning extends beyond
biological needs and cultural norms, and can include decisions like supporting a particular sports team or choosing a religion.
Emotions help us navigate complex social situations and learn from one another.

Emotions Drive Learning ｜ The Feelings Lab Ep 26 The Emotion Revolution in Psychology Clip 3.txt
 The speaker, Alan, believes that learning is driven by emotions and social interactions. We make decisions on what to think
next based on our emotions, but as social organisms, we also learn from each other through expressions, conversations, and
shared objectives. Emotions also guide learning by determining the importance of new information. Social-effective learning is
the foundation of relationships, society, culture, and even early childhood development.

The Next Revolution in AI ｜ The Feelings Lab Ep 26 The Emotion Revolution in Psychology Clip 4.txt
 The speaker is discussing the future of AI technology, specifically focusing on the integration of social-effective learning.
They believe that this development will allow AI agents to learn from various sources, including other people and their
objectives, leading to more personalized and effective assistance. The use of Clippy as an example illustrates how this could
enhance user experience, with a Clippy-like agent capable of learning and adapting to individual needs in order to provide
better recommendations and assistance. The speaker anticipates that this development will occur within the next five years.

Overcoming Obstacles in Mental Healthcare ｜ Feelings Lab Ep 27 Future of Mental Health Assessment.txt
 The speaker emphasizes the importance of assessment and monitoring in mental health care, as they believe there is a
significant gap in this area compared to treatment. They share their personal experience with helping a friend deal with
depression and how they discovered that finding the right assessment and monitoring processes can be a long and difficult
journey. They also mention that research focusing on distinguishing between individuals with and without mental health issues,
rather than treatment itself, is crucial for ensuring people receive appropriate care. The speaker suggests that video games
could potentially be used to embed treatment into this process but sees assessment as the starting point.

AI Tools for Mental Health Assessment ｜ The Feelings Lab Ep 27 Future of Mental Health Assessment.txt
 The speaker believes that AI is essential in processing vast amounts of mental health data due to the limitation of human
capabilities. However, ethical use of AI is crucial to ensure it does not become biased and can correctly identify patterns for
various mental health conditions. The ultimate goal is to assess and predict appropriate treatments based on individual
symptoms within a short time frame.

The Future of Mental Healthcare ｜ The Feelings Lab Ep 27 Future of Mental Health Assessment Clip 4.txt
 In the next 10 years, technology like AI and diagnostic tools will have a significant impact on mental health treatment. The
focus will shift from categorizing mental health conditions to a more holistic approach that considers various objective and
subjective measures of well-being. This multi-dimensional approach aims to optimize treatments based on their overall effect on
an individual's mental health rather than prescribing multiple medications for different conditions. This could lead to a
transformed mental health system in the future, where interconnected mental health issues are treated as a whole and more
effective treatments are discovered.

Predicting Effective Treatments ｜ The Feelings Lab Ep 27 The Future of Mental Health Assessment.txt
 The speaker is discussing the limitations of diagnostic categories and the desire to move towards personalized treatment based
on all measurable symptoms, rather than just a diagnosis. They mention the overlap between conditions like depression and
anxiety, as well as the use of similar medications for both. They also mention the challenge of predicting which treatment will
be most effective for an individual based on their unique set of symptoms. The concept of subdiagnoses is introduced as a
potential solution, allowing for different types or subtypes of conditions to be identified and treated accordingly. The
speaker emphasizes the importance of considering all available information about a person's symptoms and behaviors in everyday
life to inform treatment decisions.

Why We Sigh ｜ The Feelings Lab Ep 28 Are Expressions Innate？＂ Clip 2.txt
 Emotional expressions serve various purposes, including communication and individual benefits. For communication, we express
emotions to signal feelings, behaviors, wants, and dislikes to others. Emotions can have community functions by conveying
information indirectly. However, some emotional expressions are produced solely for personal benefit. For instance, a sigh
might help restore physiological balance and may appear as a sign of relief to others. Overall, emotional expressions serve
both communicative and individual needs.

Expressions Across Cultures ｜ The Feelings Lab Ep 28 ＂Are Expressions Innate？＂ Clip 3.txt
 In creating motion maps, cultural differences were taken into account during the translation of terms and the identification
of emotions evoked by videos across different cultures. Some dimensions had direct translations, while others required adding
words or phrases to preserve meaning. Research showed that there are 21 shared emotional dimensions across cultures, including
positive emotions such as pride, admiration, love, and sexual desire. The breakdowns within positive emotions varied, with some
cultural differences in expression. A lower limit for this research was set at the emotional responses to videos, but it's
likely that there are more differences beyond that.

What is a Virtual Human？ ｜ The Feelings Lab Ep 29 The Future of AI That Talks Clip 1.txt
 A virtual human is defined as an embodied conversational agent that has a physical appearance in a virtual environment,
resembling a human. Virtual humans may also be defined more broadly as any entity with a human-sounding voice or imagined
presence. The main difference between virtual humans and other AI machines like chatbots is the inclusion of a physical body
and human-like appearance in virtual humans.

Models of the Mind ｜ The Feelings Lab Ep 29 The Future of AI That Talks  Clip 2.txt
 The speaker, who has limited exposure to the topic of emotion detection and interpretation through AI, is questioning how
early researchers in this field, like Alan, approached detecting emotions with seemingly limited tools. The speaker explains
that emotion can be understood as having components such as facial expressions, bodily reactions, and internal thoughts. Alan
focuses on facial expressions as an indicator of emotion.

The speaker describes their approach to the problem of emotion from a cognitive psychology perspective, specifically appraisal
theories. According to this theory, emotions arise from thoughts about how an event relates to us, such as whether it helps or
harms our goals, and whether we have control over it.

To detect emotions using AI, researchers would consider these thought processes based on given descriptions of events. For
example, if a bear enters the room, fear is not triggered until one realizes that the bear poses a threat to their safety.

The speaker concludes by explaining that given an expression recognized by Alan, they might try to infer likely appraisals or
judgments made by the person to elicit that facial expression.

The Future of Virtual Humans ｜ The Feelings Lab Ep 29 The Future of AI That Talks Clip 3.txt
 Looking 20 years ahead, I hope to see advanced personal assistants with whom we have a relationship. These AI entities will
communicate with us naturally and understand our needs, planning things like vacations. The challenge is that these
technologies should make us better people rather than just simplifying our lives. We'll likely communicate with AI through
conversation, as it's the persistent form of human communication, unlike programming which changes frequently. While some may
suggest learning to program or building neural interfaces, I believe that AI should adapt to our way of communication for a
persistent solution.

Lucid Dreaming ｜The Feelings Lab Ep 31 ｜Emotions and the Brain ｜ Clip 3.txt
 The speaker describes their experience with lucid dreams during high school. They would wake up early and use a technique to
enter a dream while staying aware that they were dreaming. In the beginning, they tried flying but found it difficult as it was
hard to keep themselves asleep in mid-air. Towards the end of their lucid dreaming phase, they preferred meditating instead of
doing anything else in the dreams. They found that meditating in a dream kept them in the state for longer periods, giving them
a disembodied feeling. The speaker's interest in lucid dreaming was inspired by movies like "The Matrix" and "Waking Life."

Emotions and Dreams ｜The Feelings Lab Ep 31 ｜Emotions and the Brain ｜ Clip 2.txt
 Research suggests that a significant proportion of dreams, around 60% to 70%, contain emotionally negative experiences. While
there's ongoing interest in understanding the connection between emotions and dreaming, collecting data is challenging due to
the limited access to dream reports and the difficulty in measuring REM sleep. Early-stage dreaming just after sleep onset
doesn't typically show remarkable emotional changes. REM sleep, known for producing dreams, requires waiting at least an hour
or more to identify dreams, making it difficult to study.

It's All Neural ｜ The Feelings Lab Ep 31 ｜ Emotions and the Brain ｜ Clip 1.txt
 In an attempt to understand what happens in the brain when we experience emotions, researchers have historically shown
participants a few stimuli per emotion and tried to distinguish these emotions based on brain activity. However, the results
were inconsistent due to the many differences between stimuli, leading some to argue that emotions may not involve consistent
brain activity.

To address this issue, researchers Yuki and his team decided to show as many stimuli as possible for each emotion to separate
out brain activity related to emotions versus visual and semantic properties of the stimuli. They found more consistent
representations of emotion across people and a wider range of emotions than previously thought. The patterns of brain activity
corresponding to different emotions were also remarkably consistent, and more so than could be explained by a low-dimensional
theory of emotion that emphasizes valence (positive or negative) and arousal (calm or excited) as core components. Instead,
they found less consistency in how people represent valence and arousal across different brain regions compared to specific
emotions.

Is Rapid Eye Movement Random ？ ｜ The Feelings Lab Ep 31 ｜ Emotions and the Brain ｜ Clip 4.txt
 The idea that our eyes moving rapidly during REM sleep indicate our brain looking around in the dream world is a theory, not a
proven fact. A study suggested that people's eye movements during lucid dreams are smoother than in rapid eye movement (REM)
sleep, implying that they might be following objects in their dream environment. However, another theory suggests that these
movements are random. Researchers are actively investigating this topic to determine the true nature of REM eye movements.

Psychology's Role in AI Development ｜ The Feelings Lab Ep 30 ｜ Making Tech Compatible with Wisdom.txt
 During his PhD studies, the speaker became fascinated with technology but wanted to add an empathy and human betterment
aspect. He began consulting with tech companies who were interested in building technology that understood people better and
optimized their well-being. Working with these companies, he realized that many of them had good intentions but were creating
technology that was optimized for engagement, often at the expense of mindfulness and well-being. This led him to believe that
psychology could play a significant role in the development of AI and help prevent negative consequences of technology
optimization.

Technology Compatible with Compassion ｜ The Feelings Lab Ep 30 ｜ Making Tech Compatible with Wisdom.txt
 In 1809, on another planet, there were emerging trends in technology and personal well-being that Sharon Salzberg sensed could
intersect in a significant way. She noticed her own strong interests in the power of technology and the importance of inner
peace, and she couldn't find many people who shared this intersection. She felt compelled to explore this potential connection
due to her belief that external technologies would continue to advance rapidly, but it was uncertain whether internal
technologies like compassion, wisdom, and mindfulness would keep pace or be overshadowed. Sharon believed that compassion was
crucial for maintaining a healthy culture, and she wanted to help ensure that the attention given to technological advancements
did not eclipse this essential aspect of human development. She felt compelled to engage in dialogue with tech industry leaders
rather than rejecting technology altogether, recognizing both its positive potential and its risks.
