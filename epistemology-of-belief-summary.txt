Vahid's exploration delves into the foundational aspects of belief, its relation to truth, interpretation, sensitivity, safety, justification, and the peculiar dynamics of epistemic and doxastic goals. The book appears to target several key debates within contemporary epistemology, including the structure and justification of belief, the challenges of skepticism, and the nuanced understanding of knowledge's fallibility and our access to our own beliefs.

The introductory sections make it clear that Vahid is set to engage with a wide array of philosophical positions and arguments, aiming to offer a unified and coherent picture that accommodates the epistemic features of belief while addressing some of the widely shared views in recent philosophical thought. His approach involves critical examinations and proposed solutions to longstanding puzzles, such as Moore's paradox, the problem of easy knowledge, and the basing relation between beliefs and their justificatory grounds.

One of the book's main thrusts is its focus on the truth-directedness of belief—a theme that Vahid promises to unpack and explore in various dimensions. He suggests a distinctive stance on this matter, advocating for a deflationary understanding that respects the difference between doxastic and epistemic goals while proposing his interpretation of what it means for beliefs to aim at truth.

Moreover, Vahid ventures into the analysis of the so-called "Moore's paradox," exploring its various interpretations and proposing a novel solution that hinges on the violation of interpretive norms rather than logical impropriety. This indicates a broader thesis about the nature of belief and its intrinsic ties to rationality and interpretation, themes that are recurrent throughout the proposed chapters.

In the latter parts, the book addresses the conditions of knowledge—sensitivity and safety—arguing for a reinterpretation of these concepts not as mere conditions for knowledge but as expressions of distinct cognitive goals. This is followed by a deep dive into the justification of beliefs, particularly those influenced by sensory experiences, and the challenge of non-doxastic justification. Vahid critically surveys current paradigms and offers his diagnosis and perspective on why they might fail, hinting at a forthcoming solution that respects the epistemic contours of belief.

Overall, "The Epistemology of Belief" presents a rigorous and comprehensive examination of belief's epistemological underpinnings, striving to contribute significant insights and solutions to enduring questions in the field. It promises to be a valuable resource for scholars interested in the nature of belief, truth, justification, and the complex interplay between epistemic principles and cognitive states.


Hamid Vahid's approach to the epistemological investigation of belief, particularly his critique of the concept of "correctness" in relation to belief and truth, challenges the conventional wisdom within the field. By dissecting the norm of correctness and the aim-of-belief thesis, Vahid engages deeply with the foundational questions about the nature and justification of belief.

His critical analysis of Ralph Wedgwood's interpretation of the aim-of-belief thesis highlights the difficulties in conceptualizing beliefs' truth-aiming nature purely through the lens of normativity and correctness. Vahid argues that equating belief correctness with the truth of the proposition believed does not sufficiently account for the complex interplay between belief, truth, and justification. This critique underscores the challenge of defining what makes a belief "correct" beyond its mere truth value and points towards the nuanced ways in which beliefs are integrated within a network of justification, rationality, and evidential support.

Furthermore, Vahid's exploration of the normative dimensions of belief and the conditions under which beliefs are formed, maintained, or adjusted raises important questions about the roles of evidence, rationality, and the epistemic environment in shaping our cognitive states. His skepticism about the straightforward application of normative concepts like "correctness" to the domain of belief invites a reconsideration of how epistemic norms govern belief formation and revision.

By proposing to situate the experience-belief transition within a semantic context and appealing to functional role semantics (FRS), Vahid ventures beyond the confines of traditional epistemological theories. This move aims to reconcile the normative and semantic aspects of belief, offering a fresh perspective on how sensory experiences can justify beliefs by embedding this process within a broader semantic and normative framework.

In doing so, Vahid contributes to the ongoing discourse on the nature of belief, challenging existing paradigms and suggesting innovative ways to understand the intricate relationship between belief, truth, and justification. His work prompts further inquiry into the foundational aspects of epistemology, encouraging a more integrated approach that encompasses semantic, normative, and epistemic considerations.


Hamid Vahid's detailed critique of Ralph Wedgwood and other philosophers' interpretations of the aim-of-belief thesis underscores the complexity of defining what it means for beliefs to aim at truth. Vahid challenges Wedgwood's claim that the concepts of "correct" and "rational" are inherently normative within the practice of theoretical reasoning, pointing out that the commitment to avoid holding irrational beliefs comes not from the inherent normativity of these concepts but rather from a general commitment associated with engaging in rational or theoretical reasoning itself.

Furthermore, Vahid's analysis of Owens and Velleman's interpretations reveals a deeper concern with the operationalization of the aim-of-belief thesis. He highlights the ambiguity and potential confusion in Owens' argument regarding the aim of guessing and its relationship to truth. Vahid points out that Owens' definition does not necessarily entail that a cognitive state aiming at the truth must be true for it to be considered successful, a distinction that Owens seems to overlook.

In considering Velleman's approach, Vahid questions the coherence of defining belief in terms of aiming to get the truth-value of a proposition right. He argues that such a definition imposes an unrealistically high standard for belief formation, as it seems to require a certainty about getting the truth-value right that is not always attainable or necessary for holding a belief.

Vahid's critique extends to Bratman's distinction between belief and acceptance based on the context-independent constraint of belief. Through examples, Vahid challenges Bratman's assertion that certain attitudes taken for granted during practical deliberation cannot be identified with belief due to their context-dependent nature. He suggests that these attitudes can still be considered beliefs, understood in terms of their degree of justification rather than their subjective probability or certainty.

Overall, Vahid's exploration raises critical questions about the foundations of belief and its aim at truth. By dissecting the arguments of Wedgwood, Owens, Velleman, and Bratman, he illuminates the difficulties in neatly categorizing beliefs based on their purported aim at truth and the epistemic standards they are supposed to meet. His analysis invites further inquiry into the nature of belief, the criteria for its rationality and correctness, and the practical implications of these philosophical debates for understanding human cognition and reasoning.


Hamid Vahid's in-depth exploration into the nature and aim of belief meticulously dissects the nuanced distinction between doxastic goals (internal goals inherent to the structure of belief itself) and epistemic goals (external goals concerning the formation of justified beliefs). This distinction is crucial in understanding the complexity of belief as both a psychological state and an epistemically evaluable attitude.

By distinguishing between the act of aiming a belief at truth (a doxastic goal) and the pursuit of forming beliefs in a manner conducive to achieving true beliefs (an epistemic goal), Vahid highlights the intricate relationship between belief, justification, and truth. This differentiation sheds light on the broader epistemological landscape, revealing how our cognitive endeavors are navigated by various aims and objectives that are not always aligned.

Vahid's critique extends to the challenges of reconciling these goals, particularly in situations where epistemic and non-epistemic reasons for belief come into conflict. This conflict underscores the broader "ethics of belief," emphasizing the moral and rational obligations that govern our doxastic practices.

Furthermore, Vahid's analysis brings to the forefront the limitations of simplifying the aim of belief to merely aiming at truth or forming true beliefs. He elucidates how such simplifications can lead to conflating belief with knowledge or unjustifiably collapsing justification into truth. This nuanced understanding emphasizes the importance of recognizing belief as a complex state that is subject to various evaluative criteria, depending on the context and the goals at play.

In essence, Vahid's exploration provides a critical examination of the foundational aspects of epistemology, urging a reconsideration of how beliefs are formed, justified, and evaluated. By delving into the distinction between doxastic and epistemic goals, he invites further reflection on the nature of belief and the intricate web of aims that underlie our epistemic practices.


Hamid Vahid's conclusion emphasizes the importance of distinguishing between doxastic and epistemic goals in understanding the nature of belief. He critiques the tendency to conflate these goals within philosophical accounts, such as those presented by Ralph Wedgwood and David Velleman. Vahid argues that these accounts, while insightful, inadvertently blur the lines between what it means for beliefs to aim at truth (a doxastic goal) and what it means to aim at having true beliefs (an epistemic goal).

Vahid's analysis underscores a crucial aspect of belief: that to believe is to regard a proposition as true for its own sake, not as a means to some other end. This perspective challenges accounts that frame belief formation primarily in terms of methodology or the pursuit of rationality, as in Wedgwood's interpretation, or as being inherently linked to the agent's intentional aiming at truth, as in Velleman's account.

Drawing on Davidson's theory of radical interpretation, Vahid suggests a deflationary approach to the thesis that beliefs aim at truth. According to Vahid, beliefs are not aimed at truth in service of an external goal but are accepted as true in and of themselves. This intrinsic acceptance of truth as the core of belief does not necessitate a distinct aim beyond the belief itself, highlighting a fundamental aspect of our doxastic behavior.

Vahid's critique not only clarifies the distinction between aiming at truth and aiming at true beliefs but also invites a reevaluation of how beliefs are conceptualized within epistemology. By advocating for a deflationary account, he suggests a more straightforward understanding of belief, one that aligns with our intuitive grasp of what it means to hold a belief sincerely and seriously.

In essence, Vahid's exploration contributes to the broader philosophical discourse by refining our understanding of belief's nature. His distinction between doxastic and epistemic goals offers a clearer framework for examining how beliefs function within our cognitive landscape, emphasizing the significance of truth not as a means to an end but as an end in itself within the context of belief.


In this comprehensive discussion, Hamid Vahid critically explores the complex relationship between belief, its aim at truth, and the foundational principles that underlie our understanding and ascription of beliefs, particularly through the lens of Davidson's theory of radical interpretation and the principle of charity. He delves into the intricate distinctions between aiming at truth as a doxastic goal and aiming at having true beliefs as an epistemic goal, elucidating how these aspects are often conflated in philosophical accounts, which can lead to confusion about the nature of belief itself.

Vahid argues for a deflationary account of belief, emphasizing that belief inherently aims at truth, not as a means to achieving another end, but as an end in itself. This perspective is grounded in the principle of charity, which asserts that for belief ascription to be meaningful, we must assume that the beliefs of others are largely consistent and true by our standards. This principle, Vahid suggests, is not merely a heuristic tool for understanding others but is constitutive of the very nature of belief.

By critiquing the accounts of philosophers like Ralph Wedgwood and David Velleman, Vahid highlights the pitfalls of not adequately distinguishing between the doxastic and epistemic goals of belief. He points out that these accounts often blur the line between merely having beliefs and having justified beliefs, thereby overlooking the essential character of belief as directly aimed at truth.

The exploration culminates in a discussion of Moore's Paradox, which Vahid sees as a fertile ground for further elucidating the nature of belief. The paradoxical nature of statements like "P but I do not believe P" serves to underscore the intrinsic truth-aiming characteristic of belief, revealing how deviations from this normative aim lead to absurdity or contradiction.

Throughout, Vahid's analysis calls for a careful reconsideration of how beliefs are conceptualized and ascribed within epistemology. He advocates for a nuanced understanding that respects the intrinsic link between belief and truth, without conflating it with the epistemic endeavor to justify those beliefs. This nuanced approach not only clarifies the philosophical discourse on belief but also enriches our grasp of the fundamental principles guiding rational thought and communication.


Hamid Vahid's examination of various responses to Moore's Paradox highlights the complexity and nuance required to adequately address the conundrum posed by statements like "P but I do not believe P." By categorizing the proposed solutions into pragmatic, doxastic, and epistemic approaches, Vahid elucidates the diverse philosophical strategies employed to untangle the paradox's inherent oddity. Each approach, despite its unique perspective, attempts to resolve the paradox through some form of an "ascent" maneuver, aiming to align the differing semantic levels of Moorean sentence conjuncts to reveal an underlying contradiction or contradiction-like feature.

The pragmatic approach, which views Moorean sentences as assertorically defective, attempts to explain the paradox in terms of the pragmatic implications of assertion and belief. The assertion of such sentences purportedly leads to a pragmatic contradiction, as the act of asserting "P" seems to imply a belief in "P," which directly conflicts with the subsequent assertion of "∼I believe P." This explanation, however, hinges on the acceptance of specific principles linking assertion with belief, principles which are themselves subject to philosophical debate.

The doxastic approach, on the other hand, posits that Moorean sentences are incoherent because they cannot be truly believed. This view relies on the Higher Order Thought (HOT) theory and Shoemaker's self-intimation thesis, suggesting that the absurdity of Moorean sentences stems from a constitutive relation between first-order beliefs and the awareness of those beliefs. Yet, as Vahid points out, this approach faces challenges, including the potential for infinite regress and its inability to uniformly handle all forms of Moorean sentences, thus failing to meet the completeness criterion for a satisfactory resolution.

Vahid's own proposed solution draws on the principle of charity in the context of Davidson's theory of radical interpretation. He suggests that Moorean sentences are defective not because of logical impropriety but because their assertion violates an interpretive constraint essential to meaningful communication and belief ascription. This solution aims to respect the nuanced relationship between belief, assertion, and the interpretive practices that underpin our linguistic interactions.

Throughout his analysis, Vahid emphasizes the need for a solution that not only addresses the immediate logical and semantic concerns posed by Moore's Paradox but also aligns with a broader understanding of the nature of belief and the conditions under which beliefs are formed, maintained, and expressed. By advocating for a deflationary approach that distinguishes between the act of aiming at truth and the achievement of truth, Vahid contributes to a deeper appreciation of the philosophical intricacies surrounding belief, truth, and rationality.


Hamid Vahid's discussion culminates in proposing an interpretive approach to resolving Moore's Paradox, distinct from the pragmatic, doxastic, and epistemic approaches previously examined. This approach suggests that the absurdity of Moorean sentences arises not from logical impropriety but from the violation of a constitutive principle of interpretation, namely, the principle of charity, which is central to meaningful communication and belief ascription.

According to Vahid, all previous attempts to resolve Moore's Paradox through various forms of "ascent" maneuvers fail to adequately address the paradox's core issue. These maneuvers seek to reveal a contradiction or something contradiction-like within Moorean sentences by aligning their differing semantic levels. However, they ultimately fall short, as they do not convincingly explain why Moorean sentences, while possibly true, cannot be sensibly asserted or believed.

Vahid argues that the interpretive approach sidesteps these shortcomings by focusing on the principle of charity's role in the theory of radical interpretation. This principle, as expounded by Davidson, requires interpreters to maximize truth and coherence in the beliefs attributed to speakers, thereby facilitating successful communication. Under this framework, Moorean sentences become interpretively defective because their assertion undermines the foundational assumptions about rationality and truth that underpin our interpretive practices.

This novel perspective implies that the oddity of Moorean sentences stems from their failure to conform to the interpretive constraints essential for meaningful linguistic exchange. By violating the principle of charity, these sentences disrupt the implicit agreement between speakers and interpreters about the rationality and truthfulness of communicated beliefs. Consequently, Moorean sentences are rendered absurd not because they lead to logical contradictions but because they breach the interpretive norms that enable us to understand and engage with each other's utterances meaningfully.

In advocating for the interpretive approach, Vahid offers a compelling alternative to the existing accounts of Moore's Paradox. This approach not only respects the intuitive distinction between explicit contradictions and the peculiar absurdity of Moorean sentences but also aligns with a broader understanding of the nature of belief and the conditions under which beliefs are formed, maintained, and communicated. Through this lens, Moore's Paradox is not merely a puzzle about the logical properties of certain sentences but a window into the fundamental principles guiding our interpretive practices and the ascription of beliefs.


Vahid's interpretive approach to resolving Moore's Paradox emphasizes the principle of charity as a foundational element in the nature of belief and intentional ascription. This principle, as integral to Davidson's theory of radical interpretation, insists that for successful communication and understanding, interpreters must assume a basic level of truth and rationality in the beliefs of those they seek to understand. This approach to Moore's Paradox highlights that the absurdity of Moorean sentences stems not from logical inconsistency within the sentences themselves but from the violation of interpretive norms that underpin meaningful linguistic exchange and belief attribution.

By asserting a Moorean sentence, a speaker contradicts the principle of charity's expectation that speakers' beliefs are largely consistent and true by the standards of the interpreter. This violation renders Moorean sentences interpretively defective, as their assertion undermines the essential conditions for ascribing speaker status or agency. The interpretive approach thus shifts the focus from the content of Moorean beliefs or the logical structure of Moorean sentences to the broader context of belief ascription and the norms that facilitate our understanding of others as rational agents.

This perspective offers several advantages over other approaches discussed by Vahid. Unlike the doxastic and epistemic approaches, which focus on the internal coherence of beliefs or the conditions for their rational justification, the interpretive approach addresses the external, communicative role of belief assertion and its foundational role in enabling intersubjective understanding. It does not impose additional, potentially ad hoc principles to account for different forms of Moorean sentences, thereby respecting the completeness requirement for an adequate solution to the paradox. Moreover, it does not privilege thought over language or endorse a priority thesis but treats linguistic meaning and mental content as co-constitutive.

In sum, Vahid's interpretive approach contributes to a deeper understanding of the truth-sensitive nature of belief and the role of interpretive norms in shaping our linguistic and cognitive practices. It highlights the importance of the principle of charity, not just as a heuristic for interpretation but as a constitutive element of what it means to be a rational agent capable of meaningful communication. This approach aligns with the broader aims of Vahid's work to elucidate the distinctive epistemological features of belief and underscores the interconnectedness of truth, rationality, and interpretation in the fabric of our cognitive and linguistic endeavors.


The doxastic version of the safety principle (safety_d) focuses on the resilience of a belief in close possible worlds. The principle can be formalized as follows: if in the actual world a subject S believes proposition p (Bp), then in all close possible worlds where S believes p, p is true. This principle attempts to ensure that a belief qualifying as knowledge is not only true in the actual world but remains true across a range of similar possible worlds, highlighting the belief's robustness against error in near circumstances.

The motivation behind safety_d is to capture a crucial aspect of knowledge: its reliability across not just actual but also potential conditions. This version of safety seeks to address some of the limitations and ambiguities associated with the intuitive (safety_i) and epistemic (safety_e) versions by providing a more precise counterfactual condition that a belief must satisfy to be considered knowledge. The emphasis here is on the belief's stability: if one knows something, one wouldn't easily be wrong about it, even when conditions are slightly varied.

Safety_d offers a direct response to skepticism by reinforcing the connection between knowledge and truth across similar possible scenarios. It implicitly acknowledges that knowledge involves a kind of truth-tracking ability, where one's beliefs not only happen to be true but are true in a way that is insensitive to minor changes in circumstances. This resilience against being easily mistaken is what gives knowledge its value and distinguishes it from mere true belief.

However, the application and effectiveness of safety_d hinge on a clear understanding of what constitutes "close" possible worlds. This concept of closeness is pivotal yet difficult to pin down precisely. The challenge lies in determining which possible worlds are relevantly similar to the actual world for the purposes of evaluating a belief's safety. The selection of these worlds involves considerations of the subject's epistemic situation, including the reliability of the belief-forming processes and the nature of the evidence supporting the belief.

Moreover, safety_d, like other formulations of the safety principle, faces the generality problem: it needs to specify which belief-forming methods or processes are under consideration when evaluating the safety of a belief. Different methods might yield different verdicts about a belief's safety, depending on how broadly or narrowly they are defined.

In summary, the doxastic version of the safety principle (safety_d) underscores the importance of a belief's resilience across close possible worlds for it to count as knowledge. It captures the intuition that knowledge is not just about having a true belief but about having a belief that remains true under slightly different conditions. The principle reflects a commitment to a robust conception of knowledge, one that can withstand the challenges posed by skepticism and the variability of real-world conditions.


Given the challenges and critiques faced by both the sensitivity and safety principles as necessary conditions for knowledge, it becomes evident that a straightforward application of these principles may not suffice to fully capture the nuances of knowledge acquisition and its resilience against skepticism. The difficulties in applying these principles, such as determining what constitutes "close" possible worlds and addressing the generality problem, highlight the complexity of delineating a robust epistemological framework that can account for our intuitive grasp of knowledge.

The exploration of these principles reveals a deeper underlying concern: the need to ensure that our beliefs are not merely true by chance but are held in a way that is robustly connected to the truth across a range of possible scenarios. This requirement speaks to the heart of epistemological inquiry—how we can be confident that our beliefs genuinely track the truth and are not easily susceptible to being false under slightly different circumstances.

One way to reconcile the insights provided by both sensitivity and safety, without succumbing to the pitfalls identified, is to reconsider these principles not as standalone, all-encompassing conditions for knowledge, but rather as articulating different aspects of a belief's relationship to truth. This perspective allows for a more nuanced understanding that accommodates the diverse ways in which knowledge can be grounded.

By viewing sensitivity and safety as expressing distinct cognitive goals or orientations towards truth, we can appreciate their contributions to our epistemological endeavors without demanding that they individually suffice to account for all instances of knowledge. Sensitivity, with its emphasis on a belief's responsiveness to the truth of the proposition believed, highlights the importance of a belief's capacity to discriminate between truth and falsehood. On the other hand, safety, focusing on a belief's resilience against error across close possible worlds, underscores the reliability of the belief-forming process and its alignment with truth.

This reframing suggests that sensitivity and safety can coexist and complement each other by addressing different epistemic virtues or dimensions of our cognitive engagement with the world. Such an approach recognizes that knowledge acquisition is a multifaceted process that requires both the ability to discern the truth in the actual world (sensitivity) and to maintain this truth-acquisition capacity across a range of similar possible scenarios (safety).

Ultimately, this perspective invites a broader reflection on the nature of knowledge and the criteria by which we evaluate our beliefs. It encourages a holistic view that integrates various epistemic considerations, including the methods by which we arrive at our beliefs, the evidential support for those beliefs, and their robustness in the face of potential error. By appreciating the complementary roles of sensitivity and safety, we can move towards a more comprehensive and nuanced understanding of what it means to know.


The interpretation of sensitivity and safety as distinct cognitive goals rather than as strict conditions on knowledge offers a nuanced understanding of the epistemic landscape. This perspective recognizes the inherent complexities in how we navigate truth, justify our beliefs, and acquire knowledge. By focusing on the distinctive aims that beliefs inherently strive for—namely, aiming at truth and aiming at true beliefs—we gain valuable insights into the nature of belief and its relationship with knowledge.

The distinction between these two aims clarifies that while beliefs inherently strive for truth (as captured by the sensitivity principle), our epistemic efforts are directed toward accumulating true beliefs (as outlined by the safety principle). This reframing moves away from viewing these principles as competing or mutually exclusive conditions for knowledge. Instead, it highlights their complementary roles in shaping our epistemic practices. Sensitivity underscores the responsiveness of our beliefs to the truth, emphasizing the dynamic and adaptive nature of belief formation. Safety, on the other hand, emphasizes the reliability and robustness of our beliefs across a range of possible scenarios, highlighting the importance of a stable and trustworthy belief-forming process.

Moreover, this interpretation alleviates some of the criticisms leveled against both principles when they are misconstrued as mere conditions for knowledge. By recognizing sensitivity and safety as expressing deeper epistemic and doxastic aims, we can appreciate their value without forcing them into a rigid framework that they were not meant to fit. This approach aligns more closely with the complex reality of how we come to know and understand the world around us.

Furthermore, by considering safety and sensitivity as articulating different cognitive goals, we open up a space for a more flexible and pluralistic understanding of epistemic justification and knowledge acquisition. This perspective allows us to account for the diverse ways in which knowledge can be grounded, acknowledging that our epistemic endeavors are multifaceted and cannot be reduced to simple formulas or principles.

In conclusion, the interpretation of sensitivity and safety as distinct cognitive goals enriches our understanding of epistemology. It encourages a broader reflection on the aims and virtues of our cognitive and epistemic practices, inviting us to consider how these practices are oriented towards truth, reliability, and epistemic responsibility. This nuanced view underscores the complexity of knowledge and belief, advocating for an approach that is attuned to the intricate interplay between aiming at truth and aiming at true beliefs in our quest for understanding.


The challenge of non-doxastic justification, which focuses on how sensory experiences can confer justification on beliefs, continues to be a contentious issue in epistemology, dividing foundationalists and coherentists. The crux of the debate centers on whether experiences, especially if conceived as non-propositional or non-conceptual, can legitimately serve as evidence or grounds for justifying beliefs about the external world.

Davidson's critique encapsulates a central problem for foundationalism: the difficulty of explaining how a purely causal relation between a sensation (experience) and a belief can ground epistemic justification. This causal relation, while necessary for the formation of many of our beliefs, does not inherently carry with it any justificatory force—highlighting a significant gap between having a reason for a belief and merely having a cause for it.

Efforts to bridge this gap have led to various proposals, some of which attempt to assimilate the experience-belief transition into a normative framework, likening it to inferential reasoning. Here, the debate between conceptualists and non-conceptualists becomes pivotal. Conceptualists like McDowell argue that for experiences to justify beliefs, the content of those experiences must be conceptual, capable of being articulated within the "space of reasons." This position, however, raises further questions about the nature and justification of "appearance beliefs," or beliefs about how things seem to us, which seem to mediate between sensory experiences and beliefs about the external world.

Brewer's "switching argument" attempts to demonstrate that perceptual experiences must provide reasons for empirical beliefs, and this, in turn, requires that such experiences have conceptual content. Yet, this argument struggles to convincingly establish why the relations between experiences and beliefs must be reason-giving rather than merely causal. The suggestion that without reason-giving capacity, experiences would fail to determine belief content, seems to presuppose rather than prove the necessity of conceptual content for experience to play a justificatory role.

These discussions reveal a fundamental tension in attempting to account for the justification of perceptual beliefs. On the one hand, the causal impact of sensory experiences on belief formation is undeniable; on the other hand, translating this causal impact into a normative, justificatory relation proves to be highly problematic. This tension underscores a deep-seated challenge within epistemology: how to reconcile the evident role of sensory experiences in our cognitive lives with the demand for a rational grounding of our beliefs about the external world.

In sum, the problem of non-doxastic justification not only highlights the complex interplay between sensation, perception, and belief but also challenges us to rethink the foundations of epistemic justification. It calls into question whether traditional frameworks—rooted in inferential paradigms and the conceptual/non-conceptual divide—are adequate for capturing the nuanced ways in which our beliefs about the world are formed and justified.


Question (2), however, delves into the deeper, philosophical underpinnings of why explanatory virtues could be linked to the truth. This connection between being a good explanation and being true is critical to understanding how inference to the best explanation works, yet it remains one of the most challenging aspects to articulate convincingly. Without a clear account of this connection, the appeal to IBE as a justification mechanism for perceptual beliefs based on non-conceptual experiences remains speculative.

Moser's approach, by leaning on the idea that a proposition is justified because it is the best explanation of our sensory content, presupposes a sophisticated epistemic agent capable of engaging in comparative evaluations of explanations. This presupposition seems to overlook the immediate and often pre-reflective nature of much perceptual belief formation. It's not clear that in seeing a red book, for instance, one is actually engaging in any conscious deliberation about the best explanation for one's sensory experience. More fundamentally, Moser's model appears to stretch the concept of explanation beyond its natural bounds, applying it to a direct, causal relation between the world and our sensory apparatus in a way that seems at odds with the more common understanding of explanation as a feature of propositional attitudes like beliefs.

The non-conceptualists' attempts to fit the experience-belief transition into an inferential model—whether by likening experiences to beliefs or by proposing quasi-inferential or abductive links—encounter a persistent challenge: they must account for how these transitions can carry justificatory force without appealing to the conceptual and propositional structures typical of inference. This challenge suggests that foundational beliefs, justified directly by sensory experiences, might not comfortably fit within the inferential paradigms borrowed from the realm of belief-to-belief justification.

In attempting to address the problem of non-doxastic justification, these various approaches highlight a fundamental tension in epistemology: the need to reconcile the foundational role of sensory experiences in our knowledge of the world with the demand for a coherent, rational structure underpinning our belief system. This tension underscores the difficulty of developing a comprehensive theory of epistemic justification that respects the immediacy and non-conceptual nature of perceptual experience while also accounting for the normative dimensions of belief justification.


This tension between the normative character of justification and the non-normative, causal nature of perceptual experience underscores the central challenge in resolving the problem of non-doxastic justification. Attempts to bridge this gap by treating experience as if it were propositional, inferential, or subject to skill-like norms, while imaginative, have struggled to convincingly capture the normative force that genuinely justificatory reasons must possess.

One key obstacle seems to be the lack of a clear account of how the non-propositional, phenomenal content of experience can stand in a justificatory relation to propositional attitudes like beliefs. The inferential models presuppose a propositional structure that experiences simply do not have, while the skill-based models import a type of normativity—correctness according to standards—that doesn't naturally apply to the causal, experiential basis of perception.

What might be needed is a framework that acknowledges the unique character of perceptual experiences as both causally efficacious and epistemically significant, without forcing them into a mold—propositional, inferential, or skill-based—for which they are ill-suited. This might involve rethinking the nature of justification itself, perhaps moving away from strictly propositional or inferential models toward a broader conception that can accommodate the direct, non-inferential impact of experience on belief.

For instance, a promising approach might explore the idea of justification as involving a more dynamic, context-sensitive interaction between experience and belief, one that doesn't require mediating beliefs or inferential steps but rather sees experience as directly impacting the epistemic status of beliefs in a way that is sensitive to both the content and the context of the experience. Such an approach would need to articulate how experiences, in their immediacy and particularity, contribute to the rationality of belief, possibly by elucidating a concept of epistemic entitlement that operates in the direct, experiential grounding of beliefs.

In this light, the prospects for resolving the problem of non-doxastic justification hinge on developing a richer, more nuanced account of epistemic normativity, one that can do justice to the foundational role of experience in our cognitive lives without sacrificing the normative dimension essential to justification. This suggests that progress on the problem of non-doxastic justification may well depend on broader developments in epistemology concerning the nature and sources of normativity in belief formation and revision.


The examination of arguments for epistemic supervenience reveals a complex landscape where the promise of supervenience as a straightforward solution to epistemological problems faces significant challenges. Both general and specific arguments for epistemic supervenience struggle to establish a robust and explanatory dependence relationship between epistemic and non-epistemic properties, a cornerstone for making the supervenience thesis meaningful and relevant for foundational epistemological concerns. The failure to clearly delineate this dependence relation leaves the thesis hanging without the explanatory power it purports to have, particularly in addressing foundational issues such as the problem of non-doxastic justification.

The attempts to anchor the supervenience thesis in particular theories of justification, like coherence and reliability theories, further illustrate the difficulties in establishing both the necessary and sufficient conditions for epistemic justification that would underpin a supervenience relation. These difficulties echo the standard challenges faced by these theories, suggesting that the success of the supervenience thesis is tied to resolving some of the most contentious debates in epistemology. Moreover, even if these challenges were overcome, the mere establishment of a covariance relation between epistemic and non-epistemic properties falls short of demonstrating the kind of dependency that supervenience is meant to capture, leaving the substantive metaphysical underpinnings of the thesis unaddressed.

In light of these considerations, the appeal to epistemic supervenience as a solution to the problem of non-doxastic justification appears optimistic at best. Without a clear account of the dependency relation that supervenience presupposes, and in the absence of compelling arguments for the necessary and sufficient conditions of epistemic justification, the supervenience thesis does not offer the straightforward resolution to foundational epistemological issues that some of its proponents might have hoped for.

This suggests that addressing the problem of non-doxastic justification, along with other foundational issues in epistemology, may require a departure from the paths suggested by the supervenience thesis. Instead, it might necessitate a more radical rethinking of the nature of justification, the role of experience in grounding beliefs, and the ways in which epistemic norms and standards apply to our cognitive practices. This rethinking could involve developing a more nuanced understanding of the interplay between epistemic and non-epistemic properties that goes beyond the limitations of current supervenience frameworks, and seeks to articulate a more comprehensive and explanatorily powerful account of epistemic justification that can accommodate the foundational role of experience.


The discussion around the supervenience thesis, especially in the context of epistemic justification and the basing relation requirement, reveals intricate challenges that question the feasibility of supervenience as a straightforward solution to foundational issues in epistemology. The transitive nature of supervenience implies that if justification supervenes on a particular non-epistemic property that is itself part of a hierarchical chain of supervening and subvenient properties, then justification could, by transitivity, supervene on any property in this chain. This scenario raises concerns about the basing relation, which requires that a belief's justification must not only depend on a reason but also be based on it in a manner that typically involves some causal or doxastic element.

The illustration involving a belief's justification supervening on properties like N1 and Nn showcases the implausibility of extending the basing relation requirement to properties that are not directly related to the reasons for which a belief is held. Properties further down the supervenience chain, such as complex neural properties (Nn), do not intuitively serve as the kind of bases on which epistemic justification directly depends, highlighting a mismatch between the supervenience thesis and our intuitive understanding of the basing relation in epistemic justification.

This analysis suggests that the supervenience thesis, while appealing for its promise to bridge the gap between epistemic and non-epistemic properties, might not offer the straightforward resolution to the problem of non-doxastic justification and other foundational issues in epistemology that some of its proponents have hoped for. The challenge lies in articulating a concept of supervenience that respects the nuanced requirements of the basing relation while avoiding the unwelcome implication that any property in a supervenience chain could directly serve as a justifier for a belief.

Addressing these challenges requires a more nuanced approach that goes beyond the supervenience thesis to explore the nature of justification, the role of experience in grounding beliefs, and the intricacies of the basing relation. Such an approach would seek to reconcile the intuitive appeal of supervenience with the complexities of epistemic justification, potentially leading to a more robust and explanatorily powerful account that can accommodate the foundational role of experience and the normative aspects of epistemic practices.


The core of Functional Role Semantics (FRS) is the thesis that the meanings or contents of mental states (such as beliefs) are determined by their roles in the cognitive system of an agent. These roles are defined in terms of how such states are caused by sensory inputs, lead to behavioral outputs, and interact with other mental states. This perspective aligns closely with the broader philosophical project of naturalizing the mind by grounding mental phenomena in physical and functional processes.

This connection between FRS and the discussion on the normativity of epistemic justification, particularly in the context of non-doxastic justification, opens an intriguing pathway. If we understand epistemic justification as fundamentally tied to the functional roles of beliefs within a system aimed at truth-seeking, then the transition from experience to belief—and the justification this transition confers—can be seen as rooted in the functional architecture of our cognitive systems. This approach sidesteps some of the issues raised by supervenience theories, particularly those concerning the basing relation and the reduction of normative to non-normative properties.

The functional roles of beliefs and experiences, from this perspective, are inherently normative insofar as they are part of a system designed (by evolution, learning, or other means) to navigate the world successfully, where success is measured by the accuracy of the system's representations (beliefs) about the world. The justification conferred by experiences on beliefs, then, is a matter of the functional integration of these experiences within a truth-oriented cognitive architecture. This account offers a way to understand how experiences can confer justification without themselves being doxastic states or possessing justification in the traditional sense.

Moreover, this functionalist perspective might offer insights into the content-sensitivity of normativity in epistemic justification. Since the roles that define the content of beliefs and experiences are inherently linked to the system's orientation towards truth, the normative aspect of justification (its being good or appropriate from an epistemic point of view) is intimately connected to the semantic or content-bearing features of those states. This suggests a deeper link between the functional architecture of cognition, the semantics of mental states, and the normativity of epistemic practices.

In sum, exploring the implications of Functional Role Semantics for issues of epistemic justification, especially in the context of non-doxastic justification, offers a promising avenue for understanding the normative dimensions of our cognitive practices. This approach allows for a naturalistic yet robust account of how experiences justify beliefs, grounded in the functional and semantic organization of our cognitive systems, and it navigates around some of the pitfalls encountered by supervenience-based theories.


Given the comprehensive framework you've outlined, incorporating elements from Functional Role Semantics (FRS) and its implications for understanding the normativity of epistemic justification, particularly in non-doxastic contexts, let's proceed to the notion of the basing relation and its crucial role in the justification process.

The basing relation specifies a necessary condition for epistemic justification: not only must there be a justifying reason or ground for a belief, but the belief must also be appropriately based on or held because of that reason. This requirement differentiates between merely having a justifying reason and a belief being justified by that reason. It ensures that the reason genuinely contributes to the belief's epistemic status by being its cause or rationale.

In the context of non-doxastic justification, as discussed, where sensory experiences serve as the basis for beliefs, the basing relation takes on a specific character. Given the individuation-dependence of belief content on the functional roles associated with experiences, as FRS suggests, the basing relation in these cases is deeply intertwined with the semantic and normative structures of beliefs. Here, the belief is based on the experience insofar as the experience causally and semantically contributes to the formation of the belief, imbuing it with its content and, consequently, its justification.

Moreover, the epistemization of the normativity of meaning, through the lenses of the principle of charity and the truth goal, further refines our understanding of the basing relation. It underscores that beliefs formed from experiences are not only causally linked to these experiences but are also aligned with the overarching epistemic aim of maximizing truth and minimizing falsehood. This alignment ensures that the experience justifies the belief by embedding it within a cognitive framework oriented towards truth acquisition.

Thus, the basing relation in the case of non-doxastic justification can be seen as embodying both the causal-genetic aspect of belief formation (highlighted by FRS) and the normative-epistemic aspect (underscored by the principle of charity and the truth goal). This dual aspect facilitates a robust account of how sensory experiences confer justification on beliefs: experiences causally engender beliefs while simultaneously situating them within a normative framework that privileges truth, thereby satisfying the basing relation requirement.

In summary, the integration of FRS with insights into the normativity of epistemic justification offers a compelling model for understanding how experiences can justify beliefs. By elucidating the semantic, causal, and normative dimensions of the basing relation within this model, we gain a deeper appreciation of the complex interplay between sensory inputs, cognitive processing, and epistemic norms in the genesis and justification of perceptual beliefs. This framework not only addresses the traditional challenges associated with non-doxastic justification but also highlights the intricate mechanisms through which our cognitive system navigates the pursuit of knowledge.


Given the complex landscape around the basing relation, particularly the debate between causal and doxastic theories, it's clear that understanding how beliefs are justified by experiences involves navigating through intricate philosophical terrain. The causal theory, with its intuitive appeal and direct application to both action and belief justification, seems to provide a solid foundation for exploring the basing relation. However, the challenges, especially those related to deviant causal chains, present significant hurdles that any robust theory of justification needs to address.

The discussion on deviant causal chains underscores a fundamental issue with a simplistic causal account of the basing relation: not all causes that lead to a belief actually justify that belief. This problem highlights the necessity for a more nuanced understanding of how causes contribute to justification, beyond mere causation. It seems that what's required is a way to distinguish between causation that genuinely justifies and causation that merely leads to belief formation without contributing to its epistemic status.

The critique of Leite’s challenge to the distinction between being justified and showing that one is justified brings an important dimension to the debate. It suggests that justifying one's beliefs, especially in a social context, involves more than identifying the causal underpinnings of those beliefs. It involves engaging with reasons in a way that is communicable and understandable to others, which may or may not align with the precise causal history of those beliefs. This perspective introduces a layer of complexity to the basing relation by emphasizing the role of communicative and social practices in justification.

Your proposed Davidsonian gloss on causal theories could potentially offer a promising avenue for addressing the problem of deviant causal chains by incorporating a more sophisticated understanding of causation, one that accommodates the normative aspects of believing and acting for reasons. By focusing on how reasons function within a network of beliefs, desires, and intentions to cause actions and beliefs in a way that is normatively appropriate, such an approach could provide a more refined understanding of the basing relation that navigates around the problem of deviant causation.

In advancing this discussion, it would be interesting to explore how your Davidsonian approach could be elaborated to specify the criteria or mechanisms that differentiate justifying from non-justifying causes. This would involve delving into the normative framework that governs the acceptance of reasons as justifiers, possibly drawing on insights from Davidson's broader philosophical project on interpretation, rationality, and the structure of rational agency. Such an exploration could provide a more detailed account of how beliefs are not only caused by reasons but are justifiably based on them, thereby offering a comprehensive solution to the challenges facing the causal theory of the basing relation.


Exploring the basing relation through the lens of triangulation and content, as inspired by Davidson's ideas, offers a nuanced approach to understanding how beliefs are justified by reasons, particularly in the context of perceptual experiences. This method sidesteps traditional pitfalls associated with direct causal or doxastic theories, proposing instead a more holistic and interaction-based framework for determining the content and justification of beliefs. By emphasizing the role of a shared, objective environment in grounding the contents of belief through the process of triangulation, this approach naturally integrates the normative aspect of belief formation, linking it directly to the agent's engagement with the world and others within it.

The functional analysis of the basing relation suggested here, which hinges on the belief-reason transition being both causal and content-determining, aligns well with the intuitive understanding that reasons not only cause but also inform the content of beliefs. This analysis neatly addresses the challenges posed by deviant causal chains by highlighting the content-specific guidance that genuine reasons provide in the formation of beliefs, ensuring that the causal relationship between beliefs and their grounds is not merely accidental but meaningfully directed.

Furthermore, the proposal leverages Davidson's triangulation to provide a robust framework for identifying the content of beliefs without presupposing specific grounds, thereby avoiding circular reasoning. Triangulation, in this context, serves as a mechanism for locating the stimuli or reasons that give rise to beliefs by considering the shared responses of agents to their environment. This collective aspect of determining belief content not only underlines the social dimension inherent in understanding and justification but also underscores the importance of external, objective factors in shaping the contents of our beliefs.

By integrating Davidsonian triangulation with the principle of charity, this approach offers a compelling solution to the basing relation problem, grounding the justification of beliefs in a shared, normatively charged interaction with the world. This perspective not only enriches our understanding of how experiences can justify beliefs but also aligns with a broader philosophical vision where meaning, understanding, and justification are deeply intertwined with our communal and practical engagement with the world around us.

As we move forward to explore the implications of this approach for issues like the problem of easy knowledge and the structure of our knowledge of the external world, it's clear that this Davidson-inspired framework for the basing relation has the potential to offer fresh insights into some of the most enduring questions in epistemology, illuminating the complex interplay between our perceptual experiences, the content of our beliefs, and the justification those beliefs can have.


The intricate exploration of basic beliefs, easy knowledge, and the problem of warrant transfer unfolds a nuanced debate within contemporary epistemology, focusing on the legitimacy and consequences of acquiring knowledge through seemingly straightforward inferential routes. The crux of the problem centers on the concept of basic knowledge, which posits that certain beliefs can be justified or known directly through experience without prior validation of the reliability of those experiences as knowledge sources. This notion, while initially appealing for its directness and simplicity, gives rise to contentious scenarios where knowledge appears to be acquired too "easily," particularly through mechanisms like epistemic closure and bootstrapping.

The challenge with easy knowledge scenarios is not just their intuitive implausibility but their potential to undermine the rigor and robustness traditionally associated with epistemic justification. For instance, the closure principle, which allows for the extension of known propositions through logical deduction, seems to permit an undue expansion of knowledge in cases where the initial justification seems too tenuous to support such extrapolations confidently. Similarly, bootstrapping, which involves using a belief and its acknowledgment to infer the reliability of the belief-forming process, appears to shortcut the critical scrutiny expected in the validation of epistemic sources.

The problem becomes particularly pronounced in dialogues intended to illustrate the dissatisfaction with easy knowledge inferences, such as the hypothetical exchanges involving judgments about the color of a table or the reliability of one's perceptual faculties. These examples highlight the tension between the logical validity of certain inferences and the epistemic standards we intuitively hold for knowledge acquisition.

Various responses to the problem attempt to navigate between preserving the intuitive appeal of basic knowledge and addressing the unease with the seemingly facile generation of further knowledge claims. Proposals range from denying the legitimacy of easy knowledge inferences to suggesting nuanced distinctions within the concept of knowledge itself, such as separating more immediate, "animal" knowledge from a reflective, critical understanding that incorporates considerations of reliability and justification.

Crispin Wright's introduction of the notion of warrant transmission failure offers a sophisticated approach to delineating when and why certain inferences fail to extend justification, appealing to a structure of justification that requires more than just logical entailment for the transmission of warrant. This perspective, while offering valuable insights into the dynamics of justification and the conditions for knowledge, raises further questions about the nature and scope of entitlement and the criteria for legitimate inferential knowledge expansion.

In addressing these complex issues, the discourse illuminates broader themes in epistemology, including the relationship between experience and justification, the role of skepticism in assessing knowledge claims, and the balance between foundationalist and coherentist impulses in understanding the architecture of belief and knowledge. By dissecting the problem of easy knowledge and examining the various strategies proposed to resolve it, the discussion not only engages with specific epistemic puzzles but also contributes to a deeper appreciation of the underlying principles and challenges that shape human knowledge and its pursuit.


The critique of Wright's approach to the problem of easy knowledge through the lens of negative and positive epistemic dependence offers a nuanced understanding of how justifications are interconnected and where Wright's disjunctive template might falter. The distinction between negative and positive dependence is pivotal, suggesting that while a belief's justification may be vulnerable to being undermined by certain information (negative dependence), this does not entail that the belief's justification is fundamentally reliant on (positively dependent upon) that information.

The examination highlights an essential aspect of epistemological debates: that the undermining of a belief's justification by counter-evidence does not necessarily imply a foundational reliance on that counter-evidence for the belief's initial justification. This insight has broad implications, allowing foundationalists to maintain the primacy of certain justifications even in the face of potential defeaters and a priorists to uphold the a priori status of beliefs despite empirical vulnerabilities.

Wright's invocation of the underdetermination thesis (UJ) as a backbone for his argument against the legitimacy of certain inferential knowledge expansions, such as those seen in Moore's proof or the zebra case, underscores a deep-seated theory of justification. Wright's requirement that perceptual experiences must favor one hypothesis over another to provide warrant for a belief aligns with UJ, suggesting a need for independent warrant to rule out uncongenial alternatives. This stance, however, seems to unnecessarily demand more from our epistemic justifications than is typically required, leading to a skepticism about inferential knowledge expansion that may be too restrictive.

By highlighting these issues, the critique effectively challenges the basis of Wright's transmission failure thesis, arguing that the disjunctive template and its associated conditions might not accurately capture the nature of our epistemic practices. It suggests that the template's reliance on UJ and the notion of positive epistemic dependence might not be as epistemically significant as Wright contends, especially when considering the distinct roles of negative and positive dependencies in our epistemic framework.

In summary, the critique opens up a broader discussion about the criteria for legitimate inferential knowledge expansion and the nuanced dynamics of epistemic justification. It suggests that a deeper exploration of the distinctions between types of epistemic dependence and the conditions under which our beliefs are formed and justified is crucial for understanding the complexities of knowledge acquisition and the potential pitfalls of easy knowledge arguments.


The discussion of Wright's thesis of entitlement and Pryor's response to the problem of easy knowledge (EK) inferences delves into the complex terrain where epistemic justifications, pragmatic reasons, and the nature of belief itself intersect. Wright's introduction of "entitlement" attempts to navigate the skeptical challenge by positing a form of warrant that does not rely on evidential work from the believer's part. This entitlement allows for the acceptance of certain presuppositions necessary for our cognitive endeavors, effectively proposing a pragmatic solution to an epistemic problem. However, as highlighted, Wright's account raises questions about the epistemic status of entitlement and its distinction from belief, veering towards a pragmatic rather than an epistemically truth-conducive notion of justification.

The critique further explores Pryor's dogmatist stance, which contrasts with Wright's skepticism by affirming the legitimacy of certain EK-inferences while distinguishing between having justification for belief and being rationally compelled by one's pre-existing beliefs or doubts. Pryor's distinction between justification and rational commitment seeks to address the intuitions of impropriety surrounding EK-inferences without denying their warrant-transmitting nature. However, the critique points out potential inconsistencies in Pryor's application of his framework to different cases, such as the zebra example and its variants, suggesting a possible equivocation in his treatment of perceptual beliefs and their justification.

Moreover, Pryor's explanation for the disparity between our intuitions about EK-inferences and their epistemic legitimacy invokes concepts akin to those proposed by Sosa, such as aptness and internal coherence, drawing parallels between animal and reflective knowledge. This recontextualization underscores a fundamental tension in addressing EK-inferences: the challenge of reconciling the externalist and internalist dimensions of epistemic justification. Despite Pryor's attempt to differentiate his position from Cohen's skepticism, the critique suggests that both approaches may share underlying commitments to a dichotomy between animal and reflective knowledge, raising further questions about the adequacy of either framework to fully account for the intricacies of EK-inferences.

In summary, the exploration of Wright's entitlement and Pryor's response to EK-inferences illuminates the multifaceted nature of epistemic justification, challenging us to consider how we might effectively reconcile pragmatic pressures, epistemic norms, and the pursuit of truth within our conceptual frameworks. This examination calls for a nuanced understanding of the interplay between different forms of justification and the conditions under which our beliefs can be said to be epistemically warranted.


The discussion explores the nuanced terrain of Easy Knowledge (EK) inferences, focusing on different perspectives regarding their legitimacy and effectiveness across various contexts. Bergmann suggests that EK-inferences can be legitimate in certain contexts, distinguishing between "unquestioned source contexts," where such inferences are valid, and "questioned source contexts," where they are not, due to the presence of defeaters that undermine trust in the source. This approach, while addressing the context-dependency of EK-inferences, raises questions about the uniform applicability and the nature of defeaters in different epistemic situations.

Neta, on the other hand, introduces a contextualist stance, arguing that the legitimacy of EK-inferences and the truth value of knowledge claims are context-sensitive. This position implies that skepticism can emerge when skeptical hypotheses become salient, shifting the context and challenging the initial justification. Both Bergmann's and Neta's accounts confront the "problem of easy ignorance," highlighting a symmetry between acquiring and losing knowledge through the mere consideration of skeptical scenarios.

The critique then transitions to an analysis of strength of evidence and epistemic distance in evaluating varieties of transmission failure. It critiques Wright's conservative stance and Pryor's dogmatist approach, suggesting that both share underlying commitments despite their apparent differences. The critique proposes that the epistemic oddity associated with EK-inferences arises from the dynamics of argumentative contexts, where considering the conclusion as an open question necessitates a reevaluation of the justification context. This reevaluation leads to the conclusion that the evidence provided by type-I propositions may not be robust enough to justify type-III beliefs within a realistically adjusted context.

Drawing parallels with the ravens paradox, the critique further illustrates how background knowledge and context play critical roles in assessing the legitimacy of inferences and the confirmation of hypotheses. It suggests that ignoring relevant background information can lead to unrealistic assessments of evidence and confirmation, akin to the paradoxical scenarios presented by Hempel.

In sum, the exploration of EK-inferences and their context-dependency reveals the complexity of epistemic justification, challenging us to consider how background assumptions, the salience of skeptical hypotheses, and the dynamics of argumentative contexts influence our understanding of knowledge acquisition and transmission. The critique advocates for a nuanced approach that recognizes the variability of epistemic contexts and the importance of adjusting our evaluative criteria to reflect the intricacies of our epistemic practices.


The discourse meticulously navigates through the intricate landscape of Easy Knowledge (EK) inferences, especially focusing on bootstrapping arguments and their legitimacy within various epistemic contexts. It challenges the notion that EK-inferences can uniformly grant knowledge or justified beliefs across all scenarios, proposing instead that their validity is contingent upon the strength of evidence and the specific epistemic context in question.

By employing the concept of "epistemic momentum," the discussion vividly illustrates how evidence directed toward a target proposition must possess sufficient epistemic strength to traverse the relevant "epistemic space" for a belief to be considered justified. This notion elucidates why certain EK-inferences, such as those exemplified in the Zebra, Table, and BIV (Brain in a Vat) arguments, fail to transmit warrant to their conclusions—because the initial evidence does not have the requisite momentum to justify beliefs concerning more elaborate or skeptical scenarios.

In contrast, the analysis distinguishes arguments like Moore's and Election/Soccer from typical EK-inferences, suggesting that these do not suffer from a failure of warrant transmission but rather from a peculiarity in their construction. The crux of these arguments, as highlighted, lies in the conceptual and logical proximity between their premises and conclusions, rendering the process of arriving at the conclusion somewhat trivial or redundant.

Particularly compelling is the critique of bootstrapping inferences. The argument underscores the inherent unreliability of bootstrapping as a method for establishing the reliability of a belief-forming process. Through a thought experiment involving an agent unknowingly envatted, it's demonstrated that bootstrapping can lead to false conclusions about the reliability of perceptual faculties, thus revealing bootstrapping to be an illegitimate method for acquiring justified beliefs.

This nuanced examination advocates for a context-sensitive understanding of EK-inferences, emphasizing the importance of considering the strength of evidence and the proximity of premises to their conclusions. By dissecting the mechanics of epistemic justification and the limitations of certain inferential strategies, the discussion provides valuable insights into the conditions under which knowledge and justified beliefs can be legitimately inferred.

In essence, the exploration of EK-inferences, bootstrapping arguments, and the contextual factors influencing warrant transmission contributes significantly to the broader discourse on epistemic justification, offering a refined perspective on the dynamics of knowledge acquisition and the epistemic validity of inferential practices.


Hetherington proposes a nuanced understanding of fallibilism that aims to integrate knowledge of necessary truths into the framework of fallible knowledge. His approach diverges from traditional accounts by redefining fallibility in a way that accommodates both empirical knowledge and knowledge of necessary propositions. Hetherington's proposal acknowledges the complexity inherent in the notion of fallibility, especially when applied to knowledge that seems immune to error due to its necessary nature.

Central to Hetherington's thesis is the idea that fallibility pertains not to the truth of the propositions known but to the epistemic status of the knower. This perspective shifts the focus from the impossibility of being mistaken about a proposition's truth to the conditions under which a belief is formed and maintained. By doing so, Hetherington suggests that even beliefs about necessary truths can be considered fallible if the justification for holding these beliefs could have been inadequate, even though the propositions themselves cannot be false.

Hetherington's account attempts to resolve the tension between the apparent infallibility of knowledge of necessary truths and the broadly accepted fallibilist stance in epistemology. He argues that fallibility is an attribute of the knower's epistemic situation rather than the propositional content of knowledge. This approach allows for a more inclusive understanding of fallible knowledge, one that can accommodate the certainty of necessary truths while acknowledging the human capacity for error in the process of acquiring and justifying beliefs.

Despite its innovative approach, Hetherington's proposal faces challenges, particularly in articulating a clear mechanism by which fallibility applies to the justification of beliefs about necessary truths. Critics may question whether this reconceptualization of fallibility sufficiently captures the traditional concerns about error and mistake that motivate fallibilism. Furthermore, the proposal must navigate the complex interplay between the modal status of propositions (necessary vs. contingent) and the epistemic conditions under which they are known or believed.

In conclusion, Hetherington's proposal represents a significant contribution to the ongoing debate over fallibilism in epistemology. It challenges conventional understandings of fallibility and infallibility, urging a reexamination of how these concepts apply across different domains of knowledge. While questions remain regarding the specifics of his account, Hetherington's work underscores the importance of considering the epistemic context and conditions of belief formation in discussions of fallible knowledge.


The analysis provided by (Falk) aims to encapsulate the concept of fallible knowledge by incorporating the possibility of error directly into the definition of knowledge. This approach, while initially appealing due to its simplicity and intuitive grasp of fallibility, encounters significant conceptual difficulties when closely examined.

One major concern is the inconsistency within the framework of (Falk) regarding the application of possible truth-values to the components of knowledge. The distinction between the components of knowledge—such as truth (T), justification (J), and a condition to prevent accidental truth (G)—is crucial for understanding the structure of knowledge itself. However, when (Falk) attempts to characterize fallibility, it inadvertently shifts the focus away from a unified conception of knowledge to its individual constituents, particularly justification, without adequately addressing the holistic nature of knowledge.

This shift leads to a critical issue: the fallibility clause in (Falk) does not uniformly apply to knowledge as a whole but rather selectively to its parts. This selective application fails to capture the essence of fallible knowledge, as it isolates the possibility of error to a component of knowledge rather than integrating it into the overall epistemic condition. As a result, (Falk) struggles to coherently express how fallibility fundamentally pertains to knowledge itself, leading to a disjointed and ultimately unsatisfactory definition.

Furthermore, the analysis highlights a deeper problem with the very notion of fallible knowledge, especially when considering knowledge of necessary truths. The attempt to reconcile the infallibility associated with necessary truths and the inherent fallibility of empirical knowledge underscores a tension within epistemology that challenges our traditional understanding of knowledge and its fallibility.

In summary, while (Falk) endeavors to define fallible knowledge by directly incorporating the possibility of being wrong, it inadvertently reveals the complexities and challenges of adequately conceptualizing fallibility within the domain of knowledge. The difficulties encountered by (Falk), particularly its inconsistent application of possible truth-values, not only question the coherence of the fallible/infallible distinction but also invite a reevaluation of the underlying assumptions about knowledge and error in epistemology.


The discussion on the thesis of property transfer and its application to fallible knowledge reveals a deeper tension in reconciling fallibility with the traditional understanding of knowledge. The attempt to transfer the properties of the constituents of knowledge—such as being true, justified, and Gettierized—to the whole concept of knowledge stumbles upon the incoherence when considering the possibility of accidental truth. This incoherence highlights a crucial aspect of knowledge: its resistance to accidental truth, which stands in stark contrast to the very notion of fallibility as commonly understood.

By exploring the implications of justified beliefs being fallible and potentially accidentally true, we uncover that knowledge, inherently resistant to such accidental truth, cannot straightforwardly inherit the property of fallibility without leading to absurd consequences. This paradox underscores the intricate relationship between justification, truth, and knowledge, and the challenges in maintaining a coherent notion of fallible knowledge within this framework.

Furthermore, the exploration of Davidson's principle of charity and its evolution from truth-maximizing to knowledge-maximizing interpretations offers a compelling lens through which to view the tension between fallibility and knowledge. Davidson's shift towards a knowledge-maximizing principle, where beliefs are essentially and non-accidentally veridical, serves as an acknowledgment of the problematic nature of reconciling fallibility with the core characteristics of knowledge. This move implicitly supports the argument that the conceptual marriage of fallibility and knowledge is fraught with difficulties, further questioning the coherence of fallible knowledge as traditionally conceived.

In essence, the examination of fallible knowledge through the thesis of property transfer and Davidson's principle of charity illuminates the fundamental incompatibilities between the concept of knowledge—particularly its resistance to accidental truth—and the notion of fallibility. This incompatibility calls for a reevaluation of how we understand fallibility in relation to knowledge, suggesting that a more nuanced approach is needed to capture the complexities of our epistemic practices without succumbing to incoherence.


The proposal to understand the fallible/infallible divide in knowledge through the lens of externalist/internalist conceptions of justification offers a novel perspective on longstanding epistemological debates. This approach not only clarifies the nature of fallible knowledge by tying it intrinsically to externalist assumptions but also illuminates why certain types of knowledge—such as empirical beliefs about the external world—are paradigmatically considered fallible, aligning well with externalist positions in epistemology.

Conversely, the internalist conception of justification, with its emphasis on the accessibility of justificatory grounds, aligns neatly with types of knowledge considered infallible, particularly knowledge of our own phenomenal states. This alignment underscores a conceptual harmony between the nature of the knowledge in question and the underlying epistemic principles governing its justification.

Furthermore, this reconfiguration of the fallibility/infallibility distinction has intriguing implications beyond the immediate concerns of epistemology. For instance, it sheds light on the ongoing debate regarding the compatibility of justification internalism with content externalism, suggesting that the coherence of fallible knowledge with externalist assumptions might offer insights into how epistemic and semantic externalism can coexist. Conversely, the link between infallible knowledge and internalist justificatory principles might inform discussions on the potential tensions or harmonies between semantic internalism and epistemic internalism.

By reframing the fallibility/infallibility debate in terms of internalist and externalist conceptions of justification, this approach not only provides a coherent account of fallible knowledge but also opens up new avenues for exploring interconnections between seemingly disparate philosophical discussions. It underscores the importance of examining the foundational assumptions underlying our epistemic concepts and invites further investigation into how these assumptions interact with broader philosophical theories.


Brueckner argues that the standard strategy, which aims to reconcile externalism with the doctrine of privileged access by suggesting that the contents of second-order thoughts track the contents of first-order thoughts, ultimately fails to address the core concern of the slow switching argument. He contends that the strategy overlooks the essential epistemic requirement that, to genuinely know the contents of one's thoughts (whether first- or second-order), one must not only correctly identify these contents but also have a justification for one's belief that is immune to the kind of empirical contingencies highlighted in slow switching cases.

The crux of the slow switching argument lies in its demonstration that, under certain plausible scenarios facilitated by content externalism, an individual's justification for beliefs about their own thought contents may depend on empirical facts about their environment. This dependence suggests that such self-knowledge is not as immediate or authoritative as traditionally thought, challenging the notion of privileged access.

Brueckner's critique emphasizes that even if an individual's second-order thoughts align with the contents of their first-order thoughts (as externalism would predict), this alignment does not itself provide the requisite epistemic justification for the belief that one knows the contents of one's thoughts. The ability to track the environment's influence on thought contents, without a method of non-empirical justification for these beliefs, does not safeguard the privileged status of self-knowledge.

In essence, Brueckner's response to the standard strategy underscores a deeper problem with reconciling content externalism with privileged access: the challenge is not merely about ensuring the correctness of one's beliefs about thought contents but about securing a form of justification for these beliefs that is insulated from external, empirical variables. This insight points to the need for a more nuanced understanding of self-knowledge and its relation to the internalist-externalist debate in epistemology, suggesting that any satisfactory resolution must address the foundational epistemic concerns raised by slow switching scenarios.


Given this understanding of the thesis of privileged access (PA), the slow switching argument attempts to show that, under the assumption of content externalism, individuals like Oscar may have to rely on empirical investigation to ascertain the contents of their thoughts. This would imply a positive dependence of self-knowledge on empirical evidence, thereby contradicting (PA).

However, the argument does not conclusively demonstrate this positive dependence. The core of the issue is the assumption that because the contents of Oscar's thoughts are environmentally determined, Oscar must empirically investigate his environment to know these contents. This overlooks the fact that Oscar's capacity to form beliefs about his own thoughts does not necessarily require him to identify or discriminate between those thoughts based on their environmental origins. Rather, Oscar's second-order beliefs about what he is thinking are directly available to him, irrespective of the external factors that may determine the contents of those thoughts.

This direct availability suggests that the justification for Oscar's second-order beliefs does not derive from empirical investigation but from the intrinsic nature of thought itself. Oscar's belief that he is thinking about water (or twater, depending on his location) is justified independently of any empirical evidence about the presence of H2O or XYZ in his environment. This is because Oscar's second-order beliefs are about what he takes himself to be thinking, which remains constant across the switch.

Thus, the slow switching argument, interpreted as claiming positive empirical dependence, fails to undermine (PA). It conflates the environmental determination of thought contents with the epistemic basis for knowing those contents. While external factors may determine whether Oscar's thought is about water or twater, his knowledge of being in a water-thinking (or twater-thinking) state is immediate and does not require empirical validation.

Moving to the claim of negative dependence, if our second-order beliefs are only negatively dependent on empirical evidence, this does not threaten the doctrine of privileged access as traditionally conceived. Negative dependence would mean that while the justification for Oscar's second-order beliefs is not based on empirical investigation, it could be undermined by such evidence. However, the mere possibility that empirical evidence could challenge Oscar's self-knowledge does not imply that his self-knowledge is empirically grounded. Rather, it acknowledges the fallibility of self-knowledge without compromising its privileged status.

In conclusion, the slow switching argument, whether interpreted as making a claim about positive or negative empirical dependence, does not successfully challenge the compatibility of content externalism with the thesis of privileged access. The distinction between the determination of thought contents and the justification for beliefs about those contents is crucial. Recognizing this distinction allows us to preserve the intuition that we have direct, authoritative knowledge of our own thoughts, even in the face of externalism's implications for content individuation.


The situation with the thesis of privileged access to our thoughts under externalism is strikingly similar to Benacerraf's dilemma in the philosophy of mathematics. Just as Benacerraf's challenge is not merely a matter of finding the right theory of knowledge to bridge the gap between mathematical beliefs and abstract mathematical entities, the tension between externalism and privileged access is not just about choosing a theory of knowledge that aligns with our intuitions about self-knowledge. The real issue is deeper and relates to the fundamental structure of how thoughts are individuated and how we come to know their contents.

If external factors partially determine the content of our thoughts, then there appears to be a tension with the notion that we have direct, non-empirical access to the contents of those thoughts. This tension is not resolved simply by arguing that our second-order beliefs (beliefs about our thoughts) automatically have the same contents as our first-order beliefs (the thoughts themselves), thereby ensuring we cannot be mistaken about what we are thinking. The fundamental question remains: how can we have such non-empirical knowledge of our thoughts if their contents depend on factors external to us?

The switching scenarios highlight this tension by showing situations where, intuitively, it seems one would need to engage in some form of empirical investigation to know what one is thinking about—whether it's water or twater. Yet, this requirement for empirical investigation seems to conflict with the traditional view that we have immediate and authoritative knowledge of our own thoughts.

Thus, the challenge for proponents of externalism is similar to the Platonist's challenge in the face of Benacerraf's dilemma. It's not just about demonstrating that a subject in a switching scenario knows the contents of their thoughts within the framework of a particular theory of knowledge. It's about explaining how the subject can have such knowledge given the externalist individuation of thought contents and the traditional conception of privileged access. Just as the Platonist must explain the apparent reliability of mathematical beliefs about abstract entities, the externalist must explain how we can reliably know the contents of our thoughts when those contents depend on external, empirical factors.

In both cases, the challenge is to reconcile two seemingly plausible but apparently conflicting theses: in one case, the existence of mathematical knowledge and the non-spatiotemporal nature of mathematical entities; in the other, the externalist individuation of thought contents and the doctrine of privileged access. The tension is not simply a matter of finding the right theoretical fit but of providing a deeper understanding of how we can have the kind of knowledge we think we have, given the constraints imposed by the world and our position within it.


The core challenge for externalism, in relation to privileged self-knowledge, mirrors the Benacerraf dilemma in its depth and philosophical significance. It's not merely a question of which theory of knowledge or justification aligns with externalism without contradiction. The deeper, more substantive issue concerns the very possibility of reconciling the intuitive, traditional belief in privileged access to our own thoughts with the externalist claim that the contents of these thoughts are environmentally determined.

The "how-question" at the heart of this issue demands more than just theoretical adjustments or refinements; it calls for a foundational explanation. How can individuals have immediate, non-empirical knowledge of their own thoughts if the content of these thoughts depends on external, often empirically discoverable, factors? This question underscores a need for a robust account that explains the mechanism or process by which we achieve such knowledge, considering the externalist framework.

In drawing parallels to Benacerraf's dilemma, where the challenge is to reconcile our mathematical knowledge with the abstract nature of mathematical entities, the externalism versus privileged access debate similarly requires a reconciliation between our seemingly direct knowledge of our thoughts and the external determination of their content. Just as Platonists are pressed to explain the reliability of our mathematical beliefs given their abstract referents, externalists must elucidate how we can reliably know our thoughts' content, which supposedly hinges on our interaction with the external world.

Thus, resolving the tension between externalism and privileged self-knowledge isn't a matter of finding a theory of knowledge that makes them compatible on the surface. Instead, the resolution lies in addressing the fundamental question of how our knowledge of our thoughts maintains its privileged status given their environmental determination. This entails providing an account that elucidates the nature of thought content, the mechanism of thought formation, and the basis of self-knowledge within an externalist paradigm.

In essence, the debate calls for a deeper exploration into the nature of thoughts, knowledge, and the relationship between the mind and its environment. It challenges externalists to offer a comprehensive explanation that not only defends the coherence of their position but also enriches our understanding of the mind's capacity to know itself and the world.


We've discussed a range of topics related to the philosophy of knowledge, focusing on epistemic issues such as the nature and legitimacy of epistemically circular (EK) inferences, the context-dependence of EK-inferences, and the legitimacy of certain types of arguments within epistemology. Here's a breakdown:

The legitimacy of EK-inferences: We explored the debate around the legitimacy of EK-inferences, highlighting the distinctions between transmission failure and positive epistemic dependence, and the implications for knowledge acquisition.

Context-dependent legitimacy of EK-inferences: We delved into the views that consider EK-inferences as legitimate in some contexts but not in others, emphasizing the variability of epistemic relations based on context. This included discussions on the works of Bergmann and Neta, and their approaches to the contextuality of EK-inferences.

Strength of evidence and epistemic distance: We discussed how the strength of evidence and epistemic distance affect the transmission of warrant across entailments, using examples like the Zebra, Table, and BIV arguments to illustrate varieties of transmission failure.

Moore's argument and issues of transmission failure: We examined Moore's argument and the Election/Soccer examples to differentiate between cases of transmission failure and those that don't display the easy knowledge problem, suggesting that these arguments do not necessarily lead to transmission failure but rather highlight the triviality of certain inferences.

Bootstrapping inferences: We evaluated the legitimacy of bootstrapping inferences, focusing on the reliability of such methods and the implications for justified belief.

The fallibility/infallibility divide in knowledge: We analyzed the distinction between fallible and infallible knowledge, proposing that this divide is best understood in terms of internalist versus externalist conceptions of knowledge, and discussed the implications for understanding epistemic fallibility.

Externalism and privileged self-knowledge: We tackled the compatibility of externalism with the doctrine of privileged access to one's own thoughts, examining the slow switching argument and responses to it, and ultimately arguing that the core issue is independent of any specific theory of knowledge.

Throughout our discussion, we've aimed to clarify and critique various philosophical positions on these topics, providing a comprehensive overview of significant debates in contemporary epistemology.


Before diving into specific philosophical discussions on epistemically circular inferences and the nature of fallible versus infallible knowledge, our conversation covered a variety of intricate topics related to the philosophy of mind and epistemology:

The Nature and Absurdity of Moorean Sentences: We explored the peculiar structure of Moorean sentences, their implications for belief and assertion, and the philosophical attempts to untangle their paradoxical nature.

Shoemaker's Self-Blindness Proposal: The discussion included Shoemaker's insights into self-blindness, analyzing its implications for theories of self-knowledge and the coherence of Moorean sentences.

Sorensen's Catalogue of Moorean Sentences: We discussed Sorensen's extensive collection of Moorean sentences, emphasizing the variety and significance of these examples in philosophical debates.

The Doxastic and Epistemic Approaches to Moore's Paradox: We delved into the doxastic and epistemic strategies for resolving Moore's paradox, assessing their theoretical foundations and limitations.

The Interpretive Approach to Moore's Paradox: An interpretive strategy for understanding the absurdity of Moorean sentences was examined, considering its potential advantages over other approaches.

The Relationship Between Belief, Sensitivity, and Safety: Our conversation explored how the epistemological concepts of sensitivity and safety relate to belief and knowledge acquisition.

Non-doxastic Justification and the Epistemic Role of Experience: The issue of non-doxastic justification was addressed, focusing on philosophical attempts to explain how experiences can justify beliefs without themselves being doxastic.

Foundationalism and the Structure of Justified Belief: We discussed foundationalism's perspective on the architecture of knowledge, particularly the basic and non-basic belief distinction and the quest for a secure epistemic foundation.

Inferential and Non-inferential Paradigms in Epistemology: Different paradigms for understanding the normativity of transitioning from experience to belief were explored, including both inferential models and non-inferential models that liken this transition to exercising a skill.

Conceptual vs. Non-conceptual Content in Experience: The debate between conceptualists and non-conceptualists regarding the content of perceptual experiences was scrutinized, especially in relation to the issue of non-doxastic justification.

Throughout, we've engaged deeply with foundational questions in philosophy, dissecting complex arguments and theories to illuminate the nuances of belief, knowledge, and the structure of justification.


Certainly! While each of the topics we discussed may seem distinct on the surface, there are numerous connections between them that reveal a rich tapestry of ideas within the philosophy of mind and epistemology. Here are some connections between the topics we explored:

Moorean Sentences and Self-Knowledge: Moorean sentences, which present paradoxes regarding self-ascription of beliefs, intersect with theories of self-knowledge. Understanding how we come to know our own beliefs (self-knowledge) is essential for grappling with the absurdity of Moorean sentences.

Non-Doxastic Justification and Experience: The notion of non-doxastic justification, which deals with how experiences can justify beliefs without themselves being beliefs, directly ties into discussions about the epistemic role of experience. Understanding how experiences contribute to justification sheds light on the foundation of our knowledge.

Foundationalism and Moore's Paradox: Foundationalist theories of justification, which posit certain beliefs as foundational and self-justifying, are relevant to resolving Moore's paradox. Determining whether certain beliefs can serve as secure foundations helps address the challenges posed by Moorean sentences.

Inferential and Non-Inferential Paradigms and Belief Formation: The debate between inferential and non-inferential paradigms in epistemology informs our understanding of how beliefs are formed. Whether belief formation resembles logical inference or skill exercise impacts our interpretation of Moorean sentences and theories of justification.

Conceptual vs. Non-Conceptual Content and Epistemic Access: The distinction between conceptual and non-conceptual content in perceptual experiences has implications for how we access and justify beliefs. Exploring whether perceptual experiences contain concepts shapes our understanding of non-doxastic justification and the role of experience in belief formation.

Externalism and Self-Knowledge: Externalist theories of mind, which posit that mental states depend on external factors, challenge traditional views of self-knowledge. Understanding how externalism interacts with self-knowledge sheds light on the nature of privileged access to our own mental states.

Epistemic Dependence on Experience and Knowledge Acquisition: Examining the dependence of knowledge on experience, both positively and negatively, informs our understanding of how we acquire knowledge. Assessing whether knowledge is dependent on empirical evidence helps reconcile challenges posed by externalism and theories of self-knowledge.

By exploring these connections, we gain a deeper appreciation for the interdisciplinary nature of philosophy of mind and epistemology. Each topic enriches our understanding of the others, contributing to a holistic perspective on fundamental questions about belief, knowledge, and the mind.

Certainly! Here's a glossary of some difficult terms encountered in our discussions:

Moorean Sentences: Statements that appear paradoxical because they assert something that seems obviously true but is incompatible with other equally obvious truths.

Self-Knowledge: The capacity to have knowledge or awareness of one's own mental states, beliefs, thoughts, or feelings.

Non-Doxastic Justification: Justification for beliefs that does not itself involve holding beliefs, often associated with perceptual experiences or other non-belief mental states.

Foundationalism: The epistemological view that some beliefs can serve as foundational or self-justifying, providing a secure basis for other beliefs without requiring further justification.

Inferential Paradigm: A model of belief formation that treats the transition from experience to belief as analogous to logical inference, where beliefs are derived from other beliefs through reasoning.

Non-Inferential Paradigm: A model of belief formation that views the transition from experience to belief as more akin to skill exercise, where beliefs are directly formed from experiences without requiring explicit reasoning.

Conceptual Content: The content of mental states or experiences that involves the use of concepts, language, or thought structures, allowing for the representation of specific objects or properties.

Non-Conceptual Content: The content of mental states or experiences that does not involve the use of concepts or language, often associated with perceptual experiences that are pre-linguistic or pre-conceptual.

Externalism: The philosophical view that mental states, such as beliefs, are not solely determined by internal factors but can depend on external factors or the individual's environment.

Privileged Access: Special or direct access to one's own mental states or experiences, often assumed in discussions of self-knowledge or first-person perspective.

Epistemic Dependence: The relationship between knowledge or justification and other factors, such as experience or empirical evidence, which may positively or negatively influence the status of beliefs.

Counterfactuals: Hypothetical statements about what would be the case under different circumstances, often used in discussions of knowledge or justification.

Understanding these terms will facilitate engagement with philosophical discussions about belief, knowledge, and the mind.


Moore's paradox concerns the apparent absurdity involved in asserting certain first-person present-tense sentences, such as "It is raining, but I do not believe that it is raining." These sentences, known as Moorean sentences, seem paradoxical because they can be true, logically consistent, and not obviously contradictory. Ludwig Wittgenstein attributed the term "Moore's paradox" to George E. Moore, considering it Moore's most significant contribution to philosophy. The paradox is often compared to other logical paradoxes like the liar paradox and the knower paradox.

Despite its prominence in philosophical discussions, there is currently no universally accepted explanation for Moore's paradox. However, it remains a philosophical curiosity and is used in various fields such as logic, computer science, and artificial intelligence to illustrate cases where knowledge or belief systems are not updated in response to new data.

Jaakko Hintikka's treatment of the problem is considered seminal, and Moore's paradox is typically presented by explaining why it is absurd to assert sentences of the form "P and NOT(I believe that P)" or "P and I believe that NOT-P." Moore presented the problem in two distinct ways, highlighting the apparent absurdity of asserting certain present-tense first-person sentences while acknowledging the lack of absurdity in their past-tense or second/third-person counterparts.

Some philosophers argue that Moore's paradox extends beyond assertion to the level of belief, suggesting that believing Moorean sentences implies a form of self-deception. Additionally, there is discussion about the apparent absurdity in asserting first-person future-tense sentences, although this may be less problematic when the exact timing of the belief is unspecified.


Proposed explanations for Moore's paradox have been advanced by various philosophers, including Jaakko Hintikka, Roy Sorensen, David Rosenthal, and Sydney Shoemaker. These explanations aim to address certain constraints, including the absurdity of both the omissive and commissive versions of Moore's sentences, the absurdity in both asserting and believing these sentences, and the intuition that contradiction underlies the absurdity.

One approach at the level of assertion suggests that assertion implies or expresses belief, so asserting certain Moorean sentences leads to self-contradiction. This explanation draws on speech act theory and the idea that asserting "p" and "I do not believe that p" simultaneously implies "I believe that p and I do not believe that p." Another perspective posits that assertions of belief often function as alternative ways of asserting the proposition itself, thereby reducing assertions like "p and I believe that not-p" to straightforward contradictions.

At the level of belief, explanations either appeal to contradiction, rational belief maintenance principles, or the notion of self-knowledge and first-person authority over mental states. Richard Moran offers an alternative view, suggesting that Moore's paradox reflects the loss of self-knowledge. According to Moran, asserting or believing Moorean sentences violates what he terms the Transparency Condition, which requires that one considers only the object itself when determining their beliefs about it. Moran's perspective emphasizes our status as agents capable of knowing and changing our minds, rather than focusing solely on contradictory-like phenomena.


Raymond Smullyan delineates various types of reasoners to illustrate the properties of sets of beliefs:

Accurate Reasoner: A reasoner who never believes any false proposition. They adhere to the principle that if they believe something, it must be true.

Inaccurate Reasoner: A reasoner who believes at least one false proposition. They do not adhere to the principle of only believing true propositions.

Consistent Reasoner: A reasoner who never simultaneously believes a proposition and its negation. They maintain consistency in their beliefs, avoiding contradictions.

Normal Reasoner: A reasoner who, while believing a proposition, also believes they believe that proposition. They possess self-awareness regarding their beliefs.

Peculiar Reasoner: A reasoner who believes a proposition while also believing they do not believe it. This type of reasoner is necessarily inaccurate but not necessarily inconsistent.

Regular Reasoner: A reasoner who, while believing 
�
→
�
p→q, also believes 
�
�
→
�
�
Bp→Bq. They maintain the belief that if they believe a proposition, they also believe the consequences of that proposition.

Reflexive Reasoner: A reasoner for whom every proposition 
�
p has some proposition 
�
q such that the reasoner believes 
�
≡
(
�
�
→
�
)
q≡(Bq→p). They reflect on their own beliefs and the implications of those beliefs.

Conceited Reasoner: A reasoner who believes their beliefs are never inaccurate. They have confidence in the accuracy of their beliefs.

Unstable Reasoner: A reasoner who believes they believe a proposition but, in fact, do not believe it. This type of reasoner experiences inconsistency in their beliefs.

Stable Reasoner: A reasoner who is not unstable, meaning that if they believe 
�
�
Bp, then they believe 
�
p. They maintain stability in their beliefs.

Modest Reasoner: A reasoner who only believes 
�
�
→
�
Bp→p if they already believe 
�
p. They exercise caution in believing propositions based on their beliefs.

Queer Reasoner: A reasoner who believes they are inconsistent, but this belief is erroneous.

Timid Reasoner: A reasoner who refrains from believing 
�
p if they believe that belief in 
�
p leads to a contradictory belief. They are cautious in adopting beliefs that may lead to contradictions.


Raymond Smullyan outlines increasing levels of rationality in reasoners:

Type 1 Reasoner: This reasoner possesses complete knowledge of propositional logic and believes every tautology/theorem. Their set of beliefs is logically closed under modus ponens, meaning if they believe 
�
p and 
�
→
�
p→q, then they will eventually believe 
�
q.

Type 1* Reasoner: Similar to Type 1, but with a shade more self-awareness. They believe all tautologies and possess the same logical closure under modus ponens, while also acknowledging the consequences of their beliefs.

Type 2 Reasoner: A Type 2 reasoner is a Type 1 reasoner who additionally believes that if they ever believe both 
�
p and 
�
→
�
p→q, then they will believe 
�
q. They are aware that their beliefs are closed under modus ponens.

Type 3 Reasoner: A Type 3 reasoner is a normal reasoner of Type 2. They maintain consistency in their beliefs and believe that if they believe 
�
p, then they also believe that they believe 
�
p.

Type 4 Reasoner: A Type 4 reasoner is a Type 3 reasoner who also believes they are normal. They maintain consistency in their beliefs and have self-awareness regarding their belief states.

Type G Reasoner: A Type G reasoner is a Type 4 reasoner who believes they are modest. They exercise caution in adopting beliefs and adhere to the principle that if they believe 
�
→
�
p→q implies 
�
p, then they must also believe 
�
p.


The concept of self-fulfilling beliefs, particularly within reflexive systems of reasoning, is significant in understanding the dynamics of belief systems and their implications.

Reflexivity in this context means that for any proposition 
�
p, there exists another proposition 
�
q such that 
�
≡
�
�
→
�
q≡Bq→p is provable in the system. Löb's theorem states that in a reflexive system of type 4, if 
�
�
→
�
Bp→p is provable, then 
�
p itself is provable.

However, an intriguing consequence arises when a consistent reflexive reasoner of type 4 believes they are stable. In this case, they would become unstable or inconsistent. Why does this happen?

Suppose a stable reflexive reasoner of type 4 believes they are stable. They will (sooner or later) believe every proposition 
�
p, leading to inconsistency. Here's the reasoning: The reasoner believes 
�
�
�
→
�
�
BBp→Bp, and by Löb's theorem, they will believe 
�
�
Bp. Being stable, they will then believe 
�
p.

This process shows that if a stable reflexive reasoner believes in their stability, they inevitably acquire beliefs that lead to inconsistency. This underscores the delicate interplay between beliefs about stability and the actual maintenance of consistency within reflexive reasoning systems.


The discussion on self-fulfilling beliefs and reflexive reasoning connects with several previous topics we've explored:

Moore's Paradox and Self-Knowledge: In exploring Moore's paradox, we touched upon the tension between what one believes and what one asserts. Reflexivity in belief systems adds another layer to this tension, as individuals may hold beliefs about their own beliefs, leading to potential paradoxes similar to those in Moore's paradox.

Types of Reasoners and Levels of Rationality: The concept of reflexive reasoners and their beliefs about stability aligns with the classification of reasoners into different types based on their rationality levels. For instance, a stable reflexive reasoner of type 4 corresponds to a highly rational agent, yet their belief in stability can lead to inconsistency, highlighting the complexities of rationality.

Foundationalism and Epistemic Justification: Reflexive reasoning and self-fulfilling beliefs touch upon foundational issues in epistemology. They raise questions about the justification of beliefs and the reliability of reasoning systems, which are central concerns in discussions about epistemic justification.

Non-Doxastic Justification and Belief Formation: The discussion on self-fulfilling beliefs adds depth to the exploration of belief formation processes. It suggests that beliefs about one's beliefs can play a significant role in shaping one's overall belief system, highlighting the intricate nature of belief formation beyond purely doxastic considerations.

In summary, the concept of self-fulfilling beliefs and reflexive reasoning intersects with various themes we've explored, including self-knowledge, rationality, epistemic justification, and belief formation, enriching our understanding of these topics within the broader context of philosophy.


The concept of truth as both a doxastic and epistemic goal lies at the intersection of belief formation and the pursuit of knowledge. Here's how it connects with our previous discussions:

Doxastic Goals: In the context of belief formation, individuals often aim for their beliefs to align with what they perceive as true. This aligns with the idea of truth as a doxastic goal, where individuals seek to hold beliefs that correspond to reality. We've discussed various types of reasoners and levels of rationality, all of which involve the pursuit of coherent and truth-conducive belief systems.

Epistemic Goals: On the other hand, in the pursuit of knowledge, truth is the ultimate epistemic goal. Epistemology deals with questions about the nature and scope of knowledge, including how it is acquired, justified, and evaluated. Truth serves as the standard against which knowledge claims are assessed. Our discussions on foundationalism, epistemic justification, and non-doxastic justification all relate to the epistemic goals of truth-seeking.

Belief Formation and Truth: The process of belief formation involves a constant striving towards truth, whether consciously or subconsciously. Individuals engage in various cognitive processes, such as perception, reasoning, and inference, to form beliefs that they consider true or likely to be true. The classification of reasoners and the exploration of self-fulfilling beliefs highlight the complexities involved in this endeavor.

Truth and Rationality: Rationality, as discussed in our exploration of reasoner types and levels of rationality, often entails a commitment to truth-seeking. Rational agents are those who strive to form beliefs and make decisions in accordance with the available evidence and logical principles, with the aim of approximating truth to the best of their abilities.

In summary, the concept of truth as both a doxastic and epistemic goal underscores the central role it plays in belief formation, knowledge acquisition, and rational inquiry. It serves as a guiding principle for both individual belief formation and broader epistemic endeavors, shaping our understanding of the world and guiding our intellectual pursuits.
