The article discusses how 
living systems manage 
limited resources and 
environmental complexity 
through a control system 
based on active inference. 
The authors introduce the 
Free-Energy Principle 
(FEP) and active inference
as ways to minimize 
prediction error. They 
examine both classical and 

quantum formulations of 
FEP. The article also sets 
the stage for Part II, which
will explore how control 
systems in active inference
can be represented as 
tensor networks within the
framework of quantum 
topological neural 
networks. This work aims to
have implications for 
modeling biological systems 
at various scales.

The introduction of the 
article posits that living 
systems exhibit complex 
multi-level control 
systems while also being 
made up of simpler physical
components. The challenge 
is to unify these 
perspectives. The article 

employs the Free Energy 
Principle (FEP) as a general
framework to describe 
interactions between these
systems and their 
environment. According to 
FEP, any system interacting
with its environment 
minimizes its "variational 
free energy," essentially 
aiming for an optimal state. 
This behavior is termed 
active inference: the 

system observes its 
environment, updates its 
Bayesian beliefs, and takes
actions accordingly.

The principle is general 
enough to apply not only to
cognitive systems like 
humans or robots but also 
to simpler organisms like 
bacteria. Such systems 
maintain "situational 
awareness," where they 

adapt to environmental 
conditions while managing 
informational and metabolic
costs. The article also 
discusses the role of 
memory in constraining 
behavioral complexity, 
mentioning that living 
systems employ "stigmergic 
memories," contributing to 
what is termed as 
"extended minds."

The central goal is to 
understand how these 
systems maintain complexity
and adaptability within the 
constraints of their 
physical makeup and 
environmental conditions.

This section delves into 
the complexities of control

systems in active inference
frameworks, focusing on 
how such systems select 
specific courses of action, 
or policies, based on their 
Generative Models (GMs). 
The GMs encode posterior 
probabilities, essentially 
the system's Bayesian 
beliefs, about what it 
perceives and how it should
act. The concept is 
extended to planning and 

control as forms of 
inference.

The text discusses various 
examples across biological 
scales, from gene 
regulation in E. coli 
bacteria to decision-making 
processes in the human 
brain. Mutual inhibition is a 
recurring theme, wherein 
different pathways or 
systems inhibit each other, 

requiring energy to 
overcome this inhibition for
a switch in action to occur. 
Such mutual inhibition plays
a role in tasks as diverse 
as bacterial foraging and 
human visual processing.

From a technical 
standpoint, the control 
systems are formalized 
under the Free Energy 
Principle (FEP) through 

factor graphs. These 
graphs are mathematical 
structures that allow for 
efficient computation in 
terms of message-passing 
and enable the conversion 
of control into an 
inference problem. Factor 
graphs are particularly 
useful in simulations 
involving discrete state 
spaces.

The factor graph's 
structure is crucial as it 
embodies the GM and how 
the system interprets 
data. Under classical FEP, 
these factors correspond 
to state-space 
factorizations used in 
mean-field approximations, 
familiar in both physics and 
statistics for variational 
Bayesian inference.

In summary, this part 
outlines a unified 
framework for 
understanding control 
systems in living organisms, 
spanning multiple scales 
and complexities, through 
the lens of active 
inference and the Free 
Energy Principle.

This section indicates that 
the paper aims to explore 
control flow in active 
inference systems from 
both classical and quantum 
perspectives. It presents a 
unifying mathematical 
framework through the 
use of tensor networks 
(TNs), which formalize the 
relationships between 

different components of a 
control system.

In the first part, the 
paper explores control 
flow using three 
different frameworks: 
classical Free Energy 
Principle (FEP), quantum 
reference frames (QRFs), 
and topological quantum 
field theories (TQFTs). 
These approaches help 

elucidate the idea of 
contextuality, or the fact 
that global, maximally 
connected probability 
distributions do not exist 
across all observations. 
The paper argues that 
active inference systems 
will generally exhibit such 
contextual effects.

In the second part, the 
paper focuses on a 

generalized tensor 
representation of control 
flow. The architecture of 
the tensor network is 
conditional upon identifying
distinct features or 
objects in the environment.
This part also explores the
connections between tensor
networks and artificial 
neural network (ANN) 
architectures, extending 
this idea to topological 

quantum neural networks. 
The authors discuss the 
implications of these 
mathematical models for 
biology, specifically 
regarding the system's 
capabilities to perceive 
spatial locality and 
mereology (part-whole 
relationships).

In sum, the paper promises 
to offer a holistic 

understanding of control 
systems across different 
scales and types of 
inference, incorporating 
both classical and quantum 
theory. It seeks to bring 
the physical and life 
sciences closer through a 
unifying framework based 
on the Free Energy 
Principle.

In this section titled "II. 
FORMAL DESCRIPTION OF 
THE CONTROL PROBLEM," 
the paper dives into a 
formalism of control flow 
in the context of active 
inference systems. 
Specifically, it explores 
this using the Free Energy
Principle (FEP).

The system under 
consideration, denoted by 
U, is a random dynamical 
system that can be broken 
down into internal states 
b(t) that serve as a Markov
blanket (MB) separating 
the internal from the 
external states.

According to the Free 
Energy Principle, any 
system interacting weakly 

enough with its 
environment can be 
considered to be enclosed 
by a Markov blanket. Such 
systems tend to minimize a 
variational free energy 
F(π), which serves as an 
upper bound on Bayesian 
surprisal.

The paper presents an 
equation for this 
Variational Free Energy 

(VFE), written as F(π). 
This equation breaks down 
VFE into different 
components, involving terms
for complexity, accuracy, 
and divergence. The 
Kullback-Leibler (KL) 
divergence measures the 
difference between the 
true external state 
distribution and a 
variational approximation of
this distribution, which is 

influenced by the internal
states 

μ.

In essence, minimizing the 
VFE corresponds to 
minimizing the prediction 
error under a generative 
model (GM) encoded by a 
nonequilibrium steady-
state (NESS) density. This 
concept fits within the 

framework of active 
inference, a Bayesian 
approach to perception and 
action. The term "active" 
refers to those states 
within the Markov blanket 
that are not influenced by
the environment or 
internal states, 
essentially encapsulating 
the system's exploratory 
actions in the environment.

In summary, the section 
provides a mathematical 
framework for 
understanding how control 
flow operates within an 
active inference system, 
grounding these concepts in
the Free Energy Principle.

The section takes the 
formal mathematical 
principles from earlier and
applies them to the 
biological context of a cell.
In this model, the cell 
membrane serves as the 
Markov blanket (MB), the 
internal states ( μ) 
correspond to the 
biochemical states of the 
cell, and the external 

states ( η) relate to the 
cell's environment.

Homeostasis & Allostasis: 
The nonequilibrium steady-
state (NESS) corresponds to
the state(s) where the 
cell maintains its 
functional integrity. This 
self-maintenance is 
referred to as "self-
evidencing," as systems 
that comply with the Free 

Energy Principle (FEP) 
continually generate 
evidence of their 
existence.

Uncertain Causation: Cells 
are described as "strange 
particles," as they can 
monitor their environment 
but not directly their 
actions on it. This brings in 
the element of uncertain 
causation; the cell cannot 

definitively know if a 
change in its environment is
a result of its own action.

Thermodynamics & Cost: 
The FEP also connects to 
classical thermodynamics. 
Self-evidencing or belief-
updating incurs a 
thermodynamic cost, and 
the cell's actions are aimed
at acquiring the 
thermodynamic free energy

needed for its metabolic 
functions.

Complex Decision-Making: 
The cell’s generative 
model (GM) aims to minimize 
increases in Variational 
Free Energy (VFE) while 
maximizing its decrease, 
often involving a trade-
off between short-term 
costs and long-term gains. 
This necessitates higher-

order, meta-level controls
that are often 
hierarchical.

Risk & Ambiguity: The 
paper talks about “risk” as
expected complexity, which 
involves belief updating at 
a thermodynamic cost. 
“Ambiguity” relates to 
expected inaccuracy and 
leads to exploratory 

behaviors, like a cell's 
phototropism.

Context-Dependent 
Control & Energetic 
Barriers: The NESS is not a 
single state but a complex 
landscape with local minima 
separated by energetic 
barriers. These barriers 
could be, for instance, the
energy required to switch 
cellular pathways.

Hierarchical Control: These
complexities are often 
managed through 
hierarchical, meta-level 
controls. They use 
probabilistic models to 
regulate not just energy-
seeking but also 
information-seeking actions
(like curiosity-driven 
exploration).

Biological Examples: 
Finally, the section ends 
with specific biological 
examples, mentioning 
modifications in planaria 
that show how high 
energetic barriers can lead
to permanent changes.

In summary, the section 
deepens our understanding 
of cellular control by 
linking it to the FEP and 

exploring the nuanced, 
hierarchical, and often 
uncertain nature of 
cellular decision-making 
and action.

The "QRF picture" section 
explores the possible role 
of quantum effects in 
cellular information 

processing. Traditionally, 
this processing is 
considered to be classical, 
relying on causal networks 
of macromolecules. 
However, this perspective 
poses challenges:

Energy Budgets: The 
energy budgets for both 
prokaryotic and eukaryotic 
cells are much smaller 
than what would be 

required for fully 
classical information 
processing at the molecular
scale. This discrepancy 
suggests that quantum 
coherence might be 
employed as a computational
resource in cells.

Quantum Nature of 
Macromolecules: While the 
quantum characteristics of 
proteins and other 

macromolecules are 
acknowledged, the 
relevance of these 
quantum effects at a 
biological scale remains a 
subject of debate.

Decoherence Times: 
Classical models predict 
decoherence times on the 
order of attoseconds, 
which is several orders of 
magnitude less than the 

timescales relevant for 
cellular processes. This 
mismatch raises questions 
about whether a purely 
classical model is 
sufficient.

Evidence of Quantum 
Coherence: Functional 
roles for quantum 
coherence within individual
molecules (intramolecular) 
have been found, but 

intermolecular coherence 
remains elusive. However, 
indirect evidence of long-
range, tissue-scale 
coherence, especially in 
brains, has been reported.

Reformulation of FEP: By 
reframing the Free Energy
Principle in terms of 
quantum information 
theory, the authors 
suggest that scenarios 

involving long-range 
quantum coherence could 
be adequately described, 
thus enriching our 
understanding of cellular 
processes.

In essence, the section 
brings up compelling reasons
for considering quantum 
effects in the cellular 
context, particularly in 
light of energy constraints 

and evidence of long-range
coherence. It proposes that
a quantum reformulation 
of the Free Energy 
Principle may offer a more 
comprehensive description 
of cellular information 
processing.

This section presents a 
theoretical framework to 
study an isolated system 

U partitioned into 
subsystems A and B. The 
interaction Hamiltonian is 
considered weak enough to 
treat A and B as 
essentially separable. 
Various consequences of 
this construction are 
outlined:

Holographic Screen B: A and
B are separated by a 
"holographic screen" B, 
represented by an array of
N non-interacting qubits. 
This screen mediates 
interactions between A and 
B.  Information Exchange: A
and B can exchange finite 
N-bit strings encoding 
eigenvalues of H AB.

Free Choice of Basis: Both 
A and B can choose their 
own basis for H AB , which 
means they have the 
freedom to choose local 
frames of reference.

Thermodynamic and 
Informational Equilibrium: 

A and B are generally in 
informational, but not 
thermal equilibrium.

Free Energy Sector: Both 
A and B allocate some 
qubits for free-energy 
acquisition to fund classical
computation, adhering to 
Landauer's principle.

QRFs (Quantum Reference 
Frames): The actions of 
internal dynamics can be 
represented by sets of 

QRFs, which both measure 
and prepare qubits on B.

Computational QRFs and 
CCCDs: The structure of 
these computational QRFs 
can be mapped using cone-
cocone diagrams (CCCDs), 
which is useful for 
describing hierarchical 
Bayesian networks.

Memory-Write Systems: The
architecture depicted is 
similar to a variational 
autoencoder (VAE) and can 
be used for belief-
updating systems.

Contextuality: The 
framework allows for 
intrinsic or quantum 
contextuality, a 
phenomenon where quantum
systems cannot be described

by classical systems with 
hidden variables.

Holographic Coding: In the 
quantum description, 

B could be represented as 
a polygonal tessellation of 
the hyperbolic disk. In the 
classical limit, it serves as 
an information channel 
with a structure 

resembling a direct acyclic 
graph (DAG).

The construction aims to be
broadly applicable, serving 
as a generic blueprint for 
studying both classical and 
quantum systems in a 
unified manner. It suggests 
potential uses in areas like
quantum computation, 
information theory, and 
thermodynamics.

The discussion here dives 
into the role of Quantum 
Reference Frames (QRFs) 
in observing and interacting
with sectors on a 
holographic screen 

B. Each system X can be 
broken down into two 
components:

Reference Component 

R: It has a stable, time-
invariant state∣R⟩or a 
state density R. This 
allows for the system to 
be re-identified over time.

Pointer Component 

P: It has a time-varying 
state∣P or state density. 
This is the "state of 
interest" for 
measurements.

Both components R and P 
must be mutually 
decoherent and must 
commute with each other.

Additional points covered:

Memory and Environment: 
Memory operations can also 
be mapped to QRFs. Memory
stored by 

A is exposed to B, and vice 
versa. The observable 
environment E and memory 
sector 

Y must be disjoint from and 
decoherent with the 
free-energy sector F.

Energy Costs: Actions on B, 
such as memory writes, 
have an associated free 
energy cost. This cost is at 
least 
ln   2 ln2KBT per bit, 
adhering to Landauer’s 
principle.

Time-Energy 
Complementarity: A minimum
time, based on Planck’s 
constant 
ℎ
h, is associated with this 
energy cost. This defines 
"ticks" of internal time 
QRFs, denoted as B.

Time Arrows: Interestingly,
point in opposite directions 
with respect to B, allowing 

A and B to be seen as 
"interacting with their own
futures."

This framework attempts 
to bring together elements
of classical and quantum 
physics, thermodynamics, 
and information theory into
a unified picture, further 
blurring the line between 
observer and observed. It 
adds layers of complexity 

to our understanding of 
how systems interact with 
their environment and each
other.

The text delves into the 
conditions and 
representations for 
sequential measurements in

a quantum framework. 
Here's a breakdown:

Conditions for Sequential 
Measurements: For 
measurements on a system 

X to be considered 
sequential, two criteria 
must be met:

The measurements must be 
separated according to an 

internal time Quantum 
Reference Frame (QRF).

The outcomes of these 
measurements must be 
recorded to memory, 
enabling a comparison over 
time.

Schemata for Sequential 
Measurements: Sequential 
measurements can be 

represented by one of two 
schematic diagrams:
Schema One: This 
represents a situation 
where a system 

S divides into two possibly 
entangled systems 

An example of this is the 
parametric down-conversion
of a photon.

Schema Two: In this case, 
the pointer-state QRF 

P is replaced with an 
alternative QRF 

Q that doesn't commute 
with P.

S→P,R→S→Q,R→S
Examples include 
sequences where position 
and momentum or different

spin components are 
measured alternately.
Commutativity 
Requirements: Both P and 
Q must commute with R to 
satisfy the commutativity 
requirements for the 
system S.

Further Questions: These 
schemata raise questions 
about how control 
sequences are implemented 

and how contextual changes
affecting the control flow
are detected. This sets 
the stage for Part II, 
where issues like path-
integral representation of 
QRFs, the behavior of 
system 

X identified by a QRF, and 
questions of multiple 
observers and quantum 

contextuality are 
discussed.

The discussion is quite 
technical but aims to 
establish a rigorous 
framework for thinking 
about how quantum systems 
are measured and 
controlled, including how 
time and memory factor 
into these processes.

The text introduces a 
Topological Quantum Field 
Theory (TQFT) perspective
on the Free Energy 
Principle (FEP) and 
sequential measurements in
quantum systems. Here are
the key points:

Path-Integral Formulation:
The classical FEP can be 
formulated as a path 
integral, which calculates 
the expected value of any 
observable Ω Ω[x(t)] 
based on paths x(t) 
through state space. In 
quantum theory, this 
formulation extends to 
include automorphisms on a 
Hilbert space.

TQFT on Hilbert Space: The
manifold of all 
automorphisms in a finite-
dimensional Hilbert space 

H can be treated as a 
cobordism, which by 
definition is a TQFT on H.

Sequential Measurements 
and TQFT: Sequential 
measurements on any 
sector X of 

B can induce a TQFT. The 
paper notes that 
measurement sequences can
be mapped to cobordisms 
(manifolds between 
boundaries). Diagram (9) 
and Diagram (10) offer 
examples, corresponding to 
two types of sequential 
measurement schemata 
discussed earlier.

Functor F: This functor 
maps from the category of 
CCCDs (which includes 
QRFs) to the category of 
finite cobordisms, defining 
a TQFT.

Theorem 1: For any 
morphism F of CCCDs, there
is a corresponding cobordism 
S that satisfies certain 
commutative properties. 
This theorem is general 

and applies to any 
sequential measurement.

Composite Operations: It 
discusses operations that 
can measure and record an 
outcome, mapping from 
 , and operations that use 
an outcome read from 
memory to prepare a state, 
mapping from 

The text expands on the 
framework laid out in the 
previous parts, focusing on 
the implications of 
Topological Quantum Field 
Theories (TQFTs) and 
Quantum Reference 
Frames (QRFs) for 
understanding control flow
and information exchange in
complex systems.

Recording and Time 
Propagation: The operation 
of recording observational 
outcomes and then 
comparing them at a later 
time t+Δt is 
mathematically equivalent 
to propagating the "system"
X forward in time. This 
allows for a unified way to 
discuss temporal evolution.

Communication Between 
Multiple QRFs: 
Communication between 
different QRFs, deployed 
by a system 

A for instance, requires a 
channel that traverses 

B. Both classical and 
quantum channels are 
considered physically 

equivalent and 
represented as TQFTs.

Local Operations, Classical 
Communication (LOCC): In 
LOCC protocols, one channel
is termed "classical" and 
the other "quantum", but 
the text argues that this 
distinction is semantic; both
are physical channels.

Non-Commutativity and 
Contextuality: When two 
QRFs are deployed by 
separate or decoherent 
systems, they fail to 
commute. This introduces a 
context-dependent 
element into the 
measurements, influenced 
by hidden variables that 
characterize the larger 
system B.

Limitations of Classical 
Context: The text notes 
that a truly exhaustive 
classical measurement of 
context would require 
access to all of 

B, which is practically 
impossible due to energy 
costs and other limitations.

Control Flow and Free-
Energy Trade-Offs: 

Implementing control flows 
has an associated free-
energy cost. Systems must 
balance the computational 
or energetic costs of 
control flow against the 
benefits, leading to 
context-dependent 
effects on both perception
and action.

Upcoming in Part II: The 
next part promises to 

discuss Tensor Networks 
(TNs) and Topological 
Quantum Neural Networks 
(TQNNs) as formal tools to 
represent control flows, 
especially in biological 
systems.

The work aims to provide a 
rigorous, unifying 
framework for 
understanding control 
flows in complex systems, 

from quantum to biological 
scales, using advanced 
mathematical constructs 
like TQFTs and QRFs.

The article delves into the
complex subject of control 
flow in active inference 
systems by employing 
advanced mathematical and 

quantum mechanical 
concepts like Topological 
Quantum Field Theories 
(TQFTs) and Quantum 
Reference Frames (QRFs).
It proposes that sequential 
measurements in complex 
systems can be rigorously 
described using these 
theories.

Key insights include:

Sequential Measurements: 
Observational outcomes 
recorded over time can be 
represented as propagating 
the system forward in 
time, essentially unifying 
the concept of recording 
and time evolution.

Communication Framework: 
It introduces a general way 
to analyze information 
exchange between multiple

QRFs within a system, 
treating both classical and 
quantum communication 
channels as physically 
equivalent.

Contextuality and 
Limitations: The article 
discusses how non-
commutative interactions 
between different parts 
of a system introduce 
context-dependency in 

measurements. It also 
emphasizes the practical 
limitations of capturing this
context due to energetic 
and computational 
constraints.

Control Flow and Cost: It 
acknowledges the free-
energy costs of 
implementing control flows 
in systems, balancing the 
computational or energetic 

costs against the benefits, 
which introduces context-
dependent effects on both
perception and action.

The article concludes by 
setting the stage for Part 
II, which will focus on 
applying these theoretical 
frameworks to real-world 
systems, particularly in 
biology. Overall, the work 
aims to provide a unified 

and rigorous mathematical 
framework for 
understanding control 
flows in complex systems, 
from the quantum to the 
biological scale.

The Part II of the article 
extends the concepts 
introduced in Part I, 

focusing on the application 
of tensor networks (TNs) 
to model control flows in 
active inference systems. 
Key highlights are as 
follows:

Tensor Representation: 
The authors show that 
control flows in systems 
operating under the Free 
Energy Principle (FEP) can 
always be represented as 

tensor networks, provided 
certain conditions of 
statistical independence 
are met.

Classification and Examples:
It demonstrates how tensor
network architectures can 
classify different control 
flows, providing two 
illustrative examples to 
elucidate this concept.

Connection to Neural 
Networks: The article links
tensor networks to existing
artificial neural network 
(ANN) architectures, and 
further generalizes this 
to topological quantum 
neural networks, of which 
standard deep-learning 
models are a classical limit.

Biological Implications: The 
paper discusses how the 

tensor network 
architecture can model 
biological systems at 
multiple scales, 
specifically focusing on 
their observational 
capabilities like detecting 
spatial locality and 
mereology (part-whole 
relationships).

Experimental Design and 
Future Scope: It outlines 

how tensor network-based 
control flow models can be 
employed in experimental 
design and how these 
concepts can help bridge 
the gap between physical 
and life sciences.

The paper is aimed at 
providing a unified and 
rigorous framework for 
understanding control 
flows, extending its 

applicability from quantum 
mechanical systems to 
biological systems, through 
the use of tensor 
networks.

This paper is a dense read 
and tackles some of the 
most challenging and 
cutting-edge concepts in 

computational neuroscience,
quantum mechanics, and 
theoretical physics. It 
attempts to extend the 
Free Energy Principle 
(FEP) and active inference
framework into a general 
formalism for describing 
cognitive systems at 
different scales, 
incorporating tensor 
networks (TNs) as a 

representation of control 
flow in the system.

Let's break down some key 
concepts:

Free Energy Principle 
(FEP): This is a theoretical
framework suggesting that 
any adaptive or self-
organizing system (like the 
brain) acts to minimize its 
free energy, essentially 

predicting sensory inputs to
minimize prediction errors.

Active Inference: A 
Bayseian framework to 
describe decision making in 
biological agents. It 
postulates that organisms 
act to reduce the mismatch 
between their model of 
the world and sensory 
observations.

Tensor Networks: In the 
paper, tensor networks are
used as a mathematical tool
to represent complex 
many-body systems and 
their entanglement 
structures.

Quantum Error Correction 
Codes (QECC): These are 
protocols for correcting 
errors in quantum 
computing; the paper 

suggests that they might be
relevant for maintaining 
"locality" in the 
holographic dual 
representation.

Holographic Duality: This is 
a concept from theoretical 
physics, notably in the 
framework of AdS/CFT 
correspondence, that 
describes a duality between
a gravity theory in some 

space and a quantum field 
theory in the boundary of 
that space.

RT Formula: Ryu-
Takayanagi formula, which 
connects the entanglement 
entropy of a boundary 
system to the area of a 
surface in the associated 
bulk space.
