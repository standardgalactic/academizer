What are the arguments he gives ?


The speaker is discussing the importance of understanding the divine and the sacred, and how it can help people see a larger vision of humanity and the cosmos. They argue that science and reason are important, but they cannot explain everything and there are things beyond their understanding.

They also discuss the value of stories, visual art, and music in taking people to a realm beyond the immediate understanding of a piece of prose.

They also discuss the work of philosopher Martin Heidegger, who wrote in a manner that many find difficult to understand, and argue that his work is important in understanding the deeper meaning of things.

They also discuss the importance of phenomenological philosophers, such as Husserl and Merleau-Ponty, in understanding the human experience.

What are the differences between right and left brain thinking?


The differences between right and left brain thinking are related to the way in which these two hemispheres attend to the world. 

The left hemisphere is more focused on a narrow, targeted attention on details, while the right hemisphere is more holistic and open-minded.

The left hemisphere is less intelligent than the right hemisphere, perceives less, attends to less, and is more prone to delusions and strange denials of reality.

The right hemisphere, on the other hand, is more intelligent, perceives more, attends to more, and is less prone to delusions and strange denials of reality.

In his lecture, Ian McGilchrist discusses the hemisphere theory and how it relates to the global challenges we face, which he refers to as the metacrisis.

He explains that the right and left hemispheres of the brain pay different kinds of attention to the
world, leading to two distinct phenomenological worlds.

The left hemisphere sees the world as simplified, made up of isolated,
static things, while the right hemisphere sees a world of flowing processes and interconnectedness.

McGilchrist argues that our current predicament is a result of our limited vision, which he refers to as the left hemisphere's
worldview.

This way of thinking has led us to ignore what is really important and push out of our lives and our world things that matter but are not easily manipulable or quantifiable.

He also discusses some of the consequences of this limited vision, including the loss of skills such as judgment, intuition, and imagination; the fragmentation and polarization of society; and the destruction of nature and the natural world.

To address these crises, McGilchrist suggests that we need to broaden our perspective and see the interconnectedness of things
rather than treating them in isolation.

He argues that recognizing the limitations of our current way of thinking and embracing a more holistic perspective can help us begin to address these challenges and create a better future for ourselves and the world.

What does he say about cultural decline?


In the interview with David Fuller from web Rebel wisdom, Dr. Iain McGilchrist discussed his views on cultural decline. He believed that the current state of society is a metacrisis, which is not just a crisis in the natural world or the extinction of species, but a deeper issue that requires a holistic response.

He argued that the root cause of this decline is the neglect of the sacred and the disconnection from the richness and complexity of the cosmos.

He emphasized the importance of rediscovering the sacred and developing a wise disposition towards the world in order to avoid the downfall of civilization.

How does he define the metacrisis?


The speaker does not explicitly define the metacrisis in the given context. However, based on the context, it can be inferred that the metacrisis refers to a crisis or difficulty in understanding or communicating complex ideas or concepts, particularly those that involve the relationship between language and other forms of expression such as stories, music, and visual arts.

The speaker also mentions the work of philosopher Heidegger, who is known for his exploration of the relationship between language and meaning, and the idea that there are things beyond the immediate understanding of language and reason.

The speaker also mentions the concept of the left and right hemispheres of the brain and their different approaches to understanding and processing information.

In this lecture, Ian McGilchrist discusses the hemisphere theory and how it relates to what he calls the metacrisis, a term used to describe various global challenges we are currently facing.

McGilchrist argues that our limited way of thinking about ourselves and the world has led us to these crises.

He believes that by understanding more about how the brain works, we can see these disparate elements as coherent and inevitable consequences of our espousal of a particular way of thinking. 

McGilchrist begins by discussing the hemisphere theory and the distinction between the right and left hemispheres of the brain. 

He emphasizes that this is not the simple division often heard about, where the left hemisphere is unemotional and the right hemisphere is flighty.

Instead, he argues that each hemisphere has evolved to pay a different kind of attention to the world and that this difference in attention leads to two very different phenomenological worlds.

The left hemisphere pays narrow beam attention and exists in service of manipulation. It sees the world as simplified, made up of isolated, static things that are already known and familiar. 

The right hemisphere, on the other hand, pays broad, sustained attention and is in the service of understanding the contextual whole.

It sees a world of flowing processes and interconnectedness where everything is constantly changing. 

McGilchrist goes on to discuss the implications of these differences for our lives and argues that our current predicament can be understood as a result of our limited vision, which he refers to as the left hemisphere's worldview.

He suggests that this way of thinking has led us to ignore what is really important and push out of our lives and our world things that matter but are not easily manipulable or quantifiable.

McGilchrist also discusses some of the consequences of this limited vision, including the loss of skills such as judgment, intuition, and imagination; the fragmentation and polarization of society; and the destruction of nature and the natural world.

He argues that to address these crises, we need to broaden our perspective and see the interconnectedness of things rather than treating them in isolation.

Overall, McGilchrist's lecture offers a thought-provoking analysis of the role of the brain and the hemisphere theory in understanding the challenges we face today.

He argues that by recognizing the limitations of our current way of thinking and embracing a more holistic perspective, we can begin to address these crises and create a better future for ourselves and the world.
