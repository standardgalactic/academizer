Incorporating a more nuanced plot element, like the negotiation over an air-protein device and the revelation of the Rhyzomeres' plans, can add depth and subtlety to the scene. Here's how the dialogue might unfold:

*Scene Setup*: In a negotiation room on the Rhyzomeres' ship, Sam, the AI, and the ambassador are discussing the trade of an air-protein device with the Rhyzomere Leader. The atmosphere is diplomatic but tense.

*Sam*: "This air-protein technology could revolutionize how you sustain yourselves. It's a significant gesture of peace."

*Rhyzomere Leader*: "Indeed, and in exchange, we offer you access to our comprehensive DNA database. A treasure trove of biological knowledge."

*AI* (examining the database): "Your scans are remarkably detailed. But there's something unusual here... these systems marked 'uninhabitable'... what about them?"

*Rhyzomere Leader* (casually): "Oh, those are to be collapsed. No use wasting resources on uninhabitable systems."

*Ambassador* (alarmed): "Collapsed? You mean, extinguishing stars?"

*Rhyzomere Leader*: "It's a standard procedure. Why preserve what cannot sustain life?"

*Sam*: (thoughtfully) "But who defines what life is 'sustainable'? There's a broader impact to consider..."

The conversation subtly unfolds to reveal the Rhyzomeres' controversial plan, prompting a deeper ethical dialogue without overt exposition. This approach keeps the audience engaged, inviting them to ponder the implications along with the characters.
