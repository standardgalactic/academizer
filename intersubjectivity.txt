GPT, Jan 1, 2024.


It seems like you've shared a detailed excerpt from an article discussing the concept of "Intersubjectivity Collapse" (IC) by Pawel Pachniewski. This theory delves into the implications of diverse subjectivities within a civilization, especially in the context of artificial general intelligence (AGI) and mind self-modification. It explores how a significant variation in cognitive architectures and experiences can lead to unpredictability and potentially catastrophic consequences for a society.

Key points from the excerpt include:

Intersubjectivity Collapse: The breakdown of unspoken rules and networks due to the introduction of radically different minds into a civilization.
Diverse Subjectivities: The theory posits that an explosion of different types of minds, each with unique subjectivities and cognitive modalities, leads to inherent unpredictability.

Civilization's Fragility: A homogenous species building a civilization creates a brittle network susceptible to intersubjectivity collapse.
Potential Great Filter: This phenomenon could be a significant challenge for any civilization, potentially explaining the Fermi Paradox.
Imperative for Understanding and Mapping: There's a need to understand how the cognitive architectures that spawned a civilization are reflected in its organization and to prepare for intersubjectivity collapse.

Consequences of Different Cognitive Capacities: Different processing capacities and modalities among minds lead to different perceptions of concepts like beauty, values, and societal systems.

The Space of Possible Minds: The vast and potentially enormous space of possible minds and experiences, leading to a combinatorial explosion.

Relation to Consciousness and Perception: The article touches on how our consciousness and perception are shaped by our experiences and the environment we grow up in, influencing our understanding and interaction with the world.
Overall, the concept of intersubjectivity collapse raises crucial questions about the future of civilization in the face of rapidly evolving and diverse cognitive architectures, particularly with the advent of AGI and mind augmentation technologies.


The excerpt you shared delves into the diversity of sensory and cognitive experiences within the human species itself, which adds complexity to the concept of intersubjectivity collapse. Key points include:

Variability in Sensory Perception: Not everyone perceives the world in the same way due to differences in sensory capabilities. This includes variations in how senses function, such as differences in sight, hearing, touch, and others.

Diverse Inner Minds: People's inner experiences and cognitive processes can vary significantly. This is not only due to sensory differences but also due to variations in mental processing and cognitive styles.

Spectrum of Neurodiversity: There is a wide range of neurological conditions that contribute to this diversity, such as autism, psychopathy, congenital insensitivity to pain, being born blind, or having uh'fantasia. Each condition leads to a unique way of experiencing and interacting with the world.

Cultural Differences: Beyond biological and neurological factors, cultural backgrounds also shape how people perceive and interpret the world. Cultural influences lead to different worldviews, values, and interpretations of common experiences.

Common Sense as a Species-Specific Concept: What is considered "common sense" is largely dependent on the cognitive architecture and sensory setup of a species. For example, what is common sense for humans might not be the same for other species like dolphins, due to their different sensory and cognitive frameworks.

These points highlight the inherent diversity within the human species itself, which contributes to the complexity of understanding intersubjectivity. This diversity, when considered alongside the potential introduction of radically different minds (such as those of AGIs or significantly augmented humans), underscores the challenges in maintaining a coherent and functioning societal structure. It raises important questions about how societies can adapt to accommodate such a wide array of cognitive and sensory experiences.


The excerpt you shared discusses two significant concepts related to the diversity of minds and their implications:

Orthogonality Thesis (Bostrom, 2012): This thesis posits that intelligence and final goals (or values) are independent dimensions. It suggests that any combination of intelligence level and goals/values is possible. This thesis implies that in the realm of AI and AGI, we might encounter intelligences with a wide range of ethical frameworks and values, irrespective of their level of intelligence. This concept is crucial for understanding the potential diversity in AGI and the challenges in aligning their goals with human values.

Behavioristic Orthogonality Thesis: This concept extends the idea of orthogonality to behaviors and internal states. It argues that most behaviors and internal states, as we understand them, are not universally necessary but are products of evolutionary adaptation. This means that beings can display behaviors that are completely different or even opposite to what we would expect based on their internal states. For example, an entity might display behaviors that are inverse to human or animal behaviors while appearing similar to them.

The excerpt also highlights several key implications:

Diversity in Axiological Frameworks: There could be a broad spectrum of moral and ethical frameworks among different intelligences, raising significant challenges for AI alignment and safety.

Consistent Signaling Across Species: Some signals of internal states are consistent across different species, like sweating when hot or nervous, or raised pitch in alarm. These evolved traits aid in understanding and predicting behaviors within and across species.

Limitations of Kinship and Empathy: The natural evolution of empathy and kinship may not be universal traits in all minds, especially in artificially created or modified ones. This could lead to significant challenges in interspecies and inter-entity understanding and cooperation.

Superficial Nature of Behavior: The excerpt suggests that behavior is a superficial metric and can be manifested in many ways, making it unreliable for truly understanding an entity's internal state.

Clinical Examples of Inverse Behaviors: Conditions like Pseudobulbar affect, where external expressions contradict internal feelings, and the existence of psychopaths who can manipulate social intuition, are real-world examples of this divergence.

These points emphasize the complexity and potential challenges in understanding, predicting, and interacting with a wide variety of minds, whether naturally evolved, artificially created, or augmented. This further underscores the potential risks and ethical considerations in the development and integration of diverse cognitive entities in society.


This excerpt expands on the concept of intersubjectivity collapse by examining human interactions with other species and proposing a framework to assess a civilization's robustness against such a collapse. Key points include:

Human Impact on Other Species: The text highlights the significant harm humans inflict on other species, particularly through industrial-scale animal agriculture. It notes the acknowledged intelligence and sentience of certain animals, like pigs, and suggests that this disregard for other sentient beings is a negative indicator for how humanity might handle an intersubjectivity collapse.

Vulnerability of Societal Systems: The author argues that the societal systems humans have created are fragile and heavily dependent on a narrow intersubjective understanding. The introduction of new types of minds (e.g., AGI, radically modified human minds) could severely disrupt these systems, necessitating a complete overhaul of civilization.

Great Filter Theory: The concept of "intersubjectivity collapse" is linked to the Great Filter theory in astrobiology, suggesting that the development and introduction of radically diverse minds might be a critical stage that prevents civilizations from advancing and becoming detectable to others in the universe.

Intersubjective Robustness Score: The author proposes a theoretical formula to gauge a civilization's resilience against intersubjectivity collapse. This score would consider factors such as diversity of perspectives, adaptability, social cohesion, communication infrastructure, the number of dominating species, and mind variance among these species.

Diversity of Perspectives: Involves the variety and inclusion of different types of minds in decision-making.

Adaptability: The society's ability to incorporate new ideas and adapt to changes.

Social Cohesion: The strength of social bonds and collaboration within the society.

Communication Infrastructure: The effectiveness of communication tools and technologies, facilitating understanding among different groups.

Number of Dominating Species: Suggests a multi-species civilization might be more resilient than one dominated by a single species.

Human Civilization's Score: By this theoretical measure, human civilization may not score highly, given its history of treating other species and the lack of significant interspecies collaboration.

This framework underscores the importance of considering a broad spectrum of cognitive and sentient beings when contemplating the future of civilization, especially in the context of rapidly advancing technologies and the potential for creating or encountering diverse forms of intelligence. It also suggests that a more inclusive, adaptable, and multi-species approach might be key to navigating the challenges of intersubjectivity collapse.


The excerpt you shared discusses how the complexity and unpredictability of different types of minds, especially in the context of advanced artificial intelligence and mind augmentation, could profoundly affect societal structures and interactions. Key points include:

Game Theory and Intersubjectivity: Traditional game theory concepts like Nash equilibria and Schelling points, which deal with rational agents and their strategies, may fall short in a world with vastly different intelligences and modalities. The fundamental challenge is the potential inability to predict or understand the actions and intentions of other types of minds.

Negative Consequences of Diverse Minds:

Conflict and Violence: Misunderstandings and lack of empathy between different types of minds could lead to con'flict.

Fragmentation of Knowledge: Inability to share information effectively among diverse minds might result in a loss of collective intelligence.

Breakdown of Social Bonds: Lack of understanding could erode social cohesion and lead to societal fragmentation.

Scenarios Illustrating Systemic Inadequacies:

Augmented Minds in Legal Systems: An augmented human with enhanced senses and perfect recording ability challenges existing legal frameworks, raising questions about privacy, evidence, and witness reliability.

Different Internal Constitution: A mind in a human body that operates on entirely different principles, like a psychopath, can manipulate our assumptions about behavior and internal states.

Distributed Minds: A mind that exists across multiple embodiments, challenging our ability to recognize and interact with it.
Orthogonality of Behavior and Morphology: The idea that any physical form can be paired with any type of subjectivity or internal constitution, making it challenging to predict intentions or understand behaviors based on external cues.

Mitigation and Solutions:

Future-Proofing Society: The idea of preparing society for future challenges in ways that also benefit current societal structures.

Diversification of Minds as an Attractor: Embracing diversity in cognitive entities as a strategy to enhance societal resilience.

Dealing with Speculative Scenarios: Developing methods to estimate confidence levels regarding speculative future scenarios and preparing accordingly.

This part of the article emphasizes the potential challenges and uncertainties that societies may face as they encounter increasingly diverse forms of intelligence. It suggests the need for innovative approaches to governance, law, and social norms to accommodate and effectively manage the coexistence of varied cognitive entities, including humans, augmented minds, and advanced AIs. The focus is on building a more adaptable and resilient society that can thrive amidst the unpredictability and complexity of intersubjective interactions.


The excerpt explores potential strategies for preparing society for the challenges posed by intersubjectivity collapse, focusing on creating inclusive, adaptable systems that can accommodate diverse minds. Key points include:

Modifying Laws for Inclusivity: Proposes adapting legal systems to be more inclusive of future minds or mind-agnostic, moving away from anthropocentric norms. This could lead to more efficient legal processes.

Redefining Adulthood: Suggests using intellectual and emotional maturity tests instead of age as a proxy for adulthood. This approach is more adaptable to different types of minds and may also benefit current legal systems by providing a more accurate assessment of maturity.

Developing New Communication Methods: Advocates for creating new forms of communication or translation technologies to facilitate understanding between different minds.

Establishing Shared Norms and Values: Suggests forming universal norms, values, and behavioral rules to promote peaceful coexistence and cooperation among diverse minds.

Education and Training: Recommends implementing programs to educate and train individuals to interact with and understand various types of minds.

Future-Proofing Societal Systems: Emphasizes the need to create species-agnostic societal systems and laws that can adapt to the presence of different minds.

Universal Communication Modules: Considers the idea of universal slots in new minds for modules that aid in empathy or intercommunication.

Simulating Future Societies: Proposes simulations to understand how societies with diverse minds might function and to identify species-specific biases in current systems.

Acting Today for Future Scenarios: Suggests adopting practices now that anticipate the presence of diverse minds, like redefining criteria for adulthood, to both improve current systems and prepare for future ones.

Potential for Civilization Fragmentation: Acknowledges the likelihood of civilization fragmentation into sub-communities, each with its own specific rules and norms. This suggests an inverse relationship between the complexity of laws and the diversity of minds.

Decentralizing Rule-Making: Implies that as mind diversity increases, specific communities may need to develop their own rules, acknowledging the difficulty of universally judging and deciding for all types of minds.

These strategies highlight the importance of proactive and adaptive approaches to societal governance, legal systems, and communication in anticipation of the emergence of diverse cognitive entities. The focus is on building a flexible, inclusive society capable of accommodating a wide range of minds, thereby mitigating the potential negative impacts of intersubjectivity collapse.


In this comprehensive overview, the author delves into the complexities of AI alignment and safety, particularly in the context of intersubjectivity collapse. Key points include:

AI Alignment and Human Values: The idea of AI alignment involves aligning AI with human values to ensure safety. The field is rapidly evolving, with contributions from pioneers like Norbert Wiener and institutes like MIRI, FHI, and Anthropic AI. The challenge lies in accommodating a diverse set of minds, beyond just human values.

Imminence of Intersubjectivity Collapse: The author believes that intersubjectivity collapse is inevitable for civilizations that significantly self-modify their minds or develop AGI. This is partly because the space of possible minds created artificially is much larger than what evolution has produced.

Multidisciplinary Analysis: Addressing intersubjectivity collapse requires a collaborative effort from all branches of science and philosophy, given its multidisciplinary nature.

Ecosystems and Trophic Cascades: The author suggests looking at new minds through the lens of ecosystem perturbations, though this is beyond the scope of the current post.

Conclusion and Call for Research: Intersubjectivity collapse is seen as an imminent and significant problem that requires thorough research. The author expects it to begin manifesting soon, citing the impact of entities like psychopaths as an example of how minor deviations can have significant societal effects.

Suggested Literature: The author recommends various books that explore different aspects of intersubjectivity, such as "The Interpersonal World of the Infant" by Daniel N. Stern, "The Social Construction of Reality" by Berger and Luckmann, and works by Jürgen Habermas and Hannah Arendt. These works provide insights into the development, impact, and challenges of intersubjectivity in various contexts.

This overview emphasizes the urgency and complexity of addressing intersubjectivity collapse in the context of AI development and the broader implications for society and civilization. It calls for a multidisciplinary approach to understand and mitigate the potential challenges posed by diverse minds, both human and artificial.


The concept of the "Phantom Cognit" as introduced by Pawel Pachniewski is a fascinating and forward-looking idea in cognitive science and neuroscience. Here's a summary:

Definition of Phantom Cognit: A "phantom cognit" refers to a cognitive unit or element that a mind attempts to access but is absent. This absence leads to traces or broken connections in other cognitive units of the mind.

Relation to Phantom Limb: The concept is a generalization of the "phantom limb" phenomenon, where individuals feel sensations or pain in a limb that has been amputated. Similarly, a phantom cognit involves the mind's attempt to interact with a cognitive element that is no longer present or never existed.

Empirical Examples in Biological Brains: Pachniewski provides present-day examples of this phenomenon in biological brains, indicating that the concept has observable and measurable implications in current cognitive science.

Relevance to Extended Minds: The idea of phantom cognits becomes increasingly relevant as we explore the extension of the human mind through neuro-implants, cognitive augmentations, and the development of exocortices or modular minds. As minds become more complex and integrated with technology, the potential for encountering phantom cognits increases.

Implications for Future Research: The conclusion suggests several directions for further research, likely exploring how these phantom cognits affect cognitive processes, the integration of artificial cognitive units, and the overall functioning of augmented minds.

The concept of the phantom cognit represents a significant step in understanding the complexities and potential challenges in the evolving landscape of cognitive science, especially as it intersects with advancements in neurotechnology and artificial intelligence. It points to the need for deeper exploration of how minds interact with both biological and artificial cognitive elements, and the possible repercussions of these interactions.


In the introduction to his concept of the "Phantom Cognit," Pawel Pachniewski discusses the challenges and complexities of interfacing with biological brains and the implications of extending our cognition through technology. Key points from this introduction include:

Difficulty in Interfacing with Biological Brains: Unlike machines, which are designed with layers of origination and direct interfaces, biological brains lack these structured interfaces and controls, making them difficult to directly interact with.

Cognitive Extension through Technology: Humans have been extending their cognitive capabilities indirectly through technology, such as computers and mobile phones. More recent developments explore direct brain interfaces, like EEG helmets and brain implants (e.g., Neuralink).

Brain's Elasticity and Limitations: The brain is described as an adaptable and plastic organ, yet it is self-contained within the skull and primarily interacts with the world through the CNS and body in specific, established ways.

Phantom Limb Phenomenon: This is cited as an example of the brain's limitations. The brain maintains a somatosensory mapping of a limb that is no longer present, leading to sensations or pain in that absent limb.

Modularity of the Brain: The brain has specific areas dedicated to particular processing tasks (e.g., visual processing through cortical layers V1 to V5, motor cortex for movement planning and execution). Even at granular levels, there are concentrated pockets of function, like Broca's area for motor speech or the pineal gland.

Definition of Cognit: Pachniewski defines a "cognit" as a designated cognitive unit in the brain, in line with the conceptualization by Fuster (2006).

Phantom Cognit Explained: This term refers to any missing part of a cognitive system where, instead of having a functioning cognitive unit, there are references or dependencies on it that no longer function or exist. It highlights the issue of absent cognitive components that the brain or cognitive system still tries to access or integrate.

This introduction sets the stage for a deeper exploration into the concept of the phantom cognit, emphasizing the challenges of integrating technology with the complex and sometimes unpredictable workings of the biological brain. The concept of phantom cognit extends the understanding of how the brain adapts (or fails to adapt) to changes in its cognitive network, especially in the context of technological augmentation and neuro-interfaces.


The emergence of the "phantom cognit" as a problem is rooted in the unique characteristics and constraints of the human brain. Key points explaining this include:

Adaptability and Plasticity of the Brain: The human brain is known for its remarkable ability to adapt and reorganize itself, as evidenced by cases where it recovers lost functions after brain damage.

Inherent Constraints of the Brain: Despite its adaptability, the brain operates within certain limits. It is a complex, energy-efficient network (operating on about 20 watt power) consisting of approximately 86 billion neurons. This network is contained within the skull, bathed in cranial fluid, and connects to the body through the central nervous system.

Limitations of Brain Input/Output: The brain's input and output capabilities are restricted to sensory inputs and its own internal processes. It doesn't directly interact with external objects or environments in the way external devices or tools do.

Brain's Lack of Sensation: The brain itself does not feel pain or sensations, except for the eyes, which are an extension of the brain. This isolation contributes to its self-dependency and historical lack of consistent interaction with external objects.

Impact of New Interactions and Technologies: Throughout evolution, the brain has not regularly interacted with external objects or technologies like EEG helmets. Such new interactions could disrupt the brain's established patterns and networks.

Associative Nature of the Brain: The brain operates on associative principles, where neurons that frequently activate together strengthen their connections (Hebbian learning). This makes the brain particularly susceptible to integrating new cognitive units ("cognits").

Loss of Integrated Cognits: When these newly integrated cognits are lost or cease to function (as might happen with the removal of a neuro-implant or the cessation of interaction with a technology), it can create problems. The brain may continue to reference these missing cognits, leading to the phenomenon of "phantom cognits."

In summary, the phantom cognit arises due to the brain's inherent adaptability and associative nature, combined with its evolutionary history of limited direct interaction with external objects or technologies. The integration and subsequent loss of external cognitive units disrupt the brain's established patterns, creating issues in its cognitive processing. This phenomenon underscores the complexities and potential challenges in interfacing the human brain with emerging neuro-technologies.


Pawel Pachniewski's initial taxonomy of phantom cognits categorizes them based on the degree of integration and impact on the brain. This categorization provides a framework for understanding how different types of interactions and dependencies on external cognitive units can affect the brain. The taxonomy includes:

Weak or Indirect Phantom Cognit:

This type involves extended mind and body concepts, where the brain becomes accustomed to external tools or interfaces.
Examples include getting used to a specific computer interface, the shape and function of a mobile phone, or a car.
Loss of familiar people or relationships can also fall under this category, as the brain expects their presence and may struggle to adapt to their absence.
Medium or More Concrete Phantom Cognit:

These are cognitive units that interface with the brain more closely, often over an extended period.
Examples include using an EEG helmet or devices like the "God helmet," which stimulate the brain.
In these cases, the brain forms a more direct dependency on these devices, and their removal or loss can lead to cognitive challenges, though these are typically less severe than the strong version.
Strong Version of Phantom Cognit:

This category involves cognitive units that are directly integrated into the cognitive apparatus as functional units.
An example is an implanted chip, like those Neuralink aims to produce.

Removing or losing these directly integrated units can cause immediate and severe cognitive issues due to their integral role in the brain's functioning.

This taxonomy highlights the varying levels of impact that different cognitive extensions or dependencies can have on the brain. From subtle dependencies on everyday tools to significant reliance on direct brain interfaces, the concept of the phantom cognit provides a framework to understand and anticipate the cognitive challenges that may arise from the increasing integration of technology with the human mind. It underscores the need for careful consideration of the cognitive implications of such technologies, both currently existing and those in development.


Pawel Pachniewski's discussion of a potential "cognit integration score" and the concept of built-in safeguards in future minds extends the taxonomy of phantom cognits into practical applications. Key insights include:

Cognit Integration Score:

This proposed metric could quantify the degree of integration of a cognit with the brain.
The score could help predict the potential consequences of removing or losing a cognitive extension or dependency.
Such a scoring system would enable a more nuanced understanding of the impact of various technologies and interfaces on cognitive functioning.
Built-in Safeguards for Future Minds:

Future cognitive technologies might include safeguards to protect the integrity of the mind and prevent adverse effects from the loss of integrated cognits.
This approach parallels safety measures in engineering and software development, such as redundancies in critical systems and error handling in programming.
Comparison to Existing Safety Mechanisms:

The concept of building safeguards into cognitive extensions is likened to existing practices in various fields:
Redundant systems in airplanes that compensate for partial engine failure.
Handling null references in programming to avoid crashes or unexpected behavior.
Brain's Natural Plasticity and Self-Healing:

The brain's inherent plasticity and capacity for self-repair are acknowledged.
However, these natural mechanisms have historically dealt with internal changes or damage, not external cognitive extensions.
New Challenges with Brain Extensions:

The types of extensions and augmentations envisioned for the future differ significantly from the brain's historical experience.

These new forms of brain augmentation represent a novel category of interaction and integration, posing unique challenges that the brain's natural mechanisms may not be fully equipped to handle.

This discussion highlights the need for careful design and consideration of cognitive technologies and their integration with the human brain. The proposed cognit integration score and built-in safeguards suggest a proactive approach to managing the potential risks and complexities of enhancing cognitive functions through technology. It underscores the importance of understanding both the capabilities and limitations of the human brain in the context of rapid technological advancement.


In addressing the challenges and perspectives of the future in the context of AI advancements, Pawel Pachniewski presents several thought-provoking points:

Entry into the Pseudo-AGI Era: The development and release of advanced AI systems like OpenAIs ChatGPT mark the beginning of what Pachniewski calls the "pseudo-AGI era." This era is characterized by AI that appears to mimic general intelligence, though full-blown AGI (Artificial General Intelligence) remains a more distant goal.

Irreversible Advancements in AI: The author asserts that we have reached a point of no return in AI development. There will likely be no slowdown ("AI winter") in advancements or investments in the field. This continual progress is shaping the future of AI and its role in society.

Challenge of the Millennium: The integration of rapidly advancing AI technologies into human civilization, especially in the context of radical self-modification, is identified as one of the most critical challenges facing humanity.

Keeping Up with AI: The question of how, or even if, humans can keep pace with the advancements in AI is posed. There's a consideration of whether it's feasible or desirable for humans to try to match the capabilities of increasingly sophisticated AI systems.

Interfacing with Biology: One of the proposed top priorities is improving the interface between AI technologies and biological systems. This involves not just technological development but also a deep understanding of biological processes and cognitive functions.

Research and Development Priorities: The acceleration of AI developments should be one of the top research and development goals. This implies a need for significant investment in understanding and innovating at the intersection of AI and human cognition.

Pachniewski's perspective emphasizes the urgency and importance of addressing the rapidly evolving landscape of AI. It suggests a proactive approach to ensure that AI advancements are beneficial and harmoniously integrated with human capabilities and societal needs. The emphasis on better interfacing with biology points towards a future where AI is not just a separate entity but an integrated part of the human experience, raising profound questions about the future of human identity and society.


In the conclusion of his discussion on the phantom cognit, Pawel Pachniewski reflects on the implications of this concept and its relevance to the future of cognitive science and technology. Key points include:

Speculative and Fictional Aspects: The phantom cognit concept lends itself to speculation and science fiction, inspiring stories and imaginative scenarios. This reflects its potential for wide-ranging implications in future technological developments.

Limitations of the Human Brain: The unaugmented human brain, while capable of self-healing through plasticity and redundancy, is fundamentally self-contained and not designed for crude extensions or implants. It can adapt and integrate but may struggle with the loss of such extensions, leading to phantom cognits.

AI Development and Mind Augmentation: The rapid development of AI raises the question of augmenting human minds to keep pace. Exploring and developing technology that interfaces effectively with biology is seen as a critical avenue of research.

Future Minds and Cognitive Apparatuses: As minds become more augmented or modified, it will be essential to design them with robust features to handle the failure, damage, or removal of integrated cognits. This is to prevent the emergence of phantom cognits and the associated mental and cognitive issues.

Further Research and Speculation: Pachniewski indicates plans for future posts that will speculate on specific phantom cognits in the near future and in more advanced future minds.

General Acceptance and Further Work: The hope is expressed that the phantom cognit concept will gain general acceptance in cognitive science. Further work should focus on refining the taxonomy of phantom cognits, classifying current cases, and mapping out potential future issues in a way that is future-proof.

The conclusion emphasizes the importance of considering the phantom cognit concept in both current and future contexts of cognitive science and neurotechnology. It underscores the need for proactive research and development to address the challenges posed by integrating technology with the human brain, particularly in light of the rapid advancements in AI. The discussion reflects a forward-thinking approach to understanding and preparing for the cognitive implications of emerging technologies.


Pawel Pachniewski's discussion of "Mental Contraction" addresses the "hard problem" of metaphysics, focusing on the nature of consciousness and the possibility of other unknown phenomena in the universe. Key points from the introduction include:

Consciousness as an Exceptional Phenomenon: The argument starts with the observation that consciousness is a unique phenomenon that cannot be fully derived or explained by a complete description of the universe. It's an intrinsic experience, known only through direct subjective experience.

The Metaphysical Relation to Consciousness: The understanding of consciousness arises from a special metaphysical relationship humans have with their own consciousness. It's suggested that consciousness, with its subjective 'what-it's-like' nature, cannot be comprehensively understood from an external or objective standpoint.

Possibility of Other Unknown Phenomena: If consciousness is an exception to the rule that all phenomena can be understood through a description of the universe, it opens up the possibility that other significant phenomena might also exist, obscured from our knowledge and understanding.

Exploring Unknown Phenomena: The author proposes to explore ways to frame and investigate the idea of other unknown phenomena. This involves considering how such phenomena might be hidden in plain sight and accessible only through specific metaphysical relations that are currently unknown.

Implications and Avenues of Exploration: Pachniewski plans to discuss the broader metaphysical implications of this idea and how one might attempt to uncover or theorize about such unknown phenomena.

This introduction sets the stage for a deeper philosophical inquiry into the nature of consciousness and the potential for other unexplored or unknown aspects of reality. It challenges the assumption that a complete physical or scientific description of the universe can account for all phenomena, suggesting that some aspects of reality might be accessible only through unique, subjective, or metaphysical relationships. This perspective opens up intriguing possibilities for metaphysical exploration and theorizing.


The core of Pawel Pachniewski's argument revolves around the unique and intrinsic nature of consciousness. Key aspects of this argument include:

Consciousness as Intrinsically Knowable: The argument hinges on the idea that consciousness is a phenomenon that can only be known through direct, subjective experience. It is not something that can be fully inferred, understood, or deduced through external observation or analysis.

Limitations of Non-Sentient Observers: The argument posits that a non-sentient entity, such as a robot, even with comprehensive data about human behavior and physiology, would inherently be unable to comprehend or "guess" the existence of consciousness. This is because consciousness transcends observable physical processes.

Consciousness Beyond Observable Signals: While pain, for example, involves observable biological signals and responses, the experience of pain (the "feeling" of it) represents a subjective, conscious experience that is not captured by these observable processes alone.

Unique Metaphysical Relation with Consciousness: The basis of the argument is that our understanding of consciousness stems from a unique metaphysical relationship to it. We are aware of consciousness because we experience it directly, not because we observe it as an external phenomenon.

This core argument challenges the notion that all aspects of reality, including subjective experiences like consciousness, can be fully understood through objective observation or scientific analysis. It suggests that some phenomena, notably consciousness, require a different approach to understanding, one that acknowledges the limitations of external observation in capturing the full scope of subjective experiences. This perspective has significant implications for philosophy, cognitive science, and the study of consciousness.


Pawel Pachniewski's argument delves deeper into the nature of consciousness and the potential for other unknown phenomena. He emphasizes the importance of separating the phenomenon of consciousness from our metaphysical relation to it. Key aspects of this argument include:

Non-committal Stance on Consciousness Debates: The argument does not require one to accept any specific position in the ongoing debates about the nature of consciousness. It's sufficient to recognize consciousness as a subject of debate, regardless of one's stance on qualia or other aspects.

Consciousness as an Explanandum: Consciousness is treated not as something explained in a particular way but as a topic of ongoing discourse. The existence of this discourse, regardless of its conclusions, is central to the argument.

Possibility of Other Metaphysical Relations: The fact that we have contemplated consciousness for millennia without discovering other relations similar to it suggests the possibility of other significant, yet unknown phenomena in the universe.

Separating Phenomenon from Relation: The argument distinguishes between the phenomenon (consciousness) and the relation by which we understand it (direct experience). This distinction opens up the possibility of other phenomena and relations existing beyond our current understanding.

Potential for New Metaphysical Categories: The existence of other unknown phenomena could lead to new metaphysical considerations, taxonomies, and classifications beyond our current capacity to imagine.

Two Parts of the Argument: The argument consists of two components: the relation by which we know a phenomenon, and the phenomenon itself. The challenge is to speculate about other potential phenomena and the relations by which they might be known.

Intractability and Importance of Speculation: While it seems intractable to speculate about these unknown phenomena and relations from our current understanding, acknowledging their potential existence is crucial due to their potentially revolutionary nature in terms of metaphysics and epistemology.

Pachniewski's argument invites us to consider the limits of our current metaphysical and epistemological frameworks. It suggests that there could be more to the universe than what we currently understand or can even conceptualize, especially concerning consciousness and potentially other phenomena. This perspective encourages an open-minded and speculative approach to exploring the nature of reality and our understanding of it.


Pawel Pachniewski's argument acknowledges the challenges in speculating about unknown phenomena, particularly those like consciousness that are understood through a unique metaphysical relation. He also addresses potential objections to this argument:

Significance of Consciousness: The argument starts with the premise that consciousness, a significant aspect of our existence, can only be known through a unique metaphysical relation. This suggests that other significant phenomena could exist in the universe, unknowable without a similar type of access.

Clues in Descriptive Cases: Like how observing biological agency can lead to suspecting something more than mere physical processes (but not directly inferring consciousness), there might be clues in our descriptions of the universe that hint at unknown phenomena.

Bold Proposition: Pachniewski suggests that in any universe where a phenomenon is known solely through a unique metaphysical relation (like consciousness), it is reasonable to consider the possibility of other such phenomena.

Objections and Replies:

Denial of Consciousness as Solely Knowable Through Itself:

One objection is the claim that consciousness can be understood through means other than direct experience.
Pachniewski argues that even if consciousness can be known in other ways, it doesn’t negate the possibility of other hard-to-access phenomena in the universe.
Consciousness as the Only Exception:

Another objection could be that consciousness is the only phenomenon that is an exception to the knowability of facts through a description of the universe.
The challenge here would be to prove definitively that consciousness is the sole exception, which Pachniewski implies is a formidable task.
Pachniewski’s discussion emphasizes the difficulty yet importance of considering phenomena beyond our current understanding or perceptual capabilities. He encourages open-mindedness in exploring the unknown aspects of our universe, recognizing the potential for significant discoveries that challenge our existing metaphysical and epistemological frameworks. The argument invites further contemplation and research into the nature of consciousness and the possibility of other elusive phenomena.


Pawel Pachniewski concludes his discussion on the potential for unknown phenomena in the universe with responses to objections and outlines directions for further exploration. Key points include:

Objections and Replies:

Objection 1: Claiming consciousness can be known indirectly or inferred.
Reply: This has not been established. The argument challenges the claimant to demonstrate how consciousness can be known indirectly, especially from the perspective of a non-sentient entity.
Objection 2: Physics suggests other hidden phenomena are unlikely or impossible.
Reply: Physics, while descriptive of laws and phenomena, does not account for consciousness. The challenge is to show how physics can speculate on other phenomena that are similarly obscured.
Objection 3: The argument relies on specific philosophical positions regarding consciousness.
Reply: The argument remains agnostic to one’s stance on consciousness in philosophy of mind. It focuses on the potential for other unknown metaphysical relations, regardless of one's view on consciousness.
Directions for Further Exploration:

Investigating the Likelihood of Other Phenomena: Exploring whether we can speculate on the presence of other significant phenomena in the universe based on our understanding of consciousness.
Searching for Hints of Hidden Phenomena: Considering how to investigate and identify potential indicators of other unknown phenomena within our universe.
Examining Epistemic Frameworks: Surveying and categorizing frameworks for the discoverability of phenomena and developing arguments to frame these explorations.
Importance of the Argument:

Pachniewski highlights the significance of the discussion, relating it to the ongoing millennia-old debates and investigations into mind and consciousness.
He suggests that there may be phenomena as significant as consciousness yet undiscovered, and encourages others to expand on and explore this idea further.
Pachniewski's conclusion underlines the profound implications of considering unknown phenomena and metaphysical relations in our universe. By addressing potential objections and outlining avenues for future research, he encourages a broader and more speculative approach to understanding reality, beyond the confines of current scientific and philosophical paradigms. This perspective invites a more exploratory and open-minded approach to metaphysics and the study of consciousness.


Pawel Pachniewski has proposed three significant theses that he believes are crucial to understanding and preparing for the future of civilizations, particularly in the context of drastic cognitive self-modification. These theses are particularly relevant as we approach the posthuman era. Here's a summary of each:

Intersubjectivity Collapse:

This thesis addresses the potential breakdown in the network of unspoken rules that allows civilizations to function, as a result of a Cambrian esque explosion of new types of minds.

The large and varied space of all possible minds suggests that understanding and predicting other agents, which has historically been possible due to shared experiences and constraints, might become increasingly difficult.
The thesis considers how civilizations can prepare for this potential collapse in intersubjectivity.

The Phantom Cognit:

Pachniewski introduces the concept of the phantom cognit, which extends the idea of the phantom limb to cognitive units.
It describes a situation where a missing component in a cognitive apparatus leaves traces or broken connections, affecting the functioning of the remaining cognitive units.

This thesis explores present-day examples in biological brains and considers the implications for cognitive technology and augmentation.
The Hard Problem of Metaphysics:

This thesis expands on the philosophical discussion of consciousness, suggesting that if consciousness can only be known through a unique metaphysical relationship, there might be other significant phenomena in the universe similarly hidden from our understanding.

It challenges the assumption that a complete physical description of the universe can capture all phenomena, proposing the existence of other phenomena accessible only through specific metaphysical relations.
Each of these theses offers a unique perspective on the challenges and complexities facing civilizations as they evolve and integrate new technologies and forms of consciousness. They underscore the importance of considering not only the technological and scientific advancements but also the philosophical and metaphysical implications of these developments. These ideas invite further exploration and discussion as humanity navigates the uncharted territories of cognitive modification and the posthuman future.


Pawel Pachniewski's work presents three thought-provoking theses that explore the complexities and challenges facing civilizations at the brink of significant cognitive transformations and the posthuman era:

Intersubjectivity Collapse:

This concept explores the potential breakdown of the unspoken rules and mutual understandings that underpin civilization, in the face of a diverse explosion of new types of minds, including artificial intelligences.

It suggests that as minds become more varied and radically different, the conventional ways in which agents understand and predict each other may collapse, leading to profound societal and existential challenges.
The Phantom Cognit:

Pachniewski introduces the idea of the phantom cognit, akin to the phenomenon of a phantom limb, but applied to cognitive functions.
This notion addresses the potential issues arising when components of a cognitive system (natural or augmented) are lost or removed, leading to lingering effects or dysfunctions in the remaining cognitive network.
The thesis delves into how such phenomena are currently observable in biological brains and how they might manifest in more complex, augmented cognitive systems.

The Hard Problem of Metaphysics:

Building on the philosophical discourse around consciousness, this thesis argues that if consciousness is only knowable through direct, subjective experience, there might be other significant phenomena in the universe that are similarly elusive.

It challenges the notion that a complete physical or scientific description of the universe can encompass all phenomena, opening up the possibility of other entities or aspects of reality that are accessible only through unique metaphysical relationships.

Together, these theses represent Pachniewski's exploration of the philosophical, cognitive, and metaphysical challenges inherent in the evolving landscape of human and artificial intelligence. They highlight the need for a deeper understanding and consideration of the potential impacts, both known and unknown, of advancing towards a future where cognitive modification and AI integration are prevalent. These ideas encourage further research and discourse on how civilizations might navigate these unprecedented changes, maintaining coherence and stability in the face of profound transformations.
