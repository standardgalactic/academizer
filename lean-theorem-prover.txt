Summarize: Lean is a theorem prover and programming language. It is 
based on the calculus of constructions with inductive types. The 
Lean project is an open-source project hosted on GitHub. It was 
launched by Leonardo de Moura at Microsoft Research in 2013.[1] 
Lean has an interface, implemented as a Visual Studio Code extension
and Language Server Protocol server, that differentiates it from 
other interactive theorem provers. It has native support for 
Unicode symbols, which can be typed using LaTeX-like sequences, 
such as "\times" for "×". Lean can also be compiled to JavaScript and 
accessed in a web browser and has extensive support for meta-
programming. Started in 2017, the user-maintained library mathlib 
contains the largest collection of mathematics that has been 
formalized in Lean. As of February 2023, mathlib contains over 
100,000 theorems and 1,000,000 lines of code.[2] In prior releases 
of Lean, several core parts of the system's logic were not amenable 

to being modified. A user wishing to change these parts of the 
system would need to modify the C++ implementation of Lean. 
Furthermore, overhead associated with virtual machine 
interpretation meant that the efficiency of Lean was not 
competitive with other proof assistants such as Coq. In 2021, Leonardo
de Moura and Sebastian Ullrich released Lean 4: a reimplementation 
of the Lean theorem prover within itself, with the aim of 
addressing the two aforementioned criticisms. Lean 4 produces C code
which is then compiled, enabling the development of efficient 
domain-specific automation.[3] Lean 4 is not backwards-compatible 
with Lean 3.[4] Lean has gotten attention from mathematicians 
Thomas Hales[5] and Kevin Buzzard.[6] Hales is using it for his 
project, Formal Abstracts.[7] Buzzard uses it for the Xena project.
[8] One of the Xena Project's goals is to rewrite every theorem and
proof in the undergraduate math curriculum of Imperial College 
London in Lean.

Lean is a theorem prover and programming language based on the 
calculus of constructions with inductive types, developed by 
Leonardo de Moura at Microsoft Research in 2013. Distinguishing 
features include an interface through a Visual Studio Code 
extension and Language Server Protocol server, native support for 
Unicode symbols, and compilation to JavaScript for web browser 
accessibility.

A significant user-maintained library called mathlib, initiated in 
2017, contains the most extensive collection of mathematics 

formalized in Lean, boasting over 100,000 theorems and 1,000,000 
lines of code by February 2023.

Lean has seen improvements since its initial release. Early versions 
had limitations like unmodifiable core parts of system logic, 
requiring users to alter the C++ implementation, and efficiency 
concerns due to virtual machine interpretation. However, Lean 4, 
released in 2021 by de Moura and Sebastian Ullrich, addressed these
issues. It's a self-contained version of Lean that generates C code, 
which is then compiled, facilitating the development of efficient 
domain-specific automation. But Lean 4 is not backwards-compatible 
with Lean 3.

Lean has caught the attention of mathematicians such as Thomas 
Hales, who uses it for his Formal Abstracts project, and Kevin 
Buzzard, who uses it for the Xena project, aiming to rewrite every 
theorem and proof in the undergraduate math curriculum of 
Imperial College London in Lean.

Examples (Lean 3) The natural numbers can be defined as an 
inductive type. This definition is based on the Peano axioms and 
states that every natural number is either zero or the successor of
some other natural number. inductive nat : Type | zero : nat | succ : 
nat → nat Addition of natural numbers can be defined recursively, 
using pattern matching. definition add : nat → nat → nat | n zero := n
| n (succ m) := succ (add n m) This is a simple proof in lean in term 
mode. theorem and swap : p ∧ q → q ∧ p := assume h1 : p ∧ q, 
⟨h1.right, h1.left⟩ This same proof can be accomplished using tactics.
theorem and swap (p q : Prop) : p ∧ q → q ∧ p := begin assume h : (p ∧
q), -- assume p ∧ q is true cases h, -- extract the individual 

_

_

propositions from the conjunction split, -- split the goal conjunction 
into two cases: prove p and prove q separately repeat { assumption } 
end
ChatGPT

These examples demonstrate the Lean programming language's ability
to define types, functions, and perform theorem proofs.

In the first example, a type for the natural numbers is defined 
using an inductive structure, based on the Peano axioms. According to
these axioms, each natural number is either zero or the successor 
of another natural number:

leanCopy code
inductive nat : Type
| zero : nat
| succ : nat → nat

In the next example, a recursive definition of addition for natural 
numbers is provided, which utilizes pattern matching:

leanCopy code
definition add : nat → nat → nat
| n zero     := n
| n (succ m) := succ (add n m)

 is 
In the third and fourth examples, a theorem named and swap
proven. The theorem asserts that if p ∧ q is true, then q ∧ p is 
also true. This shows that conjunction in logic is commutative. The 
proof is shown both in term mode and with tactics:

_

Term mode:

leanCopy code
theorem and swap : p ∧ q → q ∧ p :=
_
    assume h1 : p ∧ q,
    ⟨h1.right, h1.left⟩

Tactics:

leanCopy code
theorem and swap (p q : Prop) : p ∧ q → q ∧ p :=
_
begin
    assume h : (p ∧ q), -- assume p ∧ q is true
    cases h, -- extract the individual propositions from the conjunction
    split, -- split the goal conjunction into two cases: prove p and prove q separately
    repeat { assumption }
end

In the tactics mode, each step of the proof is explicitly stated, 
which can make the logic easier to follow for humans, especially for
more complex proofs.

Here is a summary of the main points from the Wikipedia excerpt on 
the calculus of constructions: • The calculus of constructions (CoC) 
is a type theory created by Thierry Coquand. • It can serve as both a
typed programming language and as a constructive foundation for 
mathematics. • It has been the basis for Coq and other proof 
assistants. • Variants include: - The calculus of inductive 
constructions which adds inductive types - The calculus of 
(co)inductive constructions which adds coinduction - The predicative 
calculus of inductive constructions which removes some 
impredicativity In short, the calculus of constructions is a type 
theory that can be used as a programming language and as a basis for 
formal mathematical proofs. It supports various features like 
inductive types, coinduction, and impredicativity.
ChatGPT

The Calculus of Constructions (CoC) is a type theory developed by 
Thierry Coquand. It has dual functionality as both a typed 
programming language and as a constructive foundation for 
mathematics, acting as the foundation for proof assistants such as 
Coq and others.

CoC encompasses several variants, each introducing or removing 
certain aspects. The Calculus of Inductive Constructions extends 
the original theory by adding inductive types. The Calculus of 
(Co)inductive Constructions further introduces coinduction. The 
Predicative Calculus of Inductive Constructions, on the other hand, 
restricts the theory by removing some impredicativity.

In essence, the Calculus of Constructions is a versatile type theory 
that allows for programming as well as formal mathematical proofs. 
It has the flexibility to accommodate different features like 
inductive types, coinduction, and impredicativity, depending on the 
variant used.

Applications of the calculus of constructions: • It can be used as the
basis for proof assistants like Coq, which are tools for formal 
mathematical proofs. This allows you to model and verify 
mathematical concepts and theorems in a rigorous way. • It can be 
used as a typed functional programming language. The types provide 
strong static guarantees that help avoid bugs. Comparison to other 
type theories: • The calculus of constructions is more expressive 
than simple type theories like the simply typed lambda calculus. It 
supports dependent types, where types can depend on values. This 
allows encoding more mathematical notions. • It is similar to other 
dependent type theories like the calculus of inductive 
constructions (CIC) and the calculus of constructions and inductive 
(CCI). Predicative calculus of inductive constructions: • This is a 
variant of CoC that removes some forms of impredicativity. • 
Impredicativity refers to the ability to define a type in a way that 
depends on that same type. This can cause paradoxes. • The 

predicative version only allows defining types that depend on 
"smaller" types, avoiding impredicativity and thus paradoxes. 
However, it is less expressive. • Specifically, it does not allow 
defining inductive types whose indices contain that same inductive 
type. Only smaller index types are allowed. So in summary, the 
calculus of constructions is an expressive dependent type theory 
that serves as a basis for proof assistants and functional 
programming. Variants like the predicative CoC aim for a good balance 
between expressiveness and avoidance of paradoxes.

The Calculus of Constructions (CoC) is an advanced type theory that 
has a wide range of applications and variants. It can serve as the 
foundation for proof assistants like Coq, facilitating formal 
mathematical proofs by allowing for the rigorous modeling and 
verification of mathematical concepts and theorems.

Moreover, it can also be used as a typed functional programming 
language, providing strong static guarantees that help prevent bugs.
The utilization of types in programming has proven to be beneficial in
ensuring the correctness of code, making it a valued attribute for 
many modern programming languages.

In terms of other type theories, CoC stands out for its 
expressiveness. It goes beyond simple type theories such as the 
simply typed lambda calculus by supporting dependent types. These 
are types that can rely on values, providing a mechanism for 
encoding a broader range of mathematical concepts.

CoC is in the same family as other dependent type theories like the 
calculus of inductive constructions (CIC) and the calculus of 
constructions and inductive (CCI), which have similar attributes.

A variant of CoC, the predicative calculus of inductive 
constructions, removes some forms of impredicativity. Impredicativity
involves the ability to define a type in a manner that depends on 
the same type, potentially leading to paradoxes. This predicative 
variant restricts type definitions to "smaller" types to avoid 
impredicativity, thereby reducing the possibility of paradoxes. 
However, this precaution limits its expressiveness, as it does not 
allow the definition of inductive types whose indices contain the 
same inductive type.

In summary, CoC is an expressive dependent type theory that acts as 
the backbone for proof assistants and functional programming 
languages. Its variants like the predicative CoC are designed to 
strike a balance between expressiveness and the prevention of 
paradoxes.

Lean examples: Lean is another theorem prover and functional 
programming language based on dependent type theory. Some key 
points: • Lean is based on the calculus of inductive constructions 
(CIC), a variant of the calculus of constructions that supports 
inductive types. • Like Coq, Lean can be used for formal 
mathematical proofs and modeling. It has been used for verifying 
results in complex analysis, algebra, topology, and more. • Lean code 
tends to be more concise than Coq due to Lean's more permissive 
syntax. • Lean supports automation techniques like type class 
inference and tactic programming to make proofs more convenient. • 

Lean aims to have a low barrier to entry while remaining a coherent 
foundation for mathematics. As for your other questions: Paradoxes 
from impredicativity: • Russell's paradox arises from 
impredicativity. It considers the set R of all sets that do not contain
themselves. This leads to a contradiction - R either contains itself 
or does not. • The paradox of the least infinite ordinal considers 
the least infinite ordinal lambda. But lambda is defined as the set 
of all ordinals less than lambda, which is circular. CIC vs predicative 
CIC: • CIC is more expressive since it allows impredicative definitions. 
This allows encoding more mathematical concepts. • The predicative 
version avoids paradoxes by only allowing definitions to refer to 
"smaller" types. But this means some inductive types cannot be 
defined. Example inductive type: • In CIC, we can define the type of
lists where the element type is a list: Inductive list (A:Type) : Type
:= | nil : list A | cons : A -> list A -> list A. Inductive listlist : Type
:= | nilnil : listlist | consll : (l:list A) -> listlist -> listlist. Here, 
listlist is an inductive type whose indices contain list, the same 
inductive type.
ChatGPT

Lean is a theorem prover and functional programming language 
rooted in dependent type theory, specifically the calculus of 
inductive constructions (CIC), a variant of the calculus of 
constructions supporting inductive types. Lean's applications include 
formal mathematical proofs and modeling across various disciplines, 
including complex analysis, algebra, and topology.

A significant advantage of Lean is its concise code resulting from a 
more permissive syntax compared to Coq. It also supports automation 

techniques like type class inference and tactic programming, making 
proofs more convenient. Additionally, Lean is designed to have a low 
entry barrier while providing a coherent foundation for 
mathematics.

Paradoxes can arise from impredicativity. For instance, Russell's 
paradox contemplates the set R, comprising all sets that do not 
contain themselves. This leads to a contradiction: R either contains 
itself or does not. Another paradox, the paradox of the least 
infinite ordinal, emerges from considering the least infinite ordinal
lambda, defined as the set of all ordinals less than lambda, 
creating a circular definition.

The calculus of inductive constructions (CIC) and its predicative 
variant offer trade-offs. CIC, being more expressive, allows 
impredicative definitions, hence facilitating the encoding of more 
mathematical concepts. However, the predicative version, by only 
allowing definitions to refer to "smaller" types, ensures avoidance 
of paradoxes at the expense of disallowing some inductive type 
definitions.

An example of an inductive type in CIC could be the type of lists 
where the element type is a list:

leanCopy code
Inductive list (A:Type) : Type :=    
| nil : list A
| cons : A -> list A -> list A.

Inductive listlist : Type :=
| nilnil : listlist
| consll : (l:list A) -> listlist -> listlist.

Here, listlist is an inductive type whose indices contain list, the 
same inductive type. This kind of definition would be restricted in 
the predicative version of CIC.

Here are some details on Lean's syntax compared to Coq's and other 
aspects of your questions: Lean's syntax differences from Coq: • 
Lean uses := for definitions while Coq uses :=. • Lean does not use 
Notation to declare syntactic sugar. It has a more permissive surface 
syntax. • Lean uses square brackets [ ] for dependent function 
arguments while Coq uses ( ). • Lean does not require ending 
definitions with . or Qed. Code blocks are terminated by exiting 
indentation. • Lean uses from [import] for importing modules while 
Coq uses Require Import. • Lean uses @[derive] attributes for 
deriving instances while Coq uses Scheme. Other paradoxes from 
impredicativity: • The paradox of the greatest integer function: 
defining a function that maps each natural number to the greatest 
integer not mapping to itself. Leads to a contradiction. • The Liar 
paradox: the sentence "this sentence is false" refers to itself, 
leading to a contradiction. Both true and false lead to paradox. • 
Berry's paradox: considering the least integer not definable in 
fewer than nineteen words. But the definition is only eighteen 
words, a contradiction. Lean's type class inference: • Lean uses type
classes to represent concepts like groups, monoids, etc. That 
multiple types can instantiate. • Type classes are declared using 
class, and types instantiate them using instance. • Lean can 
automatically infer instances in many cases. For example, if a type 
has members implementing the required methods, Lean can 
instantiate the type class for that type automatically. • This means 

users do not need to declare every instance explicitly, reducing 
boilerplate and improving usability. • Inference heuristics can be 
configured and extended using attribute [infer instance] and 
[at top refer...] .

Lean and Coq, while both being proof assistants based on dependent 
type theory, differ significantly in their syntax:

• While both Lean and Coq use := for definitions, the way they 
handle syntactic sugar is different. Lean does not employ the 
Notation keyword like Coq does; instead, it offers a more 
liberal surface syntax.

• Lean utilizes square brackets [ ] for dependent function 

arguments, while Coq uses parentheses ( ).

• Lean does not mandate the termination of definitions with . or 
Qed, unlike Coq. Instead, code blocks are ended simply by 
exiting indentation.

• For importing modules, Lean uses the from [import] syntax, 

while Coq uses Require Import.

• When deriving instances, Lean uses @[derive] attributes, as 

opposed to Coq's Scheme.

Additional paradoxes may result from impredicativity:

• The paradox of the greatest integer function arises when 

defining a function mapping each natural number to the largest
integer not mapping to itself, leading to a contradiction.

• The Liar paradox presents a contradiction through self-

reference. It revolves around the sentence "this sentence is 
false", which, if true, must be false, and vice versa.
• Berry's paradox involves defining the least integer not 

describable in fewer than nineteen words. Yet, the definition 
itself is only eighteen words, creating a contradiction.

Lean's type class inference system is also worth noting:

• Lean employs type classes to represent abstractions such as 

groups, monoids, and others that multiple types can instantiate.

• The keywords class and instance are used to declare type 

classes and to allow types to instantiate them, respectively.

• Lean's capability to automatically infer instances in many 
situations can be very beneficial. If a type has members 
implementing the required methods, Lean can instantiate the 
type class for that type automatically.

• This functionality allows users to avoid having to explicitly 

declare every instance, reducing boilerplate code and improving
usability.

• Inference heuristics in Lean can be configured and extended 

using the attribute [infer instance]

Here are some key points about the general traits and basics of the 
calculus of constructions: • The CoC is a higher-order, typed lambda
calculus created by Thierry Coquand. It allows: - Functions from 
terms to terms - Terms to types - Types to types - Types to terms 

• It sits at the top of Barendregt's lambda cube due to its 
expressiveness. • The CoC is strongly normalizing, which means it is 
consistent. This means any term will eventually reduce to a value. 
• The CoC has been developed alongside the Coq proof assistant. 
Features added to CoC become available in Coq. • Variants of CoC are 
used in other proof assistants like Matita and Lean. • The CoC 
extends the Curry-Howard isomorphism beyond propositional logic to 
full intuitionistic predicate calculus. This allows: - Proofs of 
quantified statements (propositions) - Defining dependent types 
where the type depends on a term • CoC supports dependent 
functions where the domain and range can be dependent types. This 
corresponds to universal quantification in predicate logic. • CoC also 
supports inductive types, which correspond to existential 
quantification and proofs by induction in logic. So in summary, the 
calculus of constructions is a highly expressive, typed lambda 
calculus that allows representing logic, types, and terms in a 
mutually recursive fashion. This close connection between types and
propositions enables formalizing mathematics within CoC. Here is a 
summary of the main aspects of terms, judgments and inference 
rules in the calculus of constructions: Terms: • A term in CoC can be
a variable, an abstraction, an application or a universal 
quantification. • There are 5 kinds of objects in CoC: - Proofs 
(terms with proposition type) - Propositions (small types) - 
Predicates (functions returning propositions) - Large types (type of 
predicates, like Prop) - T (the type of large types) Judgments: • 
The basic typing judgment has the form: x 1:A 1, x 2:A 2, ... \vdash 
t:B Read as "If variables x 1,x 2,... have types A 1,A 2,... then 
_
term t has type B". • We use Γ to represent a series of type 

_
_

_
_

_

_

_

assignments for variables. Inference rules: • There are inference 
rules for variables, abstraction, application and universal 
quantification. • An inference rule has the form: {\frac {\Gamma \
vdash A:B }{\Gamma'\vdash C:D}} Read as "If Γ ⊢ A:B is valid, then 
Γ' ⊢ C:D is also valid". • The rules deduce new judgments from 
previous judgments. So in summary, the terms in CoC represent 
functions, applications and quantifications. Judgments express the 
types of terms, and inference rules deduce new valid judgments 
from previous ones. This allows proving that terms have certain 
types in a structured way. The key idea is that proofs (terms with 
proposition type) correspond to logical proofs, and types correspond 
to propositions. This enables representing mathematics within CoC. 
This is a good summary of the basic inference rules, definitions of 
logical operators, and data types in the calculus of constructions: 1. 
The first rule simply states that propositions have type Prop. 2. 
The second rule is the variable rule - if a variable x has type A in 
context Γ, then x has type A. 3. The universal quantification rule -
if A has type K and B has type L under the assumption x has type A, 
then ∀x:A.B has type L. 4. The abstraction rule - if N has type B 
under the assumption x has type A, then λx:A.N has type ∀x:A.B. 5. 
The application rule - if M has type ∀x:A.B and N has type A, then 
MN has type B with x replaced by N. 6. The beta equality rule - if M
has type A and A equals B by β-reduction, and B has type K, then M
also has type B. Logical operators are defined using universal 
quantification, e.g. implication is defined as ∀x:A.B, conjunction as 
∀C:Prop.(A → B → C) → C, etc. Data types like Booleans, Naturals, 
Products and Sums are defined in terms of operators like implication 
(→) and disjunction (∨).

ChatGPT

You've provided a very comprehensive summary of the key aspects 
of the calculus of constructions (CoC). I'll reiterate the main points
below:

General traits and basics of the CoC:

• The CoC is a type of lambda calculus that enables the 

construction of functions from terms to terms, terms to types,
types to types, and types to terms.

• The CoC's strength and expressiveness place it at the top of 

Barendregt's lambda cube.

• The CoC is strongly normalizing, implying it's consistent. In other
words, any term in the CoC will reduce to a value eventually.

• The CoC and Coq proof assistant have been developed 

concurrently, meaning enhancements in the CoC are also 
incorporated into Coq.

• Variants of the CoC are utilized in other proof assistants such 

as Matita and Lean.

• The CoC extends the Curry-Howard isomorphism to full 
intuitionistic predicate calculus, allowing for proofs of 
quantified statements and the defining of dependent types.
• The CoC supports dependent functions with dependent types in 
their domain and range, representing universal quantification 
in predicate logic.

• Additionally, CoC supports inductive types, representing 
existential quantification and induction proofs in logic.

Terms, judgments, and inference rules in the CoC:

• A term in CoC can be a variable, an abstraction, an application, or

a universal quantification.

• The CoC distinguishes five kinds of objects: proofs, propositions,

predicates, large types, and T (the type of large types).
• The basic typing judgment in CoC is of the form: x 1:A 1, 
_

_
x 2:A 2, ... ⊢ t:B, interpreted as "If variables x 1, x 2, ... 
_
_
have types A 1, A 2, ..., then term t has type B".

_

_

_

_

• Inference rules deduce new judgments based on previous 

judgments, in a structured way, providing a means for proving 
that terms have certain types.

Inference rules, logical operator definitions, and data types in the 
CoC:

• The inference rules are organized around variable handling, 

abstraction, application, and universal quantification.

• Logical operators are defined using universal quantification. 

For instance, implication is defined as ∀x:A.B, and conjunction 
as ∀C:Prop.(A → B → C) → C, etc.

• Data types like Booleans, Naturals, Products, and Sums are 
defined in terms of operators like implication (→) and 
disjunction (∨).

In conclusion, the calculus of constructions is a highly expressive, 
typed lambda calculus that allows representing logic, types, and 
terms in a mutually recursive manner. Its strength lies in the 
direct correspondence between types and propositions, which 
facilitates the formalization of mathematics within the CoC.

Explain that using lean instead of coq
ChatGPT

Sure, let's talk about using Lean (which is also a theorem prover and
functional programming language based on dependent type theory) 
instead of Coq.

1. Similarities:
• Both Lean and Coq are based on the calculus of inductive 

constructions (CIC), a variant of the calculus of constructions 
(CoC) that supports inductive types.

• Both Lean and Coq can be used for formal mathematical proofs 
and modeling. They are used to verify results in complex 
mathematical domains, such as analysis, algebra, and topology.
• Both Lean and Coq support automation techniques. They offer 
capabilities such as type class inference and tactic programming 
to make proofs more convenient.

2.Differences:
• Lean code tends to be more concise than Coq due to differences 

in syntax. For instance, Lean does not require ending 
definitions with '.' or 'Qed.' Lean's code blocks are terminated 

by exiting indentation, which some programmers find more 
intuitive and less cumbersome.

• Lean's syntax is often considered more permissive and flexible 
than Coq's. For example, Lean uses square brackets '[ ]' for 
dependent function arguments, while Coq uses parentheses 
'( )'.

• Lean has a goal to make it easier for newcomers to get started. 
While Coq is widely adopted and has a robust user community, 
Lean places an emphasis on a low barrier to entry.

• While both systems have strong communities, Lean is relatively 
newer and its user base and ecosystem are growing rapidly.

In summary, while Coq has a long history and a robust user 
community, Lean aims to offer a more modern and user-friendly 
environment for formalizing mathematics and developing formally 
verified software. Depending on the specific needs and preferences
of the user, either Coq or Lean could be the better choice.

Explain the calculus of constructions using lean examples.
ChatGPT

Sure! Here are some examples of the Calculus of Constructions (CoC)
concepts using Lean.

1.Functions (Terms to Terms): Functions in Lean are typically 
defined using def or λ (lambda). Here's a function add that 
adds two natural numbers:

leanCopy code
def add : nat → nat → nat
| n 0     := n

| n (m+1) := add (n+1) m

2.Terms to Types (Dependent Types): This is represented in Lean
as Pi types (Π). Here's an example of a dependent type that 
pairs a natural number with a boolean that tells whether the 
number is zero:

leanCopy code
def is zero : Π (n : nat), bool
_
| 0     := true
| (n+1) := false

3.Types to Types: Lean's Type keyword is a sort, which is a type 
of other types. The keyword Type u creates a universe of 
types, and Type (u+1) creates a universe containing Type u. 
Here's how to define a type of pairs of natural numbers:

leanCopy code
def natpair : Type := nat × nat

4.Types to Terms: This is an interesting feature in Lean (and CoC 

in general), where types can compute. An example is the 
identity type, which uses this to prove properties about 
equalities.

leanCopy code
inductive eq {A : Type} (a : A) : A → Type
| refl : eq a

In this definition, the type eq a b is a proof that a and b are equal. 
The only constructor refl creates a proof that a equals itself.

5.Judgments and Inference rules: Lean’s type-checking system 
uses CoC's inference rules under the hood to determine if 
terms are of a certain type. When you enter a term, Lean 
checks it against the rules of the calculus of constructions 

and infers its type. For instance, the add function defined 
above can be checked by Lean and it will infer its type as nat →
nat → nat.

The general structure of inference rules and judgments is implicit 
in how Lean does type checking. However, the exact details of this 
are abstracted away from the user. Lean's syntax and user 
interface are designed to make it easy to use these powerful 
concepts without needing to understand all the underlying details.

Sure, I can explain these topics.

1.Curry-Howard Isomorphism in Lean: The Curry-Howard 
Isomorphism is the idea that proofs are programs, and 
propositions are types. It is named after the logicians Haskell 
Curry and William A. Howard. It is also known as the proofs-as-
programs interpretation.

In Lean, this isomorphism is represented by treating propositions as 
types, and proofs of propositions as elements of these types. For 
example, consider the following proposition and its proof:

leanCopy code
variable P : Prop -- This is the proposition.
variable p : P    -- This is a proof of P.

-- Here is a proof of "P implies P".
theorem t1 : P → P :=
begin

    assume h : P,
    exact h,
end

In this example, P is a proposition, and the type of t1 is P → P, which 
is a function type. This shows that the proof is a function. According
to the Curry-Howard isomorphism, "if P then P" corresponds to a 
function from P to P.

2.Limitations of the Calculus of Constructions in Lean: Although 
the Calculus of Constructions (CoC) is a powerful type theory, 
there are some limitations in Lean due to its focus on usability 
and readability. For instance:

• Lean supports an extension of the CoC called the Calculus of 

Inductive Constructions, which includes features like inductive
types. However, it doesn't support all types of recursive 
definitions.

• Lean uses a variant of CoC with predicative universes, which 

limits the power of certain types of impredicative definitions.
• Lean is designed to be a practical tool for theorem proving, so it
sometimes prioritizes usability or performance over theoretical
elegance. For example, it has heuristics for type class 
resolution that are not part of the original CoC.

3.Dependent Types in a Complex Proof in Lean: Dependent types 
are used in Lean to express propositions that depend on specific
values. Here's an example:

leanCopy code
-- Define a predicate that says a natural number is even.
def is even (n : nat) : Prop := ∃ m, n = 2*m

_

-- Prove that the sum of two even numbers is even.
theorem add even is even (n m : nat) (hn : is even n) (hm : is even m) : is even (n + m) :=
_

_ _

_

_

_

begin
    -- The proof of `is even n` is a pair of a natural number and a proof that n = 2*that number.
    cases hn with a ha,
    cases hm with b hb,

_

    -- Substituting these proofs into our goal reduces it to proving that 2*a + 2*b = 2*(a + b).
    rw [ha, hb, two mul, two mul, add mul],

_

_

_

    -- This is true by definition of addition and multiplication, so Lean's `refl` tactic finishes the proof.
    refl,
end

_

In this example, is even n
proposition that depends on the value of n. The proof involves 
constructing and deconstructing proofs of this dependent type.

 is a dependent type because it is a 

Here are some answers regarding Curry-Howard in Lean and 
dependent types in complex Lean proofs: How Curry-Howard works in
Lean: • The Curry-Howard isomorphism associates propositions with 
types and proofs with terms. • In Lean, which is based on the 
calculus of inductive constructions, this means: - Mathematical 
statements correspond to types. - Logical proofs correspond to 
programs (terms) that inhabit those types. • By defining a theorem 
as a type in Lean, a proof of that theorem becomes a program (term) 
of that type. • For example, the proposition P ∨ Q corresponds to 
the type P + Q in Lean, and a proof of P ∨ Q corresponds to a term 
of that type, either inl () or inr (). • This allows proving theorems 
in Lean by synthesizing terms that inhabit the theorem's 
corresponding type. Limitations of CoC in Lean: • The predicative 
variant of CoC used in Lean is less expressive than the impredicative 
version, and cannot represent all of mathematics. • Proof 
irrelevance in CoC means equal proofs correspond to equal terms, 
which is not always desirable. Lean avoids this with proof modes. • 
The computational interpretation of proofs can be inconvenient at

times in Lean. Dependent type example in Lean: • We can prove an 
implication using dependent types: ∀ (n m : N), n ≤ m → n + 1 ≤ m + 1 
variables {n m : N} hypothesis h : n ≤ m theorem add one le : n + 1 
≤ m + 1 := begin cases le trichotomy n m with hn hm hle, { exact 
le of eq (add one inj hn) }, { exact hm }, { apply le trans, { exact
add le add hle one le one }, { exact one le add hm one } } end • 
We quantify over n, m : N and use h : n ≤ m as an assumption. • We 
prove the theorem by cases on le trichotomy, using h to simplify 
_
each case. • We apply lemmas like add le add and one le one from 
the mathlib library.

The Curry-Howard isomorphism in Lean:

The Curry-Howard isomorphism, also known as the "proofs-as-
programs" and "propositions-as-types" interpretation, forms a 
foundational cornerstone in the Lean theorem prover.

In Lean, a proposition is a type, and a proof of a proposition is a term 
of that type. Thus, proving a proposition in Lean is equivalent to 
constructing a term of the corresponding type. For example, in Lean,
the proposition P → Q corresponds to a function type (P : Prop) → (Q :
Prop). A proof of P → Q is then a function that takes as input a 
proof of P and produces a proof of Q.

Here is an example in Lean that demonstrates the Curry-Howard 
isomorphism:

leanCopy code
-- Declare two propositions, P and Q
variables (P Q : Prop)

-- Construct a function that takes proofs of P and Q and produces a proof of P ∧ Q
def example proof : P → Q → P ∧ Q :=

_

begin
  intros p q,
  exact ⟨p, q⟩,
end

Limitations of the Calculus of Constructions in Lean:

While the calculus of constructions (CoC) provides a powerful 
foundation for Lean, there are some limitations:

1.CoC is based on constructive logic, which means that excluded 
middle (the law stating that P ∨ ¬P for any proposition P) and 
the axiom of choice are not assumed by default, though they 
can be added as assumptions.

2.CoC has predicative type hierarchy, which means that some 

impredicative definitions, such as the type of all sets, cannot 
be directly expressed.

3.Some advanced mathematical concepts require additional 

concepts beyond the basics provided by CoC, such as inductive 
types (which are supported in Lean) or higher inductive types 
(which are not currently supported in Lean).

Dependent types in complex proofs in Lean:

Here is an example of a more complex proof in Lean that involves 
dependent types, proving that the product of two even numbers is 
even:

leanCopy code
-- Declare the definition of an even number
def is even (n : ℕ) : Prop := ∃ m, n = 2 * m

_

_ _

-- Define the theorem
theorem product of evens is even (a b : ℕ) (h₁ : is even a) (h₂ : is even b) : is even (a * b) :=
begin
  -- Get the witness of the evenness of a and b
  cases h₁ with k hk,

_ _

_

_

_

  cases h₂ with l hl,

  -- Substitute the evenness condition into the goal
  rw [hk, hl],

  -- Prove that a*b is even by demonstrating a witness
  use 2*k*l,
  ring,
end

_

In this example, is even
depends on the value of n. The proof involves manipulating and 
constructing terms of this dependent type.

 is a dependent type as its definition 

Here are some answers regarding the calculus of constructions in 
Lean and dependent types: How Lean uses the calculus of 
constructions: • Lean is based on a variant of the calculus of 
constructions called the calculus of inductive constructions (CIC). • 
CIC extends the basic CoC with support for inductive types, which 
enables defining more mathematical structures. • Like Coq, Lean uses
the correspondence between types and propositions in CIC to support 
formalizing mathematics and proving theorems. • Lean's syntax is 
more permissive than Coq's, making CIC concepts more accessible. But 
the underlying theory is similar. • Lean still relies on the key ideas
of CoC, like dependent functions and the Curry-Howard isomorphism.
Dependent types in CoC and Lean: • Dependent types allow the type 
to depend on values. This corresponds to quantification in logic. • In 
CoC, dependent functions are written as λ(x:A).B where B can 
refer to x, making B depend on A. • In Lean, dependent functions 
are written as |x:A| => B where B can refer to x. • Inductive types
can also be dependent, where the indices of the constructors can 
depend on prior arguments. Example Lean proof: • We can prove a 
basic proposition like ∀n:N. n + 0 = n in Lean: variables (n: N) 

_

_

_

_ _

theorem add zero : n + 0 = n := begin induction n, { refl }, 
{ intros, simp [nat.add succ, nat.succ eq add one], refl } end • We
use dependent function |n:N| to quantify over naturals, define the 
theorem, then "induction n" to prove by structural induction. • We 
use refl to show equality at base case and simplify [simp] at 
inductive case. So in summary, Lean uses a variant of the calculus of 
constructions which supports inductive types and dependent types. 
This enables representing mathematical structures and proving 
theorems within Lean by mapping types to propositions and terms to 
proofs. Here are answers regarding proof irrelevance, limitations of
CoC, and a more complex dependent type proof in Lean: Proof 
irrelevance in Lean: • In the pure calculus of constructions, proof 
irrelevance means that equal proofs correspond to equal terms. 
This is known as proof identity. • However, in practice we often 
want different proofs to be considered distinct, even if they prove
the same proposition. • Lean avoids proof irrelevance using proof 
modes. Proofs are constructed in a "proof mode" and then checked 
against the proposition. • This means that different proofs of a 
proposition are considered distinct terms, avoiding proof identity. 
Other limitations of CoC: • The predicative variant used in Lean is 
less expressive than the full impredicative CoC. This limits what can
be formalized. • CoC lacks support for homotopy type theory, which 
can be useful for formalizing higher-dimensional concepts. • Proofs 
in CoC tend to be procedural and computational, while some 
mathematicians prefer a more declarative style. Complex dependent 
type proof in Lean: • We can prove a statement about Peano addition 
recursively defined on a nested dependent pair: variables (p : N × 
(N → N)) theorem add cong : (∏ (i j : N), p.2 i + p.1 = p.2 j + p.1) → p.2

_

_

_

_ _

_
_ _

i + p.2 j = p.2 (i + j) | i j h => begin revert i j h, induction p.1 with n
ih, { intros i j h, simp }, { intros i j h, cases i with i1 ih, { cases j with
j1 jh, { simp [nat.add succ, ih ih1] }, { simp [nat.add succ, 
nat.succ eq add one, ih ih1] }}, { simp [nat.succ eq add one, ih 
_
ih1] } } end • We use a dependent pair p : N × (N → N) as context, 
quantifying over i, j : N. • We prove the theorem by induction on p.1, 
then cases on i and j, applying the induction hypothesis ih at each 
step. • The nested dependent pair allows a very general definition 
that can be proved for any addition function. Here are some 
further details regarding your questions: Homotopy type theory: 
Homotopy type theory adds higher-dimensional structures and 
concepts to type theories like the calculus of constructions. Some 
ways it is useful for formalizing higher concepts: • It models 
identity types as path types, representing paths between points in a 
type. This allows modeling higher-dimensional paths and coherence. 
• Higher inductive types can be defined, which induct over higher-
dimensional spheres and circles. This allows modeling topological 
spaces. • Univalence allows equating isomorphic types, capturing the 
idea that equivalent structures have the same "shape". This models
type-theoretic equivalence as a higher-dimensional concept. 
Declarative proofs: • Declarative proofs describe "what" is being 
proved, rather than "how" the proof is constructed. They are 
often more abstract and conceptual. • For example, in sheaf 
theory, proofs typically revolve around describing properties of 
sheaves and showing they are satisfied, rather than constructing 
terms. • Category theory also features many declarative proofs, 
focused on properties and commutative diagrams rather than explicit
constructions. • Coq and Lean's tactic-based proof style is more 

procedural and constructive, focused on constructing terms. Proof 
modes in Lean: • Lean has two main proof modes: - The "proof" mode 
constructs an explicit program (term) proving a proposition. - The 
"exact" mode simply marks a proposition as proved, without 
constructing an explicit proof term. • The "exact" mode avoids proof
identity, since different "exact" proofs are considered distinct 
even if they prove the same proposition. • Proof modes allow 
switching between computational (proof) and abstract (exact) views 
of proofs, avoiding proof irrelevance. • Lean provides a "sorry" 
command to mark a proposition as proved without giving a complete 
proof. The user can fill in the proof later.

The Curry-Howard isomorphism in Lean:

The Curry-Howard isomorphism, also known as the "proofs-as-
programs" and "propositions-as-types" interpretation, forms a 
foundational cornerstone in the Lean theorem prover.

In Lean, a proposition is a type, and a proof of a proposition is a term 
of that type. Thus, proving a proposition in Lean is equivalent to 
constructing a term of the corresponding type. For example, in Lean,
the proposition P → Q corresponds to a function type (P : Prop) → (Q :
Prop). A proof of P → Q is then a function that takes as input a 
proof of P and produces a proof of Q.

Here is an example in Lean that demonstrates the Curry-Howard 
isomorphism:

leanCopy code
-- Declare two propositions, P and Q
variables (P Q : Prop)

_

-- Construct a function that takes proofs of P and Q and produces a proof of P ∧ Q
def example proof : P → Q → P ∧ Q :=
begin
  intros p q,
  exact ⟨p, q⟩,
end

Limitations of the Calculus of Constructions in Lean:

While the calculus of constructions (CoC) provides a powerful 
foundation for Lean, there are some limitations:

1.CoC is based on constructive logic, which means that excluded 
middle (the law stating that P ∨ ¬P for any proposition P) and 
the axiom of choice are not assumed by default, though they 
can be added as assumptions.

2.CoC has predicative type hierarchy, which means that some 

impredicative definitions, such as the type of all sets, cannot 
be directly expressed.

3.Some advanced mathematical concepts require additional 

concepts beyond the basics provided by CoC, such as inductive 
types (which are supported in Lean) or higher inductive types 
(which are not currently supported in Lean).

Dependent types in complex proofs in Lean:

Here is an example of a more complex proof in Lean that involves 
dependent types, proving that the product of two even numbers is 
even:

leanCopy code
-- Declare the definition of an even number
def is even (n : ℕ) : Prop := ∃ m, n = 2 * m

_

-- Define the theorem
theorem product of evens is even (a b : ℕ) (h₁ : is even a) (h₂ : is even b) : is even (a * b) :=

  rw [hk, hl],

  -- Prove that a*b is even by demonstrating a witness
  use 2*k*l,
  ring,
end

_

In this example, is even
depends on the value of n. The proof involves manipulating and 
constructing terms of this dependent type.

 is a dependent type as its definition 

Here are examples of higher inductive types, univalence and more 
declarative proofs: Higher inductive type example: • A circle can be 
defined as a higher inductive type in homotopy type theory with two 
constructors: Inductive circle : Type := | base : circle | loop : base =
base. • The base point constructor has inductive degree 0, while the
loop constructor has degree 1, representing a loop. • This definition 
inducts over both points (degree 0) and paths between points 
(degree 1), capturing the intuitive structure of a circle. Univalence
and isomorphism: • Univalence states that isomorphic types (types 
related by an isomorphism) are equal, up to a higher equivalenc. • 
Formally, if there is an isomorphism f : A ≃ B between types A and 
B, then univalence implies A = B up to a higher homotopy. • This 
means that isomorphic structures, which are essentially "the same", 
can be treated as literally equal types in homotopy type theory. 
More declarative proofs: • In category theory, many proofs involve 
showing that certain diagrams commute, without explicitly 
constructing the commuting homomorphisms. • Proofs in sheaf theory 
often involve verifying the sheaf axioms for a given presheaf, 

rather than constructing explicit terms. • In algebraic topology, 
proofs frequently describe properties of topological spaces and 
mappings between them, without giving explicit constructions. • In 
geometry, proofs often rely on describing properties of geometric 
figures and transformations, rather than constructing terms. 
Overall, declarative proofs tend to focus on properties, 
descriptions and diagrams, rather than explicit constructions. They 
provide a more conceptual and abstract view of proofs, which CoC-
based systems like Coq and Lean lack due to their constructive 
nature. Homotopy type theory helps bridge this gap.

The Curry-Howard Isomorphism in Lean:

The Curry-Howard isomorphism, also known as propositions-as-types,
is a correspondence between logic and computation that is deeply 
ingrained in Lean. It connects systems of formal logic with 
computational calculi. For example, logical conjunction (AND) 
corresponds to product types (pairs), logical disjunction (OR) 
corresponds to sum types (either type), and logical implication (→) 
corresponds to function types.

This can be seen directly in Lean. For example, a proof of the 
logical implication P → Q is a function that takes an argument of type
P and returns a result of type Q. This function is the evidence 
that if P is true, then Q must also be true.

leanCopy code
variables P Q : Prop

-- This is a function type, but also represents the logical implication P → Q
def implies (p : P) : Q :=
...

Limitations of Calculus of Constructions in Lean:

1. Predicativity: Lean is built on a version of the Calculus of 

Constructions that includes inductive types and is predicative. 
This means there are restrictions on how one type can depend 
on another, which can limit the kinds of mathematics that can 
be formalized in Lean.

2.Impredicative Definitions: The calculus of constructions 

doesn't easily allow certain impredicative definitions, which are
definitions where a set is defined by quantifying over a domain 
that includes the set itself.

3.Large-scale structure: While Lean has strong support for 

defining individual constructions and proving properties about 
them, it can sometimes be challenging to manage and reason 
about the large-scale structure of a mathematical field.

Dependent Types in Complex Proofs:

Dependent types are a crucial part of Lean, enabling the 
formalization of complex mathematical statements. They allow the 
types of data to depend on the values of other data, and this makes
them powerful for conducting complex proofs.

Here is an example of a proof in Lean that uses dependent types:

leanCopy code
import data.set

-- Define the notion of an injective function
def injective {X Y : Type} (f : X → Y) := ∀ {x1 x2 : X}, f x1 = f x2 → x1 = x2

_

-- Prove that the preimage of an injective function respects set inclusion
theorem preimage injective {X Y : Type} {f : X → Y} (hf : injective f) :
  ∀ {s t : set Y}, s ⊆ t → f ⁻¹' s ⊆ f ⁻¹' t
| s t hst x hx :=
begin

  unfold set.preimage at hx,
  have : f x ∈ t, from hst hx,
  exact this
end

In this proof, we use dependent types to state and prove a property
about injective functions and their preimages. We use Lean's set 
theory library to work with sets and set inclusion, and we use 
Lean's support for dependent types to define the notion of an 
injective function in a way that the domain and codomain can be any 
types.

A list of all of the topics we've discussed.
ChatGPT

Certainly, here is a summary of the topics we've discussed:

1.Introduction to Lean and Coq: We discussed the basics of Lean 

and Coq, both of which are interactive theorem proving systems 
and programming languages. They are used for formalizing 
mathematics and verifying software and hardware.

2.Calculus of Constructions (CoC): We delved into the theory 
behind Lean and Coq, which is primarily the calculus of 
constructions. This is a type theory that combines programming 
and logic, allowing propositions and proofs to be treated as 
types and programs, respectively.

3.Curry-Howard Isomorphism in Lean: We explored how the Curry-
Howard isomorphism, the correspondence between systems of 
formal logic and computational calculi, works in Lean. The 
isomorphism manifests as the deep connection between types 
and propositions in Lean.

4.Limitations of CoC in Lean: We covered some of the limitations of
the calculus of constructions in Lean, including issues with 
predicativity, impredicative definitions, and large-scale 
structural reasoning.

5.Dependent Types in Complex Proofs in Lean: We discussed the 

use of dependent types in Lean for conducting complex 
mathematical proofs. We also walked through an example of a 
complex proof in Lean that uses dependent types.

6.Higher Inductive Types and Univalence: We discussed concepts 
from homotopy type theory such as higher inductive types and 
the principle of univalence. We talked about how they add 
higher-dimensional structures and concepts to type theories 
like CoC, but are not natively supported in Lean.

7.Declarative Proofs: We compared the procedural and 

computational proofs typical in CoC-based systems like Lean to 
more declarative styles often preferred by mathematicians in 
fields like sheaf theory, category theory, and algebraic 
topology.

8.Proof Irrelevance and Proof Modes in Lean: We touched on the 
concept of proof irrelevance in type theories and how Lean's 
proof modes allow different proofs of the same proposition to 
be considered distinct, avoiding unwanted proof identities.

All these topics revolve around the use of Lean and Coq as tools 
for formal reasoning, demonstrating the intricate and powerful 

nature of modern type theories in bridging the gap between 
mathematics and computation.

Connections between the topics. 
ChatGPT

Sure, the various topics we've discussed are interconnected and 
build on each other. Here are the main connections:

1.Lean, Coq, and the Calculus of Constructions (CoC): Lean and Coq 

are both interactive theorem provers and programming 
languages that fundamentally rely on CoC as their theoretical 
basis. The concepts of types and terms in CoC are essential to 
understand how Lean and Coq handle mathematical reasoning.

2.Curry-Howard Isomorphism and CoC: The Curry-Howard 

isomorphism, which establishes a correspondence between logic 
and computation, is a foundational concept in CoC. It's what 
allows Lean and Coq to treat propositions as types and proofs as 
programs, a central idea in these systems.

3.Dependent Types and CoC: The concept of dependent types, 
where types can depend on values, is a critical component of 
CoC. It allows more sophisticated and expressive forms of 
reasoning in Lean and Coq, enabling us to capture complex 
mathematical concepts and proofs.

4.Limitations of CoC and Higher Inductive Types/Univalence: The 
limitations of CoC discussed, such as the lack of support for 
homotopy type theory concepts like higher inductive types and 
univalence, connect to the desire for more expressive formal 

systems. These systems could more naturally handle abstract 
mathematical structures and proofs, which is a goal of homotopy
type theory.

5.Declarative Proofs and CoC: The preference for more 

declarative proof styles in some mathematical areas connects to
the limitations of CoC and systems like Lean and Coq. These 
systems primarily focus on procedural and computational 
proofs, which can sometimes be less intuitive or natural for 
certain mathematical areas.

6.Proof Irrelevance and Curry-Howard Isomorphism: Proof 
irrelevance relates to the Curry-Howard isomorphism by 
examining what it means for two proofs to be considered "the 
same." Lean's approach of differentiating proofs through proof
modes connects back to the isomorphism by providing flexibility 
in how we interpret it, allowing us to maintain proof identity or
not, as needed.

In summary, these topics all center around the quest to construct 
effective formal systems for mathematics and computation. The 
calculus of constructions, Lean, Coq, and the Curry-Howard 
isomorphism lay the foundation for this effort, while the 
exploration of dependent types, declarative proofs, proof 
irrelevance, and homotopy type theory illustrate ongoing challenges
and extensions to this foundational work.

A final summary.
ChatGPT

We've had a deep dive into the worlds of formal logic, proof 
systems, and type theory, specifically focusing on the theorem 
prover Lean, and how it uses the Calculus of Constructions (CoC), a 
foundational theory in computer science. Here is a final summary of
the key points we've discussed:

1.Lean and Coq: Both are powerful interactive theorem provers 

based on type theory, which provide formal systems for 
mathematics and computation. Lean is noted for its permissive 
syntax, making it more accessible than Coq for newcomers.

2.Calculus of Constructions (CoC): A core type theory that 

underpins both Lean and Coq, enabling formal reasoning about 
mathematical theorems and computational algorithms.

3.Curry-Howard Isomorphism: This principle maps mathematical 
proofs to computational programs, providing the basis for 
reasoning within Lean and Coq. It is essentially the idea that 
"propositions are types, and proofs are programs."

4.Dependent Types: A key feature of CoC that allows types to 
depend on values, enabling more sophisticated mathematical 
structures and proofs to be modeled within Lean and Coq.

5.Proof Irrelevance and Proof Modes: Proof irrelevance relates 
to whether different proofs of the same proposition should be
considered identical or distinct. Lean handles this using proof 
modes, enabling different proofs of the same proposition to be 
treated as distinct.

6.Limitations of CoC and Extensions: CoC, particularly the variant 
used in Lean, has certain limitations, including lack of support 
for homotopy type theory and more declarative proofs. These 
limitations highlight the ongoing efforts in the field to make 
formal systems more expressive and natural for different 
mathematical domains.

7.Homotopy Type Theory: This advanced theory extends type 

theory with concepts like higher inductive types and 
univalence, enabling more abstract and higher-dimensional 
mathematical structures to be modeled.

The discussion reflects ongoing research and development in the 
field of type theory and formal systems, as researchers and 
practitioners continue to refine and extend these tools to better
