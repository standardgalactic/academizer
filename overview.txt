Processing 02 -Authorial Minds： Possession vs Composition.txt
1. **Mind Composition vs. Mind Imposition**: Darin Stevenson discusses the idea that we often think we have a mind that acts upon us, but in reality, we tend to become the minds we think we're supposed to have, which can be either creative or passive, and often influenced by societal expectations.

2. **Social Context and Attention**: He emphasizes the importance of context in shaping our behavior and thoughts. Most contexts are compromised by predatory and mimetic behaviors, and we need to create a new context where we can be meaningfully human together.

3. **Recognizing Concerns and Motives**: Stevenson explains that our concerns shape our motives, which then lead to the kind of mind we have. This process is usually unconscious and leads to us adopting various roles or mindsets without question.

4. **Composing Minds**: He suggests that instead of conforming to societal projections of minds, we should learn to compose our own minds in a way that empowers and encourages us, especially when dealing with past events or future predictions.

5. **Learning from Nature**: Stevenson uses the example of birds during the duck moon to illustrate the importance of being present and attentive to the here and now. He encourages us to learn from nature's unencumbered existence, focusing on the living context we are part of, and to remember our potential for excellence.

6. **Invitation for Collective Growth**: He invites the audience to join him in recognizing and composing minds that contribute to a collective growth, moving towards empowerment and creativity rather than being dictated by fear or past grievances.

7. **Parting Thoughts**: Stevenson concludes with a note on the importance of staying grounded in the present moment and learning from nature's example, encouraging us to remember ourselves, each other, and our potential for excellence. He signs off, inviting listeners to reflect on these ideas.

8. **Final Notes**: He concludes by encouraging people to move towards a more interconnected and supportive way of life, emphasizing the importance of relationships and community over individual success and material wealth.


Processing 07 - Sol Invictus： The Moon ： Cain and Abel. Slayer and Mist..txt
1. **The Metaphorical Snake and Ring**: Darin Stevenson uses a metaphor to describe the dynamic between those who assert their individual power without regard for consensus or co-being (the "snakes" or slayers) and those who embody a more harmonious, collective intelligence (the "rings" or pods of dolphins). He emphasizes that true intelligence comes from co-em petition—a consensus of all beings across time and space.

2. **Co-em Petition**: This concept represents the collective wisdom of all living entities, including mothers, children, animals, insects, and even inanimate environments. It is a form of governance or decision-making that transcends individual will and seeks harmony and mutual respect among all beings.

3. **The Water Child and the Fire Child**: Darin speaks of two natures within individuals—one associated with water (feminine, delicate intelligence) and one associated with fire (masculine, assertive power). He notes that some people possess both natures and cautions against judging or dismissing them, as they can embody either aspect.

4. **Respect for All Natures**: He advises respect and gentleness towards each other, recognizing the dual nature within every person. He encourages a mutual respect that transcends gender and personal boundaries, advocating for a society that values care and intelligence above conflict and division.

 Darin Stevenson discusses the concept of pod-based communities as a means to enhance human intelligence and connectivity, suggesting that this approach can lead to greater fulfillment and a more harmonious existence. He emphasizes the importance of our ecosystems in shaping our identity and warns against the dangers of turning into "dumber, more combative, more paranoid" beings if we harm our environment.

Stevenson suggests that pod members engage in constant intimacy to resolve conflicts for the betterment of all involved, which would eliminate phony combat and lead to authentic displays of intelligence and emotion. He argues that with this moral and ethical foundation within communities, humans can achieve a level of empowerment to be and do anything.

He advocates for learning from our disagreements and using them as opportunities to grow collectively in intelligence. He criticizes the tendency to complain without offering solutions and to blame others or problems without fostering unity. Stevenson calls for intelligent, connected dialogue among people to address the myriad issues facing society, including ecological, economic, ideological, and political challenges.

He suggests that by adopting a more collaborative and solution-oriented approach, we can restore our humanity, democracy, and liberation. Stevenson acknowledges the influence of figures like Edward Snowden and Julian Assange in revealing alternative directions for society and calls for unity in discovery rather than adherence to ideologies.

He concludes with a festive note, wishing Merry Christmas and encouraging listeners to connect with him through his website or blog. He emphasizes the potential for human intelligence to rise beyond its current state if we embrace this collaborative vision.

He believes that this approach will lead to a more harmonious existence on Earth, where technology serves humanity rather than the other way around.


Processing 13 - The Secret of Our Cultural Diseases： LH Dominance..txt
1. **Hemispheric Lateralization**: Darin Stevenson discusses the dichotomy between the right and left hemispheres of the brain, with a focus on how fear and separation can shift cognitive processes towards a more fear-based, separated, and analytical state (left hemisphere dominant), which can lead to environmental degradation and loss of connection with the natural world.

2. **Communion Intelligence**: He emphasizes the importance of recognizing the communion intelligence that exists when both hemispheres are in balance, a state where there is no separation between beings, and where intelligence is experienced directly without the need for theories or artifacts.

3. **Cultural Problems**: Stevenson associates the current cultural problems, including human rights issues and environmental degradation, with a left hemisphere-dominant paradigm that prioritizes fear, anxiety, and deceit.

4. **Evolutionary Phase**: He suggests that understanding the dynamics between the two brain hemispheres can lead humanity into a new evolutionary phase where we can solve our problems and reconnect with the communion intelligence.

5. **Unity of Intelligence**: Stevenson points out that the right hemisphere, which is connected to the heart and gut, represents a more ancient and fundamental form of intelligence compared to the left hemisphere, which he metaphorically equates to the difference between a person and a simple tool like a pencil.

6. **The Devil as Metaphor**: He uses the concept of the devil as a metaphor for the left hemisphere's tendency to create fear and division, suggesting that the greatest trick the left hemisphere plays is convincing us it exists as a literal entity.

7. **Historical References**: Stevenson references biblical stories, such as Cain and Abel and the crucifixion of Christ, as allegories for the separation from our deeper intelligence and the potential for redemption and reconnection.

8. **Personal Note**: He concludes by sharing a personal note about being born on Christmas and expressing his excitement to continue learning about these concepts with others.

In essence, Stevenson is advocating for a holistic understanding of our cognitive processes and the need to balance the left and right hemispheres to restore our connection with the natural world and each other, leading to a more harmonious existence.


Processing 14 - Beyond science, religion, and expertise： Unknowing together..txt

He emphasizes that these children can teach us more about true perception and understanding than any other source.

2. **Play with the Toy**: Stevenson suggests using spirituality as a toy for exploration and growth, not as a rigid doctrine or dogma. We should draw pictures with it, test and link our ideas, and play together in a way that fosters mutual growth and understanding.

3. **Support Each Other**: The focus should be on supporting and uplifting each other and our children, rather than tearing each other down for cultural or personal reasons. Stevenson offers his work for free, asking only for it to be shared and discussed widely.

4. **Avoid Becoming Sharks**: He uses the analogy of remoras (shark-associated cleaner fish) and whales to illustrate how those with enlightened guidance can influence and purge negativity from their environment, much like whales can control sharks with their size and power.

5. **Reject False Promises**: Stevenson points out that many institutions have misled humanity by draining our values of justice, beauty, love, and intelligence, and then selling us back toys that are detrimental to our well-being. It's time to reject these false promises and focus on genuine human connection and potential.

6. **Stop Converting**: He urges people to stop trying to convert others to their beliefs or paradigms, whether it be religious, spiritual, or otherwise. Instead, we should aim to understand and become what we truly are, rather than what we're told to be by others.

7. **Learn and Grow Together**: Stevenson invites everyone to join him in moving beyond the current limitations of human understanding and to explore the vast potential of consciousness together.

In essence, Darin Stevenson is advocating for a shift from competition and control to collaboration and mutual growth, using spirituality as a tool for personal and collective evolution rather than a means to an end or a source of division.


Processing 15 - What’s Going On Around Here？.txt
1. **The Centrality of the Sun**: Darin Stevenson emphasizes that everything on Earth, including human history, thought, and life, depends on the sun. Without the sun, all these aspects would cease to exist because time itself might not function as we know it.

2. **Metaphysical Perspective**: He suggests a metaphysical viewpoint where one considers that everything around us, including ourselves, is an expression or manifestation of the sun's presence and influence.

3. **Complex Language and Meronymic Origin**: Stevenson points out that our language and perception often lead us to think there are separations between things, but in reality, we are all part of a continuum originating from the same source—in this case, the sun.

4. **The Sun as a Non-Thing**: He argues that the sun cannot be categorized as an object or 'thing' because it is the foundation from which all categories and things derive. This includes minds, categories, beings, and matter.

5. **The Nature of Derivation**: Stevenson suggests that humanity, along with our ideas and descriptions, is a derivative of the sun's influence, much like individual hairs are derivatives of a single organ—in this case, the sun itself.

6. **A Possible Conception of God**: He posits that if beings are derivatives of the sun, then perhaps the sun could be conceptualized as akin to a deity, as there is no other category that fits what the sun represents in terms of its influence and role in the cosmos.

7. **Encouragement for Contemplation**: Stevenson encourages listeners to contemplate the significance of the sun and to explore this relationship further, suggesting that the reality of our existence is far more fascinating than our current scientific, religious, or philosophical understandings might imply.

In summary, Darin Stevenson's message is a call to action for people to understand and directly engage with the natural world, to recognize the damage done by human cultures, and to take immediate and tangible steps to preserve the Earth's ecosystems for the sake of all life, including humanity.


Processing 18 - False Collectives： Fake Activism and Social Media.txt
1. **Facebook's Algorithmic Bias**: Darin Stevenson discusses how Facebook's algorithms tend to prioritize content that aligns with the interests of Facebook itself, the GOP, and Fox News in the newsfeed. This can lead to an echo chamber where users are exposed primarily to viewpoints that support these entities, potentially influencing public opinion and generating revenue for them.

2. **Content Filtering**: The algorithms filter content based on user interactions (likes, shares, comments), which means that pages with important content may be hidden from most users if their posts don't generate enough interaction. This can result in crucial information being overlooked or undervalued by the platform.

3. **Misinformation and Misguidance**: Stevenson points out that some pages on Facebook spread misinformation or promote agendas that are not in line with the truth, which can be detrimental to informed discourse and public understanding of important issues.

4. **The Role of Users**: He emphasizes the importance of users' actions in protesting against these practices, engaging in dialogue, and creating community to harness the power of collective agreement for positive change.

5. **Authentic Collectives on Facebook**: Stevenson highlights the Sea Shepherd Conservation Society as an example of a legitimate collective that uses Facebook to support a noble cause—protecting marine life and the environment. He encourages users to support such groups, add their own intelligence, and cooperate with them to make a real-world impact.

6. **Call to Action**: He invites listeners to join him in understanding the mechanisms of social media platforms, to collaborate for common goals, and to take action to influence the future of life on Earth positively. He concludes by expressing gratitude for the audience's participation and engagement with these issues.


Processing 19 - Our Myth of the Nuclear Family is Broken.txt
 Darin Stevenson is discussing the challenges and stresses that individuals may face when cast into roles they are unable to fulfill due to their upbringing or environment, particularly focusing on the difficulties faced by parents who are themselves struggling. He emphasizes that many people had childhoods marked by parental suffering and a lack of understanding of what was happening, which can lead to acting out in confusing and agonizing ways.

He criticizes the idea of using legal or professional means to force individuals into specific roles, such as being a parent, arguing that this is counterproductive and can result in illness. Stevenson suggests that the cultural expectation for fathers to be present and involved in raising their children is unrealistic and not reflective of our true nature as a species.

He advocates for understanding and compassion for both parents and children who have suffered due to these impossible expectations, and he encourages the formation of supportive communities or "pods" that can provide a healthier environment for raising children and fostering intelligence, learning, and emotional well-being.

Stevenson invites viewers to engage in conversation, share their experiences, and learn together how to create cultures that allow individuals to thrive, both healing from past wounds and nurturing future generations effectively. He concludes by encouraging viewers to connect with him on social media platforms like Facebook and YouTube for further dialogue and collaboration.


Processing 20 - nembo 71： What Justice Isn’t.txt
1. **Analogy between the immune system and legal/justice systems**: Darin Stevenson uses the analogy of macrophages in the immune system to illustrate how our current legal and justice systems are flawed. Macrophages are cells that engulf pathogens, but they also play a role in healing by signaling for help from the immune system and then dying as part of the resolution process. In contrast, our legal system often focuses on punishment without resolving underlying issues, which is not conducive to healing or learning.

2. **Social Responsibility**: He emphasizes that as members of society, we all financially and morally support the legal and justice systems, making us complicit in their actions, including court proceedings, prison operations, and military engagements.

3. **Flawed Systems**: Stevenson argues that our current systems are like a mechanism that would explode if an individual were to be treated as a macrophage would be—ineffectively and disastrously. These systems do not work even once effectively because they are fundamentally flawed.

4. **Change and Responsibility**: He suggests that the first step toward improvement is to notice the flaws in our systems and stop perpetuating them. We must create a context where we can understand and address these issues intelligently, rather than punishing individuals who reflect the problems of their environment.

5. **Justice and Social Systems**: Stevenson asserts that true justice cannot be achieved by placing the burden of societal issues on individuals, as these problems originate from larger social and cultural contexts. A just society would recognize this and work to adjust how humans interact and live together to prevent such issues from arising in the first place.

6. **Cultural Change**: He calls for a culture that can indict itself, recognizing the sources of problems within our systems and adapting accordingly. The goal should be to analyze and resolve the root causes of social issues rather than merely punishing individuals.

1. **Nuclear Family Myth**: Darin Stevenson discusses how the idealized nuclear family is often unattainable or unhealthy for many due to personal and environmental challenges, particularly highlighting the struggles of parents who are themselves in need of support and understanding.

1. **Analogía entre el sistema inmunológico y los sistemas jurídicos y de justicia**: Darin Stevenson utiliza la analogía de los macrófagos del sistema inmunológico para explicar las deficiencias de nuestros sistemas legales y de justicia. En este analogo, los macrófagos engullan patógenos pero también desempeñan un papel en la curación al enviar señales y morir eventualmente como parte del proceso de resolución. En contraste, nuestros sistemas jurídicos se centran en el castigo sin resolver las raíces de los problemas.

2. **Responsabilidad social**: Stevenson argumenta que todos contribuimos a los sistemas legales y de justicia como sociedad, y por lo tanto, compartimos la responsabilidad de sus resultados.

3. **Sistemas defectuosos**: Según Stevenson, nuestros sistemas actuales son inherentemente defectuosos porque operan de manera ineficiente y dañina, similar a cómo se trataría a un macrófago ineficazmente.

4. **Cambio y responsabilidad**: Stevenson sugiere que el primer paso hacia la mejora es reconocer las defectuosas características de estos sistemas y detenernos de perpetuar estas falencias. Deberíamos abordar inteligentemente los problemas sociales en lugar de simplemente castigar a los individuos que los reflejan.
