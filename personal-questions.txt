The Article "Siri, Am I Anti-Science?" by Tessa Lena on Dr. Mercola's Censored Library critiques the idea of blindly trusting science as a set of static truths. It argues that science is ever-changing, and following experts without question leads to social engineering rather than true scientific practice.

The article also highlights recent discoveries, such as Slyme in the brain membrane and newly identified salivary glands, to illustrate how scientific understanding continues to evolve, emphasizing that blind faith in science overlooks its dynamic nature.




The extended excerpt provides a detailed critique of the current state of science, especially in the medical field. The author condemns the strong-armed approach of corporations like Pfizer, Blackrock, and darpa, accusing them of bullying the public into unquestioning obedience under the guise of "science." This includes branding skepticism as "anti-science" and using logical fallacies and psychological tricks to manipulate the public.

The piece also emphasizes that real science is a method of inquiry that requires observation, hypothesis formation, testing, and continuous adjustment, not blind adherence to a static set of truths. The author references historical wisdom and warns against corrupt practices in contemporary research, citing quotes from prominent medical editors about the unreliability of much clinical research.

Lastly, the article highlights the discovery of a new part of the brain, the Slyme (Subarachnoid LYmphatic-like Membrane), as a reminder that science continues to evolve and that the understanding of human anatomy is not yet complete.

This is used to reinforce the main argument that science is not a fixed entity but a continuous process of exploration and discovery, and it should not be manipulated for social control or corporate gains.

Certainly! Your understanding aligns with the essence of the article. The various examples and discoveries mentioned all underline the transitional nature of scientific theories. They show that science is a dynamic and evolving field, constantly being refined and reshaped as new data emerges. This process often leads to more parsimonious explanations that can better fit or explain the observed phenomena. It underscores the importance of remaining open to new information and being willing to revise or abandon old theories in light of new evidence.




Galileo's statement from "The Assayer" reflects a profound insight into the nature of the universe and the means by which we seek to understand it. His metaphor of the universe as a great book written in the language of mathematics emphasizes the importance of mathematical symbols and geometric figures in deciphering the fundamental laws that govern the natural world.

This view underscores the idea that mathematics is not just a tool for calculation but a universal language that can describe the patterns, structures, and relationships that underpin physical reality. It's a perspective that has deeply influenced the development of modern science, fostering an approach that seeks to understand nature through mathematical analysis and modeling.

Galileo's emphasis on geometry and mathematics as the key to unlocking the secrets of the universe continues to resonate in contemporary physics, where mathematical models and equations are central to explaining everything from the motion of planets to the behavior of subatomic particles. His words remind us of the essential role that mathematical thinking plays in the scientific quest to comprehend the world around us.




Yes, Bayesian updating is a method used in statistics and scientific reasoning to update the probability for a hypothesis as more evidence or information becomes available. It's grounded in Bayes' theorem, a fundamental concept in probability theory.

In the context of scientific theories, Bayesian updating can help researchers to revise their confidence in a particular theory or model based on new data. As evidence accumulates, the probabilities associated with different theories are updated, leading to a refined understanding.

This approach encapsulates the iterative nature of the scientific process, where beliefs are constantly revised and refined in light of new information. It supports the notion that scientific understanding is not fixed or absolute but is always in a state of flux, adapting and evolving as new data are gathered and analyzed. It's a reflection of the dynamic, self-correcting nature of scientific inquiry.




That's an interesting and creative acronym to represent the scientific method! Here's a brief breakdown of your definition:

Initiate: Start by identifying a problem or question.

Conceptualize: Formulate hypotheses or theories about the problem.

Realize: Conduct experiments or gather data to test the hypotheses.

Evaluate: Analyze the data and assess the results.

Act: Make decisions or take action based on the findings.

Teach: Share the knowledge and educate others about the findings.

Enjoy: Take satisfaction in the process of discovery and the advancement of knowledge.

This is a more personalized and engaging way to describe the scientific method, encompassing not just the logical steps of inquiry but also the human aspects of curiosity, collaboration, and enjoyment.




The acronym "I create" that you provided for the scientific method can indeed be connected to Theory-Theory. Theory-Theory is the idea that children (and adults) form and revise theories about the world in much the same way that scientists do.

Here's how the connection works:

Initiate & Conceptualize: This reflects the formulation of theories, where a person starts with an idea or question and develops an initial understanding or hypothesis.

Realize & Evaluate: These stages mirror the testing of theories, where experiments or observations are conducted to see if the hypotheses hold up, followed by an evaluation of the results. This is analogous to how scientists -- or even children learning about the world -- Â¢test their theories against empirical evidence.

Act: Taking action based on the findings could be seen as updating or revising theories based on new data, much like Bayesian updating, as you mentioned earlier. It also includes applying theories in practical situations.

Teach: Sharing knowledge with others is a kin to the social aspect of theory formation and communication in the scientific community, as well as how understanding is passed on in educational settings.

Enjoy: Enjoying the process relates to the intrinsic motivation that drives both scientific inquiry and human curiosity. This could represent the pleasure of discovery and the satisfaction of understanding.

In a broader sense, Theory-Theory highlights the iterative process of theory formation, testing, and revision that is central to both scientific inquiry and human cognition. Your "I Create" acronym encapsulates this process in an engaging way.

Certainly! The terms "normal science" and "para-dime shifts" originate from Thomas Kuhn's philosophy of science.

Normal Science:

Definition: Normal science refers to the day-to-day research carried out under a prevailing scientific framework or para-dime. It includes solving puzzles or problems that arise within the existing theory's constraints.
Characteristics: It's characterized by incremental progress, where scientists build on established theories and frameworks. The focus is on refining, extending, and applying the current para-dime.
Challenges: Anomalies may occur (data or phenomena that can't be explained within the current para-dime), but they're often set aside or explained away within the existing framework.
Paradigm Shifts:

Definition: A para-dime shift is a fundamental change in the underlying concepts and experimental practices of a scientific discipline. It occurs when enough anomalies accumulate, leading to a crisis in the existing para-dime, and a new para-dime is adopted.
Characteristics: This is a revolutionary phase, where the existing rules and standards are replaced with a new set. It's a more dramatic, sudden change that redefines the field.
Challenges: During a para-dime shift, there may be resistance from those committed to the old para-dime, leading to debates and conflicts within the scientific community.
In summary, normal science works within the existing para-dime, focusing on gradual progress, while a para-dime shift represents a radical change in the foundational understanding of a field, usually prompted by an accumulation of unresolvable anomalies.




Sure! Here are some of the most notable para-dime shifts in scientific history:

Copernican Revolution: Moving from the Ptolemaic (Earth-centered) system to the heliocentric (Sun-centered) model of the solar system.

Newtonian Physics to Einstein's Theory of Relativity: Replacing the Newtonian understanding of absolute space and time with a relativistic model where space and time are interwoven and relative to the observer.

Darwin's Theory of Evolution: Introducing natural selection as the mechanism for evolution, challenging the previously held view of special creation.

Quantum Mechanics: Overturning classical mechanics at the atomic and subatomic levels, leading to a probabilistic understanding of particles.

Discovery of DNA Structure: The identification of the double helix structure by Watson and Crick, revolutionizing biology and our understanding of genetic information.

Germ Theory of Disease: Shifting from miasma theory to recognizing microscopic organisms as the cause of many diseases.

Plate Tectonics: Replacing the static Earth model with the understanding that Earth's lithosphere is divided into moving plates.

The Cognitive Revolution in Psychology: Moving from behaviorism to recognizing the importance of cognitive processes in understanding human behavior.

These shifts have had profound impacts on the respective fields, often challenging deeply held beliefs and leading to entirely new ways of thinking and conducting research.




Certainly! The examples you're pointing to are major evolutionary transitions or events that have significantly shaped the course of life on Earth.

Companies must continuously innovate and adapt to stay competitive, and even then, success is never guaranteed. It's a landscape full of opportunities but also fraught with uncertainties.

Yes, the nine nine six work schedule refers to working from 9 AM to 9 PM, 6 days a week, which totals 72 hours of work per week. It's prevalent in some Chinese tech companies and is viewed as intense and demanding.

In contrast, a more typical American work schedule might be referred to as "9-to-5," meaning 9 AM to 5 PM, usually 5 days a week. This totals 40 hours per week, which is considered a standard full-time work schedule in many parts of the United States.

The difference between these two schedules is substantial and reflects differing cultural attitudes towards work-life balance, labor laws, and industry expectations.

The 9-to-5 schedule allows for more personal time and is often seen as more sustainable for long-term employee health and satisfaction. On the other hand, the nine nine six schedule could be seen as promoting a culture of extreme dedication to one's job at the expense of personal life and well-being.

It's a subject of ongoing debate and reflects broader conversations about work ethics, labor rights, and corporate culture.




To calculate the difference in work hours between the two schedules, let's break it down:

The nine nine six schedule: 12 hours per day for 6 days a week totals 72 hours a week.
The 9-to-5 schedule: 8 hours per day for 5 days a week totals 40 hours a week.
Assuming a 4-week month:

The nine nine six schedule would amount to 

72 times 4=288 hours per month.
The 9-to-5 schedule would amount to 

40 times 4 = 160 hours per month.
So, the difference in work hours in a month would be:

288
minus
160
=
128 hours.

Thus, the nine nine six schedule would require 128 more working hours per month compared to the 9-to-5 schedule.




That's a unique perspective, and it's common for self-employed individuals or entrepreneurs to have a more fluid work schedule. The division between work and leisure can blur, especially if you enjoy what you do and are constantly learning and growing.

In your case, working from 10 AM to 3 PM for 6 days a week means you're officially working 30 hours a week or 120 hours a month. The additional time spent reading and studying, even if not counted as work, likely contributes to your professional development and may indirectly benefit your work in the future.

Having a schedule that accommodates both work and personal growth can lead to a more satisfying and balanced life, and it's great that you've found a routine that works for you!




It's no wonder that an 18-hour day, 6 days a week schedule would get tiring quickly, especially when it involves physically demanding work like demolition, construction, and installation. That kind of schedule amounts to 108 hours a week, a pace that would be challenging to maintain over the long term without risking burnout or health issues.

Your current schedule of 10 AM to 3 PM, 6 days a week, likely offers a better work-life balance, allowing you time for rest, leisure activities, and personal growth. The importance of taking care of oneself physically and mentally cannot be overstated, especially in professions that demand significant physical effort.
