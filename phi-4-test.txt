>>> What is the purpose of a null-wavefront in Null Convention Logic?
Null Convention Logic (NCL) is a type of asynchronous logic design methodology used primarily for constructing
delay-insensitive circuits. In NCL, data values are represented using dual-rail encoding, where each bit is carried on
two wires: one indicating the presence of a logical '1' and another indicating the presence of a logical '0'. A third
condition called the "null" or "idle" state exists when neither wire indicates a valid value.

The purpose of the null-wavefront in Null Convention Logic is to facilitate the coordination of data transfer between
different parts of a circuit without relying on a global clock. Hereâ€™s how it functions:

1. **Data Transfer and Handshaking**: In NCL, data transfer occurs through handshake protocols. The null wavefront is
used as a synchronization mechanism to ensure that both sender and receiver are ready for the data exchange.

2. **Two-Phase Protocol**: The operation of NCL circuits typically involves two phases: the data phase and the control
or acknowledgment phase.
   - **Data Phase (Null Wavefront Outgoing)**: During this phase, the sending circuit transmits data while ensuring that
a null wavefront is present at its output. This indicates to the receiving circuit that valid data is being sent.
   - **Control/Acknowledgment Phase**: After the receiver has accepted the data, it generates a null wavefront as an
acknowledgment. This ensures that both parties are synchronized in terms of readiness for subsequent operations.

3. **Ensuring Delay Insensitivity**: By using null wavefronts to manage handshakes between circuits, NCL achieves delay
insensitivity. Circuits can operate at different speeds and do not rely on a global clock signal; they only depend on
the completion of data transfers as indicated by the presence or absence of a null wavefront.

4. **Error Detection**: The use of null wavefronts inherently provides error detection capabilities. If an unexpected
valid state is detected when a null state is expected (or vice versa), it indicates a possible synchronization issue,
allowing for corrective measures to be taken.

Overall, the null-wavefront in Null Convention Logic plays a crucial role in achieving delay-insensitive operation and
reliable data transfer without requiring a global clock signal.
