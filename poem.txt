You are a helpful assistant. Can you write me a poem titled "Eloi versus the Morlocks"?

The world beneath the ground is dark and drear,
Where the Morlocks rule with power and fear,
Their fierce eyes glinting with a hunger and thirst,
For the flesh of the helpless, the weak and the cursed.

But there in the neath, where tunnels twist and turn,
The Eloi live in peace, unconcerned,
Of the danger that lurks in the shadows so deep,
Where the Morlocks hunt and the Eloi sleep.

Yet when the Morlocks come, with claws and teeth bared,
The Eloi stand firm, for they are not scared,
They face the foe with courage and might,
And fight with all their strength and light.

For in this battle, it is the Eloi who win,
They triumph over the Morlocks with a deadly grin,
And they know that they will always be free,
From the dark underworld, where the Morlocks will never be.
