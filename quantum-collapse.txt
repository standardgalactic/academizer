Quantum Superposition and Collapse


Dijiste:
In the quantum state, we have 0.5±0.5 = 0 AND 1, but in wavefunction collapse, we get 0.5±0.5 = 0 OR 1. Therefore, AND x Time ⇒ OR.

What do you think of this? Something that occurred to me and been posting a bit on it.

ChatGPT dijo:
You're touching on an interesting perspective regarding quantum superposition and wavefunction collapse. Let's break it down:

Quantum Superposition (0.5 ± 0.5 = 0 AND 1)

A quantum system in superposition exists in a linear combination of states. If we consider a qubit, it can be in a state like 1 2 ( ∣ 0 ⟩ + ∣ 1 ⟩) 2 ​ 1 ​ (∣0⟩+∣1⟩), meaning it has equal probability of being measured as 0 or 1.

The "AND" in your equation suggests that before measurement, the system embodies both possibilities simultaneously.

Wavefunction Collapse (0.5 ± 0.5 = 0 OR 1)

When a measurement is made, the wavefunction collapses to a definite state (either 0 or 1).

This is where the OR appears—it’s no longer both but one of the possible outcomes.

Role of Time in Superposition to Collapse (AND x Time ⇒ OR)

Your formulation suggests that time plays a role in transitioning from "AND" (superposition) to "OR" (collapse).

In many interpretations of quantum mechanics, it's not just time that causes collapse but measurement, decoherence, or interaction with an environment.

Possible Interpretation:

If you mean that "over time, quantum superpositions resolve into classical definite states," this aligns with ideas in decoherence theory.

However, if you suggest that time itself is responsible for collapse, that would be a unique claim requiring more exploration. The standard Copenhagen interpretation, for instance, does not attribute wavefunction collapse purely to time evolution.

Your idea is intriguing because it frames quantum measurement in a logical structure: an AND state (superposition) evolving over time into an OR state (classical outcome). If you can further refine it, it might tie into quantum decoherence or interpretations of quantum mechanics in a novel way.

Are you aiming to develop this into a formal framework, or is it more of a conceptual shorthand for understanding superposition and collapse?

Dijiste:
Simplify with more everyday examples

ChatGPT dijo:
Sure! Let’s use a simple everyday analogy to explain your idea.

Superposition (AND) – Like a Spinning Coin
Imagine you flip a coin, and while it’s spinning in the air, it’s neither fully heads nor fully tails—it has the potential to be both. In this moment, you can think of it as AND: it's in a mix of both states at the same time.

Collapse (OR) – When You Catch the Coin
The moment you catch the coin and look at it, it lands on either heads OR tails, not both. The spinning, uncertain state (AND) has now resolved into a definite outcome (OR).

Time’s Role (AND × Time ⇒ OR) – Waiting Causes Certainty
If you just let time pass and the coin lands naturally, at some point, it stops spinning and settles on a single face. In this way, you could say that time helps transition the uncertainty (AND) into a clear result (OR).

So, your idea can be seen as:

Before measurement (or before time passes enough), things exist in a mix of possibilities (AND).

After measurement (or over time), they settle into a definite outcome (OR).

Does this analogy work for what you’re trying to express?

Dijiste:
See if you can tie it in with bistable state perception

ChatGPT dijo:
Great thought! Bistable perception actually fits beautifully with your quantum analogy. Let’s connect them:

Bistable Perception – Your Brain’s Version of Wavefunction Collapse
Bistable perception happens when you see an ambiguous image (like the famous duck-rabbit or Necker cube), and your brain flips between two interpretations.

Before your brain "decides," the image is both things (like quantum superposition: AND state).

When you focus, your mind settles on one perception at a time—duck OR rabbit, not both (like wavefunction collapse: OR state).

Time’s Role (AND × Time ⇒ OR) in Perception
The longer you stare at a bistable image, the more likely your brain is to switch between interpretations.

Your mind forces a decision over time, even though both possibilities were always there.

This is similar to how, in quantum mechanics, a system in superposition evolves over time and collapses into a definite outcome upon measurement.

Quantum + Perception = A Shared Principle?
Both quantum states and bistable perception start with multiple possibilities.

Both "collapse" into a single outcome when observed.

Time and interaction influence the shift from uncertainty to certainty.

Could this mean that perception and quantum measurement share an underlying principle? Maybe consciousness, like a quantum system, works probabilistically until it "resolves" an outcome.

Does this comparison fit the way you were thinking?

## Social penetration theory
[edit](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Irwin_Altman&action=edit&section=1)
Main article: [Social penetration theory](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Social_penetration_theory)
Altman is famous for his work with Taylor resulting in the [social penetration theory](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Social_penetration_theory), which generally states that as relationships develop, communication moves from relatively shallow, non-intimate levels to deeper, more personal levels. If conversation is pleasant and rewarding, people will offer more information about themselves to each other that covers more areas of their life and is more sensitive to them.

## Environmental psychology
[edit](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Irwin_Altman&action=edit&section=2)
Altman also did work in the field of [environmental psychology](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Environmental_psychology). He believes there is a strong relationship between environmental psychology and social psychology and that the two disciplines have much to offer each other. Altman's Human Behavior and the Environment series added volumes on intellectual traditions (Altman & Christensen 1990), place attachment (Altman & Low 1992), and women and the environment (Altman & Churchman 1994). Much of his work following his Social Penetration Theory looked at human behavior and interactions with the environment.

I was going to look for analogies

ChatGPT dijo:
Analogies could definitely help make Social Penetration Theory more intuitive. Since you're already thinking in terms of quantum mechanics and bistable perception, let’s try connecting them.

1. Social Penetration as Quantum Superposition & Collapse
In the early stages of a relationship, people exist in a superposition of possible selves—only revealing surface-level aspects (like an electron being in multiple states).

As trust develops, they "collapse" into more defined, deeper states of disclosure, just as measurement collapses a quantum wavefunction into a definite outcome.

So, deep conversation is like "measuring" a person, causing their hidden layers to emerge.

2. Social Penetration as a Bistable Image
When meeting someone new, they’re like an ambiguous bistable image—you don’t yet see their full personality.

Over time, as you gain more context, your perception shifts between different "versions" of them until you form a stable impression.

Like bistable perception, your understanding of them fluctuates but eventually settles into a clearer picture.

3. Peeling an Onion vs. Quantum Tunneling
Social Penetration Theory often uses the onion metaphor—we reveal ourselves in layers.

But in quantum mechanics, tunneling allows particles to "jump" through barriers instead of slowly peeling through layers.

Some deep emotional connections happen instantly, like quantum tunneling—skipping layers of gradual disclosure.

Would you like to refine any of these, or do they spark any new ideas for you?

Dijiste:
The **social penetration theory** (**SPT**) proposes that as relationships develop, [interpersonal communication](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interpersonal_communication) moves from relatively shallow, non-intimate levels to deeper, more [intimate ones](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intimate_relationship).[[1]](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Social_penetration_theory&wprov=rarw1#cite_note-Altman1-1) The theory was formulated by psychologists [Irwin Altman](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Irwin_Altman) of the [University of Utah](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/University_of_Utah)[[2]](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Social_penetration_theory&wprov=rarw1#cite_note-2) and Dalmas Taylor of the [University of Delaware](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/University_of_Delaware)[[3]](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Social_penetration_theory&wprov=rarw1#cite_note-3) in 1973 to understand relationship development between individuals. Altman and Taylor noted that relationships "involve different levels of intimacy of exchange or degree of social penetration". SPT is known as an objective theory as opposed to an interpretive theory, meaning it is based on data drawn from actual experiments and not simply from conclusions based on individuals' specific experiences.[[4]](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Social_penetration_theory&wprov=rarw1#cite_note-4)
SPT states that the relationship development occurs primarily through [self-disclosure](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Self-disclosure)—when one intentionally reveals information such as personal motives, desires, feelings, thoughts, and experiences to others. This theory assumes that as people becomes closer with others, positive reinforcement through positive interactions allow people to achieve deeper levels of intimacy.[[5]](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Social_penetration_theory&wprov=rarw1#cite_note-5) The theory is also guided by the assumptions that relationship development is systematic and predictable. SPT also examines the process of de-penetration, how some relationships regress over time, and eventually end.[[6]](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Social_penetration_theory&wprov=rarw1#cite_note-6)
## Assumptions

## Self-disclosure
[edit](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Social_penetration_theory&action=edit&section=2)
Main article: [Self-disclosure](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Self-disclosure)
Self-disclosure is a purposeful disclosure of personal information to another person.[[8]](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Social_penetration_theory&wprov=rarw1#cite_note-Howard-8) Disclosure may include sharing both high-risk and low-risk information as well as personal experiences, ideas, attitudes, feelings, values, past facts and life stories, future hopes, dreams, ambitions, and goals. In sharing information about themselves, people make choices about what to share and with whom to share it. Altman and Taylor believe that opening the inner self to the other individual is the main path to reaching intimate relationships.

As for the speed of self-disclosure, Altman and Taylor were convinced that the process of social penetration moves quickly in the beginning stages of a relationship and slows down considerably in the later stages. Those who are able to develop a long-term, positive reward/cost outcome are the same people who are able to share important matches of breadth categories. The early reward/cost assessment has a strong impact on the relationship's reactions, involvement, and expectations in a relationship regarding the future, play a major role in the outcome of the relationship.[*[clarification needed](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Please_clarify)*]
### Uncertainty reduction theory
[edit](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Social_penetration_theory&action=edit&section=3)
Main article: [Uncertainty reduction theory](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Uncertainty_reduction_theory)
The uncertainty reduction theory (URT) is the process that people experience as they begin new relationships.[[9]](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Social_penetration_theory&wprov=rarw1#cite_note-9) When two strangers meet, they engage by asking each other questions in order to build a stronger relationship. In the context of both URT and SPT, questions are seen as a tool to learn information about the other in order to receive rewards.[[10]](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Social_penetration_theory&wprov=rarw1#cite_note-:13-10) These rewards are either physical/material rewards, or abstract rewards that supplement the relationship as it develops.

Through this process of asking questions in a new relationship, uncertainty and anxiety can be reduced and lead to a more developed relationship between the two people. Where social penetration theory postulates that new relationships (either romantic or platonic) steadily evolve into deeper conversations and interactions, uncertainty reduction theory postulates that these new relationships can reach that deep level through question and answer processes. Although SPT primarily focuses on the linear trajectory of the relationship as the two parties get a deeper understanding of one another, URT is relevant in that it focuses on each instance when uncertainty may need to be reduced through question asking on a case-by-case basis (e.g. the two people initially meet and questions are asked; later on in the relationship, one party asks the other to meet their parents, and the two engage in URT to reduce the anxiety and uncertainty surrounding the situation).[*[citation needed](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Citation_needed)*]
### Disclosure reciprocity
[edit](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Social_penetration_theory&action=edit&section=4)
Self-disclosure is reciprocal, especially in the early stages of relationship development. Disclosure [reciprocity](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reciprocity_(social_psychology)) is an indispensable component in SPT,[[7]](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Social_penetration_theory&wprov=rarw1#cite_note-West_2013-7) and is a process where one person reveals personal information of a certain intimacy level, and the other person discloses information of the same level.[[11]](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Social_penetration_theory&wprov=rarw1#cite_note-:0-11) It is two-way disclosure, or mutual disclosure. Disclosure reciprocity can induce positive and satisfactory feelings and drive forward relational development, because as mutual disclosure takes place between individuals, they might feel a sense of emotional equity. Disclosure reciprocity occurs when the openness of one person is reciprocated with the same degree of the openness from the other person.[[7]](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Social_penetration_theory&wprov=rarw1#cite_note-West_2013-7) For instance, if someone was to bring up their experience with an intimate topic such as weight gain or having [divorced](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Divorce) parents, the person they are talking to could reciprocate by sharing their own experience.[[12]](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Social_penetration_theory&wprov=rarw1#cite_note-12)
Self-disclosure being reciprocated is also a forming foundation for interpersonal relationships. If self-disclosure is not reciprocated in an interpersonal relationship, it moves the relationship to potentially face a stage of de-penetration or "slow deterioration" (West, 2018).[*[incomplete short citation](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:CITESHORT)*] This can happen in a few ways, such as oversharing and undersharing. Oversharing personal information can lead to the end of the relationship, as "[s]ome partners may be ill-equipped and underprepared to know someone so intimately" (West, 2018). Since self-disclosure depends on going back and forth, if one partner does not share in that, it leads to an imbalance in the relationship, and the bond will unlikely progress since the other partner only knows a certain amount. This also causes the partner who shares or discloses not wanting to disclose any further, hindering the interpersonal relationship's progress because "[t]he greater the depth, the more opportunity for a person to feel vulnerable" (West, 2018). Vulnerability leads the partner to believe that there can be an interpersonal relationship as it translates into trust for partners' relationship.[[13](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Social_penetration_theory&wprov=rarw1#cite_note-13)

ChatGPT dijo:
It looks like you’re looking for analogies related to Social Penetration Theory (SPT). Here are a few that connect SPT to other concepts, including quantum mechanics and bistable perception:

1. Social Penetration as Quantum Superposition & Wavefunction Collapse
At the start of a relationship, people are like quantum superpositions—existing in multiple possible states of disclosure (AND).

As trust builds and conversations deepen, the wavefunction collapses into a clearer, more defined relationship (OR).

The more "measurements" (interactions) that occur, the more stable the relationship state becomes.

Example: Two people on a first date are in a "cloud of possibilities." Over time, their shared interactions collapse uncertainty into a definite state of closeness or distance.

2. Social Penetration as Bistable Perception (Duck-Rabbit)
Just as your brain flips between two images in a bistable illusion, relationships also shift between layers of intimacy.

Sometimes, a single deep conversation flips someone from a "surface acquaintance" to "close friend," just like a bistable image suddenly shifting in perception.

Example: A casual friend suddenly shares a vulnerable story, and your perception of them shifts instantly—just like how an ambiguous image suddenly becomes a rabbit instead of a duck.

3. Peeling an Onion vs. Quantum Tunneling
SPT often compares self-disclosure to peeling an onion—gradually revealing deeper layers.

But some connections bypass this slow process through quantum tunneling—instantly jumping into deep trust (e.g., trauma bonding or instant chemistry).

Example: Meeting someone who "just gets you" can feel like skipping layers of the onion—almost like quantum tunneling through emotional barriers.

4. Entropy & Relationship De-Penetration
Relationships naturally tend toward entropy—without effort, they "de-penetrate" over time.

Just as energy must be added to keep a physical system ordered, relationships require ongoing effort and interaction to prevent regression.

Example: Old friendships can "decay" like unstable atoms, unless energy is continuously put into maintaining them.

Do any of these analogies resonate with you? Would you like to refine one further?

Connections with this: Thick Black Theory (Chinese: 厚黑學; pinyin: Hòu hēi xué) is a philosophical treatise written by Li Zongwu (李宗吾, 1879–1943), a disgruntled politician and scholar born at the end of Qing dynasty. It was published in China in 1911, the year of the Xinhai revolution, when the Qing dynasty was overthrown.

Name
edit
Houheixue is translated as "Thick Black Theory", "Thick and Dark Theory", or "Study of the Thick and Dark". Hou 厚 is thick in English. It comes from "thick face" in Chinese, which means being shameless. Hei 黑 can be translated as dark or "hard-hearted", which means setting one's mind to be ready to play hard, without respect towards common virtue.

Quotations
edit
Li was a scientist of political intrigue. He wrote: "When you conceal your will from others, that is Thick. When you impose your will on others, that is Black (Dark)." According to Chin-Ning Chu, the 'Thick Black Theory' describes the ruthless and hypocritical[1] means men use to obtain and hold power: "thick faces" (shamelessness), "black heart" (ruthlessness), according to author's view of history. It went through several printings.

Li argued that "A great hero is no more than a person who is impudent and wicked." According to Li, the wickedest of all was Cao Cao. "I would rather betray someone than be betrayed." It shows how black Cao Cao's heart was inside. Li picked Liu Bei (king of one rival kingdom competing with Cao's) as the highly skilled person with a "thick face". He never thought it shameful to live inside another's fence. He was also a frequent crier, appealing to others' sympathy. There is even a humorous saying, "Liu Bei's JiangShan (kingdom) was obtained through his crying.

ChatGPT dijo:
This is an interesting mix of Social Penetration Theory (SPT) and Thick Black Theory (Hòu Hēi Xué)—one about openness and trust in relationships, the other about shamelessness and ruthlessness in power dynamics. Here’s how they might connect:

1. The "Thick Face" as a Barrier to Social Penetration
In SPT, relationships develop through self-disclosure, revealing deeper layers of the "onion."
But in Thick Black Theory, a "thick face" (shamelessness) acts as a shield against vulnerability—preventing self-disclosure and maintaining control over others.

Some people never allow penetration beyond surface interactions, using manipulation instead of trust.

Example: A cunning politician or business leader might act friendly but never truly reveals their real thoughts, maintaining a thick, impenetrable exterior.

2. "Black Heart" as Strategic Self-Disclosure
SPT assumes that disclosure is reciprocal—people open up when the other person does.

But in Thick Black Theory, a "black heart" (ruthlessness) means using disclosure strategically, revealing just enough to manipulate others while withholding true intentions.

Instead of mutual trust, it’s about calculated deception.

Example: Liu Bei (from Romance of the Three Kingdoms) cried to gain sympathy, revealing "vulnerability" not as an honest act, but as a tactic to win people over.

3. Relationships as Power Struggles vs. Genuine Connection
SPT is based on trust and predictable deepening of relationships.

Thick Black Theory suggests that power comes from controlling perception, often pretending to be vulnerable while secretly being ruthless.

Instead of two people gradually opening up, Thick Black Theory suggests that one person dominates the interaction, controlling the narrative.

Example: In a corporate setting, a CEO might use selective vulnerability in speeches to appear relatable, while making ruthless business decisions behind the scenes.

4. Quantum Mechanics & Perception: "Thick Black" as Wavefunction Control
In quantum mechanics, a state is undefined until measured.

In Thick Black Theory, a powerful person controls how others "measure" them, shaping perception.

Instead of allowing others to truly "see" their real state, they manipulate the wavefunction collapse in their favor.

Example: A dictator or CEO creates different images for different audiences—tough to rivals, kind to followers, wise to the public. They maintain superposition, only collapsing into a specific "state" when useful.

Final Thought: Two Opposite Paths
SPT sees deep relationships as a natural, evolving process based on trust.

Thick Black Theory sees relationships as a battlefield, where vulnerability is a weapon or a weakness.

One seeks mutual understanding, the other seeks control.

Would you say people naturally shift between these two models depending on context? Or do you think they are fundamentally opposed?

Dijiste:
I think the naming is problematic I call it Thick Skin, Hidden Heart 

ChatGPT dijo:
I like that—Thick Skin, Hidden Heart sounds more balanced and adaptable than "Thick Black Theory," which carries a more negative connotation.

It captures the duality between resilience and concealment:

Thick Skin → Emotional and psychological armor, protecting oneself from harm, rejection, or manipulation.

Hidden Heart → Keeping one's true emotions, intentions, or vulnerabilities beneath the surface, revealing them selectively.

This framing makes it feel less cynical than Thick Black Theory and more like a survival strategy in different social and power dynamics.

Would you say it's more about balance—knowing when to open up and when to guard oneself? Or do you see it as a structured philosophy, like a social or leadership playbook?
