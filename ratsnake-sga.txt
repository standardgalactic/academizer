Pantherophis obsoletus – also known as the western rat snake, black rat
snake, pilot black snake, or simply black snake[4] – is a non-venomous 
species of Colubridae found in central North America. No subspecies are 
currently recognized.[5] Its color variations include the Texas ratsnake.
[3] Along with other snakes of the eastern United States, like 
the eastern indigo snake (Drymarchon couperi) or the eastern 
racer (Coluber constrictor), it is called 'black snake'.

Geographic range[edit]

Pantherophis obsoletus is found west of the Mississippi River, from 
eastern and southern Iowa southward through Missouri and Arkansas to 
western Louisiana, westward to eastern Texas, northward 
through Oklahoma and eastern Kansas to southeastern Nebraska.[6]
Aside from the usual variety that is black or has patches of black on a 

lighter background, color variations include the Texas rat snake, a 

brown-to-black variant, often with tinges of orange or red, that can be 

found in southern Oklahoma, Texas, and Louisiana.

Habitat[edit]

Rat snakes live in a variety of habitats; some overlap each other. Rat 
snakes are excellent climbers and spend time in trees. They live in 
habitats ranging from a rocky hillside to flat farmland.[7]

 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Preferred habitat[edit]

It prefers heavily wooded areas and is known for having excellent 

climbing ability, including the ability to climb the trunk of large mature 

trees without the aid of branches; the snake is also a competent 

swimmer. During winter it hibernates in dens, often 

with copperheads and timber rattlesnakes. This association gave rise to 

one of its common names, pilot black snake, and the superstition that this

nonvenomous species led the venomous ones to the den.

Description[edit]

A black rat snake, Chatham County, North Carolina

 [9]

Adults of Pantherophis obsoletus can become quite large, with a 
reported typical total length (including tail) of 106.5–183 cm (3 ft 
  They are the largest snake found in Canada. The 
6 in – 6 ft 0 in).[8]
record total length is 256.5 cm (8 ft 5 in),[10] making it (officially) the 
longest snake in North America.[9] Unofficially, indigo snakes 
(Drymarchon couperi) are known to exceed them, and one wild-caught 
pine snake (Pituophis melanoleucus), with a portion of its tail missing, 
measured 111 inches (2.8 m).[citation needed] The body mass of this rat 
snake can range up to 0.5 to 2.2 kg (1.1 to 4.9 lb) in adults, although most
adults are on the smaller end of this scale, per herpetology research 

 
 
 [13]

 [12]

sites, with weights most commonly between 0.77 and 1 kg (1.7 and 2.2 lb).
[11] 
Juveniles are strongly patterned with brown blotches on a gray 
background (like miniature fox snakes: P. gloydi, P. ramspotti, and P. 
vulpinus). Darkening occurs rapidly as they grow. Adults are glossy black
above with white lips, chin, and throat. Sometimes traces of the 
"obsolete" juvenile pattern are still discernible in the skin between 
the scales, especially when stretched after a heavy meal.[14]
Common names[edit]

 [15]

Other common names include: black chicken snake, black coluber, chicken 
snake, mountain black snake, mountain pilot snake, pilot, rat snake, rusty
black snake, scaly black snake, cow snake, schwartze Schlange, sleepy 
John, and white-throated racer.[4]

Behavior[edit]

When not fully grown, rat snakes are subject to predation by many 
animals, including other snakes. Once they attain maturity, they are 
readily preyed on by mammalian carnivores (including the American mink, 
which weighs no more than an adult rat snake) and large birds of 

 
 
 
 
 
 
prey (especially red-tailed hawks).[16] When startled, they may freeze 
and wrinkle themselves into a series of kinks. If they feel further 
threatened, they may flee quickly or tail vibrate (potentially a form 
of mimicry, which makes them sound like rattlesnakes). They are also 
capable of producing a foul-smelling musk, which they will release onto 
predators if picked up. They spread the musk with their tails in hopes 
of deterring the threat.[17] When cornered or provoked, black snakes 
are known to stand their ground and can become aggressive. 
Counterattacks on large birds of prey, often committed by large snakes 
in excess of 150 cm (59 in) in length, have resulted in violent prolonged
struggles. Utilizing its infamous agility and the great strength of its 
muscular coils, the black rat snake is sometimes able to overwhelm and 
kill formidable avian predators such as red-tailed hawks, great horned 
owls and red-shouldered hawks, though in many cases the bird is able to
kill the snake and both combatants may even die.[18]
Feeding[edit]

 [19]

Raiding a bluebird birdhouse

This species is a constrictor, meaning it squeezes its prey to the point of 
cardiovascular collapse due to obstructive shock, coiling around small 
animals and tightening its grip until they can no longer circulate blood 
and die of profound hypotension, before eating them. Though they will 
often consume mice, voles, and rats, western rat snakes are far from 

 
 
 
specialists at this kind of prey and will readily consume any small 
vertebrate they can catch. Other prey opportunistically eaten by this 
species can include other snakes (including both those of their own and 
other species), frogs, lizards, chipmunks, squirrels, juvenile rabbits, 
juvenile opossums, songbirds, and bird eggs.[14] One snake was observed to
consume an entire clutch of Mallard eggs.[16] Cavity-nesting bird species 
are seemingly especially prevalent in this snake's diet. The rat snake 
has been noted as perhaps the top predator at purple martin colonies as 
a single large snake will readily consume a number of eggs, hatchlings, 
and adults each summer. Several rat snake repelling methods have been 
offered to those putting up martin houses, but most are mixed in 
success.[20]
Reproduction[edit]

Mating while climbing a tree

Mating takes place in late May and early June. The male snake wraps its 
tail around the female with their vents nearly touching. The male then
everts one of its sex organs, a hemipenis, into the female sex 
organ, cloaca. The mating lasts a few minutes to a few hours. After five
weeks, the female lays about 12 to 20 eggs, which are 36–60 mm (1.4–
2.4 in) long by 20–26.5 mm (0.79–1.04 in) wide. The eggs hatch about 65 
to 70 days later in late August to early October.[21] The hatchlings are 
28–41 cm (11–16 in) in total length,[4] and they look like miniature fox 
snakes.[14]

Taxonomy[edit]

 [25]

This species has previously been placed (and is still placed by many) in 
the genus Elaphe, as Elaphe obsoleta. However, Utiger et al. found 
that Elaphe is broadly construed as paraphyletic, and placed this species
in the genus Pantherophis.[22] In addition, because Pantherophis is 
masculine, the specific epithet becomes the masculine obsoletus.[23] The
split of Pantherophis from Elaphe has been further confirmed by 
additional phylogenetic studies.[24]
In 2001, Burbrink suggested this species be divided into three species 
based on geographic patterns of mitochondrial DNA diversity. He assigned 
new common names and resurrected old scientific names, resulting in the
following combinations: eastern ratsnake (Elaphe alleghaniensis, 
now Pantherophis alleghaniensis), central ratsnake (Elaphe spiloides, 
now Pantherophis spiloides), and western rat snake (Elaphe obsoleta, 
now Pantherophis obsoletus). However, these three species are not 
morphologically distinct and overlap in all examined morphological 
characters.[26] More recent investigations have indicated P. 
alleghaniensis and P. spiloides interbreed freely in Ontario.[27]
In 2008, Collins and Taggart[28] resurrected the genus Scotophis for 
Burbrink's three taxa (i.e., Scotophis alleghaniensis, Scotophis spiloides, 
and Scotophis obsoletus) in response to the findings of Burbrink and 
Lawson, 2007.[24] The justification for this nomenclatural change has 
been removed by more recent research.[25]
In captivity[edit]

Western rat snakes are popular as pets. Their size, calm temperament, 

and ease of care contribute to this popularity and they also occur in 

many mutations such as leucistic, albino, and scaleless. They enjoy hiding 

 
 
 
and burrowing which is usually accommodated with a loose substrate (such

as aspen wood shavings or newspaper) and one or more hide boxes. Captive 

rat snakes are generally fed killed or stunned mice because captive-

bred mice reduce the risk of exposing the snake to pathogens or live 

prey-induced injuries.
