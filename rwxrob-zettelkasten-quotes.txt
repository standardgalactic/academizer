My fingers hurt writing this now (because of of how unnecessarily verbose all of this is). I was the college kid who submitted 25 pages when only eight were required (but somehow my professors still liked me, even let me turn in a final two weeks late once). The books I'm currently working on are listed in their own Twitch About section. You can chat away about whatever you want because I very likely am not looking at the chat at all. Just don't expect a response from me. Typo corrections are very welcome. People have said they really appreciate seeing the thought process behind the writing in real-time. I would agree.
