T
he contemporary world is the result of an enormous amount 
of accumulated human knowledge. To maintain and enhance 
societal progress, it is essential that we understand the pro-
cess of knowledge creation and, perhaps more importantly, the 
collaborative human behaviours behind it. However, quantitative 
data that analyse human history have been mostly far from sat-
isfactory because of the lack of systematically preserved records 
describing the details of human knowledge development. Thus, 
the investigation of human knowledge creation and collabora-
tion has long been anecdotal, with historians and anthropologists 
reconstructing the past based on fragmentary evidence. However, 
this situation radically changed at the turn of the twenty-first cen-
tury. The exponential growth of information technology in the 
twenty-first century has created online environments to share 
up-to-date information generated by everyone. The segregating 
lines between information producers and consumers have been 
blurred, a phenomenon called produsage1. It has been argued that 
these new online environments enable the ‘democratization’ of 
knowledge2. At the same time, accumulation of an inconceivable 
amount of information produced by everyone with online access 
every minute of the day has generated an unprecedented amount 
of exhaustive records of digital footprints, which processes of 
human knowledge creation. Wikipedia (https://www.wikipedia.
org/), a representative openly edited encyclopaedia, represents 
a paradigmatic example of an online environment for contribu-
tors who generate information. Wikipedia’s credibility has been 
questioned: it is sometimes considered unstable, imprecise and 
even misleading3,4. On the other hand, studies have shown that 
the current accuracy of Wikipedia is remarkable, even surpass-
ing traditional encyclopaedias5,6. Nevertheless, researchers have 
identified substantial heterogeneities in the editing process, due 
to the monopoly or oligopoly of a few ‘supereditors’ who govern 
Wikipedia’s content7–11. Thus, Wikipedia is still far from being the 
ideal of communal knowledge that we desire it to be.
The majority of studies, including our own previous work, 
focused on just a few language editions, mostly the English edition, 
of Wikipedia to examine the dynamics and properties of the com-
munal data set, an editable data set that is shared within a com-
munity to build collective knowledge5,8,12–14. Although these studies 
warned of the potential risks behind the current social structure in 
the English edition, cultural background affects the of individu-
als; therefore, the results of those studies may not be generalizable. 
Wikipedia users may be affected by their social norms or cultures. 
For instance, people belonging to different cultural backgrounds 
tend to use different symbols on the Web15; cultural background 
also affects Web page design16,17. The editors of different language 
editions edit Wikipedia using distinctive patterns18. Moreover, there 
are differences in linguistic complexity. For example, the linguistic 
complexity of the English edition of Wikipedia differs from that of 
the German and Spanish editions19. Finally, previous studies have 
been based on small samples obtained from non-identically sized 
data sets, comparing, for instance, the same entries across a number 
of languages. However, the number of articles in the English edition 
of Wikipedia and the number of articles in the other language edi-
tions are of different orders of magnitude; the English edition has at 
least five times more edits. Thus, it is unclear whether the hetero-
geneity in editing processes is a general phenomenon or applies to 
English users only.
To investigate the general features of editing processes and 
dynamics, we have extended our previous analysis of the English 
edition of Wikipedia8 to all 863 Wikimedia projects (https://wiki-
mediafoundation.org/our-work/wikimedia-projects/); these consist 
of various types of communal data sets hosted by the Wikimedia 
Foundation (https://wikimediafoundation.org/). For this purpose, 
Early onset of structural inequality in the

The Wikimedia project, including Wikipedia, is one of the largest communal data sets and has served as a representative 
medium to convey collective knowledge in the twenty-first century. Researchers have believed that the analysis of these col-
laborative digital data sets provides a unique window into the processes of collaborative knowledge formation; yet, in reality, 
most previous studies have usually focused on its narrow subsets. Here, by analysing all 863 Wikimedia projects (various types 
and in different languages), we find evidence for a universal growth pattern in communal data formation. We observe that 
inequality arises early in the development of Wikimedia projects and stabilizes at high levels. To understand the mechanism 
behind the observed structural inequality, we develop an agent-based model that considers the characteristics of the editors 
and successfully reproduces the empirical results. Our findings from the Wikimedia projects data, along with other types of 
collaboration data, such as patents and academic papers, show that a small number of editors have a disproportionately large 
influence on the formation of collective knowledge. This analysis offers insights into how various collaboration environments 
can be sustained in the future.

we investigated heterogeneity in contributions and supereditors’ 
share in Wikimedia projects to understand the psychosocial pro-
cesses and dynamics behind openly edited communal data sets. 
In particular, we examined the complete editing history of every 
Wikimedia project to assess their growth over time. We mainly 
focused on the number of edits, editors and articles, article size 
and the level of heterogeneity captured by an inequality coefficient 
that measures the disparity of contribution in the editing activities 
(edits and number of contributions) of editors. We demonstrate the 
existence of typical growth patterns of openly edited communal 
data sets that eventually establish strong heterogeneity among the 
contributions of editors. In addition, to understand the mechanism 
behind such disparity, we introduce an agent-based model that rep-
licates the interactions between communal data sets and editors. 
Our model takes into account the competition between editors’ 
natural reduction in motivation over time, their stronger memory 
for more recent editing activities and their attachment to the articles 
they edit. The model reproduces the actual universal growth pat-
terns in a manner that is consistent with the data.
Results
Our main goal was to identify the underlying principles in the 
development of communal data sets. For our analysis, we used the 
March 2016 dump of all Wikimedia projects (https://dumps.wiki-
media.org/backup-index.html). We considered a single Wikimedia 
project as a sample of such communal data sets. To proceed with the 
in-depth analysis of the evolution of communal data sets, we need to 
stress that most data sets were aged approximately 3.5 ×​ 108 s (about 
11 years; see Supplementary Fig. 1). Thus, most Wikimedia projects 
are of similar age, suggesting that raw measures without time rescal-
ing are appropriate.
Universality and disparity in communal data sets. We present 
evidence of a universal growth pattern shared by all Wikimedia 
projects, as displayed by characteristic measures that are based on 
the current snapshot of the communal data set, such as the total 
number of edits (Ne), editors (Np) and articles (Na), and the current 
article size (S, in bytes). Our primary interest was to identify the 
generality in growth patterns of the communal data set, not indi-
vidual articles. Thus, we used the total sum of these values for all 
articles in a Wikimedia project, without considering the individual 
properties of its constituent articles. For example, Ne is the total 
number of edits for a given edition of a Wikimedia project, or the 
sum of the number of edits of individual articles for that edition. 
Our first analysis of the interplay between such measures indicates 
their regularity across projects, regardless of age, language and  
data set type.
Growth scale of communal data sets. We begin our analysis with 
the study of the intercorrelations between Ne, Na, Np and S in the 
current Wikimedia projects. One may speculate the absence of a 
general rule between measures because of the excessive heteroge-
neity of current Wikimedia projects (see Supplementary Fig. 2) 
compared to their age distribution (see Supplementary Fig. 1). As 
an example of the differences between different language editions 
of Wikipedia projects, the degree of language proficiency among 
editors of the English edition of Wikipedia is qualitatively different 
from that of other language editions19. Despite such a difference, 
we found common positive correlations between the measures. 
First, the number of editors and articles, and the size of the data 
sets, gradually vary as functions of the number of edits. The grow-
ing patterns are characterized by the simple sublinear growth y ~​ xλ, 
where x is the number of edits, the exponent λ ≃​ 0.70 is the number 
of editors (Fig. 1a), λ ≃​ 0.85 is the number of articles (Fig. 1b) and 
λ ≃​ 0.87 is the total size of the data sets in bytes (Fig. 1c). One may 
argue that this sublinear growth of λ <​ 1 does not directly indicate a 
slowdown in growth. For instance, exponent λ =​ 1/2 is required to 
retain the mean editing rate for a single article if the editing rate is 
proportional to the current number of articles because dNe/dNa∝​Na, 
so λ <​ 1/2 indicates stagnation under this condition. However, every 
event in the Wikimedia projects can be considered as a different 
type of editing that leads to an increment of 1 in the number of edits 
Ne. In other words, the participation of a new editor and the creation 
of a new article are not independent editing actions; they are instead 
special cases of editing. Consequently, each parameter Na, Np and 
S can be written as functions of Ne, for example, as ∝
λ
Ne . Thus,  
λ indicates the temporal trend of the ratio between regular editing 
and special events, that is, the participation of a new editor and the 
creation of a new article. In summary, λ <​ 1 implies an overall slow-
down of growth with regard to the frequency of appearance of new 
editors and brand-new articles, as more edits take place; from the 
perspective of editability, larger data sets are more inefficient than 
smaller ones.
To identify the reason for this stagnation with regard to the num-
ber of edits, we also examined the interrelationships between the 
other measures. The number of editors increases with the number 
of articles (λ ≃​ 0.78; Fig. 1d). Meanwhile, the size of each article 
roughly linearly increases with the number of articles (λ ≃​ 1.02;  
Fig. 1e) and the number of editors (λ ≃​ 1.06; Fig. 1f), respectively. 
Briefly, the rate of text accumulation remains almost constant 
regardless of the number of articles and editors. Our previous study 
on the English edition of Wikipedia suggested that (1) the inter-
event period between two consecutive edits in an individual article 
follows a universal distribution regardless of its age in real time and 
(2) the size difference between two consecutive edits also follows a 
universally right-skewed distribution regardless of size8. In light of 
these findings, the current results suggest that stagnation is caused 
by the decreased appearance of new editors and not by the decreased 
productivity of existing editors. In addition, Ne, Na, Np and S are not 
correlated with the age of the data sets (Supplementary Fig. 3), indi-
cating that the raw number of edits is the appropriate measure to 
compare the various data sets, rather than actual time. As shown in 
Supplementary Fig. 1, most of the Wikimedia projects are of similar 
age; therefore, our analysis suggests that the rate of growth per unit 
time decreases as the size of Wikimedia projects increases, as we 
showed in our previous study8. All Wikimedia projects display this 
growth scale, regardless of their institutional aim, suggesting that 
the common growth pattern is caused by the common characteris-
tics of communal data sets (see Supplementary Fig. 4).
Along with the common scaling patterns observed in the differ-
ent measures of a Wikimedia project, that is, Ne, Na, Np and S, it 
is also important to identify the possible scaling patterns between 
different types of Wikimedia projects in the same language. As we 
show in Supplementary Figs. 5–8, the majority of different types 
of Wikimedia projects show almost identical tendencies with 
regard to the size ratio. Each of the four measures (Ne, Na, Np and 
S) for Wikipedia is considerably larger than that of any other types; 
Wiktionary is the second largest. The differences between other 
types of Wikimedia projects are not as great.
The next question is whether languages in Wikimedia projects 
can be categorized into distinct clusters that share growth patterns. 
To answer this question, we performed a cluster analysis by con-
structing a simple feature vector for language, which consists of 
characteristic measures from different types of Wikimedia projects 
(see Supplementary Methods). We present results from two machine 
learning techniques. In particular, we used the Dirichlet process 
Gaussian mixture model20, which can efficiently partition vectors 
in the case of unknown numbers of groups. Then, we used the 
t-SNE algorithm to visualize the higher dimensional feature vectors 
in two-dimensional space, while preserving their original degrees 
of separation21. We did not observe any clear-cut clustering for the 
different dimensions of feature vectors and different clustering

parameters (Supplementary Figs. 9−​11). Therefore, our cluster 
analysis results support the existence of universal rules governing 
the growth of a communal data set, regardless of its language.
Wikimedia projects and their corresponding socio-economic 
indicators. Next, we examined if there are any possible external 
factors that affect the current status of different Wikimedia proj-
ects with regard to the number of Ne, Na, Np and S. The number of 
Wikimedia projects is not simply determined by the total number of 
speakers of a language. As an illustrative example, the Spanish edi-
tion of Wikipedia is approximately ten times larger than the Hindi 
edition, despite the fact that both Spanish and Hindi have around 
half a billion speakers each22. Bearing in mind that the age of both 
editions is comparable (16 years for the Spanish edition and 14 years 
for the Hindi edition), the growth of the Hindi edition has been 
much slower up to this point. To elucidate the reason behind such a 
big difference, we inspected the factors affecting the current status 
of Wikimedia projects. The simplest factor is the ratio of the num-
ber of people using the language as a native language to those using 
it as a second language (see Supplementary Methods). One may 
assume that the people using a particular language as a second lan-
guage have less of an impact on the formation of a communal data 
set written in that specific language, compared to its native language 
users. However, we found that the number of Wikimedia projects 
is better correlated with the number of second language users than 
the total number of language users or the number of users who are 
native speakers (Supplementary Fig. 12). Other linguistic proper-
ties may also influence the growth rate of Wikimedia projects, so 
we tried categorizing Wikimedia projects according to their writ-
ten scripts. Rather surprisingly, there are no notable differences 
between the scripts (Supplementary Fig. 13) because, as mentioned 
earlier, a single character in each script takes a different size in bytes 
depending on the language.
In addition to simple linguistic factors, we tried to consider 
more complex ones by cross-correlating the language editions of 
Wikimedia projects with the socio-economic status of countries the 
Wikimedia projects belong to. We assigned the dominant country 
of a certain language edition according to the following criteria: (1) 
a country using the language as a primary or official language; and 
(2) the first country in terms of the page view share of the Wikipedia 
edition in that language (see Supplementary Methods). First, the 
educational level of a country shows a positive correlation with the 
number of corresponding Wikimedia projects, although not in a 
statistically significant manner (Supplementary Fig. 14). In addi-
tion, the total population weakly impacts the status of Wikimedia 
projects, whereas the total population of Internet users shows a 
strong positive correlation with the number of Wikimedia projects 
(Supplementary Fig. 15). Gross domestic product is also well corre-
lated with the growth of Wikimedia projects (Supplementary Fig. 15).  
However, the gross domestic product per capita is not correlated 
with the number of Wikimedia projects (Supplementary Fig. 15). In 
summary, the scale of the economy, which is partly reflected in the 
number of Internet users, affects the growth of Wikipedia projects.
We also observe that national expenditure and products for 
research and development show a significant correlation with the 
current number of individual Wikimedia projects. Larger investors 
in research also tend to have larger Wikimedia projects compared to 
their smaller counterparts (Supplementary Fig. 16). Consequently, 
the number of patents and academic papers are also strongly corre-
lated with the size of individual Wikimedia projects (Supplementary 
Figs. 17 and 18; see Supplementary Methods for further details). 
Such a research and development scale is determined by the scale 
of the national economy. Taken together with the results described 
earlier, the size of individual Wikimedia projects is closely tied to 
the overall size of the economy of a country, yet per-capita levels 
do not impact greatly on the current size of individual Wikimedia 
projects. In other words, the Wikimedia projects of richer countries 
grow faster and larger.
Disparity in contributions. The general growth patterns of Ne, Na, 
Np and S suggest an interesting hypothesis: could there be a univer-
sal rule underpinning the genesis of structural heterogeneity in the

formation of communal data sets8,9? To examine the validity of the 
hypothesis, we employed a variant of the Gini coefficient, a conven-
tional measure of inequality of income23. In our analysis, a variant of 
the Gini coefficient quantifies how the number of edits are distrib-
uted among different editors involved in a specific Wikimedia proj-
ect, that is, those editors who have edited an article in the project 
at least once. This variant of the Gini coefficient ranges from 0 for 
minimal heterogeneity (or maximal homogeneity, when every edi-
tor contributes equally) to 1 for maximal heterogeneity (when only 
a single editor contributes everything). We considered the number 
of edits and the data size for individual editors as the variables of 
interest; these variables are referred to as ‘total contributions’ (they 
parallel the quantification of inequality in economic wealth) unless 
specified otherwise.
The trend of the variant of the Gini coefficient as an increas-
ing function of Ne displayed in Fig. 2 suggests that the disparity in 
the level of total contributions among editors is intensified as the 
communal data set grows. Larger values of Ne produce more intense 
disparity not only for the number of edits performed by the editors 
(Fig. 2a), but also for the total data changes (in bytes) made by the 
editors (Fig. 2b). This increasing trend is still valid when addition 
and subtraction are performed separately (Fig. 2c,d). In addition, 
because the age of an article does not severely affect heterogene-
ity (Fig. 2e,f), the results of the variant of the Gini coefficient are 
consistent with our observation that the age of an article does not 
affect the current state of the communal data sets. We predict that 
heterogeneity becomes more severe if a given data set is edited more 
frequently. No notable differences among different written scripts 
of Wikimedia projects (see Supplementary Fig. 19) and the institu-
tional objectives of different Wikimedia projects (see Supplementary 
Figs. 20 and 21) were observed. To summarize, based on the current 
snapshot of the communal data set, we observed that the universal 
pattern of heterogeneity increases with the number of edits.
Evidence for the establishment of supereditor dominance. We 
have shown that current Wikimedia projects exhibit a high level 
of heterogeneity and that a variant of the Gini coefficient increases 
with the number of edits (Fig. 2). Although the current status of all 
Wikimedia projects appears to follow a specific function of Ne, this 
could be coincidental. Thus, we further tracked the actual history of 
individual Wikimedia projects to confirm or reject the possibility 
of such a coincidence, so that we could determine if the trend for 
increasing inequality in contributions is inherent to the formation 
of communal data sets. We set the initial number of edits of all 863 
data sets to the same value (Ne(t =​ 0) =​ 0) and recorded the trajec-
tories of the variant of the Gini coefficient as functions of Ne (see 
Fig. 2g for the curve averaged over the data sets, which also shows 
the standard deviation). Following the conventional use of the Gini 
coefficient (used to measure inequality of income or wealth), we 
used the accumulated number of edits up to Ne (note that the unit 
of time in this case is Ne) for each editor, which captures the total 
contributions made by an editor. Technically, a variant of the Gini 
coefficient is undefined when a single editor has edited a data set, 
since we defined the set of editors as the editors who have contrib-
uted at least once; however, we take a variant of the Gini coefficient 
as 1 because it describes the completely monopolized state well. Our 
result shows that the average of the variant of the Gini coefficient 
coincides with the current status of Wikimedia projects (Fig. 2g); 
thus, the current status of a specific data set can be taken as the 
midpoint of a single master curve described as a function of Ne. For 
example, a history of the Cebuano edition of Wikipedia clearly fol-
lows the typical growth pattern for Ne >​ 104 (Fig. 2h), except for the 
initial fluctuations due to small values of Ne.
Although we employed a variant of the Gini coefficient as a 
measure of inequality in the distribution of accumulated total con-
tributions, which parallels the conventional use of the coefficient 
to characterize inequality in wealth, an alternative approach of the 
coefficient is widely used to capture inequality due to time-bound 
contributions. In economics, income is defined as the value gained 
within a specific time frame24. Similarly, we considered the number 
of edits for individual editors per unit time frame as the ‘income’ 
variable in the Gini coefficient; this is called ‘time-bound contribu-
tions’, unless otherwise specified. In other words, the ‘total contribu-
tions’ analysed previously are the accumulated contributions from 
the onset of an individual editor’s first activity. In this analysis, we 
used the time window of 104 edits, but different time frame values 
do not meaningfully affect the result. With regard to the distribu-
tion of time-bound contributions for the communal data set as a 
function of Ne, the variant of the Gini coefficient indicates that the 
larger Ne values suggest less marked heterogeneity in contributions 
(Fig. 2i). Indeed, it suggests that the distribution of time-bound 
contributions becomes more homogeneous with time (Fig. 2i), 
whereas disparity in the total distribution of contributions is main-
tained (Fig. 2g).
Therefore, for all editors, the heterogeneity in the total distri-
bution of contributions intensifies over time, whereas disparity 
in contributions per time frame becomes less severe with time. To 
consolidate the two results, we examined in detail how the ‘rich get 
richer’ concept affects the communal data set. Fig. 3a,b suggest that 
editors not only tend to keep their short-term social positions, but 
also maintain their long-term social positions. For instance, 58.1% of 
editors remain in the [0%, 10%] rank range (10% from the top) for 
the next 104 edits if editors are ranked in the [0%, 10%] range (10% 
from the top) in the 990,000 ≤​ Ne <​ 1,000,000 time window; mean-
while, only 32.6% of editors are ranked in the [0%,90%] range, that is, 
except for the bottom 10%, editors retain their positions (Fig. 3a). In 
other words, editors who edit more often within a specific time win-
dow tend to edit more often in other time windows also. Although 
the exact proportion and number of edits for each percentile vary 
over time, the distinction among different groups of editors classi-
fied according to the level of contributions is preserved. As a result, a 
hierarchical structure between editors is gradually established.
The trend is even clearer for the accumulated number of edits 
(Fig. 3b). Early on, only highly ranked editors, whose number of 
contributions are much larger than the median, maintain the posi-
tions represented by their cumulative number of edits up to that 
time. Meanwhile, editors whose number of contributions are much 
smaller than the median change their positions in the editing hier-
archy more frequently. For every percentile, over time the percentile 
of revisiting editors becomes more associated with their previous 
class; eventually, this groups most editors under a stratified percen-
tile. Therefore, solid classes are established at a very early stage and 
remain thus for a long time. The oligopoly of supereditors is thus 
clear8,9. We have not only revisited the existence of such an oligopoly; 
we have also observed how its degree of influence changes as more 
edits are performed. The territories of these editing conglomerates 
extend beyond single articles and span the entire Wikimedia project 
community; their leverage on Wikipedia is still growing (Fig. 3b).
To understand the formation of the considerable share of such 
supereditors, we further examined the interrelationship between 
the number of edits in two consecutive editing sequences in various 
time windows from the onset of the data set (Fig. 3c). We calculated 
the Pearson’s correlation coefficient between the lists of number of 
edits in two successive time frame windows for an editor. Initially, 
the two consecutive sequences of number of edits are highly corre-
lated across various lengths of time-frame windows; however, short-
term correlations gradually decrease as more edits are performed. 
In addition, a boundary between the high- (correlation ⪆​ 0.7) and 
low-correlated (correlation ⪅​ 0.7) domains builds over time; conse-
quently, only long-term correlation is maintained.
In light of this information, the results shown in Fig. 3 explain 
the results shown in Fig. 2g,i; the disparity in the total distribution

of contributions is preserved by long-term correlations, whereas the 
disparity in the time-bound distribution of contributions is steadily 
resolved due to the decline of short-term correlations. Although the 
short-term activities of editors may vary, the dominance of a few 
editors is not resolved in the long-term because such dominance is 
established at a very early stage of the communal data set.
Other collaborative knowledge creation. One clear advantage 
of investigating online data such as Wikimedia projects is that we 
can identify individual contributions in the formation of collective 
knowledge. On the other hand, observing ubiquitous growth pat-
terns and the formation of strong heterogeneity also prompts a key 
question: is the early onset of heterogeneity specific to the creation 
of online communal data sets? In other words, is it also possible to 
find similar growth patterns in conventional knowledge formation 
processes? Although the Internet revolution has meant that online 
media play an important role in constructing and spreading knowl-
edge in the twenty-first century, conventional platforms remain a 
major route for disseminating expertise. To explore the wider land-
scape of collective knowledge formation, we extended our analysis 
to academic papers and patents, two pivotal media of traditional 
knowledge formation and dissemination.
For our analysis, we used patent data from the spring 2017 edi-
tion of the European Patent Office Worldwide Patent Statistical 
Database and academic paper data from a 22 August 2017 dump of 
the entire Scopus Custom Data in XML format (see Supplementary 
Methods for details). For the patent data set, we assumed that 91 dis-
tinct patent offices play roles analogous to the different editions of 
the Wikimedia projects. Similarly, we also considered each author’s

an article in the Wikimedia projects. Unfortunately, it is impossible

participants for each country. In addition, unlike the Wikimedia 
projects, the time frame of our patent/academic paper data set 
does not cover the very beginning of this knowledge platform. 
Considering the long history of patents and academic papers, we 
could examine only a small contemporary subset, specifically from 
2000 for the patents and 1996 for the academic papers.
Based on our analysis of the Wikimedia projects, one may expect 
the existence of a general rule between the number of participants 
and the number of patents/academic papers. We found strong posi-
tive correlations between measures for both patents and academic 
papers (Supplementary Figs. 22 and 23). Specifically, the Pearson’s 
correlation coefficient for the number of patents and the number 
of inventors (who originally designed the technology) is ρ =​ 0.85, 
whereas it is ρ =​ 0.74 for the number of applicants who originally 
filed the patent to obtain intellectual property rights. The statistics 
of academic papers show a larger Pearson’s correlation coefficient of 
ρ =​ 0.97 for the number of articles and authors.
Our finding of general growth patterns across conventional and 
online knowledge platforms prompted us to seek possible inequali-
ties among participants of conventional knowledge formation. Once 
more, we employed a variant of the Gini coefficient to measure the 
degree of inequality between players in conventional knowledge 
formation. As with the Wikimedia projects, the heterogeneity of 
both patents and academic papers grows due to the increasing func-
tion of the number of participants and research outputs. In contrast 
to the steep increase observed in the Wikimedia projects, patent and 
academic paper data sets show a more gradual increase (compare 
Supplementary Figs. 21–23), yet the variant of the Gini coefficient 
is high (≃​0.8) for the leading countries in terms of research out-
put. In summary, an early rise in the disparity among participants 
is a unique phenomenon of online communal data sets, whereas, 
more generally, growing disparity seems to be a common feature of 
human knowledge formation.
Agent-based model of heterogeneity formation. To elucidate the 
dynamics involved in the formation of the supereditors’ oligopoly, 
we introduced an agent-based model by assuming that different 
variables affect the motivation for performing edits. We assumed 
that two fundamental and inherent motivations decrease over time; 
they govern the short-term and long-term behaviours of the editors. 
Our primary purpose was to examine the separate effects of these 
two motivations. Besides these two factors, editors become deeply 
involved in certain articles when they have put in great effort to edit 
the articles25; this represents a form of attachment to the articles. In 
the following section, we describe in detail how we implemented 
these effects into our mathematical model.
Model description. Previously, we observed an early increase in 
the inequality coefficient as a function of Ne that acts as a time unit 
in the Wikimedia projects. Accordingly, we set a single edit as the 
time unit t. The model begins with a single agent. Each agent repre-
sents a single editor who participates in the editing process. A single 
medium represents the communal data set or a single language 
edition of a Wikimedia project. In our model, we considered the 
actions of editors to be driven by a set of motivations, and intro-
duced parameters for editors to describe their activities. First, for 
an editor i, we denoted the accumulated number of edits as Ni(t) at 
time t. Next, we specified the time of the first edit by an editor as tb;i 
and the time when the last edit occurred as te;i. The dynamic rules 
are as follows: for each simulation step, the debut of a new agent and 
the return (or re-edit) by an already existing agent occur in turns; 
for every simulation step, a new agent appears with a constant prob-
ability b and begins to participate in the editing process; once a new 
agent appears in the data set at time Ne, the agent edits the data set 
at the time of its entry into the system so that tb;i and te;i are assigned 
as Ne, and the time unit t is increased by 1 (the unit of the edit num-
ber). Note that the time scale of Ne for the model and data is not 
identical because the time scale of the model can vary with system 
size and differing parameters.
In the second step, an editor chosen uniformly at random 
attempts to edit the data set. Many factors affect the motivation 
for the editing, but we assumed three: (1) the decrease in motiva-
tion to edit over the long term; (2) the inertia of continuing the 
action; and (3) the attachment editors have for an article, which 
is increased by the past contributions they have made. In general, 
editors are highly motivated at the beginning of their participa-
tion, but their motivation fades steadily26,27. Thus, participants 
diminish their engagement as time goes by; this is modelled by 
the power-law decay as factor (t −​ tb;i)−k, where k represents the 
decay in motivation that is observed in many temporally varying 
systems28,29. In addition, a fat-tailed distribution is observed for 
the time between consecutive edits8; this suggests that the editing 
time scale of Wikipedia shows a bursty . The inertia of continu-
ing the (editing) action means that it is harder to edit when the 
interval between an editor’s latest editing te;i and the current time 
t increases28,30,31. This inertia is modelled as 
+
τ
−−

(

e;
, where 
τ represents the characteristic sustaining time of the inertia in 
this stimulation. Finally, editors tend to be more engaged when 
they have already participated more frequently in the past8,25. The 
number of edits is assigned 1 at the time of first participation of 
the editor; this value increases by unity every time an agent partic-
ipates in the editing process, so that it is equivalent to the number 
of edits Ni(t) up to the time point t.

editor is in both sequences; in that case, we set the value to 1 by convention because it corresponds to complete editing dominance by that editor.

Once an agent decides to participate, te;i is newly set as t +​ 1 and Ni(t 
+​ 1) =​ Ni(t) +​ 1. In addition, we also included the possibility for an 
agent to abandon the editing process permanently, this departure 
being based on the loss of motivation to edit26,27. Therefore, in our 
model, agents leave the system when they choose not to edit and 
Pi[t;Ni(t),tb;i,te;i] <​ r, where r is a pre-assigned cutoff parameter com-
mon to all editors. In the next section, we provide some evidence 
that inequality is created by these factors, regardless of the personal 
characteristics of an individual editor.
Model results. Previously, we have shown that the variant of the 
Gini coefficient increases as the number of edits increases. The 
variant of the Gini coefficient increases rapidly at the early stage of 
data set formation and stabilizes at a high value (⪆​0.8 for Ne ⪆​ 104, 
see Fig. 2). The results of our model result are consistent with the 
empirical observations. With regard to the model data set, the vari-
ant of the Gini coefficient rapidly increases until a high value is 
reached at Ne ≃​ 105 for k =​ 0.8 (compare Fig. 4a with Fig. 2g). Smaller 
k values yield a slower increase in the variant of the Gini coefficient, 
whereas τ does not affect it significantly. The coefficient does not 
reach a high value (≃​1) if we assign k ⪆​ 1; this suggests that a moder-
ate decrease in motivation is essential to reproduce the current state 
of the communal data sets. With regard to the time-bound distri-
bution of contributions, the variant of the Gini coefficient displays 
results from our model that are similar to those from the data. For 
k =​ 0.8, the variant of the Gini coefficient for time-bound contribu-
tions steadily decreases from Ne ≃​ 105 (Fig. 4b), which is observed in 
the data for Ne ⪆​ 105 (Fig. 2i).
It may be suggested that, with regard to time-bound contribu-
tions, the early tendency of our model (Ne ⪅​ 105) for the variant of 
the Gini coefficient disagrees with the data. In addition, undulation 
points that are absent in the data are observed at Ne ≃​2 ×​ 104 for the 
variant of the Gini coefficient with regard to the total contributions 
in cases other than k =​ 0.8. Although our model reproduces the pat-
terns in the data at a later stage (Ne ⪆​ 105 for k =​ 0.8), this seemingly 
different growth pattern at an early stage should be stressed. First, 
as a minimalist model, we do not intend to reproduce the inherent 
disparity due to the characteristics of an agent, for example, social 
class, educational level and language fluency. Furthermore, we do 
not intend to explain the data all the way from the complex early 
procedure, when people launch a new project, that is available to 
a limited number of users, such as (1) language proposal and (2) 
incubator. The dynamics of this early stage is very different from the 
public launch of a project. Despite such discrepancies, our model 
starts with a regular dynamics from the very first agent and shows 
an early stabilizing period. The relationship between the number of 
editors and the number of edits in the model also displays two dif-
ferent stages (Supplementary Figs. 24–27). Although the transition 
point between two stages varies according to the specific values of k, 
we assume that this point may correspond to the undulation points 
for the variant of the Gini coefficient for total and time-bound con-
tributions (compare Fig. 4 with Supplementary Figs. 24–27).
In addition to the variant of the Gini coefficient, our model 
also reproduces the trend of decreased short-term correlations for 
the number of edits between time windows reported in Fig. 3c. As 
shown in Fig. 4c, the interrelationship between the number of edits 
in two consecutive sequences in various time frames, from the onset 
of the data set, produces a similar result. In the model and empirical 
data, we observed a significant correlation between two consecutive 
sequences regardless of sequence length. With time, the short-term 
correlation is steadily reduced, whereas the long-term correlation is 
sustained. Like the empirical data, the boundary delimiting the size 
of time windows between large- (⪆​0.7) and small-correlated (⪅​0.7) 
domains increases as more edits are performed (Fig. 4). The slope 
of a boundary is different for different k values, but τ does not affect 
the slope.
Briefly, the parameter k mainly governs the overall dynamics 
despite the fact that the rapid increase in inequality of total contribu-
tions happens at an early stage and the gradual decrease in inequal-
ity of time-bound contributions always occurs. In other words, the 
loss of long-term motivation induces the inequality, whereas the 
inertia of continuing the (editing) action does not affect the sys-
tem notably. Therefore, the ‘rich get richer’ effect is mainly driven 
by the accumulated engagement induced by previous edits. Such a 
long-term engagement has led to the formation of the supereditors’ 
oligopoly that is lasting to date. In addition, our model indicates 
that the supereditors’ oligopoly can be formed without direct com-
munication between editors.

projects. Although previous studies have reported these general 
patterns, they were usually based on partial observations of specific 
types of data sets or specific languages, leaving many unanswered 
questions5,8,12–14. The extensive data set represented by Wikimedia 
projects, which record large-scale collaboration for the online cre-
ation of collective knowledge, provided us with an unprecedented 
opportunity to explore human collaborative behaviours quantita-
tively. In this data set, we observed a universal interplay between 
the number of editors, articles and edits, and article size, which are 
characterized by power-law scaling with a single set of exponents. 
The existence of universal growth patterns in all 273 languages and 
12 types of Wikimedia projects suggests a pan-human behaviour 
with regard to collaboration.
This universal pattern is seen not only in the four key features 
of the data sets (number of edits, editors and articles, and article 
size), but also in their heterogeneity as quantified by the variant of 
the Gini coefficient; the disparity in who contributes the most is 
formed at a very early stage of the communal data sets and con-
tinues thereafter. It is widely hoped that communal data sets will 
bring about democratization of knowledge2, yet studies reveal that 
current Wikimedia projects are hampered by strong heterogeneity 
in editing8,9. We have demonstrated that heterogeneity between edi-
tors is more deep-rooted than expected. The existence of the supe-
reditors’ very substantial share is a universal phenomenon across 
all Wikimedia communal data sets, regardless of size and/or activ-
ity. We have also observed a universal trend of intensified dispar-
ity for all types of data sets, which suggests that the vast influence 
exerted by a few dedicated editors will be intensified further. The 
value of such dedicated editors must be acknowledged because their 
voluntary dedication has enabled the current level of accuracy in 
Wikipedia5,6. However, biased coverage of some topics has been 
reported; lost diversity may intensify systematic biases32–34, not-
withstanding Wikipedia’s continuing efforts towards neutrality. In 
addition, we have shown that a hierarchy of contributors in such 
communal data sets can be formed at a very early stage and that the 
polarization of editors is already underway.
Our study is not limited to a description of the current state of 
Wikimedia projects, but arguably provides a general insight into the 
future direction of communal data sets. For instance, our simulation 
suggests that inequality can arise without direct interaction between 
editors. Indeed, editors tend to obey pre-established authorities cre-
ated by supereditors9. Again, we acknowledge the dedication of supe-
reditors, for instance, in maintaining the high quality of Wikipedia 
content by their (by definition) large number of contributions to 
it5,35. However, the total productivity of each editor decreases as the 
number of edits increases, which may result in reduced productiv-
ity and accuracy in the future. The growth of Wikipedia has slowed 
down36, and our analysis warns that inequality in contributions can-
not be easily resolved without active efforts.
Since the turn of this century, Wikimedia projects have spear-
headed the international open knowledge market. However, when 
considering the nature of such a social structure, strategic actions 
are required to sustain its openness to worldwide collaborations. 
Giving incentives to new editors may help, but a suitable tutorial 
system that prevents vandalism and encourages productive edit-
ing activities is also needed. Fork-and-merge systems commonly 
used in open-source communities also improve the editability of 
Wikimedia projects by serving as a secondary talk pages method 
where editors can debate. With the fork system, new editors fork 
their own versions of articles to share their ideas, which can be 
merged with the original article following discussion and debate.
Our findings provide evidence of imbalances in the formation 
of a particular set of communal data from the outset, but the results 
and implications of our study are relevant beyond Wikimedia 
projects. With the Internet being such a central aspect of daily 
life, online environments have become a mainstream platform for  
collaborative knowledge creation. Therefore, researchers have 
started to study the contribution patterns in various communal 
data sets, such as open-source and free software37–40. Compared to 
traditional (offline) collaboration systems, the products of online 
collaboration are immediately available in a collaborative fashion. 
Future analyses of GitHub, Apache, GNU software, free software 
and copyleft will contribute to a more detailed landscape of collab-
orative knowledge creation. These analyses can further our under-
standing of human collective behaviours, and, we hope, provide 
clues to address social inequalities at an even larger scale.
Methods
Data description. We used the March 2016 dump of all Wikimedia projects 
(https://dumps.wikimedia.org/backup-index.html), which contains the complete 
copy of Wikimedia articles from the 15 January 2001 to 5 March 2016, including 
the raw text and metadata in XML format. This data set not only includes 
Wikipedia, but also its sibling collaborative projects, such as Wiktionary, 
Wikibooks, Wikiquote, Wikisource, Wikinews, Wikiversity and Wikivoyage 
in different languages (see Supplementary Table 1 for further details). Each of 
these openly edited projects has a distinct subject and object. For example, each 
language edition of Wiktionary aims to describe all words of all languages. For 
example, the English edition of Wiktionary aims to describe all words of all 
languages using definitions and descriptions in English. Differences between 
objects may yield gaps in the editing behaviours of editors belonging to each 
project, which is caused by a difference in demographic pools, accessibility, 
degree of interest, and so on.
This data contains a total of 267,304,095 articles across all Wikimedia projects 
with their complete editing histories. Each article documents either the Wikimedia 
account identification or the Internet protocol address of the editor for each edit, 
the article size, the timestamp for each edit, and so on. A single character takes 
one byte, except for a few languages such as Korean (two bytes) and Chinese (two 
or three bytes); thus, article size in bytes is a direct measure of article length41. 
Each data set contains a number of articles ranging from 43,124,816 (Wikimedia 
Commons, a database of freely usable audiovisual media) to 3 (Wikipedia Login, 
a database used for administrative purposes); the number of editors ranges from 
44,349,908 (English Wikipedia) to 5 (Wikipedia Nostalgia, a read-only copy of the 
old English language Wikipedia); the number of edits ranges from 654,163,757 
(English Wikipedia) to 14 (Wikipedia Login); and the total article size ranges from 
99,519,138,751 bytes (English Wikipedia) to 1,206 bytes (Wikipedia Login) (see 
Supplementary Fig. 2 for the distributions of various measures).
Estimation of power exponent for the correlation between Ne, Np, Na and S. 
To estimate the power-law scaling relationship between measures, we applied 
a simple linear regression method to the logarithm of the values of interest, 
assuming a simple power-law scaling of y =​ Cxλ. Inevitably, various types of 
noise and fluctuations affected the empirical observations, so the distribution 
should in fact be written as y =​ k(x/xmin)λ +​ κ +​ η, where xmin is the minimum 
value of x from which the power-law is observed, κ is the constant background 
offset and η represents random fluctuations. We neglected the noises and 
fluctuations to obtain the overall collective trends for all Wikimedia projects. 
This simple method has clear advantages over complex multivariate regression; 
it is less sensitive to the heterogeneous disparity in empirical distribution. The 
aforementioned power-law scaling can be transformed as ln(y) =​ λln(x) +​ ln(C). 
We performed simple linear regression on the logarithmic values of ln(x) 
and ln(y) to yield the exponent λ and the proportionality constant C (see 
Supplementary Tables 2–7 for the statistical details).

Reporting Summary
Nature Research wishes to improve the reproducibility of the work that we publish. This form provides structure for consistency and transparency 
in reporting. For further information on Nature Research policies, see Authors & Referees and the Editorial Policy Checklist.
Statistical parameters
When statistical analyses are reported, confirm that the following items are present in the relevant location (e.g. figure legend, table legend, main 
text, or Methods section).
n/a Confirmed
The exact sample size (n) for each experimental group/condition, given as a discrete number and unit of measurement
An indication of whether measurements were taken from distinct samples or whether the same sample was measured repeatedly
The statistical test(s) used AND whether they are one- or two-sided 
Only common tests should be described solely by name; describe more complex techniques in the Methods section.
A description of all covariates tested
A description of any assumptions or corrections, such as tests of normality and adjustment for multiple comparisons
A full description of the statistics including central tendency (e.g. means) or other basic estimates (e.g. regression coefficient) AND 
variation (e.g. standard deviation) or associated estimates of uncertainty (e.g. confidence intervals)
For null hypothesis testing, the test statistic (e.g. F, t, r) with confidence intervals, effect sizes, degrees of freedom and P value noted 
Give P values as exact values whenever suitable.
For Bayesian analysis, information on the choice of priors and Markov chain Monte Carlo settings
For hierarchical and complex designs, identification of the appropriate level for tests and full reporting of outcomes
Estimates of effect sizes (e.g. Cohen's d, Pearson's r), indicating how they were calculated
Clearly defined error bars 
State explicitly what error bars represent (e.g. SD, SE, CI)
Our web collection on statistics for biologists may be useful.
Software and code
Policy information about availability of computer code
Data collection

Study description
We analysed the activities in the entire Wikimedia projects with four characteristic measures (number of articles, number of edits, 
number of editors, and total size in bytes) and an inequality index (a variant of the Gini index). 
Research sample
We used the complete editing history of 267,304,095 Wikimedia items until 2016.
Sampling strategy
No sample size calculation was executed due to the design of the research.
Data collection
All data was independently collected by the Wikimedia foundations, OECD, UNESCO, CIA, SIL International, SCOPUS, and European Patent 
Office.
Timing
All data was collected between 2000 and 2016.
Data exclusions
No data were excluded.
Non-participation
No participant dropped out of participation.
Randomization
In the model study, we assigned random seed of the random number generators.
