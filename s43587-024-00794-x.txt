DNA methylation marks have recently been used to build models known as 
epigenetic clocks, which predict calendar age. As methylation of cytosine 
promotes C-to-T mutations, we hypothesized that the methylation changes 
observed with age should reflect the accrual of somatic mutations, and the 
two should yield analogous aging estimates. In an analysis of multimodal 
data from 9,331 human individuals, we found that CpG mutations indeed 
coincide with changes in methylation, not only at the mutated site but 
with pervasive remodeling of the methylome out to ±10 kilobases. This 
one-to-many mapping allows mutation-based predictions of age that 
agree with epigenetic clocks, including which individuals are aging more 
rapidly or slowly than expected. Moreover, genomic loci where mutations 
accumulate with age also tend to have methylation patterns that are 
especially predictive of age. These results suggest a close coupling between 
the accumulation of sporadic somatic mutations and the widespread 
changes in methylation observed over the course of life.
Practically since the elucidation of the DNA double helix, it has been 
postulated that progressive damage to this fundamental structure is the 
cause of aging1,2. The primary support for this theory relates to somatic 
mutations, which accumulate in the genomes of most tissues and spe-
cies throughout life2–4. Such accumulation has been associated with 
multiple characteristics of old age, including immune dysfunction5, 
neurodegeneration6,7 and cancer8.
Aging has also been associated with other major types of molecular 
changes beyond DNA mutations, leading to a debate on which of these 
aging ‘hallmarks’ are fundamental causes9,10. In particular, much recent 
attention has been given to associations of age with DNA methyla-
tion, a dynamic epigenetic mark found primarily at CG dinucleotides 
(CpG sites) throughout the genome11. CpG methylation has diverse 
functional consequences, including X chromosome inactivation12, 
chromatin and transcriptional regulation13, cell-type specification 
and maintenance of pluripotency14–16. DNA methylation patterns have 
been found to change regularly over the course of life, prompting the 
creation of statistical models termed ‘epigenetic clocks’, which attempt 
to predict an individual’s age using their DNA methylation profile17,18. 
Subsequent research has shown that epigenetic clock predictions 
correlate with a host of age-related biological attributes, including 
frailty, Alzheimer’s disease, all-cause mortality and time to death19–22. 
Such observations have bolstered epigenetic theories of aging, which 
propose that progressive remodeling of the epigenome leads to aging 
phenotypes through the dysregulation of gene expression, cellular 
function and senescence23–25. However, the degree to which epigenetic 
changes are direct causes of aging remains unclear.
Despite the separate interest in DNA mutations and DNA methyla-
tion as theories of aging, the relationship between the two processes 
is not well understood. One recent study reported that somatic muta-
tions in DNA-binding sites for ten–eleven translocation methylcytosine 
dioxygenase 1 (TET1), the primary enzyme involved in the removal of 
methylation marks26, are associated with local hypermethylation27. 
Another demonstrated an association among somatic mutations, 
subsequent clonal expansion of blood cells and accelerated epigenetic 
aging28. Most other research linking DNA sequence and methylation has 
focused on inherited germline variants rather than acquired somatic 
mutations, such as efforts to identify methyl quantitative trait loci

methylation related to the frequency of reads with the mutant allele 
(Pearson’s r = −0.17, P = 2.08 × 10−53; Fig. 1d and Extended Data Fig. 2g). 
These results support a model in which CpG mutations occur primar-
ily at hypermethylated sites (due to the spontaneous deamination 
of methylcytosine) and can become fixed in the genome of daughter 
cells, causing a decrease in observed methylation corresponding to 
the mutated clonal population.
Mutated sites show extensive remodeling of the surrounding 
methylome
During this exploration, we noted numerous cases in which somatic 
mutations coincided not only with hypomethylation at the mutated 
CpG site but also with atypical methylation of numerous CpGs in the 
surrounding genome. An illustrative example was the C > T mutation at 
base pair 56,642,556 of chromosome 16 in the individual TCGA-GV-A3QI 
(Fig. 2a). CpG sites adjacent to this somatic mutation were strikingly 
hypermethylated in this individual, with such hypermethylation 
extending over a contiguous region more than 30 kilobases (kb) down-
stream. This effect encompassed the metallothionein 2A gene (MT2A) as 
well as additional metallothionein family members (MT1E and MT1M), 
for which methylation-linked repression has been associated with 
metastasis in multiple cancer types39–42.
To move beyond anecdotal observations, we devised a general test 
for whether somatic mutations are associated with remodeled methyla-
tion at surrounding CpGs. We computed a quantity we called ΔMFw, the 
median change in methylation fraction observed for CpGs within a win-
dow of ±w kb near a mutated site, comparing the mutated individual to 
matched nonmutated individuals (Fig. 2b and Methods). Examination 
of ΔMF1 kb values at increasing distances from mutated sites revealed 
significantly greater methylation change at these sites compared to 
randomly chosen nonmutated sites, with this effect extending for up 
to ±10 kb (Fig. 3a and Methods). Calculating the methylation change 
across this entire ±10-kb range, we observed that ΔMF10 kb tended 
toward substantially more extreme values than expected at random 
(n = 2,600 mutated sites with sufficient nearby CpGs, P < 10−124; Fig. 3b), 
with mutated loci more than four times as likely to have an extreme 
decrease in nearby methylation (ΔMF10 kb of <−0.3; Fig. 3c). Mutated 
loci were also enriched for nearby methylation increases (similar to 
the example in Fig. 2a), albeit more weakly (Fig. 3c). This phenomenon 
was observed in all tissue types for which we had data (Extended Data 
Fig. 3a). Overall, 15.5% of mutated sites had a more extremely positive or 
negative ΔMF10 kb than expected (against a reference of random control 
sites, |z score| > 1.96; Methods).
Deeper explorations showed that the methylation increases and 
decreases (1) have a direction of change that depends on local CpG den-
sity (that is, whether they are inside CpG islands13; Fig. 3d and Extended 
Data Fig. 3d), (2) are specific to the genomic context, enriched for being 
mutations to CpG sites (Fig. 3d) in intergenic regions (Extended Data 
Fig. 3e,f), and (3) increase with the fraction of DNA in the sample harbor-
ing the mutation (Fig. 3e and Extended Data Fig. 3g). In noncancerous 
tissues, methylation disturbances were found surrounding 8.0% of 
somatic mutations (|z score| > 1.96 compared to random control sites; 
Methods and Extended Data Fig. 4a), each extending for, on average, 
±1 kb from the site of mutation (Extended Data Fig. 4b). This decreased 
frequency and shorter range of effect may be attributed to the lower 
mutated allele frequency (MAF) of somatic mutations in normal tissues 
compared to tumor tissues (mean ± s.d. MAF: normal = 0.10 ± 0.013, 
tumor = 0.83 ± 0.24). These results indicate that our earlier observa-
tions were not anecdotal, but CpG mutations are generally associated 
with an atypical methylation pattern in the surrounding DNA.
Somatic mutations mirror epigenetic predictions of age
While mutation of any particular CpG site is exceedingly rare in the 
human population, and thus a poor predictor of age, its corresponding 
CpG methylation fraction varies regularly in a manner often associated 
linking common polymorphisms to methylation levels of specific 
CpG sites29,30.
An intrinsic biochemical connection between DNA mutation and 
methylation occurs at 5-methylcytosine residues3,31,32, which spontane-
ously deaminate over time to yield thymine33. A prerequisite for this 
mutational event is cytosine methylation, relating somatic mutation 
to prior epigenetic modification of DNA. Conversely, a prerequisite for 
DNA methylation is the presence of a CpG site, which may be eliminated 
by prior somatic mutation. Given this interdependence, we considered 
that the separate links that have been established between DNA muta-
tion and aging and between DNA methylation and aging might each 
reflect a common underlying process whereby methylation potenti-
ates mutation and/or mutation potentiates changes in methylation.
To explore this hypothesis, we set out to comprehensively examine 
the relationship between somatic DNA mutations and DNA methylation 
in large collections of human tissue samples characterized for both 
layers of molecular information. In what follows, we identify several 
types of interaction between somatic mutation and DNA methylation, 
both one-to-one and one-to-many (Extended Data Fig. 1a). Based on 
these findings, we use somatic mutations as a surrogate for epigenetic 
marks in measures of aging, indicating the degree to which epigenetic 
aging is explained by somatic mutations (Extended Data Fig. 1b). These 
results are initially demonstrated in cancer cohorts, which have by far 
the greatest numbers of individuals with matched DNA mutation and 
methylation profiles. We then show that our findings extrapolate to 
normal tissues drawn from the same patients.
Results
Genome-wide hypomethylation of mutated CpG sites
To study the connections between somatic mutations and DNA meth-
ylation marks, we first analyzed data from human patients cataloged 
in The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA)34–36 and the Pan-Cancer Analysis 
of Whole Genomes (PCAWG)37. Tumor biopsies had been drawn from a 
diversity of tissue types and characterized by whole-exome sequencing 
(TCGA, 8,680 exomes across 33 tissues) or whole-genome sequencing 
(PCAWG, 651 genomes across 3 tissues). In each case, DNA from the 
tumor sample was compared to a second DNA sample drawn from 
the same individual, with differences used to define somatic muta-
tions (typically comparing the tumor DNA sequence to that in whole 
blood; Methods). These data had been complemented by methylation 
profiling of the same tissues using the Illumina Infinium HumanMeth-
ylation450 BeadChip, which provides methylation fraction readouts 
(the fraction of DNA reads that are methylated) for approximately 
450,000 CpG sites across the entire genome38. To facilitate the valida-
tion of our findings in a nontumor context, we additionally obtained 
somatic mutation (n = 111) and DNA methylation (n = 187) profiles from 
normal, noncancerous tissues from a subset of these same individuals 
(Methods).
From these data, we considered all single base-pair substitution 
mutations (n = 3,457,875 mutation events) and CpG sites for which all 
individuals had a reliably measured methylation value (n = 326,751 
CpG sites; Methods and Extended Data Fig. 2a–d). Consistent with 
previous reports3,31, CpG sites were the most frequently mutated dinu-
cleotide, accounting for 13.5% of all somatic mutations across the 
genome (Fig. 1a). The vast majority of these were C > T transitions 
(82.3%; Extended Data Fig. 2e) occurring at CpG sites that tended to be 
more heavily methylated than average (Extended Data Fig. 2f).
We next asked whether individuals harboring a mutated CpG site 
exhibit lower detected levels of methylation at that site compared to 
nonmutated individuals (Fig. 1b). We reasoned that once mutated, 
the site would no longer constitute a CG dinucleotide, reducing its 
likelihood of methylation. Indeed, we found a significant decrease 
in detected methylation in individuals with a mutation at a CpG site 
compared to nonmutated individuals at the same site (Mann–Whitney 
P = 3.90 × 10−9; Fig. 1c and Methods), with the decrease of detected

with age17. However, we considered that the one-to-many relationship 
revealed by our previous analysis (Fig. 3), by which a single CpG muta-
tion maps to a broad profile of methylation changes in the surround-
ing DNA, might bridge this apparent gap between sporadic mutation 
accumulation and consistent methylation change. Accordingly, we 
compared two procedures for predicting human chronological age: 
the first using an individual’s profile of CpG methylation values, as in 
previous epigenetic aging models (methylation clock), and the sec-
ond using their profile of somatic mutations, including the counts of 
somatic mutations within 10 kb of each of these same CpGs (mutation 
clock; Methods and Fig. 4a). Evaluating these models using a nested 
cross-validation procedure (Methods), we found that the methylation 
clock predicted age with an accuracy of r = 0.83 (Pearson’s correlation), 
whereas the mutation clock had an accuracy of r = 0.67 (Fig. 4b,c). When 
predictions were examined within each tissue, both the mutation and 
methylation models were most accurate at predicting age in brain 
samples and least accurate in kidney and bone samples (Extended 
Data Fig. 5a).
Beyond their accuracies of age prediction, we found that the two 
clocks agreed significantly in several other key aspects. First, the pre-
dictions from both models were highly correlated across individuals 
(Pearson’s r = 0.74), and this relationship persisted even after control-
ling for calendar age (partial correlation = 0.45, P = 1.48 × 10−82; Fig. 4d 
and Methods). For example, for individuals predicted by mutations to 
be 1 year older than their calendar age, the methylation clock yielded 
a corresponding overprediction of 0.75 ± 0.53 years (mean ± s.d.). 
This same agreement in over-/underprediction of each individual 
(similarity in model residuals) was observed when comparing the 
mutation clock to previously published methylation clocks (Fig. 4e 
and Extended Data Fig. 6a,b)17,18,21. Second, CpG sites for which the sur-
rounding mutation burden was most associated with age also tended 
to have the most age-associated methylation values, as highlighted 
by the 80-fold greater-than-expected overlap among the top 1% of 
age-associated sites of each kind (Fig. 4f and Methods). One exam-
ple was CpG site cg19236454 (chr19:42,799,926), for which the local 
mutation burden progressively increased with age (±10 kb, r = 0.18), 
whereas the methylation of this site was progressively lost (r = −0.18; 
Fig. 4g). This overlap demonstrates a local coupling of age-related 
mutation accumulation and methylation change, independent of 
any clock or model.
To confirm that the synchronization between the mutation and 
methylation clocks is not unique to tumor tissues, we applied the 
same modeling procedure to normal tissues (n = 111 somatic mutation 
profiles, n = 187 methylation profiles). We found that models trained 
to predict chronological age from the mutation and methylation 
profiles of these normal tissues (1) were predictive of age (Pearson’s

Fig. 5b), (2) agreed in the age prediction of the same individuals as 
clocks trained on tumor data (Pearson’s r of normal versus tumor 
predicted age: mutation clocks = 0.79, methylation clocks = 0.89; 
Extended Data Fig. 5c,d) and (3) continued to exhibit an association 
between mutation and methylation age (partial correlation of normal 
clocks = 0.48, P = 0.0018; Methods and Extended Data Fig. 5e–g). 
Thus, mutation and methylation profiles were synchronized with 
respect to predictions of age (Fig. 4h), both globally (throughout 
the genome) and locally surrounding individual CpG sites, in normal 
and tumor tissues.
Discussion
In this study, we observed notable associations between CpG mutation 
and methylation at multiple scales. At the scale of single nucleotides, 
CpG sites altered by somatic mutation (the most frequent mutation 
type across the genome; Fig. 1a and Extended Data Fig. 2e,f) exhibit a 
decrease in detected methylation at that site (Fig. 1c,d). At a larger scale, 
such mutated sites coincide with sweeping methylation changes across 
numerous CpGs within the surrounding genomic region (Figs. 2 and 
3a–c). Plausibly as a result of this larger-scale relationship, individuals 
whose mutations indicate increased genomic age also tend to have 
older methylomes (Fig. 4d,h and Extended Data Fig. 5g).

A fundamental tension addressed in this study is that two indi-
viduals rarely share a somatic mutation at the same CpG site; thus, 
mutations would initially seem too sparse to explain the numerous 
CpG sites at which methylation reliably changes with age. However, 
our findings show that single mutations can correspond to appreciable 
shifts in the methylome, with a graded relationship that depends on 
the frequency of the mutated allele (that is, clonality of the mutant cell 
population; Fig. 3e). Consistent with these findings, we see that, within

sites with MAF ≥ 0.8, ≥15 matched individuals (individuals of the same tissue 
type within ±5 years of age) and one or more measured CpGs within the window. 
Random control sites include n = 260,000 nonmutated sites (Methods). The 
same was found when controlling for the initial methylation state of mutated 
and random loci (Extended Data Fig. 3b,c). The P value is shown for a two-sided 
Mann–Whitney test for a difference in median absolute deviation (MAD) of

ΔMF10 kb for mutated sites versus the probability of that ΔMF10 kb for nonmutated  
control sites. ΔMF10 kb is divided into equally spaced bins from −0.4 to 0.4.  
d, Enrichment of extreme ΔMF10 kb values at CpG sites and CpG islands. Top versus

mutations (bars, y axis) was considered for different types of sites, depending

Enrichment was compared to the genomic baseline (Methods), with significance 
determined by a one-sided binomial test. Significant enrichment (P ≤ 0.001) is 
marked with asterisks (***) and nonsignificant (P > 0.01) with ‘NS’. CpG islands 
are defined as genomic regions with ≥200 bp, ≥50% GC content and a high CpG 
occurrence. e, Boxplot of the absolute ΔMF10 kb value as a function of the MAF.

individuals of the same calendar age, mutation and methylation clocks 
agree on which individuals are aging faster or slower (Fig. 4d,e), and 
somatic mutations explain more than 50% of the variation in methyla-
tion age across individuals (Fig. 4d,h). Notably, this relationship can be 
observed directly, without relying on predictive modeling, in the colo-
calization of age-associated mutation and methylation sites (Fig. 4f,g).

Fig. 4 | Association among mutation age, methylation age and chronological 
age. a, Methylation clock: the methylation fractions of CpGs are used in a gradient 
boosted tree model to predict chronological age. Mutation clock: the count 
of mutations around the same CpGs are used in an identical model to predict 
chronological age. Both models incorporate similar covariates and whole-genome 
features (Methods). b, Scatter plot of human individuals, showing age predictions 
from the mutation model versus their chronological age. The plot includes 
n = 1,601 individuals with samples from five tissues (Methods). c, Similar to b but 
showing age predictions from the methylation rather than mutation model for 
the same individuals. d, Violin plots of the methylation age residual versus the 
mutation age residual (Methods). The plot includes the same individuals as in b 
and c. Pearson’s r refers to the correlation between the methylation age residual 
and the mutation age residual (that is, partial correlation, P = 1.48 × 10−82, two-
sided P value calculated based on the exact distribution of Pearson’s r modeled 
as a beta function). The central line of the inner boxplot represents the median; 
the edges of the box represent the interquartile range; and the whiskers represent 
1.5 times the interquartile range. e, Distribution of methylation age residuals for 
the same individuals as in b and c, computed according to each of four previous 
methylation clocks. ‘This study’ refers to the methylation clock shown in c 
(Methods). For each clock, the 20% (n = 320) of individuals with the youngest 
mutation age for their chronological age are shown in a lighter color (low mutation 
age residual), and the 20% (n = 320) of individuals with the oldest mutation age for 
their chronological age are shown in a darker color (high mutation age residual). 
The asterisks (***) indicate a significant (P ≤ 10−51) difference in distribution

mutation, are already established. The prior methylation of a CpG 
makes a subsequent somatic mutation more likely due to methylcy-
tosine deamination33. In turn, when either nucleotide of a CpG site 
is mutated, the site is no longer a CpG, substantially decreasing the 
likelihood of future methylation by a DNA methyltransferase43. For 
mutations exhibiting larger-scale gains or losses of methylation in 
the surrounding kilobases, it is conceivable that either methylation or 
mutation, or neither, could be the primary causal agent. The observed 
association between somatic mutation and local hypermethylation 
(Fig. 3b) may occur if hypermethylation creates an environment prone 
to methylcytosine deamination events, giving rise to rare somatic 
mutations embedded within hypermethylated regions. However, this 
model does not explain the frequently observed co-occurrences of 
mutations with neighboring hypomethylation throughout the genome 
(Fig. 3b), as hypomethylation should decrease, not increase, the local 
probability of mutation.
An alternative possibility is that mutations are the primary 
causes of subsequent changes in methylation. Mutations within the 
DNA-binding site of a methylase or demethylase enzyme could plau-
sibly affect enzyme activity, dysregulating the methylation state of 
the surrounding genome44–46. Such a relationship has been reported 
explicitly for somatic mutations in the DNA-binding sites of TET1, a 
demethylase, leading to local gains of methylation27. More broadly, it 
is well known that germline DNA sequence variants govern the meth-
ylation patterns of many CpG sites, affecting as many as 40% of CpGs 
throughout the genome (i.e. the effect underlying methyl quantitative 
trait loci)47. Somatic mutations in these sequences may yield effects 
on methylation analogous to those observed for inherited variants.
A third possibility is that mutation and methylation events are not 
causal of each other but both are downstream of some earlier event. 
One such event might relate to the repair of DNA double-strand breaks, 
which have been demonstrated to result in both somatic mutations and 
methylation changes near the site of repair48–50. Here, the mutation 
and methylation changes would be indicative of an earlier repair of 
double-strand breaks, an activity recently suggested to cause epige-
netic aging23. Similarly, the formation of 8-hydroxyguanine lesions has 
been associated with both somatic mutation and loss of methylation 
in the surrounding DNA51.
Regardless, understanding the causality among mutations, meth-
ylation and aging has important implications for how we seek to pre-
vent or reverse aging. In particular, if mutations are the fundamental 
driver of aging phenotypes, and epigenetic changes simply track this 
process, then strategies aimed at epigenetic reversal23,52–54 may be 
treating a symptom rather than a cause.
Some limitations of this study are as follows. First, most of the 
samples we analyzed came from tumor biopsies, as the current large 
human datasets measuring both somatic mutations and methylation 
pertain to cancer patients. While analyses of normal tissues from a sub-
set of these same individuals supported the findings in tumor tissues 
(Extended Data Figs. 5 and 7), the relevance of these findings to nor-
mative aging should be further examined in larger datasets of normal 
individuals and tissues by, for example, applying mutational clocks to 
independent datasets. This limitation notwithstanding, we note that 
mutation burdens in cancerous and normal tissues are similar55,56, and 
most mutations found in tumors are believed to represent normal 
mutational processes unrelated to cancer55,57. Second, most of the 
somatic mutations we analyzed were derived from exome sequenc-
ing, limiting our conclusions regarding the association of mutations 
with age and methylation to those regions. Third, our analysis was 
cross-sectional rather than longitudinal, with each individual measured 
at a single time point only. In the future, a longitudinal study design 
could greatly inform the actual order of events. Fourth, methylation 
values were assessed using Illumina 450k technology, which scores the 
methylation fractions of approximately 450,000 defined CpG sites 
through bisulfite conversion of unmethylated cytosines (to thymines) 
and subsequent oligonucleotide hybridization58. For CpGs at which the 
cytosine has been mutated (for example, to TpG), the technology will 
read out this mutation event as a loss of methylation, whether or not 
a concomitant loss of methylation has occurred. Finally, there exist 
other factors associated with epigenetic aging that do not explicitly 
implicate somatic mutations. Some epigenetic changes clearly reflect 
alterations in tissue composition with age59,60, and other changes are 
associated with the expression of developmental genes61,62, such as 
in the binding sites of the polycomb repressive complex63,64. Some of 
these factors may nonetheless relate to DNA mutations; for instance, 
somatic mutations can drive alterations in tissue composition65,66.
Methods
Data access and preprocessing
We obtained paired DNA methylation (Illumina 450k array) and somatic 
mutation data from two public consortia: TCGA34–36 and PCAWG37. 
Relevant to TCGA, we used the Pan-Can cohort (http://xena.ucsc.edu/), 
which includes 8,680 samples from 33 cancer types with both Illumina 
450k methylation data and somatic mutation calls. In addition to these 
tumor samples, we generated somatic mutation profiles from normal, 
noncancerous tissues of 111 TCGA individuals (see ‘Somatic muta-
tion identification’ in the Methods) and obtained DNA methylation 
profiles from normal tissues of 187 TCGA individuals (40 individuals 
had both normal somatic mutation and normal DNA methylation 
profiles). Data from the PCAWG consortium (https://xenabrowser.
net/datapages/?hub=https://pcawg.xenahubs.net:443) include 651 
samples from three cancer types with both Illumina 450k methylation 
array data and whole-genome somatic mutation calls. Methylation data 
from both cohorts were further processed as follows. First, we removed 
CpG sites for which any sample had a missing value, leaving 273,202 
CpG sites for TCGA and 326,749 CpG sites for PCAWG (Extended Data 
Fig. 2a–d). Second, we removed samples for which the mean methyla-
tion fraction (over all remaining CpGs) was more than 3 s.d. outside 
its expected (mean) value over all samples. Third, each sample was 
quantile normalized.
Somatic mutation identification
In addition to the somatic mutations called by the TCGA consortium in 
tumor tissues35 (n = 8,860 individuals), we identified somatic mutations 
in the normal tissues of individuals from TCGA who had DNA sequenc-
ing carried out in three locations: tumor, tumor-adjacent tissue and 
blood (n = 111). We called somatic mutations using Mutect2 (ref. 67) 
by comparing the tumor-adjacent DNA sequence to the blood DNA 
sequence in each individual. Mutect2 was run with default parameters 
following the tumor versus normal somatic mutation calling pipeline 
described by the Genome Analysis Toolkit (GATK) but treating the 
tumor-adjacent DNA sequence as the ‘tumor’ sample and the blood 
DNA sequence as the ‘normal’ sample (that is, reference) (https://gatk.
broadinstitute.org/hc/en-us/articles/360035531132--How-to-Call-som
atic-mutations-using-GATK4-Mutect2). In so doing, we identified vari-
ants present in the tumor-adjacent tissue that were not present in the 
blood of the same individual, indicating their somatic origin. The ger-
mline resources provided by the GATK were used to filter out common 
germline mutations67. Mutations at loci with coverage of fewer than 50 
reads in either the tumor-adjacent or blood sample were discarded.
Characterizing CpG mutation frequency
Based on the University of California, Santa Cruz, hg19 human genome 
annotations68, the number of nucleotides that comprise CpG residues 
equals 2 bp × 28,299,634 CpG sites, within a total genome length of 
3,137,144,693 bp. Therefore, 1.8% of randomly distributed mutations 
are expected to be CpG mutations, and the remaining 98.2% of muta-
tions are not (Fig. 1a). As CpG sites are palindromic, CG on one DNA 
strand is equivalent to GC on the complementary strand; thus, for 
simplicity, we refer to all CpG mutations on either strand as alterations

to the C residue in the first position. This convention was used to record 
the frequency of each dinucleotide sequence resulting from a CpG 
mutation (Extended Data Fig. 2e). For these cumulative analyses relat-
ing to the overall frequency of CpG mutation (Fig. 1a and Extended 
Data Fig. 2e,f), the PCAWG samples were used exclusively as they have 
whole-genome sequences, encompassing all CpG sites, rather than 
exome sequences only.
Characterizing methylation at mutated CpG sites
The methylation status of two categories of CpG sites was compared: 
‘nonmutated sites’, where no mutation was observed in any individ-
ual, and ‘mutated sites’, where at least one individual had a mutation 
(Fig. 1b). For CpG sites of the first category (265,399 nonmutated sites), 
the distribution of methylation fractions was plotted (Fig. 1c). For CpG 
sites of the second category (8,037 mutated sites), some individuals 
harbor a mutation at that particular CpG and some do not. In this case, 
the distributions of CpG methylation fractions were plotted separately 
for the mutated versus nonmutated individuals (Fig. 1c). For analyses of 
methylation associated with mutated CpG sites (Fig. 1c,d), tumor TCGA 
samples were used exclusively as there were many more occurrences 
of CpG mutations in this dataset due to its much larger sample size. 
We note that the effect of a CpG mutation on the overall methylation 
fraction of a tissue can be masked by nonmutated cells of that tissue 
having higher-than-expected methylation levels—this is a possible 
explanation for the rare increases in methylation observed at mutated 
CpG sites and the modest association between MAF and methylation 
change (Fig. 1d).
Calculating mutation-associated methylation change
Somatic mutation events were defined as site–sample pairs for which 
the nucleotide present at that site in that particular sample assumed a 
different (A, C, G, T) value than in the matched normal tissue (typically 
whole blood from the same sample). For each mutation event, the 
genomic ‘locus’ was defined as a ±w-kb window (upstream and down-
stream) proximal to the mutated site. Matched background samples 
were defined as those without any somatic mutations in this window 
and that were of the same tissue type and approximate age (±5 years) 
as the mutated sample (Figs. 2 and 3). Using these definitions, we cal-
culated ΔMFw, the median normalized change in methylation fraction 
mk,j at each measured CpG site k in the ±w-kb window surrounding 
mutated site i in mutated sample j relative to matched background 
samples b ∈background:
ΔMFi, j = mediank∈window(i,w) (mk, j −medianb∈background (mk,b))
Window (i, w) = {CpG sites within ± w from site i}
We calculated ΔMF in ±10-kb windows for each mutation event in 
the PCAWG data, where the mutation was a single base-pair substitu-
tion; there were at least 15 viable matched background samples; there 
was no other mutation within ±10 kb of the mutation in the mutated 
or matched background samples; the MAF was ≥0.8; and there was at 
least one CpG site within 10 kb of the mutated base (Fig. 3b,c). For the 
normal tissue TCGA data, we calculated ΔMF in ±1-kb windows at each 
mutation event, where the mutation was a single base-pair substitu-
tion; there were at least 10 viable matched background samples; there 
was no other mutation within ±10 kb of the mutation in the mutated 
or matched background samples; and there was at least one CpG site 
within 1 kb of the mutated base (Extended Data Fig. 4a–c). These cri-
teria left 2,600 and 463 mutation events for the tumor PCAWG and 
normal TCGA datasets, respectively. Random control events were 
chosen to create a background distribution of ΔMF values at genomic 
loci lacking somatic mutations in any sample. For each true muta-
tion event, we randomly chose 100 nonmutated nucleotides from the 
corresponding mutated sample and calculated ΔMF at these loci. To 
perform this calculation, we treated the randomly chosen nucleotide 
as if it were a mutation and calculated the ΔMF of CpG sites within ±1 
or ±10 kb (for normal TCGA or tumor PCAWG, respectively). To control 
for the initial methylation state, we repeated this analysis by selecting 
random control sites with a methylation profile matched (in terms of 
the median methylation fraction of comparison sites) to that of the 
matched samples of each true mutation event (Extended Data Fig. 3b,c). 
To quantify the frequency at which mutated sites had ΔMF values that 
were more extreme than expected, we calculated the z score of the 
ΔMF values at each mutated site relative to the distribution of ΔMF at 
all random control sites.
Extent of mutation-associated methylation remodeling
To investigate the extent of methylation remodeling associated with 
a somatic mutation, we computed ΔMF in a 1-kb window at increasing 
distances (up to 1 Mb) from each mutated and random control site. 
Then, we aligned these ΔMF1 kb values by their linear genomic distance 
from their respective mutated site to observe the marginal methylation 
change at each distance (Fig. 3a and Extended Data Fig. 4c).
CpG and CGI enrichment
The genomic background rate of CpG islands (CGIs) and CpGs was 
calculated based on the hg19 annotation69,70 (https://hgdownload.soe.
ucsc.edu/goldenPath/hg19/database/cpgIslandExt.txt.gz). The fre-
quency of CpGs in CGIs was based on previously published statistics31. 
To understand whether mutation type (CpG or non-CpG) and location 
(CGI or non-CGI) were related to the degree of mutation-associated 
methylation change, we divided the frequency of each mutation type 
by the expected genome-wide rate (‘fold enrichment’, focusing on the 
25% of mutation events with the most positive or negative ΔMF10 kb). A 
one-sided binomial statistic was used to test for an increase in muta-
tion frequency above the genomic background rate of each mutation 
type (Fig. 3d).
Clock datasets and features
The tumor tissue samples used for all clock-related analyses were from 
the LGG (low-grade glioma; brain), GBM (glioblastoma multiforme; 
brain 2), SARC (sarcoma; bone), KIRP (kidney renal papillary cell car-
cinoma; kidney) or THCA (thyroid carcinoma; thyroid) cancer types in 
TCGA (n = 1,601 individuals). Samples from normal tissues were chosen 
from these same tissue types as the tumor samples when available  
(n: thyroid = 23 individuals and kidney = 27 individuals), with the addi-
tion of two other tissue types chosen owing to their available sample 
size (n: colon = 34 individuals and liver = 27 individuals). Somatic muta-
tions in documented cancer genes71, as well as mutations within the 
25 genes having the highest mutation frequency for that tissue type, 
were removed to mitigate the influence of driving cancer genes on the 
analysis. Samples with a mutation burden greater than 3 s.d. from the 
mean mutation burden of that tissue were discarded. We created a 
shared feature set for training all clock models, selecting the 100,000 
CpG sites with the greatest average somatic mutation burden across 
samples within ±10 kb of the CpG site.
Mutation clock
The mutation clocks were based on a gradient boosted tree model, 
an XGBoost Regressor72 with default parameters, which we trained to 
predict chronological age using features derived from somatic muta-
tions at the 100,000 CpG sites described above. A separate model 
was trained for the tumor (n = 1,601) and normal (n = 111) samples 
because of the different rates of mutation accumulation and muta-
tional patterns, as described in previous literature3,73. The features 
used to describe an individual sample were (1) the counts of all somatic 
mutations within ±10 kb of each CpG site (‘mutation burden’; Fig. 4a), 
(2) the one-hot-encoded tissue type, (3) the genome-wide mutation

burden, summing the MAFs across all 100,000 CpG sites, and (4) the 
mutation burden associated with each possible trinucleotide context 
(for example, CCT > CTT or TCT > TTT). To assess the influence of the 
whole-genome features (3 and 4), we also constructed models with 
only local mutation counts and tissue type (Extended Data Fig. 7). 
When the genome-wide features were removed from the models, the 
performance of the methylation clocks was unchanged (tumor: Pear-
son’s r = 0.83; normal: Pearson’s r = 0.92; Extended Data Fig. 7a,b); the 
mutation clocks remained significantly predictive of age (tumor: Pear-
son’s r = 0.53, P = 1.54 × 10−113; normal: Pearson’s r = 0.73, P = 9.8 × 10−08; 
Extended Data Fig. 7a,b); and the two measures continued to agree in 
the over-/underprediction of age in the same individuals (tumor: partial 
correlation = 0.51, P = 6.66 × 10−105; normal: partial correlation = 0.52, 
P = 5.32 × 10−04; Extended Data Fig. 7c,d). For the tumor tissues, the 
accuracy of age prediction was assessed using nested cross-validation, 
in which 64% of samples were used for model training, 16% for hyperpa-
rameter tuning and 20% for testing, with this entire procedure repeated 
over five folds (Fig. 4b and Extended Data Figs. 5 and 7). As relatively 
few normal tissue samples were available (n = 111), we assessed the 
performance of the normal tissue mutation clock only on the normal 
samples for which we had both mutation and methylation profiles 
(n = 40) to maximize the number of samples used in training while not 
reducing the number with calculable mutation and methylation ages. 
Here, we conducted a similar nested cross-validation procedure in 
which, in each fold, we held out 20% of the normal samples with both 
data types for testing (n = 8 samples each fold) and performed training 
and hyperparameter tuning on the remaining samples (n = 71 samples 
with only mutation data and n = 32 samples with both data types). Fol-
lowing hyperparameter tuning, the number of features selected for use 
in the trained tumor mutation clock model ranged from 1,189 to 1,293 
with a mean of 1,237.2 across folds and from 307 to 344 with a mean of 
322 across folds for the normal tissue mutation clock.
Methylation clock
The methylation clock was also based on an XGBoost Regressor model, 
with identical parameters72 as for the mutation clock described above. 
A separate model was trained for the tumor (n = 1,601) and normal 
(n = 187) samples. The definition of features was also closely matched, 
focusing on the same 100,000 CpG sites but using methylation rather 
than mutation data. In particular, the features used to describe an 
individual sample were (1) the methylation fraction of each CpG, (2) the 
one-hot-encoded tissue type and (3) the overall degree of genome-wide 
methylation, computed as the sum of methylation fraction values 
across all 100,000 CpG sites (Fig. 4a,c and Extended Data Fig. 5). Mod-
els without the global feature were also constructed for comparison 
(Extended Data Fig. 7). Nested cross-validation was performed as for 
the mutation clock. Following hyperparameter tuning within each 
fold of cross-validation, the number of features selected for use in the 
trained tumor methylation clock ranged from 5,131 to 5,221 with a mean 
of 5,171.8 across cross-validation folds and from 1,987 to 2,139 with a 
mean of 2,051 for the normal methylation clock.
Application of existing clocks
The Hannum, Horvath and PhenoAge clocks were refitted to the TCGA 
pan-cancer dataset. This step was necessary as some CpG sites included 
in these clocks did not have methylation values passing quality controls 
(see ‘Data access and preprocessing’ in the Methods). The remain-
ing 66%, 63% and 61% of features were used in the refitted Hannum, 
Horvath and PhenoAge clocks, respectively. Briefly, the CpGs used in 
these clocks were obtained from the respective publications17,18,21, and 
an elastic-net regression model74 with default parameters was trained 
on these features to predict the chronological age of TCGA samples. 
Nested fivefold cross-validation was used to assess the performance 
of each of the previously published clocks before refitting (Extended 
Data Fig. 6a) and all clocks (including the clock trained in this study) 
after being refitted to the TCGA data (Extended Data Fig. 6b). For each 
sample, the residual of each methylation clock was compared to the 
residual of the mutation clock (Fig. 4e).
Local association of methylation, mutation burden and age
Across the 1,601 individuals and 100,000 CpG loci used in the tumor 
mutation and methylation clocks, we compared the association 
between the methylation fraction of each CpG site, its mutation bur-
den in the surrounding 20 kb and the chronological age of the samples 
(Fig. 4f). First, we calculated the Pearson’s correlation coefficient 
between chronological age and the quantile-normalized methylation 
fraction and mutation burden (±10 kb) at each CpG locus. Second, we 
selected the 1%, 5% and 10% of CpG sites with the largest methylation–
age correlation and mutation burden–age correlation and counted the 
number of CpGs shared between these groups. Third, we compared 
this overlap to the expected rate of overlap assuming random selection 
from the 100,000 original CpGs. A two-sided binomial test was applied 
to assess statistical significance.
Statistics and reproducibility
All analyses were performed in the Python 3.10 and R 3.6.1 environ-
ments. Data analysis was conducted using Pandas 1.5.3, SciPy 1.10.0, 
Pingouin 0.5.3 and Statsmodels 0.13.5. Data were visualized with 
Seaborn 0.12.1 and Matplotlib 3.7.1. No statistical method was used to 
predetermine sample sizes. The experiments were not randomized, and 
the investigators were not blinded to allocation during experiments

(across all CpG sites) greater than 3 s.d. from the mean methylation 
fraction of all samples together were excluded from the analyses. Spe-

Extended Data Fig. 2 | Supplemental characterization of CpG mutations.  
a) The distribution of methylation fraction values of each CpG site in the TCGA 
and PCAWG datasets separately (TCGA = 273,202 and PCAWG = 326,749 CpG 
sites) in each sample (TCGA = 8,680 and PCAWG = 651 samples). b) The CpG 
density (number of CpGs per base pair) in the 50 and 125 base pairs surrounding 
each of the CpG sites in (a). The central line of the inner boxplot represents the 
median, the edges of the box the interquartile range (IQR), and the whiskers 
1.5-times the IQR. c) Violin plots of the distribution of mean methylation fraction 
of non-mutated individuals at the same mutated CpG sites as in Fig. 1d (n = 8,037 
sites), stratified by CpG mutation type. d) As in (c), but the distribution of 
CpG density in the 125 bp surrounding each CpG site. e) Pie chart showing the 
proportion of CpG mutations (n = 467,079 mutations) that result in specific 
mutated nucleotides. Note that 5’-CpG-3’ sites are palindromic, corresponding 
to a 3’-GpC-5’ sequence on the opposite strand; thus, mutation of the C residue 
is equivalent to mutation of the complementary G residue. For simplicity, we 
refer to all CpG mutations by the status of the C residue. f) Violin plot showing 
the mean methylation fraction across all PCAWG samples, considering CpG sites 
where a mutation has occurred in at least one sample (left, n = 1,137 CpG sites), 
CpG sites where no mutation has occurred in any sample (middle, n = 325,614 
CpG sites), and all measured CpG sites (right, n = 326,751). Significant difference 
of distribution (p ≤ 3.03 × 10–50) is marked with (***) and non-significant (p > 0.05) 
with (n.s.), based on a two-sided Mann-Whitney test. g) Methylation fraction 
at the same mutated CpG sites as Fig. 1d (n = 8,037 sites). CpG sites are binned 
into five groups based on MAF, with violin plots summarizing the distribution of 
methylation fraction within each group. Vertical bars inside each violin represent 
the interquartile range. Two-sided p value calculated based on the exact 
distribution of Pearson’s r modeled as a beta function.

Extended Data Fig. 3 | Magnitude of methylation change near somatic 
mutations by tissue and genomic context. a) Boxplots of the distribution of 
ΔMF10kb values for mutated (red) versus random control (n = 260,000, blue) 
sites for each tissue type separately (n = 813, 144, and 1,643 mutated sites from 
Pancreas, Brain, and Ovary tissues, respectively). P value shown for a two-sided 
Mann-Whitney test for a difference in median methylation fraction between the 
mutated and non-mutated random control loci. P value shown for a two-sided 
Mann-Whitney test for a difference in median absolute deviation (MAD) of 
ΔMF10kb between the mutated and non-mutated random control loci. The central 
line represents the median, the edges of the box the interquartile range (IQR), 
and the whiskers 1.5-times the IQR. b) A histogram of the median methylation 
fraction across comparison sites within ±10 kb of mutated (n = 2,600, red) and 
random control sites (n = 260,000, blue). Mutated sites are the same as Fig. 3b. 
Random control sites have been selected as before, with the additional criteria of 
having a methylation profile matched to that of the matched samples at mutated 
sites (as measured by the median methylation fraction of comparison sites, 
Methods). P value shown for a two-sided Mann-Whitney test for a difference in 
median methylation fraction between the mutated and random control loci. 
c) Probability distribution of ΔMF10kb values for mutated (red) versus random 
control (blue) sites. Mutated and random sites are the same as (b). P value 
calculated as in (a). d) Line plot depicting the fold enrichment for mutated over 
non-mutated random control sites as a function of ΔMF10kb, for the same sites 
as Fig. 3b. Sites are stratified depending on whether the site is a CpG and/or falls 
within a CpG island (n = 419 CpG-non-CGI, 21 CpG-CGI, 2,120 non-CpG-non-
CGI, and 39 non-CpG-CGI sites). Fold enrichment is the ratio of the probability 
of observing a given ΔMF10kb for mutated sites versus non-mutated random 
control sites. ΔMF10kb is divided into equally spaced bins from –0.4 to 0.4. e) 
Barchart showing the fold-enrichment of mutated sites with the most extreme 
methylation changes (absolute ΔMF10kb | Z-score | > 1.96, n = 401 mutated sites) in 
various genomic regions, compared to all other mutated sites (n = 2,199 mutated 
sites). P values were calculated using a two-sided Fisher exact test. The categories 
‘Upstream gene’ and ‘Downstream gene’ refer to variants located within 1 kb 
of the 5’ transcription start site and the 3’ transcription stop site, respectively, 
but outside the gene itself. f) As in (e), but comparing the mutated sites with 
the most extreme gains of methylation (Z-score of ΔMF10kb > 1) to those with the 
most extreme losses of methylation (Z-score of ΔMF10kb < –1). g) Boxplot of the 
ΔMF10kb value as a function of the mutated allele frequency (MAF). Same sites and 
samples as Fig. 3e (n = 3,880 mutated loci. The Pearson correlation is shown for 
the association of MAF with ΔMF10kb and the absolute value of ΔMF10kb. Two-sided 
p values were calculated based on the exact distribution of Pearson’s r modeled 
as a beta function. The central line represents the median, the edges of the box 
the interquartile range (IQR), the whiskers 1.5-times the IQR, and the points all 
ΔMF10kb value outside of these ranges.

across all tumor tissues (n = 1,601) and in each of five TCGA tumor tissues 
individually: LGG (Brain), GBM (Brain-2), SARC (Bone), KIRP (Kidney), and THCA 
(Thyroid). b) As in (a) but for age predictions using samples from normal (that is 
non-cancerous) tissues (n = 40 individuals). c) Heatmap indicating the pairwise 
consistencies (Pearson correlation) among the mutation age in normal tissue, 
mutation age in tumor tissue, and chronological age. Data shown for n = 22 
individuals with mutations measured in both normal and tumor tissues (the  
same individuals as from panel b with the exception of 11 colon samples and 7 
liver samples as these were not available in the tumor samples). d) As in (c),  
but comparing predictions from methylation clocks.  
e) Scatter plot of human individuals, showing age predictions from the mutation 
model versus their chronological age. Shared area denotes the 95% confidence 
interval of the line of best fit. Includes 40 individuals from four normal tissues 
(Methods). A two-sided p value was calculated based on the exact distribution 
of Pearson’s r modeled as a beta function. f) Similar to panel (b) but showing age 
predictions from the methylation rather than mutation model. g) Violin plots 
of the methylation age residual versus mutation age residual (Methods). Plots 
include the same individuals as in panels (b,c). Pearson r refers to the correlation 
between methylation age residual and mutation age residual, controlling for 
chronological age (that is, partial correlation, p = 1.76 × 10–3). The central line of 
the inner boxplot represents the median, the edges of the box the interquartile 
range (IQR), the whiskers 1.5-times the IQR, and the points all the methylation age 
residual values. Statistics calculated as in (e).

Extended Data Fig. 6 | Performance comparison to previous epigenetic clocks. 
a) Pearson r between predicted and chronological age for Hannum, Horvath, 
and PhenoAge clocks across the same samples as Fig. 4b (n = 1,601). Predictions 
were done using the subset of features from each clock that existed in our 
methylation data after quality control (66%, 63%, and 61% of CpG sites from the 
Hannum, Horvath, and PhenoAge clocks, respectively). The performance of this 
study’s methylation clock is not shown as it is inherently fit to the TCGA dataset 
in 5-fold CV. b) Pearson r between predicted and chronological age for Hannum, 
Horvath, and PhenoAge clocks after re-fitting (Methods). Same samples as (a). 
The performance of the methylation clock trained in this study (‘This study’) is 
shown for reference.

Extended Data Fig. 7 | Mutation age prediction without whole-genome 
features. a) Correlation of chronological versus predicted age, shown for 
mutation or methylation clocks built without whole-genome features (n = 1,601 
individuals). Correlations are shown across all tissues and in each of five TCGA 
tissues individually: LGG (Brain), GBM (Brain-2), SARC (Bone), KIRP (Kidney), and 
THCA (Thyroid). b) As in (a) but for age predictions using samples from normal 
(that is non-cancerous) tissues (n = 40). c) The methylation age residual is plotted 
versus the mutation age residual, using clocks without whole-genome features 
(Methods). Violin plots summarize the same samples as in panel (a). Pearson r 
refers to the correlation between methylation age residual and mutation age 
residual, controlling for chronological age (that is, partial correlation, p = 6.66 
× 10–105). The central line of the inner boxplot represents the median, the edges 
of the box the interquartile range (IQR), and the whiskers 1.5-times the IQR. A 
two-sided p value was calculated based on the exact distribution of Pearson’s 
r modeled as a beta function. d) Similar to (c), but for the samples in (b). The 
central line of the inner boxplot represents the median, the edges of the box the 
interquartile range (IQR), the whiskers 1.5-times the IQR, and the points all the 
methylation age residual values. Statistics calculated as in (c).
