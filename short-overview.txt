Checking MIT EI Seminar - Laura Schulz - Curiouser and curiouser： why we make problems for ourselves.txt
 In our conversation, we discussed the nature of problems and play in children. Children often create problems for
themselves as part of their play, which differs from problems imposed by adults. The key difference lies in the
arbitrariness of the problem; if a problem feels like play, children are more likely to engage with it enthusiastically.
Even when the tasks seem hard, such as writing stories or washing the garage while playing a game, the arbitrary nature
of the task makes it part of the play rather than work.

Children generate problems based on their understanding and ideas about what these problems entail. For example,
building a spaceship involves concepts like size, containment, materials, and functionality. These preliminary steps are
derived from the children's knowledge of what a spaceship is, allowing them to create plans and engage in
problem-solving that is both meaningful and enjoyable.

The concept of arbitrariness is crucial; children can play with games or board games suggested by adults because they
understand the rules and boundaries, even though they themselves did not create these games. The depth of a problem, as
seen in ideas like spaceships or velociraptor capture, provides a rich landscape for curiosity and creativity, allowing
children to generate numerous hypotheses, proposals, and plans. This is what makes problems engaging and sustains their
curiosity.

Checking Meditations On Moloch [Full Essay].txt
1. Molok is a deity associated with child sacrifice and power in exchange for what one holds most dear, as described in
history and invoked by Ginsburg's poem. He represents a dark and destructive force that some believe is an actual entity
to be contended with.

2. Ileu, on the other hand, is the God of humans, representing more benign values such as flowers, free love, art,
science, philosophy, niceness, community, and civilization. He is often underestimated by the other gods but remains a
resilient force.

3. The transhumanist perspective is to acknowledge the existence of these deities, reject the worship of any that do not
align with human values, and work towards a future where humans are no longer subject to the whims of such entities,
effectively removing them from the equation through technological or scientific advancements.

4. The poem by Allen Ginsberg, "Howl," serves as a reflection on the impact of madness on the brightest minds of his
generation, which also hints at the struggle between opposing cosmic forces, with Molok representing one such force to
be overcome.

5. The ultimate goal for some is to create a sanctuary free from the influence of malevolent deities like Molok, thereby
allowing humanity to flourish without their oppressive rule, and potentially even to challenge and defeat them. This is
seen as a realistic and actionable strategy rather than hubris, as it involves harnessing human ingenuity and values to
transcend our current limitations.

Checking There's no I in AI ｜ Steven Pemberton ｜ CWI, Amsterdam.txt
1. The amount of data in the world is growing exponentially, and we are already producing more data than we know how to
handle.
2. Computers excel at pattern recognition, which can be applied to various tasks like recognizing zebra crossings or
traffic lights with human assistance.
3. The potential for AI to become truly intelligent (with consciousness or self-awareness) is a matter of debate. While
there's a significant amount of investment in achieving this, the timeline and feasibility remain uncertain.
4. The Turing test may not be the best measure of true intelligence, as demonstrated by conversational AI like chat GPT.
5. True intelligence would involve insights beyond pattern recognition, such as understanding irony or recognizing
non-identical corners on a knots and crosses board.
6. Stephen Pemberton humorously responded to a question about his suitability for roles like Doctor Who or Doctor
Strange, indicating he'd be perfect for such roles. The audience appreciated the light-hearted moment with applause.

Checking What we'll learn about the brain in the next century ｜ Sam Rodriques.txt
1. **Neural Interface Technology**: In the future (2043 onwards), neural interface technology became mainstream,
allowing people to interact with digital devices using their brains. This technology included electrodes that interfaced
with the brain to send emails, take pictures with the mind's eye, and store memories digitally.

2. **Research Breakthroughs**: With widespread use of these systems, neuroscientists were able to study human brain
activity in ways previously impossible with animal models. This led to significant advancements in understanding complex
cognitive processes like insight and emotional behavior.

3. **Medical Advances**: The precise recording of neural activity enabled doctors to define mental diseases at the
pathological level rather than by symptoms alone. This approach allowed for more targeted and effective treatments for
conditions such as ADHD, schizophrenia, and depression.

4. **Current State (2017)**: While the future described is speculative, the speaker emphasizes that current neuroscience
research predominantly focuses on mouse models. The speaker advocates for a shift towards understanding the human brain
and its diseases by directly recording human neural activity, which is currently under-researched.

5. **Call to Action**: The speaker calls for neuroscientists to invest effort and resources into studying the human
brain, suggesting that this will lead to significant improvements in diagnosing and treating neurological disorders.

Checking Why Can't We Make Simple Software？ - Peter van Hardenberg.txt
1. **Complexity and Its Origins**: Complexity arises from internal interactions within systems, especially when multiple
stakeholders with different needs are involved. It's a natural outcome of evolving systems based on user feedback and
changing requirements.

2. **Dealing with Complexity**: While better tools may help manage complexity, the core issue is the amount of time and
ideas invested in a project. To cope with complexity, we can:
   - Start over to eradicate dependencies.
   - Simplify our architecture.
   - Isolate complexity by understanding multiplicatory environments where additional platforms require careful
abstraction management.
   - Embrace complexity with caution, acknowledging that it can lead to great achievements but also significant
challenges and risks.

3. **Philosophical Approach**: The discussion also touched on the philosophy of building software, emphasizing the
importance of collaboration, simplicity, and running software locally (offline) while still enabling collaboration.
Tools like "auto merge" enable portable and versioned JSON-like data structures that facilitate fast and simple local
software development with collaborative capabilities.

4. **Personal Reflections**: There was a personal anecote about the challenges of relying on cloud services, which can
lead to single points of failure (e.g., Amazon's outage due to Hurricane Sandy in 2012). This experience highlighted the
importance of understanding and managing the trade-offs involved in software development.

5. **Cyclist Greg LeMond's Quote**: The closing thought was a quote from cyclist Greg LeMond, "It never gets easier. You
just go faster," which can be applied to the concept that while complexity doesn't become simpler to manage, we can
improve our ability to handle it efficiently.

In essence, the discussion revolves around acknowledging the inherent complexity in software development and systems
design, understanding its origins, and employing strategies to manage and sometimes embrace it, always with an eye
towards maintaining simplicity where possible and being deliberate when taking on additional complexity.
