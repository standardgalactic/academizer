The Arrival 

At 19.00 hours, ship’s 
time, I made my way to the 
launch- 
ing bay. The men around 
the shaft stood aside to 
let me 
pass, and I climbed down into
the capsule. 

Inside the narrow cockpit, 
there was scarcely room to 
move. I attached the hose 
to the valve on my space 
suit 

and it inflated rapidly. 
From then on, I was 
incapable of 
making the smallest 
movement. There I stood, 
or rather 
hung suspended, enveloped
in my pneumatic suit and 
yoke to the metal hull. 

I looked up; through the 
transparent canopy I could 
see 
a smooth, polished wall and,
far above, Moddard’s head 

leaning over the top of the
shaft. He vanished, and 
sud- 
denly I was plunged in 
darkness: the heavy 
protective 
cone had been lowered into 
place. Eight times I heard 
the 
hum of the electric motors 
which turned the screws, 
fol- 
lowed by the hiss of the 
shock-absorbers. As my 
eyes grew 

accustomed to the dark, I 
could see the luminous 
circle of 
the solitary dial. 

A voice echoed in my 
headphones: 

“Ready Kelvin?” 

“Ready, Moddard,” I 
answered. 

“Don’t worry about a 
thing. The Station will pick 
you 
up in flight. Have a good 
trip!” 

There was a grinding noise 
and the capsule swayed. My

muscles tensed in spite of 
myself, but there was no 
further 
noise or movement. 

“When is lift-off?” As I 
asked, I noticed a rustling 
out- 
side, like a shower of fine 
sand. 

“You’re on your way, 
Kelvin. Good luck!” 
Moddard’s 

voice sounded as close as 
before. 

A wide slit opened at eye-
level, and I could see the 
stars. 
The Prometheus was 
orbiting in the region of 
Alpha in 
Aquarius and I tried in vain 
to orient myself; a 
glittering 
dust filled my porthole. I 
could not recognize a single 

constellation; in this region
of the galaxy the sky was 
un- 
familiar to me. I waited for 
the moment when I would 
pass 
near the first distinct 
star, but I was unable to 
isolate any 
one of them. Their 
brightness was fading; they
receded, 
merging into a vague, 
purplish glimmer, the sole 
indica- 

tion of the distance I had 
already travelled. My body
rigid, 
sealed in its pneumatic 
envelope, I was knifing 
through 
space with the impression 
of standing still in the 
void, my 
only distraction the 
steadily mounting heat. 

Suddenly, there was a 
shrill, grating sound, like a
steel 

blade being drawn across a 
sheet of wet glass. This 
was 
it, the descent. If I had not
seen the figures racing 
across 
the dial, I would not have 
noticed the change in 
direction. 
The stars having vanished 
long since, my gaze was 
swal- 
lowed up on the pale 
reddish glow of infinity. I 
could hear 

my heart thudding heavily. 
I could feel the coolness 
from 
the air-conditioning on my 
neck, although my face 
seemed to be on fire. I 
regretted not having 
caught a 
glimpse of the Prometheus,
but the ship must have 
been out 
of sight by the time the 
automatic controls had 
raised the 
shutter of my porthole. 

The capsule was shaken by 
a sudden jolt, then 
another. 
The whole vehicle began to
vibrate. Filtered through 
the 
insulating layers of the 
outer skins, penetrating my
pneu- 
matic cocoon, the vibration 
reached me, and ran 
through 

my entire body. The image 
of the dial shivered and 
multi- 
plied, and its 
phosphorescence spread out
in all direc- 
tions. I felt no fear. I had 
not undertaken this long 
voyage 
only to overshoot my 
target! 

I called into the 
microphone: 

“Station Solaris! Station 
Solaris! Station Solaris! I 
think I am leaving the 
flight-path, correct my 
course! Sta- 
tion Solaris, this is the 
Prometheus capsule. 
Over.” 

I had missed the precious 
moment when the planet 
first 
came into view. Now it was 
spread out before my eyes;
flat, 
and already immense. 
Nevertheless, from the 
appearance 
of its surface, I judged 
that I was still at a great 
height 
above it, since I had passed 
that imperceptible frontier

after which we measure 
the distance that separates
us 
from a celestial body in 
terms of altitude. I was 
falling. 
Now I had the sensation of 
falling, even with my eyes 
closed. (I quickly reopened 
them: I did not want to miss 
anything there was to be 
seen.) 

I waited a moment in silence
before trying once more 

to make contact. No 
response. Successive bursts
of static 
came through the 
headphones, against a 
background of 
deep, low-pitched 
murmuring, which seemed to
me the 
very voice of the planet 
itself. A veil of mist 
covered the 
orange-colored sky, 
obscuring the porthole. 
Instinctively, 

I hunched myself up as 
much as my inflated suit 
would 
allow, but almost at once I 
realized that I was passing 
through cloud. Then, as 
though sucked upwards, 
the 
cloud-mass lifted; I was 
gliding, half in light, half 
in 
shadow, the capsule 
revolving upon its own 
vertical axis. 

At last, through the 
porthole, the gigantic ball 
of the sun 
appeared, looming up on the
left and disappearing to 
the 
right. 

A distant voice reached me 
through the murmuring 
and crackling. 

“Station Solaris calling! 
Station Solaris calling! The 

capsule will land at zero-
hour. I repeat, the capsule
will 
land at zero-hour. Stand by
for count-down. Two 
hundred 
and fifty, two hundred and
forty-nine, two hundred 
and 
forty-eight. . . ” 

The words were punctuated
by sharp screeching 
sounds; automatic equipment
was intoning the phrases of

the reception-drill. This 
was surprising, to say the 
least. 
As a rule, men on space 
stations were eager to 
greet a 
newcomer, especially if he 
was arriving direct from 
Earth. 
I did not have long to 
ponder this, for the sun’s 
orbit. 

which had so far encircled 
me, shifted unexpectedly, 
and 
the incandescent disc 
appeared now to the right, 
now to 
the left, seeming to dance 
on the planet’s horizon. I 
was 
swinging like a giant 
pendulum while the 
planet, its sur- 

face wrinkled with 
purplish-blue and black 
furrows, rose 
up in front of me like a 
wall. As my head began to 
spin, 
I caught sight of a tiny 
pattern of green and white
dots; 
it was the station’s 
positioning-marker. 
Something de- 
tached itself with a snap 
from the cone of the 
capsule; with 

a fierce jerk, the long 
parachute collar released 
its hoops, 
and the noise which 
followed reminded me 
irresistibly of 
Earth: for the first time 
after so many months, the 
moan- 
ing of the wind. 

Everything went quickly 
after this. So far, I had 
known 

that I must be falling; now I
could see it for myself. 
The 
green and white checker-
board grew rapidly larger 
and I 
could see that it was 
painted on an elongated 
silvery body, 
shaped like a whale, its 
flanks bristling with radar 
anten- 
nae. This metal colossus, 
which was pierced with 
several 

rows of shadowy apertures,
was not resting on the 
planet 
itself but suspended above
it, casting upon the inky 
sur- 
face beneath an ellipsoidal 
shadow of even deeper 
black- 
ness. I could make out the 
slate-colored ripples of 
the 
ocean, stirring with a faint 
motion. Suddenly, the 
clouds 

rose to a great height, 
rimmed with a blinding 
crimson 
glare; the lurid sky became
grey, distant and flat; 
every- 
thing was blotted out; I was
falling in a spin. 

A sharp jolt, and the 
capsule righted itself. 
Through the 
porthole, I could see the 
ocean once more, the waves
like 

crests of glittering 
quicksilver. The hoops of 
the para- 
chute, their cords snapped,
flapped furiously over the
waves, carried on the wind.
The capsule gently de- 
scended, swaying with a 
peculiar slow-motion 
rhythm im- 
posed on it by the artificial
magnetic field; there was 
just 

time to glimpse the 
launchingpads and the 
parabolic re- 
flectors of two radio-
telescopes on top of their 
pierced- 
steel towers. 

With the clang of steel 
rebounding against steel, 
the 
capsule came to a stop. A 
hatch opened, and with a 
long, 

harsh sigh, the metal shell
which imprisoned me 
reached 
the end of its voyage. 

I heard the mechanical 
voice from the control 
center: 

“Station Solaris. Zero and 
zero. The capsule has 
landed. Out.” 

Feeling a vague pressure 
on my chest and a 
disagreea- 
ble heaviness in the pit of 
my stomach, I seized the 
control 
levers with both hands and
cut the contacts. A green 
in- 

dicator lit up: ‘ARRIVAL.’ 
The capsule opened, and 
the 
pneumatic padding shoved 
me gently from behind, so 
that, in order to keep my 
balance, I had to take a 
step 
forward. 

With a muffled sigh of 
resignation, the space-suit 
ex- 
pelled its air. I was free. 

I found myself inside a 
vast, silver funnel, as high
as a 
cathedral nave. A cluster 
of colored pipes ran down 
the 
sloping walls and 
disappeared into rounded 
orifices. I 
turned round. The 
ventilation shafts were 
roaring, suck- 
ing in the poisonous gases 
from the planet’s 
atmosphere 

which had infiltrated when
my capsule had landed 
inside 
the Station. Empty, 
resembling a burst cocoon, 
the cigar- 
shaped capsule stood 
upright, enfolded by a 
calyx 
mounted on a steel base. 
The outer casing, scorched 
dur- 
ing flight, had turned a 
dirty brown. 

I went down a small 
stairway. The metal floor 
below had 
been coated with a heavy-
duty plastic. In places, the 
wheels of trolleys carrying
rockets had worn through 
this 
plastic covering to expose 
the bare steel beneath. 

The throbbing of the 
ventilators ceased 
abruptly and 

there was total silence. I 
looked around me, a little 
uncer- 
tain, waiting for someone to
appear; but there was no 
sign 
of life. Only a neon arrow 
glowed, pointing towards a 
moving walkway which was 
silently unreeling. I 
allowed 
myself to be carried 
forward. 

The ceiling of the hall 
descended in a fine 
parabolic arc 
until it reached the 
entrance to a gallery, in 
whose re- 
cesses gas cylinders, 
gauges, parachutes, crates 
and a 
quantity of other objects 
were scattered about in 
untidy 
heaps. 

The moving walkway set me 
down at the far end of the
gallery, on the threshold 
of a dome. Here there was 
an 
even greater disorder. A 
pool of oily liquid spread 
out 
from beneath a pile of oil-
drums; a nauseating smell 
hung 

in the air; footprints, in a 
series of glutinous smears, 
went 
off in all directions. The 
oil-drums were covered 
with a 
tangle of tickertape, torn 
paper and other waste. 

Another green arrow 
directed me to the central 
door. 

Behind this stretched a 
narrow corridor, hardly 
wide 
enough for two men to walk
side by side, lit by slabs of 
glass let into the ceiling. 
Then another door, painted
in 
green and white squares, 
which was ajar; I went in. 

The cabin had concave walls
and a big panoramic win- 

dow, which a glowing mist 
had tinged with purple. 
Out- 
side the murky waves slid 
silently past. Open 
cupboards 
lined the walls, filled 
with instruments, books, 
dirty 
glasses, vacuum flasks — 
all covered with dust. Five
or six 
small trolleys and some 
collapsible chairs cluttered
up the 

stained floor. One chair 
alone was inflated, its back
raised. 
In this armchair there was a
little thin man, his face 
burnt 
by the sun, the skin on his 
nose and cheeks coming away
in large flakes. I recognized
him as Snow, a cybernetics 
expert and Gibarian’s 
deputy. In his time he had 
pub- 

lished articles of great 
originality in the Solarist 
Annual. 
It so happened that I had 
never had the opportunity 
of 
meeting him. He was wearing
a mesh shirt which allowed 
the grey hairs of his 
sunken chest to poke 
through here 
and there, and canvas 
trousers with a great many 
pockets, 

mechanic’s trousers, which 
had once been white but 
now 
were stained at the knees 
and covered with holes 
from 
chemical burns. He was 
holding one of those pear-
shaped 
plastic flasks which are 
used in spaceships not 
equipped 
with internal gravitational 
systems. Snow’s eyes 
widened 

in amazement as he looked 
up and saw me. The flask 
dropped from his fingers 
and bounced several times, 
spilling a few drops of 
transparent liquid. Blood 
drained 
from his face. I was too 
astonished to speak, and 
this 
dumbshow continued for so 
long that Snow’s terror 
grad- 

ually communicated itself 
to me. I took a step 
forward. He 
cringed in his chair. 

“Snow?” 

He quivered as though I had
struck him. Gazing at me 
in indescribable horror, he 
gasped out: 

“I don’t know you . . .” His
voice croaked. “I don’t 
know 
you . . . What do you 
want?” 

The spilt liquid was quickly 
evaporating; I caught a 

whiff of alcohol. Had he 
been drinking? Was he 
drunk? 
What was he so terrified 
of? I stood in the middle of
the 
room; my legs were 
trembling; my ears roared, 
as though 
they were stuffed with 
cotton wool. I had the 
impression 
that the ground was giving 
way beneath my feet. 
Beyond 

the curved window, the 
ocean rose and fell with 
regularity. 
Snow’s blood-shot eyes 
never left me. His terror 
seemed 
to have abated, but his 
expression of invincible 
disgust 
remained. 

“What’s the matter? Are 
you ill?” I whispered. 

“You seem worried,” he 
said, his voice hollow. “You 
actually seem worried ... So
it’s like that now, is it? 
But 
why concern yourself about
me? I don’t know you.” 

“Where’s Gibarian?” I 
asked. 

He gave a gasp and his 
glassy eyes lit up for an 
instant. 

“Gi . . .Giba . . .No! No!” 

His whole frame shook with
stifled, hysterical 
laughter; 
then he seemed to calm 
down a little. 

“So it’s Gibarian you’ve 
come for, is it? Poor old 
Gibarian. What do you want 
with him?” 

His words, or rather his 
tone of voice, expressed 
hatred 
and defiance; it was as 
though I had suddenly 
ceased to 
represent a threat to him. 

Bewildered, I mumbled: 

“What. . . Where is he?” 

“Don’t you know?” 

Obviously he was drunk and
raving. My anger rose. I 
should have controlled 
myself and left the room, 
but I had 
lost patience. I shouted: 

“That’s enough! How could
I know where he is since 
I’ve only just arrived? 
Snow! What’s going on 
here?” 

His jaw dropped. Once again 
he caught his breath and 

his eyes gleamed with a 
different light. He seized 
the arms 
of his chair with both 
hands and stood up with 
difficulty. 
His knees were trembling. 

“What? You’ve just 
arrived. . . Where have you
come 
from?” he asked, almost 
sober. 

“From Earth!” I retorted 
angrily. “Maybe you’ve 
heard 
of it? Not that anyone 
would ever guess it.” 

“From Earth? Good God! 
Then you must be Kelvin.” 

“Of course. Why are you 
looking at me like that? 
What’s 
so startling about me?” 

He blinked rapidly. 

“Nothing,” he said, wiping 
his forehead, “nothing. 
Forgive me, Kelvin, it’s 
nothing, I assure you. I was 
simply 
surprised, I didn’t expect 
to see you.” 

“What do you mean, you 
didn’t expect to see me? 
You 
were notified months ago, 
and Moddard radioed only 
to- 
day from the Prometheus. 
” 

“Yes; yes, indeed. Only, 
you see, we’re a bit 
disorgan- 
ized at the moment.” 

“So I see,” I answered 
dryly. 

Snow walked around me, 
inspecting my atmosphere 
suit, which was standard 
issue with the usual 
harness of 
wires and cables attached 
to the chest. He coughed, 
and 
rubbed his bony nose: 

“Perhaps you would like a 
bath? It would do you good. 
It’s the blue door, on the 
other side.” 

“Thanks — I know the 
Station lay-out.” 

“You must be hungry.” 

“No. Where’s Gibarian?” 

Without answering, he went
over to the window. From 

behind he looked 
considerably older. His 
close-cropped 
hair was grey, and deep 
wrinkles creased his 
sunburnt 
neck. 

The wave-crests glinted 
through the window, the 
colos- 
sal rollers rising and 
falling in slow-motion. 
Watching the 

ocean like this one had the 
illusion — it was surely an 
illu- 
sion — that the Station was 
moving imperceptibly, as 
though teetering on an 
invisible base; then it 
would seem 
to recover its equilibrium, 
only to lean the opposite 
way 
with the same lazy 
movement. Thick foam, the 
color of 

blood, gathered in the 
troughs of the waves. For 
a fraction 
of a second, my throat 
tightened and I thought 
longingly 
of the Prometheus and its 
strict discipline; the 
memory of 
an existence which 
suddenly seemed a happy 
one, now 
gone for ever. 

Snow turned round, 
nervously rubbing his hands
to- 
gether. 

“Listen,” he said abruptly,
“except for me there’s no

one around for the 
moment. You’ll have to 
make do with 

my company for today. Call 
me Ratface; don’t argue. 
You 
know me by my photograph, 
just imagine we’re old 
friends. Everyone calls me
Ratface, there’s nothing I 
can 
do about it.” 

Obstinately, I repeated my 
question: 

“Where is Gibarian?” 

He blinked again. 

“I’m sorry to have 
received you like that. 
It’s. . . it’s not 
exactly my fault. I had 
completely forgotten. . . A 
lot has 
been happening here, you 
see. . . ” 

“It’s all right. But what 
about Gibarian? Isn’t he on 
the 
Station? Is he on an 
observation flight?” 

Snow was gazing at a tangled 
mass of cables. 

“No, he hasn’t left the 
Station. And he won’t be 
flying. 
The fact is. . . ” 

My ears were still blocked,
and I was finding it more 
and 
more difficult to hear. 

“What? What do you mean? 
Where is he then?” 

‘ I should think you might 
guess,” he answered in a 
changed voice, looking me 
coldly in the eyes. I 
shivered. 
He was drunk, but he knew 
what he was saying. 

“There’s been an 
accident?” 

He nodded vigorously, 
watching my reactions 
closely. 

“When?” 7 

“This morning, at dawn.” 

By now, my sensations were
less violent; this succinct 

exchange of questions and 
answers had calmed me. I 
was 
beginning to understand 
Snow’s strange behavior. 

“What kind of accident?” 

“Why not go to your cabin 
and take off your 
spacesuit? 
Come back in, say, an hour’s
time.” 

I hesitated. 

“All right,” I said finally. 

As I made to leave, he 
called me back. 

“Wait!” He had an uneasy 
look, as if he wanted to add
something but was finding it
difficult to bring out the 
words. After a pause, he 
said: 

“There used to be three 
of us here. Now, with you, 
there are three of us 
again. Do you know 
Sartorius?” 

“In the same way as I knew 
you — only from his photo- 
graphs.” 

“He’s up there, in the 
laboratory, and I doubt if 
he’ll 
come down before dark, 
but. . . In any case, you’ll 
recog- 
nize him. If you should see 
anyone else — someone who 
isn’t me or Sartorius, you 
understand, then. . . ” 

“Then what?” 

I must be dreaming. All this
could only be a dream! The 

inky waves, their crimson 
gleams under the low-
hanging 
sun, and this little man 
who had gone back to his 
arm- 
chair, sitting there as 
before, hanging his head 
and star- 
ing at the heap of cables. 

“In that case, do nothing.” 

“Who could I see?” I flared
up. “A ghost?” 

“You think I’m mad, of 
course. No, no, I’m not mad.
I 
can’t say anything more 
for the moment. 
Perhaps. . . who 
knows?. . . Nothing will 
happen. But don’t forget I
warned 
you.” 

“Don’t be so mysterious. 
What’s all this about?” 

“Keep a hold on yourself. 
Be prepared to meet. . . 
anything. It sounds 
impossible I know, but try. 
It’s the 
only advice I can give you. I 
can’t think of anything 
bet- 
ter.” 

“But what could I possibly 
meet?” I shouted. 

Seeing him sitting there, 
looking sideways at me, his 
sunburnt face drooping 
with fatigue, I found it 
difficult to 
contain myself. I wanted to 
grab him by the shoulders 
and 
shake him. 

Painfully, dragging the 
words out one by one, he 
an- 
swered: 

“I don’t know. In a way, it 
depends on you.” 

“Hallucinations, you 
mean?” 

“No. . . it’s real enough. 
Don’t attack. Whatever 
you do, 
remember that!” 

“What are you getting at?” 
I could hardly recognize 
the 

sound of my own voice. 

“We’re not on Earth, you 
know.” 

“A Polytherian form?” I 
shouted. “There’s nothing
hu- 
man about them!” 

I was about to rush at him, 
to drag him out of the 
trance, 

prompted, apparently, by 
his crazy theories, when he
murmured: 

“That’s why they’re so 
dangerous. Remember what 
I’ve 
told you, and be on your 
guard!” 

“What happened to 
Gibarian?” 

He did not answer. 

“What is Sartorius doing?” 

“Come back in an hour.” 

I turned and went out. As I 
closed the door behind me, 
I took a last look at him. 
Tiny, shrunken, his head in
his 

hands and his elbows 
resting on his stained 
knees, he sat 
there, motionless. It was 
only then that I noticed 
the dried 
bloodstains on the backs of 
his hands. 

The Solarists 

In the empty corridor I 
stood for a moment in front
of the 
closed door. I noticed a 
strip of plaster carelessly 
stuck on 
one of the panels. 
Pencilled on it was the 
word “Man!” At 
the sight of this faintly 
scribbled word, I had a 
sudden 
longing to return to Snow 
for company; but I thought 
better of it. 

His crazy warnings still 
ringing in my ears, I started
off 
down the narrow, tubular 
passage which was filled 
with the 
moaning of the wind, my 
shoulders bowed under the
weight of the spacesuit. On
tip-toe, half-consciously 
flee- 
ing from some invisible 
watcher, I found two doors 
on my 

left and two more on my 
right. I read the 
occupants’ 
names: Dr. Gibarian, Dr. 
Snow, Dr. Sartorius. On the 
fourth, there was no 
nameplate. I hesitated, 
then pressed 
the handle down gently and
slowly opened the door. As 
I 
did so, I had a premonition, 
amounting almost to a cer- 
tainty, that there was 
someone inside. I went in. 

There was no one. Another 
wide panoramic window, 
almost as large as the one 
in the cabin where I had 
found 
Snow, overhung the ocean, 
which, sunlit on this side, 
shone with an oleaginous 
gleam, as though the waves 
secreted a reddish oil. A 
crimson glow pervaded the 
whole room, whose lay-out 
suggested a ship’s cabin. On

one side, flanked by book-
filled shelves, a 
retractable bed 

stood against the wall. On 
the other, between the 
numer- 
ous lockers, hung nickel 
frames enclosing a series 
of 

aerial photographs stuck 
end to end with adhesive 
tape, 
and racks full of test-
tubes and retorts plugged 
with cot- 
ton-wool. Two tiers of 
white enamel boxes took up 
the 
space beneath the window. I
lifted some of the lids; 
the 
boxes were crammed with 
all kinds of instruments, 
inter- 

twined with plastic tubing. 
The corners of the room 
were 
occupied by a refrigerator, 
a tap and a demisting 
device. 
For lack of space on the big
table by the window, a 
micro- 
scope stood on the floor. 
Turning round, I saw a tall 
locker beside the entrance
door. It was half-open, 
filled
