In the natural world, analogies are the way representations relate.
An analogy is a personal concept, each of us creates our own.
Verbal causal relations are shareable, and language suggests and embeds them.
Lying and cheating are attributes of the verbal world, where symbols exist,
unlike the analog natural world, out there.
The verbal world
Humans recognize the advantages of lying,
especially when narratives concern non-visible objects or events like feelings,
past or distant events, or future ones.
Lying is a natural part of language development in children but can become disastrous in adulthood.
Lies often require more lies to cover up,
leading to complicated contradictions that drain cognitive resources.
Throughout history, many have used speech to gain power or trust through promises and false claims.
When it's challenging to distinguish true narratives from fake ones,
it poses daily challenges for society.
Lies can be likened to a cancer for societies.
Later in this chapter, we'll explore the imitation fallacy,
where pretending to be something we're not can also be dangerous.
For brain-centrism, there's no absolute truth,
as the same mental space asserts the narrative and its truth value.
The only concept we've proposed to replace absolute truth is conventional truth,
which signifies agreement among several mental spaces.
They consider the narrative to be true.
The scientific method, however, requires narratives to make falsifiable predictions for acceptance as scientific,
which doesn't guarantee truth but suggests that we haven't yet proven it false.
5.3
Certainly, here are the refined definitions.
We have often accepted self-referentil definitions,
such as defining time as what a clock measures.
In this approach, we create an instrument specifically designed to measure time
and then define time based on what that instrument measures.
Circular definitions can be beneficial in the field of physics,
where they facilitate understanding of complex concepts.
However, they can also lead to confusion and potential dangers
when used inappropriately or without a clear understanding of the underlying principles.
Here's a cleaner version of the text.
Language and Interpretation
Human language is inherently context-driven, lacking univocal precision.
Noam Chomsky noted that its strength lies in its imprecision.
A single word can have multiple meanings, and sentences always require interpretation.
Language allows for the use of metaphors, irony, humor, hints, and poetry,
often suggesting meanings contrary to the literal words.
This imprecision enables the depiction of the fleeting nature of our emotions.
Writers and poets masterfully convey subtle emotions
and delicate situations by deftly managing linguistic ambiguities.
A word spoken with a different tone or accompanied by a distinct facial expression
can convey a completely different message.
Language's flexibility permits humor,
which is often considered the finest expression of human wisdom
because it allows for playful deception.
Human language is dynamic, allowing anyone to invent new words,
and context often aids in understanding.
Dialects and jargon can reveal variations or convey meaningful analogies
to those who can interpret them.
Computer languages
In contrast to human languages,
computer languages must be univocal and precise,
as computers lack the ability to interpret context.
Computers operate without awareness of the surrounding context
and empathy to adapt sentence meanings.
They exist within a purely verbal world.
If computers were subject to interpretation,
they would prove unreliable,
providing different results for the same input.
The mechanical reversibility of computers in their languages
serves as both their strength and weakness.
The challenge of computer translation illustrates the tension
between the necessity for precision
and the creative imprecision inherent in human language.
Undefinable concepts
Certain concepts are primitive and deeply rooted in our natural world.
We instinctively understand them
but struggle to define them
without falling into circular reasoning.
Among the most fundamental of these concepts
are time, space, intelligence, and existence.
Before the invention of language,
these notions were already familiar to our natural world
and remained undefinable within the verbal world.
To cope with this,
human societies introduced self-refer-ntial definitions,
such as defining time as one o'clock measures.
These definitions rely on circularity,
which, while useful in physics,
can also lead to confusion and ambiguity in other contexts.
Here's a more organized version of the text.
Representations of external objects and feelings
Representations of external objects or events
are generally less susceptible to distortions than feelings
because they can be compared with outward-oriented sensory inputs.
However, these representations are still influenced by various factors,
including brain physiology, language, emotions,
and pre-existing expectations.
Perception and Kant's Perspective
Immanuel Kant, 1724-1804
explained that what perception tells us about the world
is how it presents itself to us,
not its absolute nature.
The mental space continually changes its state
by combining information sources,
including active emotions,
prevalent feelings,
expectations,
and dominant thoughts.
This affects mental patterns,
memories,
and bodily reactions.
A third-party perspective,
when analyzing a brain or an object,
relies solely on sensory information.
Diversity of mental states
There is an uncountable number of possible mental states,
created through brain plasticity and adaptations at all levels.
A mental space's state can never be the same twice in one's lifetime,
as it is inseparable from the surrounding environment,
whether physical or social.
Brain nets,
as studied by Miguel Nicolese,
illustrate the synchronization of brain signals
between individuals during shared experiences.
Situational variability
Different life situations trigger distinct mental patterns,
concepts,
and feelings.
Language also varies across situations,
and the balance of information sources shifts accordingly.
Problem-solving in mental space
Jerry Allen Fodor,
1935-2017
proposed a modular structure for the mind,
with specific brain regions dedicated to various functions,
such as language,
perception,
emotion control,
and face recognition.
General purpose problem-solving capacities exist within the mental space,
allowing damage regions to be compensated by other parts of the brain.
Complexity of mental space
The mental space is incredibly complex,
surpassing the complexity of its subsystems like language or theoretical physics.
Mathematics, for example,
is infinitely more complex than any language,
whether formal or natural.
This complexity justifies metaphorical descriptions
and highlights that the brain defies traditional physical descriptions.
The text you provide appears to be an excerpt from a review of James Williams' book titled,
Gilles Deleuze's Philosophy of Time,
A Critical Introduction and Guide.
This book explores Gilles Deleuze's Philosophy of Time and is authored by James Williams,
who is known for his work in the field of Deleuzean philosophy.
The review is written by Daniel W. Smith,
who is affiliated with Purdue University.
In the review,
Smith discusses Williams' significant contributions to the understanding of Deleuze's philosophy,
particularly focusing on Deleuze's philosophy of time.
The review also mentions Williams' previous works
and his expertise in both the continental and analytic philosophical traditions.
Certainly, here's the text without the day tags.
James Williams has merged as one of the most important
and accomplished readers of the philosophy of Gilles Deleuze.
After writing two early books on Lyotard, 1998 and 2000,
see also Crome and Williams 2006,
Williams published, in rather quick succession,
Critical Introductions to two of Deleuze's most important works,
Difference and Repetition, 2003 and Logic of Sense, 2008.
Between these two books, he published Encounters and Influences,
which explored, in a series of extended essays,
the relation of Deleuze's philosophy to thinkers such as Bachelard, Whitehead,
Kant, Levinas, and Antonio Negri,
as well as issues raised by analytic philosophers such as David Lewis,
on the concepts of the possible and the virtual,
and Graham Harmon, on the status of problems, 2005-8.
Williams has also published a study of post-structuralism, 2005-B,
and co-edited a collection of papers exploring the relations between the analytic and continental traditions,
Reynolds et al., 2010.
The result has been an impressive body of work that is marked by not only by Williams' own interpretive acumen
in both the continental and analytic traditions,
but also by his own original philosophical voice.
In his most recent work, Williams tackles one of the most difficult, yet central aspects of Deleuze's thought,
his philosophy of time.
In a sense, the book is an expansion of the fourth chapter of the book on difference and repetition,
the chapter on repetition, which dealt with the same material in a much more condensed form.
Here's a cleaner version of the text.
ERP's View on Time
ERP, Extended Reality Physics, considers time as an existing physical entity.
Since we cannot directly observe time, this existence must be of the extended type
and associated with the platonic realm linked to physicalism, 5.1.
Einstein's Definition of Time
Einstein defines time and special relativity as what clocks measure to provide a practical, numerical ERP definition.
However, this definition is inherently circular, much like definitions of other primitive concepts.
Time is defined using clocks, yet clocks themselves are instruments constructed to measure time.
Circular Definitions in Physics
The circular nature of these definitions is not surprising.
Physicists often rely on digital units, and the definitions of these units inevitably involve circularity.
For example, in 1799, the meter was defined in terms of a prototype meter bar in Paris.
Today, it is defined as the length of the path traveled by light in a vacuum in 1 299,792,458 of a second,
which is also a circular definition.
Such circularity arises from the need to connect mental concepts with observable events, out there.
Measurement serves as the vital bridge between the mental concept and the external reality.
Alternative Views on Time
Other ERP physicists have differing views on time.
For instance, British physicist Julian Barber, 1937, proposed in his 1999 book,
The End of Time, that there may be no time, out there.
His perspective aligns with the Machian tradition,
which rejects the existence of non-directly observable entities as non-physical.
However, Barber's viewpoint remains highly controversial.
Sean Carroll, in his 2015 book, The Reality of Time,
suggests that these approaches are attempting to solve a problem that has already been addressed.
Leibniz's unique idea on space and time
Leibniz had an original concept of space and time.
He rejected the Newtonian idea of a stage on which everything unfolds.
He would not have agreed with Einstein's,
what clocks measure, definition or Carroll's perspective.
Leibniz's idea aligns more closely with our intuitive sense of the flow of time
and is compatible with the concept of brain-centrism.
In his third paper, the author expresses his perspective as follows.
Indeed, Julian Barber's concept that the history of the universe is a continuous curve
in its relative configuration space aligns with ideas that predate Albert Einstein's theory of relativity.
Leibniz's statement, which suggests that space is something relative and an order of coexistence,
indicates an early recognition of the idea that space is not an absolute, fixed framework
but rather a relational concept.
Einstein's theory of relativity, published in the early 20th century,
further developed and formalized these ideas,
leading to the understanding that both space and time
are relative and interconnected aspects of the fabric of the universe.
Barber's work builds upon and extends these earlier philosophical and scientific ideas.
The provided text appears to be in an abstract of an academic article by K.M. Yesholt,
titled, Time, Perspective, and Semantic Representation,
Published Online by Cambridge University Press on May 5, 2017.
In this article, the author discusses the perspectival nature of temporality in discourse
and argues that the concept of time is intrinsically linked to perspectival thought.
The author emphasizes that perspectival temporality cannot be excluded from semantic representation
if it is to remain cognitively plausible.
The article presents a semantic approach to temporal reference within the framework of default semantics,
where temporality is viewed as degrees of attachment from the certainty of the present moment.
The text also addresses questions related to temporal asymmetry,
metaphysical time, psychological time, and time in natural language,
concluding that these concepts can be understood through possibility and perspectivity.
The text you provide appears to be in an abstract or introduction to a document titled,
Spacetimes with Semantics, I, Notes on Theory and Formalism, by Mark Burgess, dated November 21, 2014.
In this document, the author discusses the relationship between objects and space,
how changes in relationships signify the passage of time,
and the importance of observer semantics in our understanding of spacetime.
The document explores mathematical structures of spacetime, vector spaces, categories and algebras,
as well as symbolic grammars as spatial models.
It appears to be a comprehensive exploration of the concept of spacetime and its semantic representations.
The text you provide appears to be a table of contents or an outline for a document titled,
Spacetimes with Semantics, I, Notes on Theory and Formalism, by Mark Burgess.
It covers various topics related to spacetime semantics, autonomous agent semantics,
mathematical structures of spacetime, semantic knowledge spaces, and much more.
It appears to be a detailed exploration of the concept of spacetime and its connection to semantics and knowledge spaces.
The provided text discusses the concepts of space and time and their relationship with observers in semantics.
Here are some key points from the text.
Space and time are fundamental concepts that underlie our understanding of the world.
They are intricately linked, and their perception often depends on an observer's perspective.
Traditional models treat spacetime as a separate entity from matter and energy, with smooth coordinates.
However, this approach may not account for fundamental local interactions at smaller scales.
Einstein's theory of relativity highlighted the importance of considering the relationship between space and time,
leading to unexpected consequences related to observer locality.
The text emphasizes the need for an intentional theory of spacetime that includes the functional aspects of the world,
bringing observers in semantics into the picture.
Agency, subjectivity, and intents play a significant role in understanding spacetime and its functional relationships.
The concept of connectivity is crucial in both the physical sciences and information systems,
often implying semantics and subjective elements.
Promise theory is mentioned as a framework that can address questions related to space, time,
and scaling from small clusters to larger spaces.
The text acknowledges that describing even and objective spacetime is a complex and technical topic,
and it aims to provide an outline of how spatial relationships work within this framework.
Overall, the text raises important philosophical and conceptual questions about the nature of spacetime
and its relation to observers and semantics.
The text discusses the fundamental concepts of space and time and introduces some key assumptions and definitions related to these concepts.
Here are the main points.
Space and time are observed quantities, and their existence is taken as given.
Elements of location, such as points, regions, or agents, are considered as fundamental components of spacetime.
Changes in the state of these elements involve changes in their relative relationships,
and this is how the progression of time is measured.
A spatial element is defined as a member of a set representing the property of location.
These elements can be named and satisfy set theory properties.
The assumption is made that space is an expression of the connectivity of its constituent elements,
emphasizing the role of relationships in connectivity in defining space.
Clocks are introduced as systems that measure and mark the passage of time,
emphasizing the connection between time and change.
It is noted that time can only be measured if there is distinguishable change,
and the number of times that can be measured in a system is finite if the variety of states available is finite.
The concept of space is explored in terms of structural patterns and the representation of patterns.
Questions are raised about the nature of space, especially in empty space.
The text mentions different approaches to describing space,
such as the Euclidean view and the container view,
and how these views are related through mathematical formulations.
The role of semantics in defining spatial relationships is emphasized,
as the choice of how to parameterize these relationships is an observer choice that requires intent.
Overall, the text lays the foundation for a discussion on the fundamental nature of space and time,
as well as their relationship with observers in semantics.
It highlights the importance of considering both structural patterns and observer intent in understanding these concepts.
This section explores the concept of naming elements within a space.
Here are the main points.
The way elements and collections of elements are labeled in a space is important.
If elements cannot be identified,
they effectively do not exist within an observer's universe.
Symmetries between elements that are interchangeable can lead to collective names or categories.
These symmetries also affect an observer's ability to perceive and measure time.
Names can have scopes or domains of validity.
In computer science, terms like private and public names are used.
In vector spaces, Cartesian vector coordinates are often used as names for identifying elements.
Any property that can pinpoint an element can be considered its name,
whether it's an identifying mark, a string, or a coordinate vector.
Elements may have more than one name, and names may not remain constant.
Understanding the consequences of these considerations is important.
Sets of elements can collectively have names representing common properties.
Terms like scope, namespace, container, class, or group are used for this purpose.
These names define patches of space in which an element's name is valid, connecting with semantics.
Hierarchical namespaces, known as taxonomies, are used for naming elements.
The coordinates of a name within a hierarchy are given by paths through a graph from a reference root element to the specific element.
Dimensionality is a concept related to naming elements into independent classes or regions.
Understanding dimensions can be challenging, especially in non-Euclidean spaces like graphs.
Concepts like linear independence, matroidids, and spanning trees are introduced to address this.
The difference between two locations, two names, is considered both a vector and a derivative on a topological space,
defining rate of change or gradient.
If all names for an element are removed, it effectively disappears as an independent entity in the observer's universe.
The limits of a space are determined by the number of names it contains,
whether they are coordinates or other labels, leading to the notion of boundedness as the dimension of a set.
This section highlights the significance of naming and labeling and defining the properties and relationships of elements within a space,
emphasizing how observers perceive and interact with their surroundings.
This section discusses models of space and the fundamental concept of extent in spatial relationships.
Extent begins with sets of elements and nearest neighbors within those sets.
The concept of a neighborhood is crucial in topology, where extent is understood as transitivity.
For example, if A, B, and C are elements in a partially ordered set, post-set, and A is a nearest neighbor of B,
and B is a nearest neighbor of C, then to go from A to C, one must go through B.
This transitive property is a common assumption in spatial relationships.
The transitive property implies that to move from one element to another,
one might need to make several hops through intermediary elements.
However, there's no inherent reason why this has to be the case.
In an alternative scenario, one could teleport directly to any element from any other with equal cost,
effectively creating a complete graph structure.
This example illustrates that assumptions about transitivity and distance can vary.
Discreteness of elements can invalidate assumptions about distance, such as Pythagorean relationships.
The mathematical hierarchy of sets allows for successive refinements with increasing amounts of structure.
Key concepts include
Groupoid or magma
A set with a closed operation
Semi-group
A magma with an associative operation, represented as a directed graph
Monoid
A semi-group with an identity element, also represented as a directed graph
Group
A monoid with an inverse, usually represented as an undirected graph
Lattice
A tiling formed by the generators of a discrete group.
Traditional notions of space-time often begin with groups and the regular lattices they generate.
However, these models rely on a continuum hypothesis,
approximating a large countable set by a non-countable distribution of values to obtain a smooth manifold.
In contrast, this paper explores a more elementary view of space and time.
The discussion highlights the importance of understanding the underlying mathematical structures that describe space and the different assumptions that can be made about spatial relationships, depending on the context of the observer's perspective.
This section discusses models of time.
Time is measured by clocks, which are mechanisms that change some measurable phenomenon at a locally constant rate.
In principle, the entire universe can be seen as the ultimate clock, but individual observers partition off their own set of distinguishable states to measure their perception of change.
Clocks can be built from various measurable phenomena, including spatial position, spin, charge, or any finite, countable state machine.
Every distinguishable spatial motion can act as a clock.
This implies that space, time, and speed are not independent concepts.
They are interdependent.
In Einsteinian relativity, the speed of light is fixed as a fundamental constant.
Time is assumed to pass monotonically, but this is merely an assumption.
Consistency requires allowing time to run both forwards and backward in infinite systems.
In a finite system of states, time is inseparably bound to those states, including states of position.
A change in states corresponds to a change in time.
If a state change is repeated or reversed, time also repeats.
Proper time, in this context, is equivalent to what computer science refers to as a version of an information source.
Each spatial hypersurface containing a unique microstate is a version and a single position in time.
Time is linked to the level of entanglement of different elements forming a space.
The more states in a space, the more possible times exist in the system.
Topology is the origin of time.
Traditionally, physics describes the complete state of a system using position and velocity.
However, in a state model where time is measured by space itself, there is no independent notion of velocity.
Velocity becomes an emergent concept from transitions between states.
This discussion provides a unique perspective on the relationship between space, time, and speed,
emphasizing their interdependence and the role of clocks in measuring time.
It challenges traditional physics by suggesting that velocity is an emergent property rather than a fundamental parameter.
This section discusses the concept of scaling and renormalization in the context of space-time.
Fundamental aspects of space-time are expected to change at different scales.
Defining scale in a general space is a complex task, especially for non-Euclidean spaces.
In Euclidean spaces, scaling is a simple multiplicative factor,
and the structure remains self-similar under different multiplicative maps.
In Euclidean spaces, Euclidean spaces and lattices exhibit scale-invariant behavior.
Graphs, which are not regular lattices, lack regular scaling properties.
The number of nearest neighbors at one scale and location can differ significantly from another scale or location.
Space-times are often in homogeneous and non-scale invariant.
Various approaches in physics and mathematics, such as reg calculus, curve-Riemann manifolds, fuzzy sets and topologies,
and large-scale network studies, already account for this complexity.
The concept of scaling in a graph can be defined through strongly connected components, SCC.
Scale, in the context of set topology, involves the union of independent subsets
to create a lower-resolution element from a high-resolution picture.
This process is known as coarse-graining or renormalization.
Defining dimensionality in non-ISOTRPIC, in homogeneous spaces, like graphs, can be challenging.
Dimensionality may vary from place to place and from scale to scale,
leading to a different perspective on space compared to traditional Euclidean geometry.
This discussion highlights the multifaceted nature of scale and dimensionality in space-time
and acknowledges that these concepts can vary considerably based on the specific context
and mathematical framework used to describe space and time.
This section discusses models of adjacency, communication, and linkage in the context of space-time.
The most fundamental concept in modeling space-time is the notion of locations
that can be occupied by certain information or properties, along with their adjacencies or neighborhoods.
Within a neighborhood, elements can be considered adjacent to each other in various ways.
One way to represent adjacency is through a graph-like structure,
and another is by intersecting open regions, as in algebraic topology.
The implied connectivity resulting from adjacency relationships naturally leads to a graph structure,
whether it represents a physical network or serves as a mathematical map or co-ordinatization.
Shannon's communication model, which includes a source, sink, and channel,
is a valuable tool in understanding adjacency in communication and space-time.
It unifies the idea of set intersection with graph-like adjacency
and represents how information is shared through channels.
In this model, any source element can be considered a transmitter or receiver,
and adjacency is established through a communication channel.
The communication channel can be discrete and symbolic, as in Shannon's discrete channel model.
This discussion highlights the concept of adjacency as a fundamental aspect of space-time modeling,
where elements can communicate or interact with each other through various channels or pathways.
The Shannon communication model provides a useful framework for understanding these relationships.
In this section, the mathematical structures of space-time are discussed,
primarily focusing on sets and topology.
Sets and topology
The most fundamental mathematical notion of space starts with elementary topology.
Topology deals with sets of elements, often referred to as points.
These points are grouped into sets that can overlap or intersect, effectively covering the entire space.
Topology is concerned with properties like continuity, connectedness, and limiting convergence or path ordering.
A topology is a set of points with associated neighborhoods that satisfy certain axioms.
Elementary points
At this elementary level, the size or unambiguous meaning of basic elements and concepts is not defined.
Points are considered as semantic primitives that may or may not have internal structure.
Their size or extent is deemed meaningless, as points are seen as agents that possess the property of location.
Neighborhoods and open sets
A crucial concept in topology is that of neighborhoods.
A neighborhood of an element, P, in a set, S, is a subset, N, of, S, that includes an open set, U, containing, P.
Open sets are defined such that they don't include any of their boundary points.
Neighborhoods can be thought of as open balls in the context of manifolds.
Key concepts
Three key concepts emerge from topology.
Continuity
It relates to functions and implies that small changes in the space result in small changes in the function.
Connectedness
A space is considered connected if it's not a union of disjoint open sets.
Compactness
This concept generalizes the idea of closure of a set.
Compactness suggests that the points are naturally close together in some sense, depending on the notion of boundedness.
These concepts form the foundation for understanding spaces mathematically, but they do not define the size, structure, or nature of the points within the space.
The concept of open sets, neighborhoods, continuity, connectedness, and compactness helps characterize spatial properties without specifying the details of the points themselves.
In this section, various mathematical concepts related to vectors, dimensionality, matroids, categories, and algebras are discussed.
Vectors between elements and direction
Directionality in mathematical spaces can be defined using vectors, traditionally associated with Euclidean-Cartesian spaces.
However, vectors can be associated with any pair of elements in any space, not limited to Euclidean spaces.
Unit vectors are defined based on adjacent named elements within a given scale.
A vector between two elements is represented as S, H, equals F, C, S, J, where C and S, J are elements in the space.
If two elements are not adjacent, a vector may still be defined as a path or root, consisting of several transitions between elements.
This path need not represent a straight-line root, as assumptions about the structure of intermediate points cannot be made in general spacetimes.
Coordinates, bases, matroidides, and independent dimensions
In spaces constructed from sets of elements, dimensionality is not inherently given but is a matter of choice.
Dimensionality depends on the independence of vectors or elements, similar to the concept of a basis in vector spaces.
The analog of a basis for sets is called a matroid, which captures and generalizes the notion of linear independence.
A matroid consists of a set of elements, E, and a spanning set of subsets, I, where I represents independent sets.
The dimensionality of a set is defined by a specific matroid basis, and there can be multiple bases for the same set, leading to non-uniqueness of dimension.
Categories and Algebras
Category theory is a way of classifying structures and arrangements in a very general sense.
A category comprises objects and arrows, morphisms, that behave as functions.
Arrows map from a domain to a codomain via functions, and they satisfy the properties of associativity and identity.
Examples include the category of sets, set, where arrows represent total functions, monoids, and with a binary operation, partially ordered sets, post-sets, and more.
Categories can vary in complexity, from simple categories with no objects or arrows, category 0, to categories with multiple objects, identity arrows, and composition, e.g., category 3.
These mathematical concepts provide a foundation for understanding the structure, dimensionality, and relationships within mathematical spaces, while also highlighting the flexibility and choices involved in defining these properties.
In this section, you're discussing category theory and algebraic structures.
Category theory
Category theory is a broad mathematical framework for classifying and studying structures and relationships.
A category consists of objects and arrows, morphisms, that behave like functions.
Arrows map from a domain, source object to a codomain, target object via function f, a, rightwards arrow, b.
Composition of arrows must be associative, h, white bullet, g, white bullet, f, equals h, white bullet, g, white bullet, f.
Identity arrows, id, exist for each object, and they satisfy it be, white bullet, f, equals f, and f, white bullet, id, equals f.
Algebras
A monoid, a monoid, m, is a set with an operation, e.g., multiplication, that is associative and has an identity element, e.g., x, middle dot, y, middle dot, z, equals x, middle dot, y, middle dot, z, for all x, y, z, and n.
Monoids are a type of algebraic structure.
A partially ordered set, poe set, is a set, p, equipped with a relation, less than or equal to, that preserves ordering and can represent monotonic functions.
Categories and examples
You provide examples of categories with varying complexities.
Category 0, has no objects and no arrows.
Category 1, consists of one object and one arrow, the identity.
Category 2, contains two objects, two identity arrows, and one arrow from one object to the other.
Category 3, involves three objects, three identity arrows, and two arrows between the objects.
These examples illustrate how categories can range from very simple, with no objects or arrows, to more complex, with multiple objects, arrows, and compositions.
Category theory is a powerful tool for studying relationships and structures in mathematics and various fields of science.
In this section, you discuss various concepts related to operators, total functions, and diagrams in the context of category theory.
Operators and Total Functions
You introduce the concept of operators as total functions.
An operator, such as O1 or O2, maps from a domain D to a co-domain I.
Two operator functions, O1 and O2, can be combined into a single total function O2, white bullet O1, mapping directly from D to C, eliminating intermediate range I.
Inner products of mappings are possible when transformations are compatible and smoothly joinable across an intermediate domain.
Diagrams as Categories
Diagrams are graphs with functionally labeled edges.
In the context of category theory, diagrams become categories when each object is labeled,
and directed edges are consistently labeled with morphisms, e.g., F, G, H, and domains co-domains.
Commutative diagrams are diagrams where all paths from one object to another are equivalent and equal despite passing through different intermediate co-domains.
An example diagram demonstrates commutativity when F, white bullet, G equals F0, white bullet, G0, even with different intermediate co-domains, B and C.
You mentioned the concepts of initial objects, sources, and final objects, syncs, in diagrams, where initial objects have one arrow to a neighbor, and final objects receive one arrow from a neighbor.
These concepts provide a foundation for understanding how operators, total functions, and diagrams fit into the framework of category theory,
allowing for the study of relationships and structures in various domains.
In this section, you discuss vector spaces and their fundamental properties.
Vector spaces
A vector space is commonly associated with Euclidean space and consists of tuples of coordinates, such as X, Y, Z.
In a vector space, vectors are defined as transitions between two points V equals P1, P2, emphasizing the importance of transitions rather than the points themselves.
Vector spaces
Vector spaces exhibit the algebraic structure of a group and satisfy group axioms for two types of operations, addition, plus, and scalar multiplication.
The group axioms for vector addition include closure, associativity, the existence of an identity element, 0, the existence of inverses, U, and commutativity.
Scalar multiplication in a vector space adheres to closure, associativity, and the existence of an identity element, 1U.
These properties define the foundational structure of vector spaces and provide the basis for performing operations and transformations within such spaces.
Vector spaces are fundamental in various mathematical and physical contexts, allowing for the representation and manipulation of multidimensional data.
In this section, you delve into the concepts related to vector spaces.
Group Lattice
Vector spaces are often referred to as having a lattice structure, which represents an ordered, regular tiling of vectors in translations.
This lattice structure provides a simple tuple representation for points in the vector space.
Homogeneity of a space means uniform properties along a single direction, while isotropy implies uniform properties in all directions around a point of observation.
Naming of points in coordinate systems
Points in an n-dimensional vector space are typically represented as coordinate tuples, often as column vectors.
These coordinate tuples can be expressed as linear combinations of orthonormal basis vectors.
Orthonormal basis vectors are used to decompose vectors into their components.
Rank, Linear Independence, and Dimensionality
The dimensionality of a vector space is related to the number of linearly independent basis vectors.
Linear independence means that no non-zero linear combination of basis vectors results in the zero vector.
Euclidean spaces are typically defined by the number of linearly independent basis vectors required to represent them.
In group theory, algebras generating the equational structure of a group can be represented as vectors,
with the rank of the algebra indicating the number of independent generators.
These concepts are fundamental in understanding how vector spaces are constructed,
how points are named within them,
and how dimensionality and linear independence are defined in such spaces.
In this section, you cover several concepts related to tensors,
inner products, matrices, and transformations.
Tensors, order, and rank
Tensors are index arrays of values that transform correctly between different coordinate bases.
Vectors are tensors of order 1, matrices have order 2,
and objects of higher dimensions can also be formed.
Rank refers to the number of independent sets composing the object,
distinct from the order of the tensor.
For example, a matrix with rank 1 can be expressed as the outer product of two non-zero rank 1 vectors.
Distance and inner product
Vectors have inner products that can be used to calculate distances and projections.
The inner product of two vectors represents their relative length and can be interpreted geometrically.
The inner product is zero for orthogonal vectors, satisfying the orthonormality condition.
Matrices and transformations
Matrices with components midge are used for transformations and symmetries.
Matrix multiplication is defined as an inner product between matrices,
and it's associative but not always commutative.
Matrices are fundamental for describing transformations,
especially in the context of relativity for local observers.
Derivatives and vectors
Derivatives measure how quickly a function changes with respect to a constraint parameter
and are typically defined in Euclidean space.
On a lattice or discrete space,
the smallest distance between neighbors is considered constant,
making it challenging to define distances in derivatives.
These concepts are crucial for understanding how tensors,
inner products, and matrices are used to represent transformations
and derivatives in various mathematical contexts.
In this section, you discuss the interconnection of mathematical concepts
and introduce the idea of embedding subspaces into higher-dimensional spaces.
Boundaries, subspaces, and immersion of structures
Subspaces of lower dimensions can be embedded into higher-dimensional Euclidean spaces
by using additional constraints.
These subspaces, often referred to as hypersurfaces,
are defined by equations like, Greek small letter Chi, V equals 0,
where V is a vector in the higher-dimensional space.
By adding such constraints,
you can reduce the dimensionality of the solution set for V,
effectively representing a lower-dimensional space within the higher-dimensional one.
For example,
a two-dimensional sphere, S2,
can be embedded within three-dimensional Euclidean space, R3.
The concept of embedding is also used to decompose vector spaces
into subspaces or non-overlapping hypersurfaces,
which is valuable for understanding complex structures like graphs.
This discussion highlights how mathematical concepts,
such as subspaces and constraints,
can be used to represent lower-dimensional structures within higher-dimensional spaces,
providing a more flexible and interconnected framework
for modeling various mathematical phenomena.
In this section,
you discuss manifolds and Minkowski spacetime
in the context of special relativity.
Manifolds and Minkowski spacetime
When adding time as an independent coordinate to Euclidean space,
you introduce a new coordinate, T,
which allows you to describe the velocity of an observer with respect to an element.
The constancy of the speed of light suggests that it is a fundamental form of transmission,
especially in a discrete spacetime.
In the context of special relativity,
where the speed of light is constant,
transformations between observers' reference frames
are generated by the Poincaré group in a four-dimensional representation.
A manifold is a generalization of locally Euclidean space
that can possess global curvature.
For example,
the surface of a sphere deviates from Euclidean geometry.
In modern formulations of special relativity,
the constancy of signal propagation,
speed of light is treated as a fundamental constant.
It is expressed as an invariant inner product on Euclidean space,
defining spacetime in a four-dimensional context.
The metric tensor,
Greek small letter EDA,
Greek small letter Nu,
diagonal elements,
minus 1,
1,
1,
1 generalizes the concept of spacetime curvature
used in general relativity
and curved coordinate systems.
This extension of time into spatial coordinates
introduces a fundamental choice,
embedding a clock into the coordinate system itself.
The Poincaré group transformations account for changes in the rates of clocks
for different observers,
recognizing that a fixed universal measuring scale
is incompatible with the constancy of the speed of light.
This discussion illustrates how the inclusion of time as a coordinate
and the constancy of the speed of light
lead to the formulation of spacetime,
with important implications for special relativity
and the behavior of observers in different reference frames.
In this section,
you delve into the concept of graphs or networks
as a discrete representation of space.
Graphs or networks
Graph theory provides a fundamental discrete notion of space
that generalizes lattices and introduces minimal initial semantics.
A graph G equals V, E comprises nodes or vertices, V, and edges, E,
connecting these nodes.
The structure and dimensionality of this space
are determined by the topology of the edges.
Graphs can be acyclic, no loops, or form a forest,
which is a collection of possibly disconnected tree-like
or acyclic graphs.
Unlike group lattices,
graphs do not imply regularity of structure.
Graphs can be directed,
with arrows indicating one-way connections,
or undirected,
implying connections in both directions.
Graphs separate the notions of dimension and direction
from adjacency, change, and connectivity,
making these issues more apparent.
Adjacency of matrix representation
A graph can be represented by an adjacency matrix A,
which describes the connectivity between nodes.
For a graph with ordered vertices,
the adjacency matrix A defines the relationships between nodes.
The matrix element R is considered a generator of translation
or a degree of freedom,
taking the value 1 if node R points to node C.
Greek small letter lambda represents an unspecified eigenvalue of a matrix,
while Greek small letter rho denotes the principal eigenvalue
or spectral radius of a strongly connected graph.
A graph with repeated eigenvalues in its spectrum is called degenerate.
Indegree, kin refers to the number of links pointing to a node,
while outdegree, count, represents the number of outgoing links from a node.
In a directed graph,
the real sum of the adjacency matrix provides the outdegree of the corresponding node,
and the column sum gives the indegree.
You mentioned the use of submatrices,
such as the square leading diagonal submatrix R
and non-square off-diagonal submatrix R C.
This section introduces the fundamental concepts of graphs,
adjacency matrices,
and degrees of nodes within a graph,
highlighting the distinctions between dimension, direction, and connectivity.
In this section,
you discuss various aspects of graphs and their representations.
Strongly Connected Components, SEC
An SEC, strongly connected component in a directed graph
is a maximal subgraph in which there exists a directed path
from every node to every other node by some root.
Each node belongs to one and only one SEC,
and the number of SECs in a graph can vary from one,
in the case of a strongly connected graph,
to as many as N,
in a directed acyclic graph or DAG.
Connected graphs
You mentioned that for the purposes of this paper,
you focus on connected graphs,
which require that every node in a connected subgraph
has a path to every other node,
regardless of the direction of the links.
Completely Connected Components, CCC
A CCC,
completely connected component,
is defined as a maximal subgraph
where there exists a non-directed path
from every node to every other node
by direct adjacency.
Peron-Frobenius Theorem
The Peron-Frobenius Theorem
deals with the property of reducibility in a graph.
Irreducible regions in the graph
can be associated with SECs.
A matrix M with non-negative entries
is considered irreducible
if every element in M is greater than 0
in some infinite power of the matrix.
Functions on a Graph
You describe how a graph
can be represented in functional form
with vertices grouped into an n-tuple.
Vertices can be named using unique numbering.
The values in the tuple represent
a function's values on the vertices.
Graph edges may or may not have
specific interpretations,
but they can be associated
with elements of the graph.
You highlight the importance
of correlation matrices
in statistical analyses,
where correlations between elements
become the relative weights
or distances in the graph.
The adjacency matrix's operation
acts as a generator of a transformation
on the tuple of vertex names.
Eigenvalue distributions over the graph,
especially the principal AIGEN function,
describe the relative centrality of nodes.
Self-loops and graphs are crucial
for global stability,
allowing for the pumping
of functional values at source nodes
and orbiting at sync nodes
to avoid singularities.
This section provides insight
into the mathematical
and structural aspects of graphs,
their components,
and their use in representing
various relationships and data.
In this section,
you delve into the properties of graphs,
including measuring distances,
linear independence,
spanning trees,
and scale transformations.
Distance on a graph
HOPs
You discuss measuring the distance
between two nodes on a graph
as the length of the path,
measured in HOPs,
by summing the values of R,
edge values,
along the path.
Linear independence,
matroides,
and spanning trees.
In a graph,
there's no direct concept
of linear independence,
but you introduce the concept
of matroides
to define dimensionality
in terms of sets of edges.
Independent edges
can be considered
those that form a forest,
implying no cycles in the graph,
which aligns with the concept
of a spanning tree.
Any edges that create loops
make the edges dependent
because they introduce
multiple roots
to the same location.
Functions on a graph
You describe how a graph
can be represented
with a functional form
where vertices are grouped
into an n-tuple,
representing values
of a function on the vertices.
The importance of correlation matrices
in statistical analyses
is highlighted,
where edge values represent
correlations between elements.
You mentioned that
the adjacency matrix operation
acts as a generator
of a transformation
on the tuple of vertex names.
Eigenvalue distributions
over the graph,
especially the principal
AIGEN function,
describe the relative
centrality of nodes.
Self-loops in graphs
are discussed
for global stability,
allowing pumping of values
at source nodes
and orbiting at sync nodes
to avoid singularities.
Scale transformations
on a graph
Scaling in a graph
is not as straightforward
as in self-similar structures,
and graphs are not
inherently self-similar.
You discuss how scaling
in a graph
can involve constructing
strongly connected components
up to a certain number
of nodes
or a horizon,
creating new elements
and links.
Derivatives and vectors.
You describe vectors
on a graph
as pairs of vertices,
i, j,
and mention that
valid vectors
typically connect
directly connected vertices.
The partial derivative
of a function on a graph
is defined
along nearest neighbor edges,
providing the way
to measure changes.
Lattices from irregular graphs.
You consider the challenge
of obtaining
familiar lattice structures
from irregular graphs.
In a lattice,
neighboring points
are generally connected
unless there's a boundary.
In a graph,
this assumption doesn't hold,
and paths are not orthogonal.
You pose a question
about the requirements
for imposing
large-scale lattice-like structures
from local graphs.
This section provides insights
into the intricacies
of measuring distances,
defining dimensionality,
and considering transformations
in the context
of graph theory,
emphasizing the differences
between graphs
and more structured lattices.
In this section,
you discuss symbolic grammars
as spatial models,
emphasizing their role
in information sciences
and language processing.
Symbolic Grammars
in Languages
Information sciences
involve recognizing
and manipulating
discrete sequential patterns
known as languages,
which are composed
of symbols.
Symbols themselves
can be spatial patterns
or representations
of spatial patterns,
enabling the compression
of spatial representations.
Grammars and Syntax
Grammars are used
to model the syntax
of languages,
defining the structure
of allowed strings
of symbols.
You mentioned
the Chomsky hierarchy
of transformational grammars,
which classifies languages
into four levels
of complexity,
each corresponding
to a class of automata
capable of parsing them.
Dimensionality
and topology
in languages.
While languages
are typically represented
in a one-dimensional
sequence of symbols,
context-free grammars
allow for the embedding
of parenthetical structures.
You discuss
how interpretation
can involve
multidimensional views,
analogous to storing data
on a computer
with complex storage arrangements.
Automata
as classifiers
of grammatical structure.
Automata are essential
for recognizing
the grammatical structure
of languages
and play a crucial role
in human computer systems.
You describe
the Chomsky hierarchy
and how each level
in the hierarchy
encompasses the lower levels,
providing a hierarchy
of computational complexity.
Time in an automaton
or state machine
progresses
with the arrival
of each new symbol
in a language string,
effectively serving
as its own clock,
with an explicit
one-to-one mapping
between space and time.
The section highlights
the significance
of grammars,
automata,
and symbolic representations
in understanding
and processing languages,
emphasizing their role
in information science
and computational linguistics.
In this section,
you introduce
the concept of eye graphs
as a model
for spatial structures
with intentional semantics,
following concepts
from category theory.
Elements in a grammar.
You discuss
how a grammatical structure,
used to span a space
like a document,
consists of atomic elements,
symbols from a language's alphabet
and larger regions
formed by repeated patterns.
Patterns or regions
that repeat in a language
can be aggregated
into larger elements
during data compression,
reducing the size
of the space.
Naming elements.
You mentioned
that regular expressions
or patterns
in embedded regular languages
represent repeating words
in a language,
often used
in parsing documents.
You provide an example
of the hypertext
markup language,
HTML,
where the semantics
of regions
are encoded
into the names
for relevant parenthesis.
Bi-graphs.
Nested structures.
You introduce bi-graphs
as a model
for spatial arrangements
in computer science,
emphasizing their role
in describing machinery.
Bi-graphs are described
using points
that may contain
internal structures,
including holes
to be filled in
with other bi-graphs.
Bi-graphs provide
a non-Euclidean view
of space,
emphasizing interfaces
and containment relationships.
Bear graphs,
forests,
and links.
You describe
bear bi-graphs,
which consist of vertices,
some of which are nested,
and edges
representing communication channels.
You differentiate
between forest graphs,
hierarchical relationships,
and link graphs,
connectivity channels,
derived from
the bear bi-graph.
Boundaries and interfaces
on a bi-graph.
You discuss the concept
of interfaces
and bi-graphs,
which allow for mappings
from inner to outer faces,
representing transformations
between regions and links.
Interfaces can be
site-region interfaces,
where regions represent places,
or link interfaces
that extrude
from the outmost region.
You show how regions
and sites are represented
in bi-graphs,
emphasizing their role
as inner and outer faces.
Interfaces for links
are shown as incoming
and outgoing,
ready to connect
with connectors
at the boundary
of other places.
Fully featured bi-graph,
You illustrate
a fully featured bi-graph
with regions,
sites,
links,
and interfaces,
providing an example
of a mapping
from inner to outer faces.
Overall,
this section introduces
bi-graphs as a model
for spatial structures
with rich semantics,
emphasizing their use
in computer science
to describe arrangements
and machinery.
In this section,
you delve deeper
into bi-graphs
and their use
in modeling spatial structures
with semantics.
Signatures and sorts
You discuss the importance
of adding sorts types
to bi-graph vertices
to provide elementary semantics.
Typing vertices
with type
and arity for links
allows for classifying vertices
based on named roles.
The concept of controls,
which are names
associated with vertices,
is introduced,
and a signature
is defined as a way
to classify nodes
by role.
Composition of Bi-Graph Operators
You explain different ways
to compose bi-graphs,
including juxtaposition,
proper inner product,
semi-proper inner product,
and improper inner product.
The composition of bi-graphs
involves matching
the incoming and outgoing faces,
making them compatible
for composition.
Incompatible bi-graphs
cannot be composed,
denoted as
G1-G2.
You provide examples
and illustrations
of these composition methods.
Time and Motion
in Bi-Graphs
You draw parallels
between bi-graphs
and linear algebra
by treating bi-graphs
as transformers
of compatible bi-graphs.
The idea of change
in bi-graphs
can be enacted
by reaction rules,
analogous to group transformations
in linear algebra.
Time is enacted
by reaction rules
or the transformation stages
that bi-graph machinery undergoes.
Bi-graphs are described
as spatial containers
with interfaces
expressing dimensionality
at the joins
between regions.
You emphasize
that bi-graphs
provide a different viewpoint
from the traditional
dynamical traditions
of physics,
focusing on containment semantics.
However,
you note that bi-graphs
have limitations
in representing
dynamic changes,
as they primarily
focus on semantic changes.
Overall,
this section
explores the use
of bi-graphs
as a formalism
for modeling
spatial structures
with semantics
and discusses
their compositional aspects
in relationship
and relationship
to linear algebra.
It also highlights
their unique perspective
on change
and limitations
in representing
dynamic changes.
In this section,
the following key points
and concepts
are discussed.
Space and time.
Space is described
as a set of adjacencies
between basic elements.
Time is counted
through distinguishable
changes of state.
Space-time serves
as a measuring system
for transitions,
represented both
as coordinates,
names,
and as transitions,
change.
Transition matrices
and symmetries.
A set of independent
transition matrices
forms a basis
for allowed changes
in space,
leading to a global
transition matrix
or adjacency graph.
Distance,
extent,
and change
are related concepts,
all connected
to transitions.
Dimensionality of space.
The dimension of a space
is considered
a semantic issue
and depends on
the naming of occasions.
and tupple dimensionality.
Spaces can be composed
using inner and outer products
for joining
and exfoliating,
respectively.
Scales in space.
Different scales in space
imply various levels
of coarse graining
of basic elements,
with regular lattices
having scale-invariant
multiplicative
renormalizations.
Proper time and change.
Time is measured
by changes in the states
available to an observer.
Proper time encompasses
all states
and is not independent
of space.
Structural compositions.
The structural compositions,
or grammars,
of space-times
are algorithmic
in their representations
and complexity.
Two classes of objects.
Some models
have two classes
of objects,
such as places
and agents,
each with their connections,
while graphs
typically have
a single class
of vertices
representing both.
Received notion
of dimension.
The conventional notion
of dimension
is closely tied
to tuple coordinates,
where each component
has a unique name.
Graph theory.
General graphs
highlight differences
compared to manifolds
and raise issues
about the percolation
of large-scale motion.
Category theory
and bi-graphs.
Category theory
offers a functional viewpoint
but provides
limited insights
into the structural
nature of space-time.
Bi-graphs offer
a view of space
with substantial
semantic content,
but they may lack
the semantics
of autonomy,
decision-making,
and individual agency.
The discussion
in this section
touches on the nature
of space,
time,
and their representations,
as well as the limitations
and strengths
of different formalisms
in capturing
the semantics
of space-time.
The concept of autonomy
and individual agency
in the context
of bi-graphs
is highlighted
as an area
that may require
further exploration.
In this section,
we delve into
the fundamentals
of promise theory,
which is introduced
as a framework
for understanding
space-time
from the perspective
of autonomous agents
and intended behavior.
Here are some key points
from this section.
Motivation for promise theory.
Promise theory
is motivated
by the need
to represent
non-uniform observer
interpretations
of relationships
between elements
and spaces,
especially in technology.
It can shed light
on assumptions
about physical space-time
and provide a framework
for understanding
artificial constructions
in information sciences.
Autonomous agents.
Agents are the
fundamental elements
in promise theory,
representing entities
that can exhibit
agency or intent,
either inherently
or by proxy.
Autonomous agents
control their own behavior,
make promises
by themselves,
and cannot be forced
to comply
with external impositions.
Promise theory basics.
Promise theory
is a framework
for expressing
intended behavior
graphically
through promises
made between
autonomous agents.
Promises describe
the nature of relationships
between elements
and space,
including permissions
to move from one element
to another.
Promises come
in two polarities.
Plus for assertion semantics,
giving and,
for projection semantics,
accepting.
Impositions are denoted
when an agent
imposes behavior
on another agent.
Promise model.
A promise model
consists of a graph
with vertices,
agents,
and edges.
Promises are in positions
used to communicate
intentions.
Agents publish
their intentions,
and agents in scope
of those promises
may choose whether
or not to pay attention.
Promise binding.
A promise binding
represents a voluntary
constraint on agents,
and the perceived
strength of this binding
is a subjective judgment
made by each agent
in scope of the promises.
The effective action
of a promise
is the possible overlap
between the promises
made by two agents.
Interaction and adjacency.
A promise binding
is the basis
for interaction,
and adjacency
is crucial in this context.
Promise theory
introduces a novel
perspective on space-time,
emphasizing the role
of intention
and interactions
among autonomous agents.
It offers a framework
for understanding
behavior,
constraints,
and relationships
in complex systems.
In this section
of the text,
the concept of constraints
and the relativity
of observations
within the context
of promise theory
is discussed.
Here are the key points.
Exchange of promise behavior.
When two agents
engage in an exchange
of promise behavior,
the level of cooperation
perceived by agents
in the scope
of each promise
can vary.
For instance,
if Agent A promises
to give something,
B1,
to Agent B
and, in return,
Agent B promises
to accept something,
B2,
the level of cooperation
may differ
between these two promises.
An agent in the scope
of both promises
will perceive
the cooperation level
as the intersection
of B1 and B2,
denoted as B1
intersection B2.
Relativity of observations.
The relativity
of observations
means that different agents
may have varying perceptions
of the same promises
and their levels
of cooperation.
Each agent makes decisions
based on the information
available to them.
Prerequisite promises.
The provision
of a prerequisite promise,
Greek small letter pi,
by an assistant agent
is acceptable
only if the principal promiser,
XD,
also promises
to acquire the service,
Greek small letter pi,
from an assistant.
This ensures
that the prerequisite promise
is fulfilled
and consistent
within the promise model.
Observational Semantics.
Promise theory
involves observational semantics,
which considers
how different agents
interpret and attribute
meaning to promises,
including concepts
like trust and belief.
These interpretations
are essential for science
and are inherent
in the theory.
Agents Names,
Identifiers,
and Namespaces.
Agents may or may not
promise their names
or identities to others.
Observers may promise
to accept
and associate
unique identities
with agents
they can observe
directly or indirectly.
These identities
are local to the observer.
The concept of a namespace
belongs solely
to the observer,
and it's the observer's
interpretation
that determines
whether agents
are identifiable.
Distinguishing Agents.
Agents can be distinguished
based on distinguishable promises,
observer labeling,
or knowledge
of the path
between them
and the observer,
if trusted.
The naming of agents
is not constant
or necessarily unique
over an extended region
in promise theory,
in contrast
to some other models
of space-time.
Renormalizing Assumptions.
Promise theory requires
a re-evaluation
of what can be taken
for granted
since agents
may not have agreed
to coordinate
to ensure unique,
distinguishable identities.
The assumptions
about naming
an identity
in promise theory
are different
from traditional models.
Promise theory
introduces the idea
that the perception
of promises
and cooperation
can be relative,
and it emphasizes
the role of observers
and their interpretations
in determining
the semantics
of promises
and interactions.
In this section,
the text discusses
the concept of adjacency
and its relation
to space-time
in promise theory.
Here are the key points.
Promise adjacency
in communication.
In promise theory,
adjacency is associated
with the ability
to communicate messages.
The assumption
is made that adjacency
and the ability
to exchange information
are closely related.
Essentially,
space reflects
an agent's capacity
to observe
and transport information.
Adjacency promise.
An adjacency promise
is a promise
that relates one agent,
XIA,
to another specific
and unique agent,
XJ.
It may also provide
a local interpretation
of relative orientation
or direction
between these agents.
Examples of adjacency promises
include being close to,
being able to see
or hear a neighbor,
being able to point to,
or being attracted
to another agent.
Adjacency promise binding
to bind adjacent points
in a space-time,
a bundle of bilateral promises
is required.
These promises create
a channel between agents,
allowing the transmission
of directed influence.
Specifically,
Agent XN promises
that Agent,
X underscore N plus 1,
may transmit
directed influence
plus to it.
Agent,
X underscore N plus 1,
promises to use
the offer from XN.
Agent,
X underscore N plus 1,
promises that XN
may transmit
directed influence
plus to it.
Agent XN promises
to use
the offer from
X underscore N plus 1,
Newton's third law
and promise theory.
In promise theory,
Newton's third law,
which states that action
and reaction
are equal and opposite,
is not automatically guaranteed.
What is given
is not necessarily received
unless explicitly promised,
similar to how charge
is documented
with explicit promises.
Duality rules.
The duality rules
in promise theory
allow us to interpret
the acceptance
of an accept message promise
as a promise
to send messages.
This interpretation
cement the adjacency relationship
and makes it
an undirected graph.
Scope of promises.
The scope of any
promised adjacency
typically extends
to the two agents
involved in the
adjacency relationship.
However,
it can also extend
beyond them,
allowing others
to observe
the relative positioning
of points
and coordinate
distributive behaviors.
Partitioning promise networks.
A promise network
can be partitioned
into two parts.
The graph of promise bindings
that refer to adjacency
and communication
between agents.
All other promises
that use the former promises
to expand their scope.
Matter can be thought of
as spacetime
with special properties
represented by bundles
of scalar promises
anchored to agents
with positions
due to their adjacency promises.
In essence,
promise theory
provides a framework
for understanding
spacetime
in terms of adjacency promises
and communication
between autonomous agents.
This perspective
allows for the emergence
of spatial relationships
and the coordination
of behaviors
among agents.
In this section,
the text discusses
the concepts
of spatial continuity,
direction,
and bases within
the framework
of promise theory.
Here are the key points.
Spatial continuity.
Continuity in promise theory
refers to the idea
that if a certain direction
exists at a specific location,
she,
it should continue to exist
in the local neighborhood
around that location.
However,
understanding spatial continuity
in an autonomous framework
is challenging.
Direction as a non-local concept.
Direction,
such as traveling north,
is a non-local concept
that is uniform
over a wide region.
It goes beyond
the closest neighboring agents.
Agents can promise
to bind to certain neighbors
with similar names,
e.g.,
north,
south.
But ensuring that this behavior
continues to the next agent
raises questions
about standardization.
Membership in Bases Sets
Membership in a basis set
is a semantic invention
used by observers.
It cannot be imposed
on autonomous agents.
Each agent is free
to classify other agents
as members of independent sets
within the matroid
that spans its observable world.
This means that
the dimensionality of space-time
can vary depending
on the observer's perspective.
Local Observer View.
The dimensionality of space-time
experienced by elements
is different for every agent
and at every point.
Each observer decides
its own set of independent sets
to span its space,
making direction
a local observer view.
Defining Direction.
Direction can be defined
by a sequence of agents,
eggs, i, that are mutually adjacent.
An agent recognizes a direction
if it promises adjacency,
plus edge along that direction
to a subsequent neighbor,
she, plus one,
and promises to accept adjacency,
edge with a previous neighbor,
she, one.
Homogeneous Promises.
To maintain direction
over a region,
all agents must conform
to these promises,
which is a non-local constraint
requiring long-range homogeneity
between the agents.
Multidimensional Interpretation.
Directional names belong
to the local agent's
coordinate basis,
and the non-local cooperation
is assumed to be homogeneous.
This allows for the possibility
of a multidimensional interpretation
with coordinate names
x, y, z.
Long-range order,
such as a crystal lattice,
can emerge through local,
autonomous promises
as long as they are homogeneous
over a sufficient region.
In summary,
spatial continuity,
direction,
and bases in promise theory
highlight the role
of local observer perspectives
and the importance
of autonomous agent's promises
in defining space-time properties.
These concepts emphasize
the cooperative nature
of space-time formation
and organization among agents.
In this section,
the text discusses symmetry,
short and long-range order
within the context
of promise theory
and its implications
for understanding space-time.
Here are the key points.
Symmetry and order.
Promise theory draws an analogy
between adjacency,
vector, promise bindings
and chemical bonds
with the addition
of semantic types.
A graph of autonomous agents
without adjacency bindings
has a state of maximal symmetry
akin to a disordered
or gaseous state.
When agents promise adjacency
uniformly and homogeneously,
it results in long-range order,
similar to a solid state
with a lattice coordinate system,
like a crystal.
Mixed phases.
In technological space-times,
such as computing infrastructure,
a mixture of phases is observed.
Devices like mobile phones
and computers move
without fixed adjacency
on the background
of more permanent fixtures,
like servers
and network switches.
Therefore,
space-times of mixed phases
can coexist within a single picture.
Analogous to phase transition,
the self-organization
of autonomous agents
shares similarities
with phase transitions
in matter caused
by local interactions.
This analogy raises questions
about whether there should be
a distinction between elements
of space-time and matter
in a discrete space-time.
Symmetry and order in space-time.
The text questions the origin
of long-range order
and symmetry in space-time.
It challenges the assumption
that all points
make the same promises,
as is typically assumed
in descriptions of space-time.
For example,
the Internet lacks
natural long-range order,
which affects
global network addressing.
Breaking symmetry.
Long-range order can exist
for various kinds of promises,
not just adjacency promises,
but adjacency promises
are specifically related
to connectivity.
One way to break symmetry
is to introduce a function
with a monotonic gradient
on space-time,
generating a notion
of consistent direction.
This concept is analogous
to chemotaxis
in cellular biology.
Non-local symmetries.
While promise theory aims
to build concepts
of regular space
from a local observer's perspective,
it acknowledges the presence
of non-local symmetries
that create long-range structure.
Understanding why
multiple agents
with no direct adjacency
should make the same promises
becomes a fundamental question.
Phases and transitions.
In promise theory,
the model resembles
that of a cellular automaton
with an undetermined topology.
It forces consideration
of phases
and the possibility
of transitions between them,
emphasizing the importance
of understanding
how long-range order
and symmetry
emerge in space-time.
In summary,
this section delves
into the intricate
relationship
between symmetry,
order,
and promises
in space-time,
challenging conventional
assumptions
and highlighting
the need to address
the origin
of long-range order
and symmetry
in a discrete
space-time framework.
In this section,
the text explores
the representation
of material,
scalar,
properties
in agent space
within the context
of promise theory.
Here are the main points.
Two representations
of properties.
There are two ways
to represent
a point-like property,
such as an agent
being blue
in agent space.
In the first case,
an agent merely
asserts the property
to another agent
without changing
the type of objects
between which promises
are made.
The conceptual world
of the property,
like blueness,
lives separately
from the agents themselves.
Subjective interpretation.
In the first representation,
different agents
may interpret
the promise
of blueness differently,
and there is no objective
calibrated standard
for blueness.
Merging physical
and conceptual worlds.
In the second representation,
a special agent
is introduced
to represent
material properties
like blueness.
The special agent
provides the property
as a service,
and association
with this source
of the property
gives an agent
that property.
Agents can obtain
the property
by promising
to use the service.
Coordination of properties.
Multiple agents
can coordinate
their definitions
of a property
either individually
in a peer-to-peer clique
or by using
a definitive calibration source.
Independent sets.
Each property,
or type of promise
representing
an intrinsic quality,
is a basis vector,
forming an independent set
in a matroid.
This set of links
radiates from a singularity,
resembling how charges
radiate lines of force.
Scalar promises
in database analog.
Scalar promises
used to label
material properties,
have similarities
to the use of
tags or
keywords
to label information documents
and inventory items
in databases.
They serve as
orthogonal dimensions
to the matroid
that spans agents
in the ordered phase
of a space-time.
In summary,
Promise Theory
offers a flexible framework
for representing
material properties
and their interaction
with agents,
highlighting the relationship
between properties,
agents,
and the concept
of independent sets
within matroidites.
This approach allows
for the integration
of physical
and conceptual worlds
in the representation
of properties.
In this section,
the text delves
into space-time,
vector,
promises,
and quasi-t-r-a-n-s-i-t-i-v-i-t-y.
Here are the key points.
Space-time promises.
Space-time promises
describe cumulative
relationships between
elements of space-time
and can be interpreted
in various ways.
A1 can influence
A2 causation.
A1 is connected
to A2 topology.
A1 is part of
A2 containment.
Examples of space-time promises.
The text provides
examples of space-time promises,
such as causation,
temporal ordering,
precedes follows,
influence,
effects,
and relationships
like specialization
is a special case of
and generalization
generalizes.
Quasi-transitivity.
Space-time promises
exhibit a kind of
quasi-t-r-n-s-i-t-i-v-i-t-y.
For example,
if A causes B
and B causes C,
there is a sense
in which one might
interpret that
A causes C.
These promises
create relationships
that generate
a space-time,
similar to a vector space.
Container models.
Container models
represent spatial relationships,
such as containment.
A1 is contained
by A2.
Inclusion.
A1 is found
within A2,
and part-hole relationships.
A1 is part of A2.
These models
form forest-graph relations
and contribute
to spatial continuity.
Incorporating
different spatial semantics.
Promise theory
provides a framework
to incorporate
both spatial semantics,
mainly translation,
symmetrical translations,
and containment,
forest-graph relations,
and links them
through quasi-t-r-n-s-i-t-i-v-i-t-y,
offering a notion
of spatial continuity.
Singular properties.
Promises that cannot
be transformed
into a succession
of symmetrical translations
are considered
singular properties.
These singular properties
represent promises
about the self,
rather than about
relationships with others.
They can be formulated
and interpreted
in two ways,
as promises
or as general associations
between topics
in a topic map.
In summary,
promise theory
allows for the representation
of various
space-time relationships
and spatial semantics,
including causation,
containment,
and influence,
by using promises
with quasi-transitive properties.
These promises
contribute
to the description
of space-time continuity
and relationships
between elements
within space-time.
In this section,
the text discusses
fields,
potentials,
boundaries,
and containment
within regions
and boundaries.
Here are the key points.
Fields and potentials.
The classical notion
of a field or potential
is seen as a functional
representation
of the separation
between vector adjacency promises,
space-time,
and local material promises,
the potential.
In a discrete space-time,
this concept is represented
as a separation
between scalar promises,
material properties,
and vector adjacency promises,
space-time.
Discrete representation
of fields.
Promise theory provides
a way to represent fields
in a discrete manner,
emphasizing the symbolic semantics
of particles
alongside dynamical properties.
Fields,
in this context,
are realized
as the promises
of material properties
at specific locations.
Boundaries.
Boundaries are defined
as interruptions
in vector continuity.
They explicitly break symmetries
and anchor symmetry generators
to fixed points.
Boundaries can be categorized
into continuity boundaries,
absence of adjacency promises,
and observation boundaries,
absence of negative adjacency promises.
Boundaries can be
semi-permeable membranes,
and their perceived extent
depends on observer semantics
or coordinatization.
Types of boundaries.
Different types of boundaries
are defined,
including edge boundaries,
promises,
plus minus sign,
edge to nine existing agents,
and material boundaries,
edge of a vector region
consisting of agents
promising a specific
material property.
Containment within regions.
Representing containment
within autonomous agent worlds
is challenging
since each agent
is atomic
and cannot be
inside another agent.
Containment is approached
as a bulk material property.
Compound agents,
denoted as AI,
are introduced,
representing sets of agents
that mutually promise
to belong to a specific role
or property are
Containment promise.
Containment promise
is defined as follows.
Compound agent A1
is R inside
or R contained by
compound agent A2
if A1 promises R2,
A2,
and A2 promises
plus R2,
A1.
This promise represents
membership in a region R,
defining a coarser green space
consisting of component agents.
Spatial overlap promise.
Spatial overlap promise
is defined as follows.
Compound agent A1
are a relapse
with compound agent A2
if A sub is a subset of A3
and A3 promises R2,
A2,
and A2 promises
plus R2 A sub.
In summary,
promise theory provides
a way to represent
fields and potentials
in a discrete spacetime,
defines boundaries
as interruptions
in vector continuity,
and introduces
compound agents
to represent
containment within regions.
These concepts
offer a unique perspective
on how spatial relationships
and containment
can be understood
in the context
of autonomous agents
and their promises.
In this section,
the text explores
the concept of time,
concurrency,
simultaneity,
timelines,
and the challenges
related to distributive consensus
among autonomous agents.
Here are the key points.
Local versus proper time.
Time is new differently
from the perspectives
of individual agents
and a hypothetical,
godlike observer.
Proper time represents
the complete overview
of all events
to an all-seeing observer.
In contrast,
individual agents
have information horizons
and can only observe
events within their limitations,
defining their local time.
Local clocks.
Agents measure
their own passage of time
using local clocks,
and this convention
can vary from place to place.
Local clocks are assumed
to be internal
and of zero size
for simplicity.
Shared clocks.
Agents can potentially
build shared clocks
with neighbors
through cooperation,
but this concept
goes beyond the scope
of the current paper.
Concurrent events.
Agents can only determine
the order of events
if there are explicit
dependency promises.
Events without documented
dependencies
are considered concurrent.
Distributive consensus example.
The text provides
an example of
distributive consensus
among four agents,
A, B, C, and D,
trying to synchronize
their activities.
The challenge is that
they may receive information
in a different order,
leading to diverse interpretations.
Autonomous agents.
Each agent knows
only what promises
it has been exposed
to and forms
its own timeline
based on this information.
Agents must rely
on trust and cooperation
to align their intentions.
Solving distributed consensus.
Solving the distributed
consensus problem
requires agents
to be less restrictive
in their behavior
and interact back and forth
to exchange information
about suitable overlapping time.
This process resembles
finding a Nash equilibrium
in game theory.
Emergent narrative of time.
In the world
of autonomous agents,
the notion of time
is an emergent narrative
that summarizes dependencies
between interacting agencies.
It is a post-hoc construction
based on the information
available to agents.
Overall,
the text highlights
the challenges
of distributed consensus,
the role of trust
and cooperation,
and the idea
that time in such a system
is a result of narratives
constructed by individual agents
based on their experiences
and interactions.
In this section,
the text explores
different models of motion
and the relationship
between empty space
and material.
Here are the key points.
Motion in agent space.
Motion in the context
of autonomous agents
is defined as a change
in the location
of promised attributes.
Behavior consists
of exhibiting
certain promise attributes,
and motion is assessed
by observing changes
in these attributes.
Different models of motion.
The text presents
three distinct models
of motion
within the framework
of promise theory.
Single agent gaseous model.
In this model,
there is a single kind
of agent in a gaseous state,
representing motion
as agents moving freely
within the space.
Two phase model.
This model features
a solid spatial lattice
with material properties
loosely bonded
to specific locations
within that lattice.
Motion involves
the position of matter
being determined
by its bonding
to elements of space.
Single agent transfer model.
In this model,
there is a single kind
of agent,
but physical properties
promised as matter
can bind to a specific agent
and be transferred
from one agent
to another.
Relevance in technology.
These models of motion
find relevance in technology
where they correspond
to various scenarios
such as mobile agents,
base station attachment
of mobile devices,
and fixed virtual infrastructure.
Nature's perspective.
The text raises
the question
of whether these models
also have relevance
in understanding
natural phenomena.
It suggests
that these alternatives
exist within material structures,
and the question remains open
regarding whether space-time
itself might be constructed
in a similar manner.
Overall,
this section explores
the concept of motion
in the context
of autonomous agents
and the different ways
it can be modeled
within promise theory,
drawing parallels
between these models
and technology
as well as speculating
on their potential applicability
to natural systems.
In this section,
the text discusses
the concept of motion
of the first kind
in a gaseous model
within the framework
of promise theory.
Here are the key points.
Homogeneous collection
of agents.
This model considers
a homogeneous collection
of agents
that can move
by swapping places
within an ordered graph
of adjacencies.
To simplify,
it focuses on
one-dimensional motion.
Knowledge of adjacent agents.
Agents need to be aware
of the existence
of other agents
to which they want to bind.
This knowledge is limited
to nearest neighbors,
introducing challenges
in multi-agent coordination.
Formation of adjacencies.
For agents to move,
they must form adjacencies
with their neighbors.
This requires multiple messages
and can create
a bootstrap problem
for the formation
of space-time structure.
Formation of a coordinate system.
The text raises the issue
of how to establish
a coordinate system
in a gaseous phase
when traditional sequential,
monotonic labels
cannot be used.
Preference in valuation functions.
Agents employ
a valuation function
on promises
to determine their preference
for certain combinations
of promises over others.
This introduces complexity
and preference
for promises
from farther away neighbors.
Conditional equilibrium promises.
To address issues
with loose ends
and non-simple connectivity,
conditional equilibrium promises
are introduced,
making promises contingent
on the recipient's acceptance.
Intrinsic versus cooperative motion.
Unlike the traditional view
of motion
as an injuncic behavior
of bodies,
this model reveals
that motion
is a cooperative,
non-local behavior
involving multiple agents.
Logical need for memory.
The exercise demonstrates
the logical need
for memory
of non-local information
to bootstrap motion,
highlighting the challenge
of describing motion
in agent-based space-time.
Overall,
this action delves
into the complexities
of modeling motion
in a gaseous agent space,
emphasizing the cooperative
and non-local nature of motion
and the necessity
of addressing these challenges
within promise theory.
In this section,
the text discusses motion
of the second kind
within the framework
of promise theory.
Here are the key points.
Two types of agents.
This approach separates agents
into two distinct classes.
Spatial skeleton agents,
C,
responsible for the ordered structure
of space-time,
and material agents,
M-J,
which carry non-ordered
material properties.
Agent interaction.
The motion consists
of rebinding material agents
to new space-time locations.
Material agents
effectively serve
as containers
for material promises,
and adjacency promises.
M,
plus binestine,
edge,
rightward,
0,
S,
account for the location
of matter
within space.
Application to mobile phones
and biographs.
This model resembles
the way mobile phones
attach to different
cell-based agents
by rebasing or rehoming
satellite agents
around a fixed cell location.
It's also used
in biographs
where locations
are fixed seats
around which material
agents agreed or migrate.
Velocity and binding.
Agents carrying momentum
must autonomously promise
to bind to new locations,
and information
about these binding points
must be relayed
between the spatial agents.
Simplicity compared
to motion of the first kind.
Motion of the second kind
involves fewer agents
and promises
for the transport
of a mobile agent,
making it simpler
than motion of the first kind.
Comparison to absolute space-time.
This model has similarities
to the concept
of absolute space-time
or the ether,
but it offers
a preferable alternative
to motion of the first kind.
Generalization to multiple
agent classes.
The text mentions
that similar issues
will persist
as they generalize
to many classes of agents
in later sections.
Other forms
of spatial belonging.
The binding to a sea concept
discussed here
can also be applied
to other forms
of spatial belonging,
such as membership
in a club or organization.
This approach to motion
introduces a clear distinction
between the structure
of space-time
and material properties,
providing the more
straightforward way
to model motion
and spatial relationships
within promise theory.
In this section,
the text explores
the concept of motion
of the third kind
within the framework
of promise theory.
Here are the key points.
No distinction
between agent types.
This approach
avoids distinguishing
between different classes
of agents,
keeping all agents
the same.
It can be thought of
as a peer-to-peer network
where every agent
is equal.
Transfer of promises.
Motion of the third kind
involves transferring promises
from one location
to the next.
Unlike the second kind,
there is no need
for a separate class
of spatial skeleton agents.
Global homogeneity.
In this model,
every agent in space
must be capable
of keeping every kind
of promise,
leading to a requirement
of global homogeneity.
There is no specialization
among agents.
Promises as a foundation.
The promises
and their transfer
in this model
resemble the construction
of quantum fields
by Schwinger
and the graphical approach
used by Feynman.
This approach
simplifies the model
by not distinguishing
between different types
of agents
and focusing on
the transfer of promises.
It draws parallels
with concepts
from quantum physics,
emphasizing the role
of promises
as the foundation
of motion
and interaction
within the framework
of promise theory.
In the context
of a finite state machine
and the framework
of promise theory,
the concept of speed
and acceleration
takes on a unique perspective.
Here are the key points.
Definition of speed.
Speed is defined
as the translation
of a measurable quantity
over a definite
time interval.
However,
in the context
of autonomous agents
and discrete transitions,
this definition
becomes complex.
Local time.
Agents in this system
can only measure
the passage of time
based on their
internal clocks.
Time is an intrinsic property,
and each agent
experiences its own time
independently.
Measurement of speed.
Measuring speed
within this framework
is challenging
because an agent
can only observe
the changes in properties
over time
based on its own
clock ticks.
Maximum speed.
In any discrete
transition system
that measures
its own time,
there is a maximum speed,
which can be defined
as unity.
This means that
all signals
within the system
must travel
at this maximum speed,
and there can never
be any acceleration.
Measurement uncertainty.
Observers within
this system
cannot measure
the speed of transport
with certainty.
This is because
they lack
direct knowledge
of the paths
taken by observable
properties,
and multiple
intermediary agents
may be involved.
Autonomy and trust.
Agents rely on
observations and promises
made by other agents
to form a model
of the external world.
However,
this model is subject
to uncertainty
and requires
extensive cooperation
between agents
to establish trust.
In summary,
speed and acceleration
within this framework
are fundamentally
different from
classical mechanics.
Speed is limited
to a maximum value,
and measuring it
with certainty
is challenging
due to the autonomy
of individual agents
and the discrete
nature of transitions.
Observations and trust
play a crucial role
in forming an agent's
understanding
of the external world.
The growth and depth
of agents
within a discrete
agent-based space time
introduce interesting
considerations
related to promises
and semantics.
Here are some key points
to understand.
Introducing and removing promises.
When new agents
are introduced
or existing agents
are removed,
it involves the creation
or termination
of promises.
These promises
can represent
various attributes
or behaviors.
The cost associated
with introducing
or removing promises
depends on the semantics
of these promises
and their impact
on the system.
Addressability and recognition.
New agents
must be addressable
within the system.
This means that
other agents
should be able
to recognize
and interact with them.
Addressability is crucial
for communication
and cooperation
between agents.
Uniqueness and naming.
Uniqueness of agents
is essential
to prevent conflicts
and ambiguity
within the system.
Naming or assigning
unique identifiers
like addresses
to agents
helps maintain
their individuality.
Ensuring uniqueness
may involve promises
related to naming
or entropy.
These considerations
highlight the role
of promises
in managing the birth
and death
of agents
within the space-time.
Promises help
define the attributes
and behaviors
of agents,
ensure their recognition
and addressability,
and maintain uniqueness
to avoid conflicts.
Additionally,
the expansion
and contraction
of space-time
in this context
may be influenced
by factors
such as resource
availability,
system design,
and the specific goals
of the agent-based system.
Managing the dynamics
of agents' birth
and death
is essential
for maintaining
the integrity
and functionality
of the space-time.
In this section
of the document,
the focus is
on unifying dynamics
and semantics
within a single description
at the space-time level.
This involves
the application
of promise theory
to knowledge spaces.
Knowledge spaces
are used
to model concepts
and their relationships,
providing a formal framework
for understanding
and representing
semantic information.
Some key points
and concepts
discussed in this section
include
modeling concepts
and relationships.
Knowledge modeling
introduces abstractions
like concepts
and their relationships.
Promise theory
helps formalize
these abstractions,
depersonalizing them
to understand
their properties
without ambiguity.
Context and concepts.
A concept is defined
as an agent
in a semantic space
with a non-numerical
coordinate name
and a non-empty context.
The context
of an agent
includes the collection
of agents
in its neighborhood
that influence
its semantics.
Concepts play a role
in linking agents
together
into superagents,
aggregating agents
into generalizations
or umbrella classes.
Coordinate systems
for knowledge spaces.
Coordinatizing
a knowledge space
is crucial
for addressability
and finding objects
within a repository
space or map.
Traditional approaches
use taxonomies,
relational cables,
hyperlinked structures,
and more.
Promise theory
allows for the representation
of these structures
and the encoding
of memory
of adjacencies
in semantics.
Roles of knowledge
space agents.
Knowledge space agents
have two primary roles,
concepts,
tokens of meaning
and exemplars,
occurrences of concepts.
Concepts represent
generalizations,
while exemplars
are specific instances.
The link between
these roles
is established
through associations,
forming an index.
Overall,
promise theory
provides a foundation
for understanding
and modeling
knowledge spaces,
offering insights
into how concepts,
relationships,
and semantics
can be integrated
into a unified framework.
This framework
has applications
in fields
such as information technology,
databases,
semantic webs,
and knowledge management.
It allows for the
formalization
of knowledge structures
and the exploration
of their scaling properties.
In this section
of the document,
the concept of semantic distance
and its significance
in knowledge spaces
is discussed.
Here are some key points.
Semantic distance
versus occurrence distance.
Semantic distance
refers to the abstract
distance between concepts,
typically measured
by the number
of transformations
or hops
required to move
from one concept
to another
in a knowledge representation.
On the other hand,
occurrence distance
is the sum
of adjacencies
between specific instances
or occurrences
of knowledge
in a space-time
that contains both.
These two types
of distances
help establish relationships
and closeness
between knowledge elements.
Value of aggregation.
Aggregating similar things
in a semantic space
is often more valuable
than decomposing them
into separate classes.
Aggregation leads
to stability,
continuity,
and homogeneous meanings,
while branching
can introduce
intentional inhomogeneity.
Semantic coordinate system.
A semantic coordinate system
involves numbering elements
in a material network,
which can be spanned
by a matroid
consisting of scalars
and vectors.
The vector components
are covariant,
while the scalar elements
are invariants.
Knowledge map
and maintainer.
A knowledge map
consists of agencies
known as topics
or things,
each promising
by identifying names
and various semantic relationships.
The entire knowledge map
belongs to an independent agency
referred to
as the maintainer.
Topics and associations
within the map
can be considered
autonomous agents
in the sense of promise theory.
Autonomous agents
in cooperation,
although knowledge relationships
are not voluntary
in the same way
as voluntary cooperation
among autonomous agents,
they are still
considered autonomous,
emphasizing their independence
and local significance.
In pre-design knowledge maps,
topics cannot refuse
to connect with one another,
but in shared maps,
observers have the choice
of whether to connect things
asserting their connectedness.
Overall,
this section explores
how semantic distance,
coordinate systems,
and autonomous agents
play a role
in knowledge spaces
and knowledge mapping.
It highlights the significance
of aggregation
and the challenges
in representing
and relating concepts
within knowledge maps.
In this section
of the document,
it discusses
how semantic relationships
can be modeled
as promises,
drawing a contrast
with a database viewpoint.
Here are the key points.
Semantic relationships
as promises.
Semantic relationships
between entities
are depicted
as promises
in this model.
For example,
an agent,
A1,
describes its properties
to an observer,
A2,
and these descriptions
are expressed
as promises.
The observer then
interprets
the nature
of the agent
based on these promises.
Symmetry
in promise model.
In this promise model,
the agents,
A1 and A2,
are symmetrical
and comparable entities.
They are similar
to generic stem cells,
and their differentiation
arises from the promises
they make.
Observers decide
the nature of agents
through observation,
much like a game
of charades.
Comparison with the database.
The document compares
this promise structure
to knowledge relationships
in a database.
In a database,
relationships between entities
are typically represented
as records,
e.g.,
thing,
A1,
connected by attributes,
e.g.,
as color.
The left and right sides
of these relationships
are very different objects,
leading to a significant
contrast between the two worlds
when traversing
the relationships.
nexuses of connectivity.
Knowledge relationships
tend to serve
as nexuses of connectivity
rather than simple adjacencies,
as they connect entities
from different worlds
and often lead to a network
of related concepts.
Semantic elements,
topics.
The document introduces
the concept of a semantic element
or topic,
T,
which consists of a single
autonomous agent,
A,
and an optional set
of scalar material promises.
Semantic elements
represent entities
in the semantic space
and are surrounded
by scalar promises
that provide them
with specific semantics.
Creating space-time
from elements.
To construct a space-time
with both scalar attributes
and vector bindings,
one can define semantic elements
with scalar material promises,
creating the network
of interconnected semantic elements
in a semantic space.
Overall,
this action emphasizes
the modeling
of semantic relationships
through promises
and the idea
of semantic elements
as autonomous agents
surrounded
by scalar promises
in a semantic space.
It highlights
the difference
between this approach
and traditional
database representations.
In this section
of the document,
it discusses
the concept
of indices,
metadata,
and code books
in the context
of semantic spaces.
Here are the key points.
Familiarity
as Valuation Ranking
Familiarity is described
as a valuation ranking
that an agent
can promise
to encode
Bayesian-style learning
into a knowledge map.
This concept
highlights the utility
of the promise model
for representing
familiarity
and learning.
Biological analogy
The document draws
an analogy
between autonomous agents
and stem cells,
with scalar promises
acting like a genome
and familiarity
indicating the dynamic
ranking of the agent's
attributes.
This analogy suggests
that biological organisms
can also be viewed
as semantic networks.
Semantic associations
Semantic associations
between elements
in a semantic space
can be defined
using promise bindings.
These associations
are unidirectional
and represent relationships
between semantic elements.
The document provides
examples of associations
such as
eats and
is eaten by
structural challenges.
Semantic typing
initially appears
to disrupt the notion
of simple translational symmetry
in semantic knowledge maps.
The bi-P-A-R-T-I-T-E
hierarchical structure
of taxonomies
and other semantic maps
arises due to the separation
of concepts and instances.
Local efforts
are made to restore
some translational symmetry
for ease of reasoning.
Indices as Maps of Space
An index is affined
as a semantically
structured map
that associates
knowledge items
with coordinates
in the knowledge space.
It serves as a means
of quickly locating
knowledge items
within a space.
Indices can be
physically represented
code books or algorithms
such as
hashing or tree sorting.
Efficient coordinate systems
An efficient coordinate system
minimizes the number
of points one
must reverse
to locate
to destination
within a space.
Efficient indices
reduce the overall time
needed to find
the knowledge item
compared to searching
for it directly
in the knowledge space.
Taxonomies and categorization
While categorization,
such as taxonomies,
can be considered
a form of indexing,
it often involves
subdividing categories
to separate things
into exclusive containers.
This can lead
to exponential growth
in categories.
Aggregation of objects,
such as alphabetization
or conceptual generalization,
is often the more efficient way
to reduce the number
of categories to search.
Navigation and caching.
Coordinate systems
that exploit
the natural structure
of a space
can offer shortcuts
to locating elements,
particularly if the information
content being addressed
is reduced.
The document hints
at a forthcoming discussion
of caching
in semantic networks.
Overall,
this section delves
into the role
of indices,
their efficiency,
and their relationship
to semantic spaces.
It also touches
on the challenges
of maintaining structure
and symmetry
in semantic knowledge maps.
This section discusses
the importance
of timelines,
narratives,
and world lines
in human thinking
and semantic organization.
Here are the key points.
World lines as narratives.
Human thinking
often revolves
around narratives
or timelines
in which events
are sewn together
to create
a meaningful sequence.
This predilection
for narratives
plays a significant role
in how we organize semantics.
World lines
in Einsteinian relativity.
In Einsteinian relativity,
the story
of a material body
as it moves
through space-time
is represented
as a world line.
World lines
can be space-like stories
or time-like histories.
Crafting storylines.
When designing
human jobs,
experiences,
or spaces
for enjoyment,
we often craft
storylines
or narratives
to make them
practical
or emotionally appealing.
Our preference
for stories
and the desire
to know how they
and influence
our approach
to information.
Narratives
in human interaction.
Human interactions,
such as customer experiences
in an airport,
can be viewed
as narratives.
For example,
airport staff
follow passengers
throughout their journey,
providing continuity
and avoiding
the need
for time-consuming
communication
between different agents.
This approach
is satisfying
for both customers
and staff.
Different organizations
organizational approaches.
While continuity
of agency
throughout an entire process
offers advantages,
such as efficiency
and satisfaction,
there are alternative ways
to organize processes.
Some processes
involve different
specialized teams,
and there may be
handoffs
between agents
at various stages.
Narrative threads
and handoffs.
Processes can be followed
as narrative threads
along a timeline
longitudinally
or by focusing
on staging
component-wise
transversely.
handoffs
between different
agents or teams
can occur
at specific points
in the narrative.
In essence,
this section
emphasizes
the role of narratives
and timelines
in human cognition
and how they influence
the design
of processes
and interactions.
It also highlights
the benefits
of maintaining
continuity
in agency
throughout a process.
This section
discusses
two different approaches
to handling
processes
and narratives,
continuous threading
and discrete staging.
Here are the key points.
Continuous threading.
In continuous threading,
a single agent
adapts its role
to perform
different phases
of a process
from start to finish.
This approach
forms a time-like
world line,
and the same agent
maintains continuity
throughout the entire process.
Discrete staging.
In discrete staging,
a narrative
or process
is divided
into different
specialized agents,
each responsible
for different phases.
This approach
forms a space-like story,
and hand-offs
occur between
these specialized agents.
Interfaces between agents.
When staging a timeline
and using different agents
for various phases,
interfaces between
these agents
are necessary.
Each agent
operates within
its own world
and timeline
with local information.
Reasoning semantics.
Reasoning semantics
are more exposed
in staging,
as each specialized agent
can apply
its own reasoning rules.
In contrast,
threading tends
to hide reasoning
within a single agent's process.
Story or narrative
definition.
A story or narrative
is defined
as an ordered
collection of elements
within a connected
semantic space,
joined by associations
with a quasi-transitive
interpretation.
Generating stories.
To generate stories,
one can follow
vector links
from a specific
initial position,
similar to solving
a different equation.
Inference rules
involve relabeling
associations
and pathways
within a quasi-transitive
vector promises.
Semantic element types
and story structures.
Agents that make
many scalar
material promises
define semantic
element types.
Agents that make
many vector adjacency
promises form part
of a story structure.
In summary,
this section explores
the organizational
approaches of
continuous threading
and discrete staging
in handling processes
and narratives,
highlighting the role
of agents,
interfaces,
and reasoning semantics
in each approach.
It also introduces
the concept of
generating stories
by following vector links.
This section
delves into the
semantics and dynamics
of identity
and context
within promise theory.
Here are the
key points discussed.
Two aspects
of identity.
Identity in promise theory
consists of two aspects,
a distinguishing name
or form,
semantics,
and the local prominence
relative to its context,
dynamics.
These two aspects
intersect at the point
where dynamics
and semantics meet.
Semantics and symmetry.
Semantics are associated
with breaking maximal
symmetry and identifiability.
Complex semantics
are often associated
with locations
where symmetries break down,
leading to interesting
phenomena.
Familiarity and knowledge.
Familiarity plays
a significant role
in knowledge.
It increases the prominence
of a location
within a semantic space
by repeated visits
and reinforcement.
This concept
is analogous
to memory structures
in brains
and machine learning.
Importance of localization.
Localization explains
why we construct
monuments,
symbols,
and logos
that stand out
against their backgrounds.
Low entropy,
representing little information
but high significance,
is attributed
to such structures.
Fragility of concepts.
Singular concepts
may seem fragile
because they can act
as single points
of failure.
Destroying one concept
could disrupt
the connectedness
of a semantic space.
Concepts become robust
by associating
with many exemplar
occurrences
and related concepts.
Identity in context.
The complete identity
of a concept
lies in the sum
of its associations
and its context.
Context,
defined by bindings
and relationships,
is essential
for defining
the meaning
of a concept.
Robust semantics
arise from extensive
interconnectedness.
Changing identity.
If none of the contextual
bindings of an agent
is preserved,
it essentially
takes on a new identity.
In summary,
the section explores
how identity
and context
intersect within
promised theory,
emphasizing the importance
of familiarity,
semantics,
and interconnectedness
in shaping the meaning
and robustness
of concepts
in a semantic space.
In this section,
the focus is on
low entropy
functional spaces
and componentization
within semantic
spacetimes.
Here are the key
points discussed.
Specialization networks,
semantic spacetimes
that consist of unique
and specialized agents
represent specialization networks.
These networks
have local structure
with global variation,
making them similar
to a molecular phase.
Low entropy.
Low entropy
characterizes these networks
as most agents
have unique
and special roles,
resulting in
strong semantics.
However,
they are dynamically
fragile because
the uniqueness
of each element
makes the network
potentially unstable.
Examples of
low entropy structures
examples of
low entropy structures
include human
organizations,
shopping models,
organizational maps,
electronic circuitry,
computer flowchart algorithms,
and databases.
Databases
and normal forms.
Databases
typically exhibit
low entropy
because each data record
contains unique content.
Normal forms,
such as the first
normal form,
1NF,
constrain the similarity
and redundancy
of coded information
within spatial elements
of the database.
First normal form,
1NF.
A database or space
is in 1NF
when all elements
have the same size,
shape,
and make the same
type of promises.
It focuses on the
similarity of form
rather than the
uniqueness of data.
Extracting redundancy.
In semantic databases,
redundancy is often
extracted to create
a single point of change,
avoiding inconsistencies.
This is done to ensure
that changes made
to share information
are causally connected.
Overall,
the section explores
how low entropy structures,
characterized by
strong semantics
and unique agents,
play a crucial role
in various domains,
including databases
and functional networks.
In this section,
the concept of
normalization in databases
and its implications
in semantic space-time
are discussed.
Normalization
and factoring out
dependence.
Normalization in databases
involves factoring out
common dependencies
to increase semantic focus
at the expense
of dynamical fragility.
For example,
when several people
live at the same address,
extracting the address
as an independent
class of agents
allows the promise
that a person lives
at an address
to be independent
of the address's details,
making changes
more reliable
and efficient.
Extended normal forms.
There are more
extended normal forms
that attempt to separate
hidden dependencies further.
These normal forms
turn agents
into superagent clusters
and encourage
the separation of agency
to avoid diverging worlds.
However,
this complexity increases
with the square
of the number of agencies,
making it a trade-off
between simplicity
and complexity.
The many worlds problem
primarily concerns
managing causality
during change in databases.
Dependency helps
ensure consistency
during changes.
Database change
was initially expected
to be performed
by human operators,
which could introduce errors
during repetitive tasks.
However,
in data warehousing
and replication
for backup and recovery,
duplication of information
is a valid strategy,
as it eliminates human error
and mitigates fragility.
Cloning and duplication.
Cloning data
is a form of change
in promises and time.
It introduces
the possibility
of inconsistent promises
being observed
by agents
working concurrently
with the duplication process.
To address this,
cloning should be
managed carefully,
often through isolation methods
like mutex locking
or temporary partitioning
of space
to make it appear
as if time
is stopped
during the process.
Overall,
normalization in databases
aims to improve
data integrity
and manage dependencies,
considering the trade-offs
between semantic focus
and complexity.
It also highlights
the challenges
of maintaining consistency
during data duplication
and cloning operations.
In this section,
the concept of high-entropy
load-sharing spaces
and the potential
for decoordinatization
are discussed.
High-entropy spaces.
High-entropy spaces
are characterized
by repetitive network structures
found in various
redundant systems.
These systems
include biological tissues,
physical materials,
and artificial
communications networks.
In such spaces,
no specific point
or agent
has a unique identity,
and individual elements
are interchangeable.
This regularity serves
as an effective
equivalence relation,
leading to higher resilience
within the network.
Reduce significance
of identity.
In high-entropy spaces,
there is less significance
attached to the identity
of individual agents
or points.
Finding any element
that is good enough
can fulfill a need,
and the spatial structure
is resilient
to point disruptions.
This shift
towards translational invariance
and high-entropy
suggests that coordinates
become less important.
Eliminating coordinates.
There is a temptation
to eliminate coordinates
altogether using algorithms
from information science,
such as hashing functions
and sorting trees.
However,
these algorithms
still rely on
a coordinate system
to function effectively.
They essentially
transducate semantic names
into spatial processes
and do not eliminate coordinates
but rather represent semantics
via transformation functions.
Interacting without identity.
It is theoretically possible
to eliminate identity
from a spacetime
and still interact with it,
although it would be like
interacting with empty space.
Eliminating all identity
would mean removing
all information and structure
from spacetime,
leaving only boundary conditions,
which themselves represent
the form of identity.
Interpreting semantics
from dynamical patterns.
The question arises
of how semantics
can be interpreted
from dynamical patterns
in the absence
of explicit coordinates.
This can be approached
in scenarios
where spacetime
is fundamentally ordered
or disordered.
In ordered spacetime,
small tuples
with coordinate numbering
can be used
to map locations,
while in disordered spacetime,
interactions might be perceived
as random collisions.
Biological tissues example.
An example is given
where biological tissues
are considered
as high entropy spaces.
In such tissues,
biochemical signals
diffused through the space
with a chance of absorption,
representing a form of interaction
without explicit identity.
Overall,
the concept of high entropy spaces
challenges the traditional reliance
on coordinates
and highlights the potential
for interaction
and interpretation
of semantics
without specific identity.
In this section,
the concept of load-sharing spaces
and decoordinatization
is discussed,
along with examples
of how such spaces
can be used
in various contexts.
Load assignment
in biological tissues.
Biological tissues serve
as an example
of high entropy spaces
where the interaction load
is distributed
across the bulk.
In this context,
batches of income
and promises,
e.g. blood,
need to be finely grained
to share
and bind
to individual receptors
for effective distribution.
Queuing lanes
in supermarkets
and airports.
Another example
of load assignment
is found
in queuing lanes
at places
like supermarkets
or airport check-in counters.
In such scenarios,
servers are chosen
by customers
based on visual feedback
or other criteria.
Agents select locations
for incoming customers,
promise to show queue lengths,
and self-organize
based on misinformation.
Dispatchers,
representing decision algorithms,
play a significant role
in these scenarios.
Load balancer dispatch agents.
Load balancer dispatch agents
are used in technology
to break the symmetry
of uniform load-bearing spaces
with a singular point.
They have high semantic value,
making them easily understandable,
but low dynamical integrity,
making them potential bottlenecks
and single points of failure.
Round robin dispatchers.
Round robin dispatchers
allocate resources
in a cyclic manner,
ensuring a fair distribution.
This is a simple
hashing function
that indexes new arrivals
to the next queue,
creating a form
of load balancing.
Memory in spatial world.
Both load balancing
and round robin algorithms
require memory to implement.
This memory is encoded
into the spatial world,
effectively using space
as memory
to coordinate the process.
These processes involve
collective stigmatic cooperation,
where the shared state
of the process
is encoded
into the environment itself.
Examples from data centers.
In data centers,
network architectures
are designed
with functional semantics,
but often ignore
spatial symmetries.
The use of three dimensions
for network design
can reveal hidden regularities.
For instance,
a tree-like structure
in two dimensions
may correspond
to a well-known
three-dimensional lattice structure.
Non-blocking networks.
Non-blocking networks,
initially designed
for telephony,
are now essential
on modern data centers.
These networks
create regular load-sharing patterns
that are extensible
and help distribute
the load efficiently.
Decoordinatization challenge.
The challenge
in high-entropy load-sharing spaces
is to distribute the load
without relying
on unnecessary sets
of identities.
Self-routing fabrics
and similar technologies
aim to achieve
load distribution
without imposing
artificial identities.
Overall,
load-sharing spaces
challenge the traditional
reliance on coordinates
and highlight the potential
for efficient load distribution
and interaction
without explicit identities.
In multi-phase spaces
where some agents
are fixed
and others are mobile
or fluid in their adjacencies,
there are challenges
in how to label
and coordinate
these agents effectively.
Two main approaches
can be considered.
Decoupling naming
from adjacency.
One option is to fix
the coordinates
of the gaseous agents
and decouple the naming
from their adjacency.
In this approach,
mobile agents
are labeled separately
and given orthogonal
sets of dimensions
for their movements.
This allows mobile agents
to move without affecting
their numbering
in the fixed phase,
often referred to as
HOMEN.
Continuous redefinition
of coordinates.
Alternatively,
one can redefine
the coordinate system
continuously
to accommodate
the flow of mobile agents.
In this case,
the coordinate
matroides change
dynamically along
with the movements
of mobile agents.
The choice
between these approaches
depends on
the specific requirements
and characteristics
of the system.
If configurations
in the gaseous phase
need to remain
distinguishable,
it implies a passage
of time,
typically achieved
by changing
the internal properties
scalar of mobile agents.
In terms of
practical consequences
for knowledge spaces,
spatial labeling
affects how agents
are located quickly.
Without symmetry
to guide the finding
of locations,
searching a space
becomes a process
of exploratory mapping.
To facilitate
efficient searching,
maps,
directories,
or indices
are created
to associate names
with coordinates.
These maps
should ideally
be significantly
smaller than
the space
they map
to ensure
that searching
the map index
is less costly
than searching
the entire space.
Indices are effective
when the list
of significant names
is smaller
than or equal
to the list
of spatial locations.
In essence,
indices serve
as a way
to compress
spatial structure
into coarse-grained
locations
by aggregating
structures
and assigning
non-unique names.
In a two-phase space,
the addition
of extra dimensions
without long-range order
allows for a flexible
and efficient labeling
of both fixed
and mobile agents.
Branching processes,
where a space partitions
into two or more
disjoint sets,
leading to causally
separate histories,
are common
in various domains,
including biology,
computer operating systems,
network connectivity,
software engineering,
and more.
Each branch
or partition
represents a separate
bundle of world lines,
effectively becoming
its own world,
following its unique
timeline
and evolving independently.
These separate branches
are akin to distinct worlds
in the sense of
Leibniz,
Kripke,
and Everett.
However,
it's important to note
that there's no guarantee
that each world
or branch
will have a unique timeline.
In some cases,
branches may end up
in the same state,
forming indistinguishable worlds.
Still,
this indistinguishability
is unknowable
to any particular branch.
Once separated,
each region or branch
becomes its own
proper time clock,
measuring time
based on the information
it receives.
The separation
into distinct branches
results in the growth
of space
in order to maintain
time within each
branch world.
In cases where
complete separation
occurs,
with singular agents
in their own worlds,
time must effectively
stop within each branch,
leading to a static
equilibrium.
Promised process
narratives within
these separate branches
can be seen as
the black holes
of semantic space,
where timelines reach
static equilibrium
or fixed points
due to the absence
of changes.
The relationship
between branching worlds
and network breakages,
where partitions
cannot communicate,
is also highlighted.
This breakage
can lead to the
merging of a world,
resulting in collisions
of intent.
In software version
and systems,
versions are not
entirely separate worlds
but embedded channels
within a larger world,
and they can be indexed
separately from clock time.
Knowledge spaces,
which often represent
external processes
and change connections
dynamically,
continuously receive
new information.
Each change or addition
leads to a new version
or proper time
within the knowledge
space time.
Knowledge spaces
effectively serve
as indices,
sometimes of themselves.
branching can also
occur at the metal level,
where the maintainer
of a knowledge space
clones one information base,
leading to the evolution
of distinct branches
or species in isolation.
In these closing remarks,
it's clear that the concepts
of space and time
presented in this review
may appear unconventional
from a physics standpoint
but are quite natural
and applicable
to close discrete systems.
These ideas provide
a unique perspective
on space-time,
particularly in the context
of interpretational semantics.
Key takeaways from this
exploration of space-time include,
Agency plays a crucial role
in how we interpret
and understand space-time.
Semantics,
which involve identity
and its dynamical prominence,
are fundamental
in mapping out space and time.
Dynamics,
including magnitude
and semantic interpretation,
are heavily influenced
by the semantics
of observers.
Coordinate systems,
matroidides,
can be introduced
for various topologies
to help interpret space
within these
unconventional frameworks.
Discrete spaces
with non-trivial semantics
can exist in different phases,
such as gas,
molecular,
and solid phases.
The fidelity
of transmitted information
cannot be guaranteed
in spaces
with non-trivial semantics,
highlighting the challenges
of information transmission
and interpretation.
Defining concepts
like motion and speed
is not straightforward
in discrete transition systems,
challenging traditional
notions of movement.
The idea of branching
into causally independent worlds
is a crucial consideration,
both in natural science
and in artificial spaces.
Overall,
this exploration serves
as a reference
for applying these concepts
to the study
of intentional spaces,
such as information systems
in the modern world.
It encourages
a deeper examination
of how we perceive
and interact with space
and time
in various contexts.
Certainly,
let's delve into more detail
on the key takeaways
from the exploration
of space-time concepts
presented in the closing remarks.
Agency in space-time
Agency refers
to the capacity
of individuals
or entities
to make choices
and take actions.
In the context
of space-time,
the presence
of agents,
observers,
entities with intentions
plays a fundamental role
in how we perceive
and understand the world.
Agents interact
with space-time,
influencing and interpreting
it based on their
intentions and actions.
Semantics and Identity
Semantics here refer
to the meaning
associated with elements
in space-time.
Identity includes
not only distinguishing names
but also the local significance
of elements relative
to their context.
Semantics help us
define the meaning
and significance
of elements in space-time.
This includes understanding
what makes an entity unique
and how it relates
to its surroundings.
Dynamics and Semantics
Dynamics relate
to the changes
and movements
within space-time.
The dynamics of space-time
are heavily influenced
by the semantics
and intentions
of observers.
How agents perceive
and interpret changes
in space-time
depends on their intentions
and the meaning
they assign to those changes.
Coordinate Systems
Matroidides
Coordinate Systems
represented by matroidides
provide a structured way
to interpret
and map out space
within different topologies.
These coordinate systems
help us establish
a framework
for understanding
spatial relationships
and locations
in unconventional
space-time models.
Phases in Discrete Space
Discrete spaces
can exist in various phases
much like matter
can exist in solid,
liquid,
or gas phases.
These phases
represent different
states or arrangements
of elements in space-time
and they can transition
from one phase
to another.
Fidelity of Information
In spaces with
non-trivial semantics,
ensuring the accuracy
and fidelity
of transmitted information
can be challenging.
The meaning
and interpretation
of information
may vary among observers
and maintaining consistency
can be complex.
Defining Motion and Speed
The conventional definitions
of motion and speed
may not apply directly
in discrete transition systems.
Understanding how entities
move and the concept
of speed may require
alternative frameworks
and definitions.
Branching into
causally independent worlds
Branching processes
occur when space-time
partitions into multiple
disjoint sets or worlds.
These separated worlds
may evolve independently,
leading to distinct
histories and outcomes.
This branching concept
is not limited
to theoretical physics
but can also apply
to various fields,
including computer science
and biology.
These key takeaways
provide a framework
for re-evaluating
our understanding
of space-time,
especially in the context
of information systems
and complex,
intentional spaces.
They encourage us
to explore how agents,
semantics,
and dynamics interact
in diverse space-time models
and how these concepts
can shape our perception
of the world.
Certainly,
metaphors and analogies
can make complex concepts
more accessible.
Here are some metaphors
and analogies
to help explain
the key concepts
related to space-time,
agency,
and semantics.
Space-time as a stage.
Imagine space-time
as a grand theater stage
and each agent
as an actor on that stage.
Agents move around,
interact,
and perform actions
that shape the narrative
of the play.
The stage itself
represents space-time
and the actors' actions
are the dynamics within it.
Semantics as the script.
Think of semantics
as the script of the play.
It provides meaning
and direction
to the actor's roles.
Different scripts
can lead to entirely
different narratives,
just as different semantics
can change
how we interpret space-time.
Agency as the director.
Agents act as both actors
and directors
on the stage of space-time.
They have the freedom
to make choices,
act,
and guide the overall storyline,
direct.
The director's choices
influence the plot's development.
Dynamics as the choreography.
Dynamics represent
the movements and actions
of the actors on the stage.
Consider them
as the choreography
that dictates
how the actors move,
interact,
and change the scene.
Coordinate systems as maps.
Coordinate systems,
matroid ads,
are like maps
of the theater.
They help the actors
and directors
navigate the stage
effectively.
Just as different maps
can use various
coordinate systems,
e.g.,
GPS coordinates,
landmarks,
different matroid ads
provide distinct ways
to interpret space.
Phases in discrete space
as changing sets.
Imagine space-time phases
as different acts
or scenes in a play.
Each act has its unique
setup and atmosphere.
As the play progresses,
the stage transforms
to represent new phases.
Fidelity of information
as whispered secrets.
Maintaining the fidelity
of information
is like a whispered secret
among actors.
As the secret passes
from one actor to another,
it may change subtly
or dramatically,
depending on how
it's interpreted.
This illustrates
how meaning can shift
in space-time.
Defining motion and speed
as dance styles.
Think of motion and speed
in space-time
as various dance styles.
Some entities
may move gracefully,
while others might perform
energetic and rapid movements.
The choice of dance style
reflects their motion and speed.
Branching into causally
independent worlds
as parallel universes.
To grasp branching processes,
consider them as the creation
of parallel universes.
Each universe follows
a unique storyline,
like alternative versions
of the same play,
where characters make
different choices
and experience
distinct outcomes.
These metaphors
and analogies
offer intuitive ways
to explain
the intricate concepts
related to space-time,
agency,
and semantics
by drawing parallels
to familiar scenarios
and experiences.
The paper you mentioned,
titled,
Quantum Euler Angles
and Agency-Dependent Space-Time,
explores the implications
of quantum gravity
on reference frames
and space-time.
Here's a brief summary
of the key points.
Quantum gravity
and reference frames.
The paper deals
with the effects
of quantum gravity
on the concept
of reference frames.
Quantum gravity theories
suggest that
classical symmetries
could be modified
due to quantum aspects.
SUQ-2 Quantum Group
The authors use
the quantum group
SUQ-2
to describe
deformed spatial rotations.
This quantum group
introduces deformations
in the way
spatial rotations work,
potentially due
to quantum gravity effects.
Euler-Angles Quantization
One of the consequences
of using SUQ-2
is the quantization
of one of the Euler-Angles.
Euler-Angles
are mathematical parameters
used to describe
the orientation
of an object
in three-dimensional space.
The quantization
means that this angle
can only take
certain discrete values
due to quantum effects.
Agency-Dependent Space-Time
The paper introduces
the concept of
agency dependence
in space-time.
According to this paradigm,
space is not
an absolute,
fixed entity.
Instead,
it's described
as a collection
of fuzzy points,
and the degree
of fuzziness
depends on an agent's
choice of reference frame.
In other words,
different agents
observing the same points
may perceive them
with varying degrees
of fuzziness
if they choose
different reference frames.
Differing Observations
If two agents
choose different
reference frames,
they will observe
the same points
in space differently.
Some points
may appear sharper
to one agent
while appearing
fuzzier to the other,
all due to their
choice of reference frame.
This work suggests
that quantum gravity
could have
profound implications
for our understanding
of space-time
and reference frames,
introducing the idea
that space itself
may be fundamentally
dependent on the choices
made by observers.
In the context
of the paper's
discussion on graph bases
and co-ordinatized dimensions,
let's break it down
using a simple example.
Imagine you have a graph,
as shown in figure 53,
consisting of nodes
and connections
between them.
This graph
can be represented
by an adjacency matrix,
a mathematical way
to describe
the connections
between nodes.
Now,
the paper introduces
the idea
of using matroidites
or independent sets
to describe
the dimensions
of this graph.
This concept
is similar
to how you might
describe dimensions
in lattices
or manifolds
in mathematics.
In the provided example,
the adjacency matrix
is given as follows.
Make file copy code
age equals
1100010100101100100100100
This matrix
can be broken down
into a set of generators
for spanning sets.
Essentially,
it can be expressed
as a combination
of independent sets.
Let's consider
an example
where we choose
a rank R of 3.
We can then represent
the adjacency matrix
as a linear combination
of 3 independent sets.
CSS copy code
equals I1 plus I2
plus I3
Now,
each of these
independent sets,
I1,
I2,
I3,
describes a certain
aspect or dimension
of the graph.
The paper visualizes
these dimensions
in figure 54.
Each set represents
a different way
of looking
at the graph's structure.
For example,
I1 might describe
one aspect
of the graph's
connectivity,
I2 another,
and I3 yet another.
These sets are not
completely disjoint,
they overlap
because they capture
different aspects
of the same graph.
To represent points
within these dimensions,
the paper uses tuples.
Each tuple corresponds
to a node in the graph
and contains values
that indicate its position
along each of the
independent sets.
For instance,
V1 equals
1,
1,
1 means that this node
has values of 1
along all three dimensions.
V2 equals 0,
1,
1 indicates
that this node
has a value of 0
along the first dimension
but one along
the other two.
V3 equals 0,
2,
2 shows that this node
has a value of 0
along the first dimension
and 2 along the other two,
and so on.
The ordering
of these dimensions
is arbitrary
but can be chosen
in a way that makes sense
for the specific context
of the graph.
The key takeaway here
is that this method
allows you to describe
the dimensions of a graph
using independent sets,
and you can then represent
the nodes within those dimensions
using tuples.
This approach provides
a structured way
to analyze and understand
the graph structure
and relationships.
In the paper,
it's demonstrated
that if you add an edge
to the graph
to create a non-trivial cycle,
it doesn't change
the coordinates of the nodes.
The positions of the nodes
remain the same.
All that happens
is a change
in the underlying topology
of the graph.
This example highlights
an important concept.
Coordinates and topology
are separate descriptions
of a graph
and do not necessarily
correspond to each other,
except in cases
where you assume
a certain symmetry.
In this case,
the addition of an edge
creates a cycle
which changes
the graph's topology
but doesn't affect
the coordinates of the nodes.
This is a fundamental idea
in graph theory
and spatial representation,
the structure
or shape of a graph
topology
can be distinct
from the specific
positions or dimensions
coordinates
of its elements.
So,
even though the graph's
shape has changed
due to the cycle,
the way nodes
are positioned
and their dimensions
remains the same
unless you choose
to redefine
those coordinates.
The separation
of topology
and coordinates
allows for a flexible
way to analyze
and understand graphs,
particularly when
dealing with
complex structures.
In the second example,
depicted in figure 56,
the graph is more complex,
but it can still be represented
using independent link sets
as a linear decomposition
of the adjacency matrix.
This results in a
four-dimensional
spanning basis.
The adjacency matrix
can be decomposed
into four independent sets.
I1
represents the first dimension.
I2
represents the second dimension.
I3
represents the third dimension.
I4
represents the fourth dimension.
The adjacency matrix
age is broken down
into these independent sets
as shown.
I equals I1
plus I2
plus I3
plus I4.
Each independent set
corresponds to a dimension,
and you can express
the vertices,
nodes,
in terms of these dimensions.
For example,
V1
is represented as
1,
1,
0,
0,
V2
is represented as
0,
1,
1,
0,
V3
is represented as
0,
1,
1,
1,
V4
is represented as
0,
0,
1,
0,
V5
is represented as
0,
0,
0,
1.
These tuples describe
the positions of the vertices
in the four-dimensional space
defined by the independent link sets.
This approach allows you
to capture the spatial relationships
within the graph
using a multi-dimensional
coordinate system,
where each dimension
is associated with
an independent set.
In example 3,
shown in figure 57,
we have another
three-dimensional
matroid basis
for the graph.
The adjacency matrix
is decomposed
into three independent sets.
I1
represents
the first dimension.
I2
represents
the second dimension.
I3
represents
the third dimension.
The adjacency matrix
is broken down
into these independent sets
as shown.
I equals
I1 plus
I2 plus
I3.
Each independent set
corresponds to a dimension,
and you can express
the vertices,
nodes,
in terms of these dimensions.
For example,
V1 is represented as
1,
0,
0,
V2 is represented as
0,
1,
1,
V3 is represented as
0,
0,
2,
V4 is represented as
0,
0,
3,
V5 is represented as
0,
0,
4.
These tuples
these tuples describe
the positions of the vertices
in the three-dimensional space
defined by the independent link sets.
In the extreme case
where a linear graph
is bent into three dimensions,
as shown in figure 58,
each link is treated as
a separate orthogonal direction,
resulting in a pseudo-three-dimensional
representation.
The coordinates for the four points
in this bent line
are expressed using these directions.
V1 is represented as
1,
0,
0,
V2 is represented as
1,
1,
0,
V3 is represented as
0,
1,
1,
V4 is represented as
0,
0,
1.
This example illustrates
that the degrees of freedom
in the graph's representation
are not necessarily related
to the dimensionality,
but rather to the connectivity constraints.
It's important to understand
that computing distances
or interpolating continuous expanse
in such coordinatizations
can be more complex
and doesn't follow
simple formulas
like Pythagoras' theorem.
This excerpt discusses
the concept of agency-dependent
space-time
in the context
of quantum gravity.
Here are some key points
and explanations.
Observers as agents
in classical physics
and even in general relativity,
GR,
observers are considered
external entities
that do not significantly affect
the space-time
they are observing.
However,
in quantum mechanics,
observers' choices
and measurements
can impact the properties
of the observed system.
This introduces the idea
that observers
are more like agents
in quantum mechanics.
Quantum gravity.
When quantum mechanics
and general relativity
are combined
into a quantum theory
of gravity,
space-time itself
is treated
as a quantum object.
This raises the question
of whether the properties
of space-time,
such as its geometry,
might depend on the choices
made by observers.
In other words,
how space-time appears
to observers
could be influenced
by their decisions.
Internal observers.
This notion suggests
moving away
from the classical idea
of external observers
and considering a concept
of internal observers
in quantum gravity.
Internal observers
would be embedded
in the quantum space-time
and their actions
might affect
the very nature
of space-time itself.
Relative state
of reference frames.
The paper discusses
a simplified model
where two observers,
Alice and Bob,
are interested
in determining
the relative spatial orientations
of their laboratories.
In standard quantum theory,
they can do this
with high precision.
However,
in a quantum space-time,
there may be limits
to how precisely
they can determine
these orientations
due to the inherent
fuzziness of space-time
at quantum scales.
Quantum group toy model.
The authors use
a toy model
of quantum gravity
based on non-commutative geometry.
They describe
the non-commutative space
where points are fuzzy
due to the
Heisenberg uncertainty principle.
They model
this non-classical space
by deforming
the rotation group SU2
using the quantum group
SUQ2.
This deformation
introduces
a dimensionless parameter,
Q,
and when Q equals 1,
it corresponds
to the undeformed
SU2 group.
SUQ2
SUQ2
and quantum symmetries.
SUQ2
is a quantum group
that represents
deformed symmetries
of rotations.
In this context,
it serves as
a simplified model
for describing
how reference frames
and rotations
might behave
in quantum gravity.
It introduces
the idea
that rotations
could be subject
to quantum geometric effects,
depending on the value
of the deformation
parameter, Q.
Predicting quantum
geometric effects,
The authors aim
to predict
the novel
quantum geometrical effects
that observers
would perceive
if rotations
of reference frames
were described
by SUQ2
transformations.
This exploration
contributes
to understanding
how quantum gravity
might influence
the way space-time
is perceived
and described
by observers.
Overall,
this excerpt
highlights the intriguing
interplay
between observers'
choices,
quantum space-time,
and the potential
impact of quantum gravity
on our understanding
of the nature
of space-time itself.
This excerpt
delves into
the mathematical framework
of SUQ2
and its connection
to quantum rotations
in the context
of quantum gravity.
Here are some
key points
and explanations.
SUQ2 Algebra
SUQ2
is a quantum group
formed by deforming
the algebra
of complex functions
on the classical
SU2 group.
This deformation
is non-commutative,
introducing
commutation relations
between the generators
A and C.
These relations
depend on a
deformation parameter
Q,
which is close to 1
to recover
the classical limit.
Limit Q,
rightward 0,
1.
As Q approaches
1,
the quantum group
SUQ2
approaches
the classical
SU2 group,
which describes
classical rotations
in three-dimensional space.
This classical limit
is important
for consistency
with our classical
understanding
of rotations.
Quantum rotation matrices
The paper introduces
quantum rotation matrices
in RQ,
which are analogous
to classical rotation matrices
but incorporate
quantum effects.
These matrices
describe the relative
spatial orientations
of reference frames,
but their elements
don't commute
due to the
non-commutative nature
of the algebra.
Quantum homomorphism
The authors establish
a quantum version
of the classical
homomorphism mapping
SU2 to SO3
using quantum
rotation matrices.
This mapping
is crucial for
connecting the
quantum description
with classical rotations.
Quantization ambiguity
Due to the
non-commutative nature
of the algebra,
there is a
quantization
ambiguity
associated with
the trace operation.
However,
this ambiguity
does not affect
the main results
discussed in the paper.
Operators A and C
The operators A and C
in the algebra
represent information
about the alignment
of reference frames
between observers A and B.
In the classical case,
these parameters
correspond to angular
parameterizations.
In the quantum case,
their operators
act on a Hilbert space H,
which represents
states encoding
the relative orientation
between the
reference frames.
Uncertainties
and fuzziness
Quantum effects
introduce uncertainties
represented by
increment
edge when computing
expectation values
of RQ edge.
These uncertainties
result from
the non-commutative
nature of the
matrix elements
and lead to
a fuzziness
in the alignment
of reference frames.
Observers A and B
cannot perfectly
align their frames
due to this
intrinsic uncertainty.
Hilbert space
The choice of
the Hilbert space H
in the study
of how operators
A and C
act on it
are crucial
in understanding
the representation
of the relative
orientation
between reference
frames and
the associated
uncertainties.
Overall,
this excerpt
lays the mathematical
groundwork for
exploring how
quantum gravity
might introduce
quantum effects
into the description
of rotations
and reference
frame alignments,
leading to a new
perspective on
spacetime and
observers in
quantum gravity.
In this section,
the paper discusses
the representations
of the SUQ-2
algebra and how
they relate to
quantum Euler angles.
Here are the
main points.
Representation spaces.
The paper explores
two irreducible
representations of
the SUQ-2
algebra,
denoted as
H, Greek
small letter
pi, and H,
Greek
small letter
rho.
These representations
are constructed
using certain
mathematical operators
and act on
specific Hilbert
spaces.
quantum numbers.
Quantum numbers,
Greek
small letter
chi,
Greek
small letter
phi,
and,
Greek
small letter
theta appear
in these
representations and
carry physical
meaning.
In particular,
Greek
small letter
chi represents
rotations around
the z-axis,
and,
Greek
small letter
theta represents
quantized
rotations.
Comparison with
classical parameters.
The paper draws
parallels between
the quantum
representations and
classical Euler
angles.
In the
classical case,
rotations are
specified by
three angles.

Greek

and,
Greek
small letter

Quantization of
Greek
small letter
theta.
The Euler
angle,
Greek
small letter
theta,
becomes quantized
in the quantum
framework,
meaning it can
only take certain
allowed values.
The quantization of
Greek
small letter
theta is a
significant feature
of this quantum
description.
semi-classical
rotations.
The paper focuses
on,
semi-classical
rotations,
which describe
small deformations
of classical
rotations.
These deformations
are specified by
quantum numbers,
Greek
small letter
theta,
Greek
small letter
phi,
and,
Greek
small letter
chi,
and are constrained
by the quantization
of,
Greek
small letter
theta.
State

To describe
quantum rotations
with specified
Euler angles,
the paper considers
superpositions
of states,
N,
Greek
small letter
phi,
Greek
small letter
chi,
mathematical

These states
involve coefficients,
C,

and are chosen
to minimize

while satisfying

that satisfy

Constructing

due to the
computational
complexity of

the paper
invokes
physical
intuition
to construct

represent

Macron,

Greek

These states
help demonstrate
the effects of
the quantum
deformation of
the rotation
group.
Overall,
this section
provides insights
into the
mathematical
representations of
quantum rotations
and their
connection to
classical
Euler angles,
highlighting the
quantization of
certain rotation
parameters in the
quantum framework.
This section of
the paper explores
a novel concept
where the choices
made by an observer
can influence the
space-time they
observe.
Here are the
key points.
Operational
space-time.
The paper starts
by advocating
Einstein's
operational notion
of space-time,
where space-time
points have
physical meaning
only as labels
for events
occurring there.
It uses the
example of a
network of
sources emitting
photons,
stars,
to illustrate
this concept.
Observer
Choices.
In this
framework,
observers make
choices when
setting up their
reference frames,
such as selecting
coordinate systems
and orientations
for their
telescopes.
The coordinates
assigned to
space-time events
depend on these
choices.
Uncertainties
and observers.
The paper highlights
that, in their
model, uncertainties
in the coordinates
of space-time events
are not intrinsic
properties of
space-time itself.
Instead, these
uncertainties depend
on the choices
made by observers
when defining their
reference frames.
Dive-afferent skies.
The key implication
is that
dive-afferent observers,
making dive-afferent
choices, may end up
with dive-afferent views
of the same stars
in the sky.
Even though they
observe the same
stars, the
uncertainties
introduced by their
choices result in
dive-afferent pictures
of the celestial
sphere.
Agent-dependent space.
The paper introduces
the idea of
agency-dependent space,
where the definition
of space is not
independent of the
observer who
reconstructs it.
This challenges
the concept of
an objective,
observer-independent
space-time.
Isotropic description.
Despite the
preferred direction,
z-axis, chosen
by observers,
the framework
produces an
isotropic description
of space.
Spatial rotations
are two
deformed symmetries,
and no direction
is inherently
preferred.
The special role
of the z-axis
results from the
choices made
by each observer.
Contrast with
spatial anisotropy.
This concept
is contrasted
with spatial
anisotropy,
where dive-afferent
directions have
dive-afferent
properties independent
of observer choices,
leading to the
loss of spatial
rotation invariance.
Overall,
this section
introduces a
thought-provoking
concept where
space-time is not
an objective,
observer-independent
entity but is,
instead,
influenced by the
choices and agency
of observers,
resulting in
dive-afferent
perceptions of the
same physical
reality.
In this section,
the paper provides
a numerical analysis
to support its
claims about the
influence of
observer choices
on the perception
of space-time.
Here are the
key points.
Alice's perspective.
The analysis
begins by
considering Alice's
perspective.
Her z-axis is
aligned with a
star, Greek
small letter
alpha, and she
wants to observe
another star,
Greek small letter
beta, using a
two-deformed
rotation of,
Greek small letter
pi, around the
x-axis.
Expectation
values and
variances.
The paper calculates
the expectation
values and
variances of the
q-rotated matrices
in Alice's state.
These values
quantify the
degree of
fuzziness in
Alice's perception
of the stars.
Quantitative
fuzziness.
The transformed
vectors representing
star directions are
shown to lie within
cones with specific
apertures.
The aperture
quantifies the
fuzziness, and it
is related to the
angle, Greek
small letter
theta, in the
q-rotated state.
Comparison with
Bob.
The paper
emphasizes that if
Alice had chosen
to align her
z-axis with
star, Greek
small letter
beta, her
perception of
the stars would
be diveferent.
This is because
the relative
orientation of
stars with respect
to her z-axis
would change,
resulting in
diveferent
uncertainties and
cone apertures.
Numerical
examples.
The paper provides
a table of
numerical examples,
showing the
dependence of
the aperture,
fuzziness, on
the observation
angle, Greek
small letter
theta, n, for
various stars.
It demonstrates
how the
fuzziness increases
as the
quantized
Euler angle,
Greek
small letter
theta, n,
increases in
absolute value.
Bob's perspective.
The analysis
can be repeated
for Bob, who
can choose a
diveferent
z-axis.
Bob's observations
will yield
diveferent degrees
of fuzziness
for the same
stars, leading
to a diveferent
inference of the
starry sky.
Overall, this
numerical analysis
reinforces the
idea that observer
choices, such as
the alignment of
their reference
frames, result
in quantifiable
uncertainties or
fuzziness in their
perceptions of
space-time.
Different observers
making diveferent
choices can have
diveferent views of
the same physical
reality.
In conclusion, this
work introduces a
novel framework
based on the
SUQ-2 quantum
group, providing
the physical
interpretation that
leads to fuzziness
properties in the
descriptions of
reference frames.
Here are the key
points of the
paper's conclusions.
fuzziness from
deformed rotations.
The fuzziness
described in this
framework is
fundamentally different
from the fuzziness
associated with
quantum reference
frames, QRFs.
It arises due to
the deformation of
spatial rotations
governed by the
parameter Q, rather
than being a result
of standard quantum
mechanics.
The fuzziness
emerges in the
relation between
two frames, not
within each frame
itself.
Agent-based
observations.
In this framework,
observers are
considered agents, and
they each reconstruct
their own version of
the observed universe
based on their
choice of the z-axis.
There is no
objective procedure for
reconstructing the
universe, and even
if observers exchange
data, they would
need to apply Q
rotations in their
own coordinates,
introducing intrinsic
uncertainties.
Future Directions.
The paper suggests that
the next steps in this
program should involve
developing a fully
relativistic and
relational picture.
This includes
considering scenarios
with more than two
observers, addressing
translations in
boost sectors, and
exploring the full
quantum regime, which
would require a
characterization of
physical objects like
spiners' qubits in the
context of SUQ-2
rotations.
Experimental
Possibilities.
Investigating these
possibilities may pave
the way for
experimental tests,
potentially guiding
further developments in
the field of quantum
gravity.
In summary, this work
presents a unique
perspective on the
relationship between
observers and their
observations, suggesting
that observer choices
fundamentally influence
their perception of
space-time, opening up
new avenues for both
theoretical and
experimental exploration
in quantum gravity.
The content discussed in
the paper about SUQ-2
quantum groups,
fuzziness in reference
frames, and observer-
dependent space-time is a
highly specialized and
advanced topic in
theoretical physics.
While it shares some
common themes related to
quantum mechanics and the
concept of reference
frames, it may not have
direct connections to the
earlier discussions in this
conversation, which were
more general and covered a
wide range of topics.
If you have specific
questions or if there are
particular aspects of the
paper's content that you'd
like to explore further or
relate to our earlier
discussions, please feel free
to ask, and I'll do my best
to provide relevant
information or
explanations.
The use of the word
agency in the paper is
related to the idea that
observers play an active
role in defining certain
aspects of the physical
world.
In the context of the
paper's discussion on SUQ-2,
quantum groups and
observer-dependent space-time,
agency refers to the active
role of observers in setting
up their reference frames and
how their choices impact
their observations.
Here's a more detailed
explanation.
Observer-dependent space.
The paper suggests that in
this particular theoretical
framework, the observer's
choices, such as the
orientation of their
reference frame, e.g.,
choosing the preferred
axis, can influence the way
they perceive and measure
certain physical quantities,
like the directions of
stars in the sky.
This is in contrast to
classical physics, where
it's often assumed that
there exists an objective
and observer-independent
space-time.
Fuzziness and Choices.
The term agency is used to
highlight that observers are
not passive recorders of the
universe but actively shape
their observations.
The uncertainty and
fuzziness that arise in this
framework are not intrinsic
properties of space-time or
physical objects but rather
depend on the observer's
choices, represented
mathematically through
quantum rotations.
Relational Aspect.
This notion of agency implies a
relational perspective on
physics, where the
relationship between observers
and the physical world
becomes fundamental.
It challenges the idea of a
single, objective space-time
and suggests that different
observers might have their own
versions of space-time due to
their choices.
In summary, the term agency in
this context emphasizes that
observers are not mere passive
entities but actively participate
in defining aspects of their
physical reality, particularly in the
context of quantum groups and
observer-dependent space-time.
Your summary and explication are
quite accurate and capture the
main points of the discussion
about the unorthodox perspective on
space and time in closed
discrete systems.
It highlights the importance of
agency in shaping our perception
of space and time and emphasizes the
role of semantics and observer
influence.
It also touches on the idea of
different coordinate systems for
unconventional spaces, phases of
discrete spaces, information
transmission challenges, and the
need for rethinking traditional
concepts like motion and the
possibility of branching into
independent worlds.
This discussion indeed challenges
traditional notions and encourages
us to explore new ways of
understanding and interacting with
our environment, particularly in the
context of information systems and
complex semantics.
It underscores the need for a fresh
perspective and the potential for
entirely new theories or
interpretations in these domains.
In the context of space-time theory
and information systems, agency
refers to the capacity of individual
entities or agents who act, make
decisions, and influence their
surroundings within a defined space
and time.
It represents the notion that
entities within a system have the
ability to exhibit intentionality, make
choices, and impact the course of
events.
Narrative Summary of Main Points
Space-time Interpretation
Space-time Theory is a framework
used to understand how events
unfold within a defined space and
over a period.
In this theory, agency plays a vital
role in shaping and interpreting
space-time.
Agents as Actors
Agents are likened to actors on a
stage.
They have roles, move within space-time,
and interact with one another, much
like actors performing on a theater
stage.
Semantics as Meaning
Semantics refers to the meaning or
significance attributed to events
and interactions.
It provides the script or narrative
that guides agents' actions within
space-time.
Dynamics and Actions
Dynamics represent the actions and
movements of agents in space-time.
These actions can be thought of as the
choreography of that performance
happening on the stage of space-time.
Coordinate Systems as Maps
Coordinate Systems, or Matroids, act as
maps that help agents navigate and
make sense of space-time.
Different coordinate systems provide
varying interpretations of the same
space.
Phases and Transformations
Space-time can have different phases,
similar to acts in a play.
These phases represent distinct settings
or scenes, and the transitions between
them signify transformations in the
narrative.
Information Fidelity
Fidelity of information refers to how
accurately information is transmitted and
preserved as it moves through space-time.
Just as whispered secrets can change,
information may undergo alterations during
its journey.
Motion and Speed
Motion and Speed in space-time are
comparable to different dance styles.
Agents may move gracefully or swiftly,
and their choice of dance reflects their
motion and speed within space-time.
Branching in Parallel Universes
Branching processes involve the
creation of causally independent worlds
or parallel universes, each with its
unique storyline.
This concept highlights how different
choices and actions by agents can lead to
distinct outcomes.
In summary, agency in the context of
space-time theory emphasizes the role of
individual entities or agents in shaping
and interpreting the narrative of events
within a defined space and time.
Agents act like actors with intentionality,
guided by semantics, and their
interactions form the dynamic choreography
of space-time.
Different coordinate systems offer various
perspectives, and branching processes
create parallel narratives, showcasing the
richness and complexity of space-time dynamics.
In the discussion about polycomputation and its
implications for space-time and information
systems, the concept of observer effects
wasn't explicitly mentioned.
However, the broader themes of agency,
semantics, and the influence of observers
on the interpretation of space-time and
information systems were explored.
These themes touch upon similar ideas related
to how observers or agents actively shape
and influence the understanding and dynamics
of the systems they interact with.

This section discusses the concept of observer dependency and determining whether living things are computers and the role of computational formalisms as metaphors.
Here are the key points.
Observer dependency.
The binary view of whether living things are computers, or not, assumes an objective, privileged perspective that can universally and unambiguously decide this relationship.
This view is considered untenable and leads to unnecessary philosophical questions.
Computational formalisms as metaphors.
Instead of a binary view, the authors argue for an observer-dependent perspective.
In this perspective, computational formalisms are treated as metaphors, recognizing that scientific concepts, in general, are metaphors with varying degrees of utility.
The key idea is that scientific models are tools that help observers predict and control phenomena.
Pragmatic approach.
The authors advocate for a pragmatic approach where, anything is a computer in a given context if it enables an observer to better predict and control that thing compared to other metaphors.
The focus is on adopting a computational framework that yields new experimental capabilities and research opportunities.
Empirical validation.
Whether something is considered to be computing is not a philosophical question, but an empirical one.
It is determined by specifying the computational framework and demonstrating empirically how adopting that framework enhances our understanding and control of the system.
Adaptive advantage.
Biological subsystems can also adopt a computational stance, and the quality of this stance is measured by the adaptive advantages it offers.
If a particular computational perspective enhances an organism's fitness, it is considered valuable in an evolutionary context.
Provisional and relative.
The authors acknowledge that scientific progress may lead to the discovery of better frameworks and metaphors,
making the answer to whether something is computing provisional and relative to a specific perspective.
Relation to cognitive science, this view aligns with the intentional stance in the philosophy of the mind and the development of frameworks and tools from cognitive science
that can be applied broadly in biology and the biomedical sciences.
In summary, this section emphasizes the pragmatic and observer-dependent nature of determining whether something is a computer,
highlighting the importance of empirical validation and the relative nature of scientific concepts and metaphors.
It suggests that the quality of a computational metaphor is judged by its productivity in enabling new experiments and research capabilities.

primarily due to new techniques in chimeric organisms, synthetic biology, and biohybrids.
These techniques blur the traditional boundaries between evolved and designed systems.
Blurring life and machine.
Advances in active matter and bioengineering have led to a blurring of the lines between life and machine.
This distinction was easier to maintain when our technological capabilities did not allow us to construct and analyze a wide range of agents.
Beyond Earth, the life sciences have expanded their scope beyond the limited example of Earth's phylogenetic history.
There is now a mandate to understand life in a broader sense through synthetic biology and exobiological explorations.
This entails exploring the possibilities of life beyond our planet.
In essence, this section highlights how technological advancements are challenging traditional definitions of life
and expanding our understanding of what can be considered living systems.
It emphasizes the need to embrace a more inclusive perspective on life as we explore the boundaries between evolved and engineered organisms.

Here are the key points.
Observer-centered approach.
To bypass philosophical debates about whether biological systems are computers, an observer-centered perspective is proposed.
This perspective recognizes that computational formalisms in biology are flexible and adaptable, depending on the observer's viewpoint.
Key questions.
The concept of polycomputing raises fundamental questions.
What are the essential functional and control properties of polycomputing systems?
How does evolution create systems with multiple functions in the same hardware?
And what does this mean for adaptability?
How can we develop intervention strategies for existing polycomputing systems?
And what is the efficient path to design novel polycomputing materials, algorithms, and devices?
Life as polycomputing.
Living systems are inherently polycomputing because different components within them interpret the same mechanisms differently.
At various levels and within different components of a living system, interpretation and exploitation of mechanisms occur simultaneously.
Life behaves as a network of overlapping, competing, cooperating entities, each striving to predict and adapt to its microenvironment.
In summary, this approach encourages viewing biological systems as flexible and adaptable, emphasizing their observer-dependent nature.
It opens up a realm of questions about how polycomputing works in biological systems and how it can be harnessed for various applications,
shedding light on both fundamental and practical aspects of biology and computing.
The section discusses why the concept of life as computation is significant and its impact on both biology and computation.
Feedback loop.
The interaction between biology and computation creates a positive feedback loop, enhancing insights in both fields.
Biological examples inspire new computing implementations,
while computational principles help biologists focus on fundamental design principles.
Unconventional computing platforms, examples from biology, such as fungal networks, and colonies, and DNA,
offer unconventional computing platforms and architectural ideas.
Functional substrate independence.
The idea of functionalist substrate independence, drawn from computer science,
aids biologists in focusing on essential design principles rather than contingent ones.
This extends beyond neuroscience, recognizing that neural dynamics are part of broader biological problem-solving architectures.
Physical reservoir computing.
Concepts like physical reservoir computing, where neural networks map dynamics within various systems,
highlight the observer-dependent aspect of biology.
It views biology as nested societies of elements exploiting the information processing capacities of their living environment.
Superposition and observer frames.
Similar to how quantum mechanics and relativity transformed our understanding at different scales,
Polycom put in challenges thus to apply the same principles at mesoscales.
The concepts of superposition and observer frames are discussed in this context,
with implications for materials engineering, regenerative medicine, and more.
In essence, the, life as computation, perspective bridges biology and computation,
offering valuable insights and novel ideas in both fields,
and encouraging us to explore new frontiers in understanding and controlling evolved and designed materials.
This section discusses the current debate surrounding the relationship between living organisms and machines.
Inspiration from nature.
When technological progress in a specific domain slows down,
researchers often turn to nature for fresh inspiration.
Examples include using photosynthesis for energy capture devices and mimicking flapping winds for drone designs.
Challenge of microchip packing.
The increasing difficulty of packing more computing power into microchips prompts us to explore how computation is embedded within living systems.
To make such comparisons, one must view organisms as a type of machine,
sparking debates about whether organisms are, in fact, machines.
Defining machine.
In this context, the term machine refers to a subset of machines capable of computation,
including robots and physical computers.
It excludes simpler mechanical devices like combustion engines and flywheels.
However, there's a continuum, as even circuitry-free machines like mechanical computers,
physical reservoir computers, and computational metamaterials can perform computation.
Quantum effects.
The exception might be machines that compute by exploiting quantum effects,
where the role of an observer is crucial in deriving binary outcomes from fundamentally indeterminate realities.
In essence, the discussion centers on whether organisms should be considered as a type of machine,
particularly in terms of their capacity for computation,
and the nuances in defining what constitutes a machine in this context.
The section discusses the challenges of comparing organisms and machines
by examining their structure-function relationships and introduces the concept of polycompturing.
One-to-one mapping.
Initially, it may seem logical to compare organisms and machines
by assuming a one-to-one mapping between structure and function.
This would involve comparing the structures of organisms and machines,
their respective functions,
and the mappings between their structures and functions.
Complex structure-function mapping.
However, such a straightforward mapping becomes challenging
due to the integrated non-intuitive interactions
between structural and functional units in both genetics and neuroscience.
This complexity makes it difficult to predict outcomes based on structure-function relationships.
Rational changes.
Inferring how to make rational changes at the system level,
such as in regenerative medicine, replacing complex organs,
becomes even more complex when considering the dense interactions between structure and function.
Machine lens for life.
Recognizing the wide range of implementations and origin stories for machines,
including organic components and evolutionary design techniques,
highlights that adopting a machine metaphor for life
can facilitate progress in understanding and manipulating living systems.
Polycomputing.
The concept of polycomputing involves understanding
how a component can provide multiple uses for multiple beneficiaries
or compute different functions from the perspectives of different observers,
all on the same spatial scale and at the same time.
Investigating polycomputing opens up new questions for both biology and engineering
and seeks to enhance the efficiency of packing more functionality into the same machine.
In summary, comparing organisms and machines involves complex structure-function relationships,
and the notion of polycomputing introduces the challenge of understanding
how components can serve multiple functions simultaneously,
benefiting various observers, all on the same spatial scale and at the same time.
This concept holds potential for both biological and engineering advancements.
Table 1 provides a list of common assumed distinctions in biology and technology,
along with recent counter-examples that challenge these assumptions,
suggesting a spectrum of complementarity.
Software-hardware distinction, assumption.
Software and hardware are distinct.
Counter-example.
Physical materials it can compute and learn.
Tape-machine distinction, assumption.
A machine needs a tape, assuming a Turing machine architecture.
Counter-example.
Tape-less von Neumann self-replicators.
Digital-analog distinction, assumption.
Digital and analog are distinct.
Counter-example.
Evolved digital circuits that explored electromagnetic properties of their substrate.
Machine-lifeform distinction, assumption.
Machines and lifeforms are distinct.
Counter-example.
AI-designed organisms.
Automaton-free agent distinction, assumption.
Automatons and free agents are distinct.
Counter-example.
The intentional stance, which considers even non-free agents as intentional entities.
Brain-body distinction, assumption.
The brain and body are distinct.
Counter-example.
Computational metamaterials that integrate both functions.
Body-environment distinction, assumption.
The body and environment aren't distinct.
Counter-example.
In multicellular organisms, other cells serve as the environment for a cell.
Intelligent-faking-it distinction, assumption.
Intelligence and pretending to be intelligent aren't distinct.
Counter-example.
AI-technologies that seem to pass various two-ring tests.
Made evolved distinction, assumption.
Made, by humans.
And evolved, naturally, aren't distinct.
Counter-example.
Artifacts designed by human-created evolutionary algorithms.
These counter-examples challenge traditional distinctions and suggest that the boundaries between these categories are not as clear-cut as once believed,
indicating a spectrum of complementarity between biology and technology.
Title.
Exploring Complementarity.
Challenging assumed distinctions between biology and technology.
Introduction.
In the realm of scientific inquiry, researchers often rely on established distinctions to understand and categorize complex phenomena.
However, as our understanding deepens and technology progresses, these assumed distinctions can be challenged by new discoveries and advances.
Table 1 presents a collection of common assumed distinctions in biology and technology, along with recent counter-examples that defy these distinctions.
In this essay, we will explore these counter-examples and discuss how they suggest a spectrum of complementarity,
blurring the boundaries between previously distinct concepts.
Software-hardware.
Traditionally, software and hardware have been seen as separate entities,
where software refers to the instructions and algorithms that enable computation,
while hardware encompasses the physical components that execute those instructions.
However, recent advancements have demonstrated the existence of physical materials capable of computation in learning.
For instance, physical reservoir computers and computational metamaterials utilize the properties of their materials to perform computational tasks,
challenging the strict separation between software and hardware.
Tape Machine.
The relationship between tape and machine represents the distinction between the data storage medium and the computational entity.
In classic computing, Turing machines rely on tape as a storage medium.
However, tape-less von Neumann self-replicators have emerged as counter-examples,
demonstrating the possibility of computational systems that operate without relying on a traditional tape-based architecture.
Digital Analog.
Digital and analog computing have long been seen as distinct approaches to information processing.
Digital circuits operate with discrete values, while analog circuits process continuous signals.
However, evolved digital circuits have been shown to exploit the electromagnetic properties of their substrate,
blurring the line between digital and analog computation.
Machine life form.
The distinction between machines and living organisms is deeply ingrained in our understanding of the world.
However, the development of AI design organisms challenges this dichotomy.
Through artificial intelligence and synthetic biology approaches,
researchers have created organisms with designed characteristics and functionalities,
blurring the line between machine and life form.
Automaton free agent.
The dichotomy between automatons and free agents reflects the distinction between deterministic systems
and entities capable of intentional behavior.
The intentional stance, a concept from philosophy of mind,
suggests that we can attribute intentional behavior to complex systems,
even if they lack consciousness.
This challenges the strict separation between automatons and free agents,
as it highlights the possibility of intentional behavior emerging from non-conscious systems.
Brain-body.
The relationship between the brain and the body is a fundamental distinction in neuroscience.
However, computational metamaterials provide a counterexample by demonstrating that materials
can exhibit computational properties.
These materials, which can be engineered to possess specific computational functionalities,
challenge the conventional separation between the brain and the body in terms of computational capabilities.
Body-environment.
The distinction between the body and the environment is central to our understanding of an organism's boundaries.
However, in a multicellular organism,
the cells within it can be seen as both components of the body and the environment for individual cells.
This challenges the clear delineation between the body and the environment,
emphasizing the intricate interdependencies within living systems.
Intelligent-ficking it.
The ability to discern intelligence from simulated intelligence has long been a topic of interest.
Recent advancements in artificial intelligence have produced technologies
that seemingly pass various Turing tests, such as verbal, visual, or physical tests.
These AI technologies challenge the assumed distinction between true intelligence
and artificially simulated intelligence,
raising questions about the nature of intelligence itself.
Made-evolved.
Traditionally, artifacts have been viewed as products of human design,
while living organisms are seen as products of evolution.
However, the application of evolutionary algorithms in engineering
has led to the creation of artifacts that are designed through an evolutionary process
rather than by human hands.
This challenges the clear distinction between artifacts made by humans
and those that have evolved through natural processes.
Conclusion.
The examples presented in Table 1 demonstrate how recent advances are challenging
assumed distinctions between biology and technology.
These counterexamples highlight the spectrum of complementarity
that exists between previously distinct concepts.
By blurring the boundaries between software and hardware,
tape and machine, digital and analog, machine and life form,
automaton and free agent, brain and body, body and environment,
intelligence and faking it, and made and evolved,
we are encouraged to embrace a more nuanced understanding
of the complex relationships that exist within the natural and technological world.
This exploration not only expands our knowledge
but also offers new avenues for interdisciplinary research and innovation.
Title.
Blurring Boundaries.
Rethinking Distinctions Between Biology and Technology.
Introduction.
In the world of science,
we often rely on established distinctions to make sense of complex topics.
However, as our knowledge grows and technology advances,
these distinctions can be challenged.
Table 1 shows common distinctions in biology and technology,
along with examples that blur these lines.
In this essay,
we will explore these examples
and how they suggest a spectrum of complementarity,
blurring boundaries between once separate ideas.
Software-hardware.
Traditionally, software and hardware are separate,
but recent advances show physical materials
can perform computation in learning.
For example,
computational metamaterials challenge the idea
that software and hardware are strictly distinct.
Tape Machine.
We've seen a shift from traditional tape-based computing
with examples like Tape-Lass von Neumann self-replicators,
challenging the necessity of tape in computational systems.
Digital Analog.
Digital and analog computing used to be clearly separate,
but evolved digital circuits can now explore analog properties,
blurring this boundary.
Machine life form.
AI-designed organisms created through synthetic biology
challenge the divide between machines and living beings.
Automaton-free agent.
The intentional stance suggests
that even non-conscious systems can exhibit intentional behavior,
blurring the line between automatons and free agents.
Brain-body.
Computational metamaterials demonstrate
that materials can have computational properties,
challenging the separation of brain and body
in computational capabilities.
Body environment.
In multicellular organisms,
cells can be both part of the body
and the environment for other cells,
breaking down the clear boundary
between body and environment.
Intelligent-fitting it.
Advanced AI technologies can pass various Turing tests,
raising questions about distinguishing
genuine intelligence from simulated intelligence.
Made-evolved.
Artifacts designed through evolutionary algorithms
challenge the notion
that human-made and naturally evolved objects
are fundamentally distinct.
Conclusion.
The examples entable and challenge traditional distinctions
between biology and technology,
revealing the spectrum of complementarity.
By blurring boundaries between software-hardware,
tape machine, digital analog,
machine life form, automaton-free agent,
brain-body, body environment,
intelligent-fitting it,
and made evolved,
we gain a more nuanced understanding
of the relationships between nature and technology,
opening doors to interdisciplinary research and innovation.
Dichotomous thinking in the life sciences
often falls short of capturing
the complex nature of biology.
While biologists sometimes use discrete criteria
for specific traits,
both evolution and developmental biology
demonstrate scale invariance and gradual change.
These processes defy clean divisions,
much like how the transformation
from a caterpillar to a butterfly
represents a spectrum of mixed properties.
Life's interoperability allows for chimeras at all levels,
blurring the boundaries between distinct categories,
making objective classification challenging.
The distinctions between disciplines,
such as neuroscience and cell biology,
often result from practical and logistical limitations
rather than deep underlying differences.
In reality,
these divisions can obscure important symmetries
across categories that enable unifications
and breakthroughs in understanding,
such as using cognitive neuroscience techniques
to study the collective intelligence of cells
or even physics itself.
In the realm of computer science,
advances are breaking down established categorical boundaries.
One boundary being challenged
is the division between the body and the brain.
Physical computing,
where computation occurs through optical,
mechanical,
or quantum phenomena without electronics,
is erasing this distinction.
Recent developments in mechanical computing
demonstrate how non-electronic materials
can perform complex calculations,
including AI's fundamental concept of error backpropagation.
A groundbreaking demonstration
of mechanical polycomputing involved
the propagation of acoustic waves
through granular metamaterials,
performing multiple Boolean operations
in the same place simultaneously.
Mechanical computing and mechanical polycomputing
challenge the conventional idea of one subsystem,
computing and controlling,
e.g., the nervous system,
while another accepts that control,
the body.
Morphological computation,
originating in robotics,
suggests that an animal's or robot's body
can compute and even take over
some tasks performed
by the nervous system or control policy.
Unlike mechanical computing,
morphological computation allows
for adaptive computation performed
either newly or mechanically,
depending on environmental demands.
This interchange of computation
between the body and the brain
blurs the traditional human-defined categories
of body and brain.
Polycomputing challenges traditional distinctions
between biological bodies and brains,
and it has implications
for understanding computation
in various substrates.
Unlike traditional computation,
polycomputation primarily involves
vibrational materials capable of storing
multiple computation results
at the same place and time,
albeit at different frequency peaks.
This focus on vibration
might initially suggest
that materials like digital circuits
and biological nervous systems,
which rely on electrons and chemicals,
respectively,
cannot perform polycomputation.
However,
recent findings suggest
that neurons might communicate mechanically
in addition to their electrical
and chemical signaling.
This mechanical neural communication
may involve vibrational components,
implying that nervous systems
could indeed engage in polycomputation.
This blurs the boundary
between bodies and brains
by suggesting that both might engage
in this form of computation.
Mechanical computing
and morphological computation,
which allow the interchange
of computation between body and brain,
provide useful viewpoints for biology.
In computer science,
the concept that algorithms drive outcomes,
even though they are implemented
at the micro-physical level,
is well accepted.
This contrast with debates in biology
about whether higher-level descriptions
are merely epiphenomenal,
and computer science demonstrates
how adopting a causal stance
at higher levels
can facilitate progress.
The application of computational concepts
to biology has led to a dismantling
of the brain-body dichotomy,
with studies showing forms of intelligence
in various biological systems,
including plants,
single somatic cells,
and microbes.
The tools of neuroscience,
like active inference and optogenetics,
are applicable across biology,
regardless of whether the system
is neural or non-neural.
The dissolution of arbitrary distinctions
in biology and technology
reveals commonalities
and fundamental principles
across different substrates,
offering unifying insights
and addressing challenges
related to big data
and interpretability.
Polycomputing,
which focuses on form, function,
control, interpretation,
and the role of observers,
emerges as one such principle
at the forefront of these discussions.
Polycomputing is a fascinating concept
that challenges traditional boundaries
and categories
in both biology and computer science.
It highlights the interconnectedness
of different systems and materials,
ultimately leading to a more holistic understanding
of computation in life.
This interconnected view
encourages researchers
to break away from rigid distinctions
and embrace a more flexible perspective,
which can open up new avenues
for exploration and innovation
in various fields.
Whether in the context
of biological organisms
or artificial systems,
Polycomputing reminds us
that the boundaries
we perceive are often more fluid
than we might initially assume.
The text discusses
various engineering technologies
that challenge the assumption
that multiple computations
or data storage
in the same place
at the same time
are impossible.
These technologies
have practical implications
for increasing computational density
and data storage efficiency.
Quantum Computing
While quantum computing
has demonstrated
the ability
to perform multiple computations
simultaneously,
it remains a complex
and specialized field.
However,
the text highlights
that non-quantum materials,
composed of relatively few components,
can also achieve
computational superposition,
suggesting new possibilities
for packing more computation
into smaller spaces.
Holographic Data Storage,
HDS
HDS is a technology
that disperses data
across a storage medium
by etching a distributed
representation of data
from various directions.
This allows parts
of multiple pieces of data
to be stored in the same place
but accessed
at different times.
HDS challenges
the traditional approach
to data storage
and has the potential
to significantly increase
storage density.
These engineering technologies
not only offer
practical benefits
but also raise questions
about the fundamental nature
of computation
and materials,
both in the technological
and biological domains.
The ability
to perform multiple computations
or store data
in a superposed manner
has implications
for future advancements
in computational density
and efficiency.
The text introduces
another technology
called physical reservoir computing,
PRC,
which challenges
the assumption
of data compute locality.
PRC aims to retrieve
computational results
by exciting inert bulk materials
like metal plates
or photonic crystals
and capturing
the mechanical vibrations
or refracted light
that result from this excitation.
Different computations
can be extracted
from the same material
by exciting it
in different ways
and attempts have been made
to program PRCs
to ease the extraction
of desired computations.
One intriguing application
of this technology
is the creation
of deep physical neural networks.
In this approach,
input and parameters
describing an artificial neural network
are combined
into forces
applied to the material.
The forces captured
from the material
are interpreted
as if the input
had passed through
a neural network
with those parameters.
This process repeats
until a set of input forces
is found
that produces
the desired output.
Importantly,
the internal structure
of the bulk material
remains unchanged,
allowing the same material
to embody
different computations.
Furthermore,
some materials
are capable
of retaining
an imprint of forces
even after they cease,
essentially possessing memory.
Efforts are underway
to design such materials
to maximize
the number of overlapping
memories
they can store.
This property
of designed materials
has significant potential
in robotics.
If robots
can be constructed
from such materials,
they could simultaneously
perform external actions
and internal computations
without the need
for distinct components
for behavior generation,
the body,
and computation,
the brain.
Soft robots
are already demonstrating
how these exotic materials
can enable
multiple functions
like sensation,
actuation,
computation,
power storage,
and power generation
to be performed
by the same parts
of the robot's body.
This represents
a departure
from traditional robotics
where these functions
are typically segregated.
The text discusses
the challenges
of analyzing
natural systems
to determine
whether they perform
polycomputation,
which refers
to the ability
to simultaneously
perform multiple computations
in the same place
at the same time
for different observers.
Analyzing natural systems
for polycomputation
is challenging
because many analytical
approaches in biology
are reductionist,
focusing on characterizing
specific phenomena
in isolation.
Additionally,
synthesis of
polycomputable technologies
is challenging
because they often
resist traditional
engineering design principles
like hierarchy
and modularity.
One notable point
is that typical
human design systems
are highly constrained,
meaning that optimizing
one function
can interfere
with another.
However,
the text highlights
that artificial intelligence,
AI methods,
particularly evolutionary algorithms,
have been used
to automatically design
polycomputant technologies
in some domains.
The text mentions
the application
of an evolutionary algorithm
to design
a granular metamaterial
capable of polycomputation.
This metamaterial
combines vibrations
at different frequencies
at its inputs,
providing different computations
in the same place,
at the same time,
but at different frequencies.
Figure 2
has referenced
to illustrate this process.
The text discusses
the engineering
of polycomputant materials
using an evolutionary algorithm,
e.e.
and a granular metamaterial
as an example.
Here's a breakdown
of the process
illustrated in Figure 2.
A granular metamaterial
is family.
The granular metamaterial
is constructed
by embedding stiff,
dark gray
and soft,
light gray particles
into a sheet
and wrapping it
into a tube.
These particles
interact differently
when they collide,
with the soft particles
being less affected.
B-particle interactions.
When particles collide
with soft particles,
their motion
is only slightly affected.
However,
if they collide
with rigid particles,
their motion
is more significantly impacted.
See evolutionary algorithm,
E.A.
N.E.A.
is created
to evolve populations
of metamaterials.
Each metamaterial
has a unique combination
of stiff and soft particles.
The E.A.
evaluates the performance
of these materials
in a specific computational task,
such as performing
a computation.
Poor performing materials
are deleted,
while better performing
ones are randomly
modified and retained.
D-in-gate evolution.
Through the E.A.
process,
a metamaterial
evolves to act
as an in-gate,
a fundamental component
of computers.
In this configuration,
an output particle,
red,
vibrates only
if two input particles,
green and blue,
are vibrated
from outside the system.
E.A.
XOR-gate evolution,
the E.A.
can be tasked
with evolving
the same metamaterial
to function
as an XOR-gate
at a higher frequency.
In this scenario,
the output particle
vibrates
if one of the input particles
is vibrated.
F.Polycom-putting material,
as a result
of the evolutionary process,
the material
becomes polycom-putting.
When inputs are supplied
at two different frequencies,
the evolved metamaterial
simultaneously functions
as an in-gate
and an exor-gate,
it provides the results
of these two computations
at the same place
and the same time,
output particle
but at different frequencies.
This process demonstrates
how E.A.
can be used
to design materials
capable of polycom-putting,
where different computations
are performed
in the same material
simultaneously.
The text highlights
that many biological functions
can be analyzed
as computations,
and this perspective
extends to various
biological processes
and elements,
including molecular pathways,
individual protein molecules,
cytoskeletal elements,
calcium signaling,
and more.
These biological computations
may differ
from traditional algorithms
but fall within
the broader scope
of computations
known to information scientists.
Key points discussed
in this context.
Computations in biology,
biological systems
engage in massively
parallel,
stochastic,
and evolutionarily shaped
information processing.
This type of information processing
is different
from traditional algorithms
but is considered
a form of computation.
Information science tools
have been applied
to understand
decision-making processes
at the cellular
and tissue levels,
addressing aspects
such as uncertainty,
analog digital dynamics,
and distributed computations.
Bioelectric networks
bioelectric networks
and non-neural tissues
exhibit properties
amenable to polycomputation.
These networks
can store
diverse pattern memories
that facilitate
morphogenesis
on multiple scales
simultaneously.
They also enable
a single genome
to produce various
diverse outcomes.
Multiple observers.
Recognizing
unconventional computing
in biology
requires dropping
the notion of
what a system
is really computing
due to the issue
of multiple observers.
Once this perspective
is adopted,
it becomes evident
that biology incorporates
polycomputation
at various scales.
Evolutionary perspective.
The prevalence
of polycomputation
in biology
raises questions
about why it is so common.
It may be because
of its efficiency,
robustness,
or other advantages
that outweigh
the evolutionary challenges
of finding such solutions.
Alternatively,
polycomputation
might not be
as evolutionarily challenging
as previously thought
and could even be
a default feature.
The role of
developmental physiology,
bridging the genotype
and phenotype,
is considered a factor
in the emergence
of polycomputing.
Organizing principles.
Polycomputing
is seen as one
of the organizing principles
underlying
the open-ended
and robust nature
of living systems,
along with
degeneracy,
redundancy,
stress minimization,
and frustration minimization.
In summary,
the text highlights
that unconventional
computing,
including polycomputing,
plays a significant role
in biology,
providing insights
into the computational nature
of various biological processes
and systems.
Table 2 provides
a comprehensive list
of examples
of biological polycomputing
at diverse scales.
These examples illustrate
how various biological systems
and components
can perform multiple computations
in the same biological hardware.
Here are some of the examples
highlighted in the table.
Mitochondria.
They also act as microlenses
and photoreceptors.
Proteins.
Proteins can exist
in multiple fluctuating conformations,
allowing them
to perform different functions.
Pathways
and transcriptional networks.
These regulate
real-time physiology
while simultaneously
performing learning processes.
Gene regulatory networks.
They exhibit
multiple memories
and behaviors.
Chemical networks.
Some chemical networks
can perform tasks
similar to neural networks.
RNA.
RNA molecules encode
both enzyme
and protein functions.
ATP.
Adenosine triphosphate
serves as both
an energy source
and a neurotransmitter.
DNA.
DNA can have
more than one
active reading frame,
including overlapping
or dual-coding genes.
Ion channels.
Some ion channels
also function
as transcription factors.
cytoskeleton.
The cytoskeleton
performs computations
through biomechanical,
bioelectrical,
and quantum mechanical dynamics.
Electrophysiological networks.
They perform memory functions
while regulating
physiological processes
like heartbeat.
Bioelectric networks.
These networks
play roles
in both physiological functions
and the regulation
of morphogenesis.
Spiderwebs.
Spiderwebs serve
as both auditory sensors
and structural elements.
Pleiotropy.
Most genes
have multiple functions.
Holographic memory.
The brain exhibits
holographic memory.
Neuronal circuits.
The same neuronal circuit
can support
multiple behaviors.
Personality and identity.
Studies related
to dissociative identity disorder
in split brains
reveal multiple personalities
in the same brain.
Calcium dynamics.
Calcium dynamics
act as hubs
in a complex network
of simultaneous processes.
These examples
demonstrate
the remarkable capacity
of biological systems
to perform
multiple computations
concurrently,
challenging traditional notions
of distinct
and isolated functions
within living organisms.
Evolutionary processes
have played
a fundamental role
in the emergence
of polycomputing
in biological systems.
Evolution
is a powerful force
for innovation
while also conserving
existing mechanisms,
allowing for the adaptation
of organisms
to new niches.
This ability
to both innovate
and conserve resources
can be observed
in various domains,
including structural,
regulatory,
and computational aspects.
One key aspect
of evolution
is the reuse
of conserve mechanisms
for different purposes.
This reuse
allows evolution
to pivot
successful algorithms
and policies
from solving problems
in one domain
to addressing challenges
in another.
This ability
to pivot
has been observed
in metabolic spaces,
physiological processes,
transcriptional regulation,
anatomical development,
morphospace,
and ultimately,
behavioral spaces.
For instance,
ion channels,
originally used
for physiological control
of cell homeostasis
and metabolism,
are also employed
in large-scale
bioelectric circuits
to compute directions
for adaptive changes
in growth,
form,
embryogenesis,
metamorphosis,
regeneration,
and cancer suppression.
Polycomputting
is a prevalent feature
in biology
because living organisms
possess a multi-scale
competency architecture.
Each level
of biological organization,
from the molecular
to the behavioral,
is competent
in solving specific problems
within its own domain.
These competencies
operate simultaneously
using the same
physical medium,
which can be interpreted
differently and by observers
at various scales.
This interconnectedness
and multi-scale
competency architecture
enable Polycomputting
in biology,
and the results
of these computations
are explored
by observers
across different scales.
Polycomputting
in biology
is facilitated
by a multi-scale
competency architecture,
where each level
of biological organization
is capable
of performing
specific functions
simultaneously.
This architecture
spans from
the molecular level
to entire organisms
within larger ecosystems,
and it involves
various layers
of organization.
Molecular networks
at the lowest scale,
molecular networks,
composed of proteins,
genes,
and other biomolecules,
perform specific functions.
These molecular actors
are often required
to multitask
due to the limited space
and resources
within cells.
Cells
molecular networks
come together
to form cells,
each of which
serves specific purposes.
cells are capable
of executing
a variety of tasks,
and their interactions
contribute to the overall
functions of tissues
and organs.
Tissues
Cells combine
to create tissues,
which have their own
unique roles
and functions.
Tissues work in harmony
to perform tasks
like collective morphogenesis,
where they compute
the correct attractor
for a specific
morphogenetic behavior.
Organs
Tissues further aggregate
to form organs,
each with its own
specific function
in the context
of the organism's
overall physiology.
Organisms within swarms,
finally,
individual organisms
become part of
larger ecosystems,
forming swarms
or communities.
Each organism
plays a role
within its ecological niche,
contributing to the
overall balance
of the ecosystem.
Importantly,
each layer
in this multi-scale
competency architecture
not only performs
its designated functions
but also influences
the layer below it.
This influence
involves deforming
the action landscape,
providing incentives,
and shaping behavioral paths.
This hierarchical
organization encourages
lower-level components
to use their behaviors
in service
of the higher-level's goals,
creating a complex,
interconnected system
where polycomputting
can emerge.
The concept of
polycomputting
is vividly illustrated
in the example
of xenobots,
which are autonomous
entities created
from frog skin cells.
These remarkable
entities self-assemble,
exhibit a range
of behaviors,
and even demonstrate
kinematic self-replication,
all without
genetic modification.
The key insight here
is that xenobots
leverage the same
genetic information
found in standard
frog cells
but interpret it
in novel ways
to produce
these diverse functionalities.
This capacity
for cells
to perform
unexpected
and novel tasks
reveals that
genomic information
is inherently
overloaded
with potential.
The same DNA sequence
can be used
by cells
to build
a tadpole,
a frog,
or a xenobot.
Evolution doesn't
create specific solutions
for individual problems,
instead,
it generates
generic problem-solving
machines capable
of diverse functions.
Genomic information
is interpreted
by internal observer modules,
allowing the same hardware
to perform
multiple functions
simultaneously.
Evolutionary processes
in biology
do not overt
reign on prior examples
but generalize
to produce substrates
that can adapt
to different needs
in varying environments.
Developmental processes
involve cells
that have their own competencies
and affordens
forming a toolkit
that evolution
can exploit.
Evolutionary outcomes
are achieved
by incentivizing
subsystems
to manage
and utilize
the many capabilities
of the material
rather than establishing
a single,
privileged way
of doing things.
This perspective
aligns with
the process metaphysics
where biology operates
by shaping behaviors
and exploiting
existing competencies.
Importantly,
evolution benefits
from architectures
that support polycomputing
because each new
evolutionary experiment
can derive
adaptive advantages
without a need
to change existing components,
minimizing the risk
of disrupting
other subsystems.
This dynamic
allows for the
continual optimization
of functions
and behaviors
without compromising
existing dependencies.
Polycomputing
emerges as a powerful
design principle
in biology,
facilitating adaptive
outcomes in response
to ever-changing
environmental challenges.
The multiscale
competency architecture
in biology,
where different parts
of an organism
can adapt
to changing circumstances,
is a crucial factor
in the efficiency
and adaptability
of evolutionary processes.
This architecture
allows various
biological structures
to perform their functions
even if circumstances
change
or mutations occur.
For example,
in the case
of the tadpole eye,
it can still provide
vision even if placed
in an aberrant location
on the head or tail,
thanks to the competency
of eye primordial cells
to adapt
and connect
to the spinal cord.
This competency
of biological substrates
and regulative development
and remodeling
neutralizes
the lethal side effects
of many mutations,
enabling the exploration
of other
potentially beneficial effects.
In a polycomputing
architecture,
structures simultaneously
solve morphological
and physiological problems,
enabling evolution
to explore
the consequences
of mutations
that might have
multiple effects
on the phenotype.
The concept
of an overloaded
competency
of cells and tissues
creates a
hidden layer
of developmental physiology
that sits
between genomic inputs
and phenotypic outputs.
This layer provides
problem-solving capacity
by getting adaptive tasks
completed
despite changes
in the microenvironment
or internal parts.
This occurs
across all scales
of biological organization,
with each level
computing specific functions
in its own problem space
and influencing
higher-level spaces.
The evolutionary pressure
to make existing materials
perform multiple duties
is the driving force
behind the development
of polycomputing
in biology.
However,
much remains
to be understood
about how these pressures
lead to polycomputing
and how materials
can be overloaded
with new functions
without disrupting
existing ones.
In computer science,
there is also a need
to explore
how optimization pressures
can create
polycomputing substrates
and to develop
programming strategies
suitable for polycomputing.
Despite the complexity
of these processes,
it's clear that
the predictability
and tractability
of biological systems,
which behave like machines,
are harnessed by evolution.
Biological machines
control and comprise
other machines,
working simultaneously
in the same locality
but in different modalities
and virtual problem spaces.
This architecture
produces plasticity,
robustness,
and novelty,
demonstrating the true power
of that machine
in the context of life.
One approach
to harnessing
computational capabilities
in biological systems
is to examine
specific mechanisms
for their novel functions
and find the best ways
to induce them
to execute these capabilities.
At the molecular level,
this can involve
studying gene regulatory networks,
GRNs,
which consist of genes
that up and down
regulate each other's functions.
While GRNs are typically studied
to explain specific
biological processes,
researchers have explored
whether these networks
have novel computational functions,
such as learning functions.
In one study,
biological GRN models
were analyzed
to identify learning capacity
within them.
The researchers examined
different combinations
of nodes within the networks
as candidates for conditioned
and unconditioned stimuli
and responses,
similar to Pavlovian
classical associative learning.
They found that
biological networks
exhibited a range
of learning capabilities,
while control random networks
showed fewer instances
of this property.
Importantly,
the same biological networks
offered multiple types
of memory and computations,
depending on which modes
were considered control knobs
and salient readouts.
This approach demonstrates
how existing biological systems
can embody novel functions
without the need
for rewiring
their causal architecture.
This approach highlights
a key principle
of biological polycomputing.
Evolution can prepare
a computational affordance,
such as a GRN,
with multiple interfaces,
different gene targets
that can be manipulated
by engineers,
neighboring cells,
or parasites
to exploit the system's
computational capabilities.
This perspective suggests
that understanding
biological evolution
involves searching for ways
in which an organism's
components can adaptively
exploit each other
as features of their environment,
seeking optimal perspectives
and ways to use
existing interfaces.
Furthermore,
the results of probing
neural networks
for novel functions
indicate the need
to develop tools
not only for predicting ways
to rewire biological systems
but also for identifying
the optimal perspectives
from which to view
and explore existing
polycomputant capacities.
This approach can provide
valuable insights
into the rich computational
capabilities inherent
in biological systems.
In developing tools
to understand
and harness
the computational capabilities
of biological systems,
it's essential
to overcome
human cognitive biases
and resist the tendency
to categorize phenomena
in familiar ways.
One approach
is to explore
non-intuitive phenomena
that challenge
traditional categories.
Even better
is to identify gradients
along which we can
transition from
obvious approximations
of phenomena
to more accurate,
yet less obvious,
reflections of reality.
One such gradient
leads from serial
to parallel
to superposed processes.
Historically,
the Industrial Revolution
demonstrated
the advantages
of parallel tasks
over serial ones,
and the computer age
highlighted
the power
of parallel computation.
However,
human thinking
often occurs
in a serial fashion,
and understanding
superposition,
where multiple functions
happen in the same place
at the same time,
can be even more challenging.
Another conceptual transition
involves moving
from modular
to non-modular processes.
Modular design
is a fundamental principle
in engineering,
but it may primarily
serve human
cognitive limitations.
Many natural phenomena
are continuous
rather than strictly modular.
When considering
biological
or technological
polycomputing systems,
the question
of modularity
becomes complex,
as different observers
may perceive
different subsets
of functions,
some of which
may appear
more modular
than others.
Consequently,
traditional distinctions
between modular
and non-modular systems
may need to be reconsidered
to advance research
in this field.
Understanding
how biological systems
engage in polycomputing
and integrating
these principles
into technology
has several
practical implications
for AI
and robotics.
Efficiency,
building AI technologies
or robots
that can perform
multiple computations
in the same place
at the same time
can lead to
computationally dense systems.
This means
they can perform
complex tasks
with fewer
physical materials,
reducing waste
and resource consumption.
Biohybrids,
technologies
that incorporate
polycomputing principles
may be more compatible
with biological components.
This compatibility
could enable
the development
of biohybrid systems
where biological
and synthetic components
work together seamlessly.
Multifunctional machines
Polycomputing
can allow machines
to perform
different functions
in various domains
simultaneously,
such as sensing,
acting,
computing,
storing energy,
and releasing energy.
This versatility
could lead
to the creation
of entirely new types
of robots
with diverse capabilities.
Overcoming
catastrophic interference
Polycomputing
offers a potential solution
to the problem
of catastrophic interference
in AI and robotics.
Agents that can
polycompute
may have an advantage
in learning
and storing new behaviors
without forgetting
previously learned ones,
as they can utilize
underutilized areas
of their computational substrates.
Overall,
embracing
polycomputing principles
in technology
has the potential
to enhance efficiency,
compatibility
with biological systems,
multifunctionality,
and robustness
in AI and robotics applications.
The concept
of gradual computing
in biology
and technology
challenges binary categories
and highlights
the importance
of recognizing
slow,
continuous transitions.
This gradualism
is evident
in various scenarios,
such as the development
of sentient features
during embryogenesis,
the distinction
between a cyborg
and a machine or organism,
and when a machine
becomes a robot.
These questions
often require
arbitrary lines
to be drawn,
lacking discrete transitions.
In developmental biology,
the transition
from an unfertilized
humanusite
to a complex being
involves gradual changes
and polycomputing.
Structural and physiological
functions adapt
over time
to navigate
new behavioral spaces
while still performing
their original roles.
This gradual transition
blurs the lines
between internal
and external affordenses.
Similarly,
when a dynamical system
composed of electrical components
becomes a computer,
there is a transition
from the electrodynamics lens
to computational formalisms.
The process matures
as the system
starts following algorithms,
executing instructions,
and becoming
computationally interpretable.
Recognizing this transition
is essential
for effectively interacting
with computers
and harnessing
their computational capabilities.
In essence,
the shift
from analog to digital
or from one state
to another
is a matter of changing
the observer's perspective
and the relative payoffs
for different formalisms.
Understanding these transitions
is crucial
for working
with complex systems
in both biology
and technology.
Understanding agency
and persuadability
in computational systems
is a critical aspect
of recognizing
and harnessing
their capabilities effectively.
Systems exist
along a spectrum
of persuadability,
indicating how meanable
they are to different forms
of interaction
and manipulation.
The spectrum
includes physical rewiring,
set-point modification,
training,
and language-based reasoning.
Animals,
including humans,
possess the ability
to detect agency
in their environment.
For humans,
the theory of mind
is a fundamental aspect
of behavior
and social culture.
Evolution
has shaped
our cognitive systems
to readily attribute
the intentional stance
to entities
in our environment.
Whether it's recognizing
agency in another being
or overestimating it
and anthropomorphizing,
these cognitive processes
serve to enhance
our adaptive interactions
with the world.
The key takeaway
is that understanding
the level of agency
and persuadability
in computational systems
allows us to choose
the most suitable techniques
for interacting with them,
optimizing our ability
to harness
their computational capabilities
effectively.
The concept
of multiple observers
interacting with a biological
or technological system
simultaneously
adds complexity
to the understanding
of agency
and persuadability.
In such scenarios,
various entities,
including neighboring cells,
tissues,
conspecifics,
and parasites,
might all be attempting
to influence the system
to achieve different outcomes.
A polycomputant system,
due to its ability
to perform multiple computations
in the same place
at the same time,
could potentially respond
to the requests
and needs
of all these observers
concurrently.
This is in contrast
as to traditional computers,
which typically follow
a single set of instructions
and do not easily
accommodate
simultaneous,
diverse interactions.
The notion
of multiple observers
and their varying degrees
of influence
and persuasion
highlights the potential
for future
polycomputational machines
to be more versatile
and adaptive
in addressing
the demands
of different entities
interacting with them.
The concept
of what constitutes
a computer
extends beyond
typical devices
like laptops
and smartphones.
Alan Turing
provided a theoretical
definition
of a computer
that is device-independent.
According to Turing's
definition,
a system can be
considered a computer
if it possesses
the following characteristics.
It has an internal state,
it can read information
from its environment,
referred to as its tape,
it can update
its behavior
based on what it reads
and its current state,
and optionally,
it can write information
back out to the tape.
This theoretical framework,
known as a Turing machine,
encompasses a broad
range of systems,
including unconventional
ones like consortia
of crabs,
slime molds,
fluids,
and even algorithms
running within
other computers.
Identifying when
a system transitions
from being just
a physical material
to behaving like
a computer
can be challenging,
especially with
continuous dynamical
systems.
Observers might
perceive the system
differently,
depending on their
chosen viewpoint.
Even if a system
appears to behave
like a Turing machine,
pinpointing its components,
such as the tape
or the read-write head,
can be complex.
In certain
biological systems,
like modal
multicellular assemblies
constructing
other modal assemblies,
it might not be clear
where or how the
tape is localized
in space and time,
if it exists at all.
This ambiguity
adds to the complexity
of defining
when a system
becomes a computer.
The challenge
of identifying
when a system
becomes a computer
is further complicated
by the dynamic
nature of both
biological and
non-biological systems.
These systems
evolve over time,
potentially altering
how they appear
in terms of
computer-like behavior.
Moreover,
Polycomputing systems,
capable of providing
different computational
results to different
observers simultaneously,
may appear as
multiple computers,
each with varying
levels of computational
and the gentle potential,
depending on the
observer's perspective.
This complexity
makes it difficult
not only to determine
if something is a computer
but also to pinpoint
when it becomes one
or starts behaving
more like a computer.
As technology advances
and our understanding
of biological systems
deepens,
the idea of attributing
a singular cognitive self
to a system
will become
increasingly challenging.
Instead,
we may need to acknowledge
that many systems
of interest house
multiple selves,
each with varying degrees
of computational
and the gentle potential.
These selves can exist
not only at different
size scales
but can also be
superimposed upon
one another
within localized
parts of a system.
The Integrated Information
Theory,
IIT,
of consciousness
also faces challenges
in defining a single,
privileged perspective
within a system,
as there are numerous
viable scales
of description
and computations,
each with some degree
of integrated information.
The Exclusion Postulate,
which posits a definite
singular consciousness,
remains a controversial
aspect of IIT.
In light of the growing
understanding of
polycomputting in both
biological and
technological systems,
it is possible that
the Exclusion Postulate
may need to be
reconsidered when attempting
to explain human
consciousness as a
mental module operating
solely within the brain.
In conclusion,
the debate over whether
biological systems
or computers has evolved
with a changing
understanding of computation
and the recognition
that there isn't a single,
objective answer
to this question.
Instead,
we propose a perspective
in which computational
interpretations
aren't just lenses
to view a system
in the same way.
Multiple interpretations
of the information
processed by a set
of events
can be simultaneously
useful to different
subsystems
observers within
the same system.
This perspective
acknowledges that
there is no
one-to-one mapping
between biological form
and function,
and biological components
are massively overloaded
with regard to
polycomputting.
They exhibit competency,
plasticity,
and autonomy,
enabling the kind
of second-order
polycomputting
where various components
attempt to model
each other's
computational behavior
and act based on
their expected reward
from their perspective.
Modern computer engineering
offers more suitable
metaphors for understanding
and predicting life,
as biological systems
are not just computers
but are remarkable
polycomputting devices,
unmatched by current
technology in terms
of depth and complexity.
While biological systems
differ from today's
computers,
future efforts
to build deep,
multi-scale,
highly adaptive
synthetic devices
can benefit from
the principles
of biologic
polycomputting.
The key implication
is that blanket
pronouncements
about the capabilities
of living
or non-living machines
are inadequate,
and we should embrace
a more nuanced,
hypothesis-driven approach
to understand
and predict the limits
of adaptive behavior
in synthetic,
evolved,
and hybrid systems.
This approach
recognizes the inherent
surprises and complexities
that arise in these systems
and expands
our predictive capabilities.
Indeed,
the practical implications
of understanding
and harnessing polycomputting
in biology
are far-reaching.
In biomedical settings,
where control
over multiple scales
of biological organizations
is crucial,
computational frameworks
that account for polycomputting
can be transformative.
From cellular pathways
to patient psychological states,
the ability to model
computational superpositions
where diverse observers
have their own models
of the dynamic environment
can enhance our control
and understanding.
Furthermore,
this concept aligns with
and advances various fields,
including synthetic bioengineering,
biorobotics,
smart materials,
and AI.
It opens up new avenues
for creating adaptive
and highly functional technologies
that can operate
at multiple scales,
much like biological systems.
By embracing
polycomputting principles,
we can unlock
innovative solutions
to complex problems
in these domains.

The example of Xenobos is used to illustrate how organisms can exhibit autonomous behaviors that were not specifically selected for in their evolutionary history.
These behaviors are achieved without genetic modification, showcasing the flexibility of genomic information.
The passage emphasizes that genomic information can be interpreted in various ways by physiological machinery,
leading to the same DNA sequence being used to build different types of organisms or achieve different functionalities.
Evolution creates generic problem-solving machines, allowing organisms to perform multiple functions simultaneously.
Polycomputing is linked to recent advances in developmental biology and primitive cognition,
where larger-scale systems emerge from smaller-scale components pursuing diverse agendas.
This highlights the coordination of computational processes at different scales.
The passage also discusses the challenge of the centereal gap in biology,
where evolutionary experience may not always be suitable for novel challenges in new environments.
Evolution generalizes and produces substrates capable of computing different functions as needed.
Furthermore, the passage highlights how evolution works with existing cellular competencies
and utilizes cellular affordances during embryogenesis.
It finds ways to incentivize subsystems to exploit the capabilities of the material effectively.
In conclusion, the passage argues that evolution naturally incorporates polycomputing as a design principle.
It leverages genomic and physiological information to generate organisms with diverse functionalities,
adapts to new environments by generalizing past experiences,
and exploits existing cellular competencies and affordances.
Polycomputing allows evolution to derive adaptive advantages without disrupting prior evolutionary processes.
The passage discusses the significance of polycomputing in the context of evolution
and the adaptability of organisms to perform multiple tasks and respond to changing circumstances.
One example provided is the tadpole eye's ability to still provide vision,
even when placed in the wrong position on the head or tail.
The cells forming the eye can adjust their development and connectivity to compensate for this misplacement
and provide visual signals to the spinal cord instead of the brain.
This regulative development and remodeling competency allows organisms to neutralize the harmful effects of mutations
and explore potential beneficial effects.
In a monocomputational developmental architecture,
mutations might hinder such exploration due to their negative impact on essential functions.
However, in a polycomputing architecture, structures can solve multiple problems simultaneously,
enabling the exploration of other effects while necessary adjustments are made.
The passage introduces the concept of the hidden layer in developmental physiology,
acting as a problem-solving capacity between genomic inputs and phenotypic outputs.
This layer operates at various scales of organization,
with each level computing specific functions in its own problem space while influencing the higher level.
Evolution produces modules that explore each other's outputs through behavior shaping
and the use of competent subunits as a gentle materials.
This allows the same processes to serve different functions and different components of the organism.
The evolutionary pressure to make existing materials serve multiple roles is significant.
However, there is still much to learn about how this pressure leads to polycomputing
and how new functions can be incorporated onto existing materials
without detrimently affecting their existing functions.
The passage acknowledges that within computer science,
there is work to be done to develop optimization pressures that create polycomputing substrates
and programming strategies suitable for polycomputing.
Despite these gaps in understanding,
it is evident that evolution relies on the predictability and tractability of living organisms as machines.
Life harnesses the principles of physics and computation to produce specific outcomes,
and evolution makes changes to the material, control algorithms,
and environment to achieve predictable and adaptive results.
This underscores the machine-like nature of life,
characterized by its multi-scale polycomputing architecture,
where machines control and comprise other machines,
leading to plasticity, robustness, and novelty.
The passage discusses a novel approach to identifying and harnessing computational capabilities
in living organisms and computer models.
One approach is to explore specific mechanisms,
such as gene regulatory networks, GRNs,
for their potential computational functions.
GRNs describe how a set of genes interact to regulate each other's functions,
While GRNs and protein pathways are typically studied to understand biological processes,
the passage suggests investigating their capacity for computational functions,
particularly in terms of learning.
The study described in the passage involves using GRNs as formal models of biological systems.
The researchers examined different combinations of nodes within GRNs
as conditioned and unconditioned stimuli and responses,
similar to classical associative learning.
The results indicated that biological networks exhibited learning capacity,
while control random networks showed fewer examples of such behavior.
Importantly, the same networks display different types of memory and computations
depending on the nodes considered control knobs and readouts.
This approach aims to identify functional perspectives
from which unmodified systems already possess novel functions,
without altering the system's causal architecture.
The passage highlights a key principle of biological polycomputing.
Evolution prepares computational affordenses, like GRNs,
with multiple interfaces, gene targets that can be manipulated by engineers,
neighboring cells, or parasites to leverage their computational capabilities.
It suggests that understanding biological evolution involves identifying ways
in which an organism's components can adaptively explore other components
as features of their environment, seeking optimal perspective to utilize existing interfaces.
At the organism level, the brain is cited as an example
where multiple functions occur simultaneously,
and the ability to store multiple memories in the same neuronal structure
is proposed to be implemented through phase.
The passage concludes by suggesting that,
in addition to tools for predicting how to rewire living systems,
there should be a focus on developing tools to identify optimal perspectives
for viewing and exploiting existing polycomputing capacities.
This approach aims to tap into the computational potential
already present in biological systems,
rather than exclusively focusing on rewiring or modifying them.
The passage discusses the need to challenge human cognitive biases
and resist the tendency to categorize phenomena in comfortable, yet limiting ways.
It suggests that we should seek non-intuitive phenomena
that challenge our existing categories and identify gradients
along which we can transition from obvious approximations of phenomena
to more accurate reflections of reality.
One such gradient mentioned is the transition from serial to parallel to superposed processes.
The Industrial Revolution demonstrated the advantages of parallel tasks over serial ones,
and the computer age showcased the power of parallel computation.
However, the transition from serial to parallel processes has been slow,
possibly due to cognitive limitations.
Despite the parallelism in the human brain,
human thinking predominantly occurs in a serial fashion.
The concept of superposition,
where multiple functions are performed in the same place at the same time,
is even more challenging to grasp.
Another conceptual direction discussed is the transition from modular to non-modular processes.
In engineering, modular design is a cardinal rule,
but it is a conception to human cognitive limits
rather than necessarily the best approach.
Many natural phenomena are continuous,
challenging the notion of strict modularity.
When considering polycomputant systems in biology or technology,
the question of modularity becomes ambiguous.
Different observers may perceive different subsets of functions,
and the degree of modularity may vary.
The passage suggests that classical distinctions
between modular and non-modular processes
need to be abandoned or redefined
to facilitate future research in this area.
Overall, the passage advocates for embracing non-intuitive phenomena
and exploring gradients of understanding
that lead us away from comfortable categorizations,
ultimately allowing for a more accurate and comprehensive understanding of reality.
The passage discusses practical implications for AI robotics
that can be derived from understanding
and incorporating the concept of polycomputant observed in biological systems.
Firstly, developing AI technologies or robots
that are computationally dense,
meaning they can perform complex tasks with fewer physical materials,
can lead to more intelligent and efficient systems
that generate less waste.
Secondly, the components of technology
that exhibit polycomputant capabilities
may be more compatible with biological components
that naturally polycompute.
This compatibility can open up possibilities
for creating biohybrids,
combining biological and technological elements
to develop new and advanced systems.
Thirdly, the concept of polycomputant enables
the creation of machines
that can perform multiple functions simultaneously
in the same location.
This can lead to the development of robots
that can sense, act, compute, store energy,
and release energy all in one place,
expanding the capabilities and versatility of robotic systems.
Fourthly, polycomputant offers a potential solution
to the problem of catastrophic interference in AI and robotics.
Catastrophic interference occurs
when an agent learns something new
at the expense of forgetting something it has previously learned.
A polycomputant agent,
with its ability to perform multiple computations simultaneously,
may be able to learn and store new behaviors
in underutilized areas of its computational space,
reducing interference
and improving overall learning and adaptability.
This ability is analogous to cognitive radio technologies
that constantly seek underutilized frequency bands for broadcasting.
Overall, understanding and incorporating polycomputant principles
from biological systems into AI and robotics
have practical benefits,
including increased computational efficiency,
compatibility with biological components,
expanded functionality,
and potential solutions to interference problems.
The passage discusses the concept
of gradual computing in biology
and the challenges of defining discrete boundaries
in the emergence of specific features and identity.
It highlights the importance of continuous models
and the limitations of binary categories
in understanding the complex processes
of development and evolution.
Examples such as the question
of when a human baby
becomes sentient during embryogenesis,
when a cyborg transitions
from being a machine to an organism,
or when a machine becomes a robot,
demonstrate the difficulty
of defining clear-cut boundaries.
These questions require arbitrary lines to be drawn,
despite the absence of discrete transitions.
Developmental biology and evolution
show that gradual, slow changes
are integral to the nature
of important structural and functional aspects.
The gradual transition process
in the development
of a biologically embodied intelligence
involves polycomputting,
where structural and physiological functions
progressively adapt to new tasks
and behavioral spaces
while still fulfilling their original roles
in metabolic and physiological spaces.
This transition blurs the boundaries
between internal and external affordens
and has implications for niche construction
and the extended phenotype.
Similarly,
the Buddha process of a dynamical system
becoming a computer
exemplifies the shift in the relative payoffs
for different formalisms.
Initially,
the system is described by electrodynamics,
but as power is turned on,
it becomes increasingly amenable
to computational formalisms.
The maturation of the process
involves a mode
that can be modeled as
following an algorithm.
The transition from an analog device
to a computer
represents a change
in the observer's perspective
and the recognition
of the computational lens
that offers higher-level interfaces
and functionalities.
The passage emphasizes
the need to recognize
and understand
these gradual transitions
and shifts in formalisms,
as overlooking them
can lead to a limited understanding
and interaction
with complex systems,
whether in biology or computing.
The conclusions drawn from the passage
suggest a shift in perspective
regarding the understanding
of biological systems
as computers.
It argues against
the skeptical debate
surrounding this topic,
emphasizing that computation
should not be seen
as a single,
objective answer
but rather as diverse interpretations
that can be useful
to different observers simultaneously.
The passage highlights
the concept of multiple realizability,
indicating that there is
no one-to-one mapping
between biological form
and function.
Biological systems exhibit
a high level of conservation
across evolutionary instances,
and their components
are overloaded
with polycomputing capabilities.
This polycomputing nature
allows different components
to model each other's
computational behavior
and act based on
their expected rewards,
creating a complex
and multi-layered system.
While biological systems
are powerful computers,
they possess a depth
and complexity
that is yet to be achieved
by current technology.
However,
the passage suggests
that future efforts
in building synthetic devices
can benefit from the principles
of biologic polycomputing
to achieve deep,
multi-scale,
and highly plastic systems.
The conclusion also emphasizes
the need to abandon
absolutist categories
and objective views
of computation.
Instead,
it encourages formulating
and testing hypotheses
to understand
and predict
the adaptive behavior
of synthetic,
evolved,
and hybrid systems.
The unpredictability
and surpassing capabilities
of these systems
indicate that
blanket pronouncements
about what living
or non-living machines
can do are insufficient,
and a more open
and hypothesis-driven approach
is necessary
to expand
our predictive capabilities.
In summary,
the passage advocates
for a shift in perspective
towards understanding
biological systems
as powerful
and polycomputing devices
capable of complex computations.
It suggests
that incorporating
the principles
of biologic polycomputing
into future synthetic systems
can lead
to further advancements.
Additionally,
it emphasizes
the importance
of abandoning rigid categories
and embracing
hypothesis-driven approaches
to expand
our understanding
of adaptive behaviors
in complex systems.
The passage highlights
the practical implications
of understanding
and harnessing polycomputing
in biological systems,
particularly in the context
of improving health
in biomedical settings
and advancing various fields
of science and technology.
One practical outcome
is the need
to develop
computational frameworks
that can control
and manipulate
multiple scales
of biological organizations.
This includes
cellular pathways,
physiological processes,
and even patient
psychological states.
By understanding
and leveraging
the polycomputing capabilities
of biological systems,
researchers and practitioners
can gain better control
over these complex systems
to improve health outcomes.
Furthermore,
the passage suggests
the importance
of constructing
computational superpositions,
where diverse observers,
such as scientists,
users,
and the components
of a system
have their own models
of the dynamic environment.
This would enable
optimization of behavior
and decision-making
based on individual
perspectives and goals.
Such computational
superpositions
can have implications
for synthetic bioengineering,
biorobotics,
smart materials,
and AI,
as these fields
can benefit
from understanding
and incorporating
the principles
of polycomputing
in their respective domains.
In summary,
the practical outcomes
of understanding
and utilizing
polycomputing in biology
include the development
of computational frameworks
for controlling
biological systems
at multiple scales,
improving health outcomes
in biomedical settings,
and advancing fields
such as synthetic
bioengineering,

If you have any specific questions or if there's a particular aspect of polycomputation you'd like to explore further, please feel free to ask.
Certainly, I can summarize the connections between the various topics we've discussed.
Polycomputation
This is the overarching concept we've been discussing, involving multiple computational processes contributing to a system's functionality.
Multiscale competency architecture
This concept relates to the hierarchical organization of biological systems, where different levels of organization interact to achieve adaptability.
It involves modularity, feedback, and emergence.
Gradual transitions
We discussed how gradual transitions occur in biology, computing, and artificial intelligence.
These transitions involve incremental changes over time, whether in biological evolution, developmental processes, or the improvement of computing technologies.
Non-intuitive phenomena
This topic relates to phenomena in quantum physics that challenge classical intuitions, such as superposition, wave-particle duality, and quantum entanglement.
These phenomena highlight the complexity and non-linear behavior of the quantum world.
Ethical considerations in AI
We talked on ethical considerations in artificial intelligence, particularly in the context of gradual computing.
These considerations include transparency, fairness, accountability, and the potential for unintended consequences in evolving AI systems.
Evolution and repurposing
We discussed how evolution repurposes existing mechanisms in biology, leading to adaptations and diversifications.
This concept can be applied to various biological processes, including gene duplication, exaptation, and co-option of developmental pathways.
Superposition in quantum mechanics
This is a fundamental concept in quantum physics that challenges classical notions.
Superposition allows particles to exist in multiple states simultaneously until measured, impacting quantum computing and interference phenomena.
These topics are interconnected in various ways.
For example, polycomputation and multi-scale competency architecture relate to the parallelism and integration of multiple processes in biological systems.
Gradual transitions can be observed in the evolution of biological organisms and the development of AI systems.
Ethical considerations become important when discussing the implications of evolving AI technologies.
Non-intuitive phenomena in quantum physics highlight the complexity of the natural world, which can be studied and harnessed through computing and AI.
If you have specific questions about how these topics further relate or if you'd like to explore any particular aspect in more detail, please let me know.
Certainly, let's tie together the topics we've discussed into a narrative summary.
At the heart of our discussion lies the intriguing concept of polycomputation, which mirrors the multi-scale competency architecture found in biology.
Polycomputation involves the harmonious interplay of multiple computational processes to enhance system functionality and adaptability.
In the biological realm, nature has perfected the art of gradual transitions.
Through mechanisms like gene duplication, exactation, and the co-option of developmental pathways, evolution repurposes existing structures and processes to drive adaptation and diversification.
Biological systems exhibit multi-scale competency architecture, where molecules interact at the cellular level, cells collaborate within tissues,
tissues orchestrate within organs, and organs coordinate to form an organism.
This hierarchical organization promotes adaptability, robustness, and the emergence of collective behaviors.
Yet, as we delve into the quantum realm, we encounter non-intuitive phenomena that defy classical intuitions.
Quantum superposition allows particles to exist in multiple states simultaneously, challenging our understanding of reality.
Wave-particle duality reveals that particles can behave both as waves and particles, transcending classical categories.
Quantum entanglement creates instantaneous correlations between particles, shattering classical notions of causality and locality.
Drawing parallels between the quantum and artificial intelligence domains, we explore gradual computing.
This approach emphasizes incremental learning, adaptability, and the accumulation of knowledge over time.
It mirrors the incremental changes seen in biological evolution and development.
However, gradual computing introduces ethical considerations, such as transparency and accountability, as evolving AI systems become more autonomous.
In essence, these diverse topics interconnect through the theme of complexity and adaptability in the face of ever-changing environments.
From the intricate dance of molecules within cells to the entangled particles of quantum physics and the evolving algorithms of artificial intelligence,
the threads of polycomputation, multi-scale competency architecture, gradual transitions, non-intuitive phenomena, evolution, and ethical AI considerations
weave together a tapestry of exploration into the intricate and interconnected nature of our world.
The terms you've introduced are indeed unusual and represent novel concepts in the field of polycomputation and bioengineering.
Let's briefly explore each of these terms.
A gentle material.
A gentle material refers to a type of material or system that possesses a significant degree of autonomy and the ability to execute its own agenda.
It is not merely passive or reactive but can actively shape its behavior based on interventions.
This concept highlights the idea that certain materials, whether engineered by humans or evolved in nature, can exhibit a form of autonomy and self-determination.
Anatomical compiler.
An anatomical compiler represents an advanced system that, in the future, may be able to interpret shape specifications provided by a user and translate them into a set of stimuli.
These stimuli would guide cells in building a specific anatomical structure, regardless of how novel or unusual it may be.
It's a visionary concept that envisions a level of control over biological form that extends far beyond our current capabilities.
Axis of Persuadability.
The axis of persuadability is a spectrum that categorizes different types of systems based on what kinds of interventions or approaches are most effective in predicting and controlling them.
It's an engineering perspective on agency, focusing on how to persuade a system to behave in the desired manner.
This concept considers various methods, from rewiring to logical arguments, to influence different types of systems.
Bioprompting.
Bioprompting involves the ways in which biological systems communicate and signal each other to induce complex outcomes using simple signals.
It draws parallels to how AI engineers craft inputs to manipulate the behavior of artificial intelligence systems.
Bioprompting explores how signals can be used to exploit the competencies of the receiver to achieve intricate results.
Competency.
In this context, competency refers to the degree of the ability of a system, such as a group of cells or tissues, to solve problems within anatomical, physiological, metabolic, or transcriptional space.
It measures how effectively a system can navigate the space despite interventions or perturbations.
Competency can vary based on how a problem is posed and the prompts or signals used to guide a system's behavior.
These concepts, as presented by Dr. Michael Levin, reflect innovative thinking at the intersection of biology, engineering, and artificial intelligence.
They challenge our understanding of biological systems and open new avenues for research and exploration in the field of polycomputation and bioengineering.
These are indeed intriguing and innovative terms that expand our understanding of various fields, from biology to artificial intelligence.
Let's briefly summarize each of these terms.
Cognitive light cone.
The cognitive light cone represents the outer boundary, in both space and time, of the largest goal that a given system, whether biological or artificial, can work towards.
It provides a way to categorize and compare the scope of goals that different agents can pursue, regardless of their nature or origin.
IONOCEUTICLE.
An IONOCEUTICLE is a biomedical intervention specifically designed to target the bioelectric interface exposed by cells.
This includes ion channels, gap junctions, and similar cellular machinery that regulates how cells process information and interact with each other.
IONOCEUTICLES aim to modulate these processes for therapeutic purposes.
IONOCEUTICLE.
Morphous eutical.
Morphous eutical.
A morphous eutical is a biomedical treatment, such as a drug or device, that functions by resetting the anatomical set point within a patient's tissues.
Instead of directly implementing a physiological state, morphous euticals leverage the homeostatic mechanisms of the body to achieve the desired anatomical morphology.
POLICOM PUTING
Polycom putting reimagines computation as observer-driven, suggesting that a given machine, whether living or artificial, can perform multiple computations simultaneously based on the computational lens employed by an observer.
This concept challenges traditional notions of computation and highlights its observer-dependent nature.
Symbiosis
Symbiosis describes the symbiotic relationship between evolved and engineered materials in novel configurations.
It emphasizes the interdependence and mutual benefit that arises when living and artificial entities come together to create something new.
This term reflects the concept of entities thriving together through collaboration.
Target morphology
Target morphology refers to the specific anatomical pattern that a collective of cells will work towards, and once achieved, triggers the cessation of proliferation and remodeling.
The ability to reach a target morphology reflects the competency of cellular collectives in navigating morphospace and can be edited without genetic changes.
Teleophobia
Teleophobia represents the fear of attributing too much agency when explaining or predicting the behavior of a system.
