The days of the internet being a true global network are coming to an end
The decoupling started two and a half decades ago when countries like China and North Korea
Started walling their networks off from the rest of the world and it has accelerated rapidly in the last few years
By today politicians from Russia, Iran, Turkey, India and much of the rest of the global south have tightened their grips on their internet
Significantly and even the EU and the US are starting to draw up lines around their borders demanding data
Localization and banning what they consider to be foreign propaganda
We're on the verge of a so-called splinter net not one global network where information travels freely across borders
But a patchwork of many smaller ones that are allowed to communicate with each other only when and how their leaders decide to
I've already made a dedicated video about how Russia is cutting themselves off the global web
Which you can watch somewhere here, but in this video
Let's take a global look at what patterns and technologies
Countries around the world are using to isolate themselves
On the 20th of April
1994 China connected itself to the global internet for the first time ever from there
It only took three years for the term the great Chinese firewall to be coined by China watchers and
Journalists as the government quickly made it known that a completely free connection was not their intention at all
They started with just some simple legal restrictions at first and for about a decade many scholars
Doubted that real control over a network as fast and chaotic as the internet was even possible
But the government soon proved that it very much was
China early on realized that they didn't need a complete seal with absolute control around their internet
But just a semi permeable great firewall that put up some very specific limits
This system would be easier to maintain and in fact it would be much more beneficial for the government too
Some information leaking in and out of the country was a feature not a bug
International traffic was allowed to flow in and out of the country
But bandwidth was painfully slow for daily use foreign websites did load by default
But they got blacklisted once they grew too problematic workarounds like VPNs were usually tolerated most of the time
But they were made unreliable enough to become inconvenient on a daily basis and they were shut down
completely during sensitive political events and foreign internet companies from Facebook to Google to Uber were all initially
Allowed to set up offices and operate in China too
But they were never allowed to truly win any crucial markets for themselves
And they were eventually thrown out of the country once they got too big to control like Facebook
This per rose firewall ensured that people who needed global access to information like
researchers and scientific departments or companies with foreign clients
They could always kind of get through the firewall and it also made sure that Chinese domestic companies would be exposed to
International competitors that gave them lots of good ideas and kept them on their toes
But it also made foreign services unreliable enough where the mainstream population
Allerant to never truly rely on them for day-to-day activities under this system of carefully balanced isolation
China built a parallel fully independent internet for itself with domestic firms for everything from
Payments to ride-hailing to social media and with those services being built exclusively on domestic cloud services
APIs etc while only foreign firms like Apple that could not easily be kicked out of the country were simply ordered to process most of their
User data within China and often even to hand over control to their domestic servers to state owned enterprises
With this careful balancing act China achieved something pretty remarkable a domestic internet
That is basically fully independent and doesn't actually need access to the rest of the world
This level of control is pretty mind-boggling and it gives the Chinese government an incredible amount of control over both their population
And their economy and as you might expect a lot of other countries have looked at this system and said yeah
Maybe we should replicate that there are now dozens of countries following in China's footsteps trying to establish a
Splinter net often with the help of China of course and a sort of playbook with three distinct levels of splintering has emerged over time
The most basic type of control that governments typically gravitate to in order to exert control over their internet is a blackout
Where internet service providers are simply ordered to shut their services down temporarily during politically sensitive periods
Iran for example ordered its first full country-wide internet blackout in
2009 during major anti-government protests which allowed the country to violently crack down on protestors while limiting their options to
Organize at home and also to ask for help from the outside
Cutting them off from the rest of the world completely and in 2021
34 countries in total pushed similar blackouts through in
182 separate instances to crack down on protests
India alone staggeringly accounted for more than a hundred different regional blackouts during this year
Well, Ethiopia is winning the dubious title of the longest blackout at 18 months and counting
These blackouts require no skill and no special equipment
So they're the most common way for governments to start cutting their population off from the rest of the world
At least from the rest of the internet
But they are of course blunt instruments because they don't just hurt the protesters
But basically everyone in their vicinity
So a lot of countries have started wanting to get much more fine-grained abilities to target who they want to block and when
9 out of 10 protesters in Egypt and Tunisia that were polled during the Arab Spring in
2010 claimed that they used Facebook to organize protests and to spread awareness and
Protests clearly spilled from one country over to another via the internet as well
Eventually engulfing the whole region blocking such services as Facebook and information from abroad in general
Has therefore become a high priority for many governments around the world fearing protests
But those governments have also seen that many of the protests went on for years
So temporary blackouts were clearly not a good enough solution
Governments didn't just want a simple off switch for the internet
They wanted the ability to permanently filter specific parts of the internet while the rest of it could stay up and running
And they wanted to keep those on for long periods of time and they found a couple of ways of achieving this
At the simplest level governments often just order companies to take down content like how India ordered the removal of
Hundreds of Chinese apps from mobile app stores or how governments like Russia and Turkey
Routinely ask companies like Google to hide certain videos and search results in their countries
Companies can simply refuse to honor these requests, especially if they're from abroad
So these are hardly bulletproof solutions, but they require basically no technical skill or equipment or anything at all
So they remain popular
However, lots of governments have also started moving towards acquiring technical capabilities to enforce some of their filters
There are simple technical enforcements like the Indian government simply ordering to block the IP addresses of certain websites
Like the VLC media player for some bizarre reason
Which are pretty easy to get around for anyone with even the most minimal amount of motivation
Or there are also more sophisticated methods like a deep packet inspection for example
With DPI internet service providers actually start analyzing and filtering the
Individual data packets that flow through their networks in real time and they try to figure out their recipients and their content
So they can block those based on government orders
And this kind of filtering is both much harder for users to get around and also harder for governments to implement
Especially with VPNs and encryption and other privacy technologies increasingly making their jobs harder
Proper DPI requires analyzing and filtering and processing all the data that flows through a country's internet in real time
It requires specialized routers specialized software specialized skills
So this is hardly a trivial thing to do at all
But thankfully for I guess thankfully for authoritarian governments
They don't actually have to do most of the heavy lifting themselves
Companies like Amesis from France were happy enough to sell their deep packet inspection technologies to Libya's
Authoritarian leader Muhammad Gaddafi before his death
Cisco from the US gladly supplied Indonesia's network operators with monitoring technologies for example
And of course the US and other Western nations together with their technological suppliers do plenty of network monitoring at home and abroad as well
And while titan sanctions have mostly stopped Western exports to some of the most authoritarian countries lately
China has made it their official government policy to expand on these exports and to fill those gaps next to roads and bridges and ports
Etc. China's flagship belt and road initiative explicitly aims to build telecom infrastructure in developing nations
Most of Africa for example has had their networks build financed and partially operated by Huawei and ZTE in what experts call a
Chinese telecommunications war in Africa
And you might also remember Chinese telecom giant ZTE
Repeatedly clashing with US regulators over providing telecom monitoring equipment to sanctioned Iran as well
What exactly China builds into their exports is really hard to say from public sources
But the working theory is that government can basically order a convenient package of hardware like routers and switches and radios and whatever
Together with all the monitoring tech as well all from China even financed by China
And so it's likely that we're gonna see a lot more of these content filtering systems in more and more countries in the future
Impact is today from what I can tell only Russia Iran and Turkey have so far demonstrated a strong real-world
capabilities in permanently blocking undesired services in sophisticated ways
Including even the ability to block some VPN providers and filter out individual text messages
For example, in New York countries like Indonesia, Malaysia and Egypt have pushed through more temporary filters using similar techniques
Though again many more are expected in the future
Beyond just filtering though the kind of end goal for many governments around the world
The dream state that they'd like to be in is to kind of replicate what China has which is to not just have the ability to
Individually block out things from abroad but rather to have a domestic internet that is fully independent from the rest
That if they want they can completely isolate
Iran for example calls their efforts the national information network and Russia calls theirs
Runet and such systems consist of two basic building blocks first
The government must be in control of all cross-border exchange points
So it can stop traffic flowing through them if it wants to and second
It must make sure that there are a number of domestic services that can continue to operate with the connections shot
This means cutting out the reliance on any foreign hosting companies, content delivery networks, APIs, plugins
Basically everything and replacing them with domestic alternatives
It means basically recreating the entire internet at home just like China has done
In 2019 Iran demonstrated their network when they successfully cut international connections
While keeping some domestic services running
These included a few banks, a few state owned or at least state adjacent messaging apps, a ride hailing app, a domestic search engine
And a few other basic services like it
This isolation was implemented during a particularly brutal set of crackdowns that killed an estimated
1,500 people
Iran fought especially hard to suppress information from spreading outside of the country
Meanwhile Russia has notably claimed to have basically the same capabilities
Saying that their core message and apps would survive an isolation event
But unlike Iran they haven't actually clearly demonstrated this capability in practice yet
Now what Iran and Russia have achieved is a far cry from the level of independence that China has built for itself
Over the last two and a half decades or so
And no other country has even gotten close to what Iran and Russia has done
And it's kind of easy to understand why
Full independence is incredibly difficult to achieve
Being independent requires nothing less than kind of mirroring what the entire rest of the internet has achieved
And keeping up with what it will build next
Each country on their own
China's own internet needed decades to become truly competitive
And only did so because of their massive domestic market
That can sustain truly world-class companies all on its own
Russia, a huge country with lots of resources, has seen some success
With payment systems like MIR, cloud services like Yandex cloud and user-facing solutions
Like VK and Mail.ru building real competitive solutions
But Russia is still far from having a full replacement for the entire internet
And meanwhile Iran's solution of keeping just a few core services like banking running during a blackout
Seems like a big achievement but also a very narrow definition of independence
There is simply no country with an economy strong and robust enough other than China and the United States
That could actually have a hope at maintaining a massive globally competitive internet ecosystem all at home
Now there is a chance that some governments will bend together to create a sort of alternative block of allied states
That share their networks with each other but not the rest of the world
Kind of like what the socialist countries did with their economies during the Cold War
But we haven't really seen that happen yet
And China, the biggest player by far that could be part of such a block
Seems very unlikely to let anyone into their internet bubble
So we'd have to wait and see how that would play out
The original inventors of the internet back in the 1960s actually calculated with mathematical certainty
The exact design that would make their networks as efficient as possible
Years before they actually got funding to build out any of our current TCP-IP based systems
We have long moved away from their original designs
