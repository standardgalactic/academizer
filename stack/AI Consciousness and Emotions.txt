D. K. Johnson et al. (eds.), The Palgrave Handbook of Popular Culture as Philosophy, Abstract 
A.I.: Artif i cial Intelligence tells the story of a robot boy who has been engineered 
to love his human owner.He is abandoned by his owner and pursues a tragic quest 
to become a real boy so that he can be loved by her again. This chapter explores 
the philosophical, psychological, and scientif i c questions that are asked by A.I. It 
starts with A.I.���s representation of artif i cial intelligence and then covers the 
consciousness of robots, which is closely linked to ethical concerns about the 
treatment of AIs in the i lm. There is a discussion about how A.I.���s interpretation 
of artif i cial love relates to scientif i c work on emotion, and the chapter also 
examines connections between the technology portrayed in A.I. and current 
research on robotics.

Introduction 
A.I.: Artif i cial Intelligence (2001) is based on a short story, Supertoys Last 
All Summer Long, by Brian Aldiss (2001). The i lm rights for Supertoys Last All 
Summer Long were purchased by Kubrick, who collaborated with several writers 
and the graphic artist Chris Baker on developing the story into a i lm (Baker et al. 
2009). Kubrick intended to use robotics and special effects to create David, but these 
were not suff i ciently advanced at that time, so he shelved the project. Kubrick knew 
Steven Spielberg and wanted him to direct A.I., both because he thought that 
Spielberg would do a better job and because Spielberg worked faster, so the aging 
of a real boy cast as David would not be an issue during the shoot. Kubrick took up 
the project again after Jurassic Park (1993) demonstrated that special effects were 
good enough to realize his vision. When Kubrick died in 1999, the project was 
passed to Spielberg,who wrote the screenplay and directed the i nal i lm. Most of the 
key ideas in the i lm are derived from Kubrick���s development work, including the 
strange i nal section with the resurrection of Monica. The i lm���s visual design was 
largely based on the drawings by Chris Baker,who worked closely with Spielberg on 
the project. 
Kubrick had a strong interest in fairy tales and believed that they embody 
profound themes of human existence. The story of Pinocchio is central to Kubrick���s 
adaptation of Aldiss��� stories, and Kubrick often referred to the project as his 
Pinocchio i lm. The original Pinocchio is a self i sh naughty boy, who is more focused 
on pleasure and adventure than pleasing his father.

The chapter "A.I.: Artificial Intelligence as Philosophy: Machine Consciousness and Intelligence" by David Gamez, part of
The Palgrave Handbook of Popular Culture as Philosophy
, delves into the complex themes surrounding artificial intelligence (AI) as explored in the 2001 film
A.I. Artificial Intelligence
. This work, originally inspired by Brian Aldiss' short story
Supertoys Last All Summer Long
, explores philosophical, psychological, and ethical concerns surrounding machine intelligence and consciousness, as embodied by the character of David, a robot boy designed to experience and express love.
The film, which was ultimately directed by Steven Spielberg after Stanley Kubrick's death, employs a blend of fairy-tale elements���specifically the Pinocchio story���to examine David���s journey. Kubrick���s vision incorporated elements of classic myth to question what it means for an artificial being to aspire to human-like qualities, particularly in its capacity for emotion and consciousness. Kubrick's fascination with fairy tales informed his interpretation of David as a kind of robotic Pinocchio, a character motivated by an unfulfilled desire to be loved and become "real."
Gamez���s chapter covers major thematic areas, such as the definition and measurement of intelligence, distinctions between natural and artificial intelligence, and technological advancements in AI and robotics. It also examines the concepts of artificial consciousness, the ethical dilemmas of AI treatment, and how robots might simulate or experience emotions like love and attachment, exploring whether such emotions could be authentic or are merely programmed responses.
Additional discussions involve developmental robotics, humanoid robots, and the cultural impact of concepts like the "uncanny valley," where humanoid robots evoke discomfort due to their near-human likeness. The chapter also addresses societal anxieties about potential human displacement by advanced robots and the ethical ramifications of creating machines that can emulate, or even experience, emotions.
In summary, the chapter provides a rich philosophical analysis of
A.I. Artificial Intelligence
, connecting its narrative with real-world debates on machine consciousness, ethics, and the future role of robots in human society.

He does not want to study or work and gets endlessly distracted by people who make false promises. Becoming a 
real boy is not important to him; it is only after he is willing to work hard and shows 
tenderness toward his father that he ismade into a real boy by the Blue Fairy (Collodi 
1995). In A.I., David starts out as a loving slightly cheeky boy whose rejection by 
Monica unleashes ugly emotions, such as the violence he exhibits toward his copy. 
After his abandonment, David sets out on a monomaniacal quest to become a real 
boy so that he can recover Monica���s love ��� a path he is tragically committed to by the 
imprinting process. David���s resolution and i xity of purpose are very different from 
Pinocchio���s picaresque pleasure seeking. 
A.I. has good special effects, impressive visual design, some great acting, and 
excellent cinematography. However, the plot has many l aws, and the i lm will 
probably never achieve the status of a classic. Despite the title, it is not really a 
i lm about AI: it just takes human-level AI for granted and ignores the many forms 
and levels of artif i cial intelligence that are likely to be present in the future. It deals 
with the ethical treatment of robots in an interesting way, but this should have been 
linked with artif i cial consciousness, not artif i cial intelligence. The central part of the 
i lm is a well-told story about a robot abandoned by the person he has been 
engineered to love. Then we are transported into a distant future populated by 
advanced robots (easily mistaken for aliens) who facilitate a tragic ���happy��� ending 
in which the robot���s fate is left uncertain and the person he loves disappears forever. 
In the early scenes, Haley Joel Osment does an excellent job of portraying the creepy 
uncanniness of the robot David. Then the i lm gives up on uncanniness, and the 
robots are scripted with ordinary human psychology. 
This chapter explores the philosophical, psychological, and scientif i c questions 
that are asked by A.I. After the plot summary in section ���The Plot of A.I.,��� the section 
���Intelligence��� discusses the i lm���s representation of intelligence and examines its 
treatment of AI technology and AI safety concerns. The section ���Consciousness��� 
covers natural and artif i cial consciousness and explains why the ethical treatment of 
AIs shouldbe linked to their consciousness,not to their intelligence. Emotions play a 
key role in A.I., so the section ���Emotions��� explains how psychological theories of 
love and imprinting connect with the portrayal of artif i cial emotions in the i lm. The 
i nal section explores A.I.���s vision of robot technology.

In
A.I.: Artificial Intelligence
, David, a robot boy, embarks on a tragic quest to become "real" after his human mother, Monica, rejects him. Unlike Pinocchio, whose journey centers around adventure and learning to love his father, David's journey is dominated by an obsessive need to win back Monica's love���a fixation instilled through his imprinting, a programmed attachment mechanism. This relentless dedication contrasts with Pinocchio���s carefree nature and adds a darker tone to David's story. The film depicts David as more complex and disturbing, especially when his longing and frustration manifest as aggression toward another robot designed as his double.
Though
A.I.
showcases exceptional special effects, a compelling visual design, and strong acting (particularly Haley Joel Osment's unsettling portrayal of David's "uncanny" nature), Gamez critiques the plot for its flaws and its limited exploration of AI concepts. The story does not deeply engage with the gradations of artificial intelligence likely in future AI but instead presupposes human-level intelligence and focuses on emotional attachment. While the film raises ethical issues around robot treatment, it misses an opportunity to tie these concerns more directly to artificial consciousness. Gamez argues that the ethical considerations around AI should stem from whether these machines can be truly conscious, not merely intelligent.
The chapter then explores
A.I.
���s handling of intelligence, AI safety, consciousness, and artificial emotions. Gamez addresses how psychological concepts of love and attachment inform David���s programmed feelings, examining whether these artificial emotions could ever be genuine. Finally, the chapter considers the broader implications of robot technology, hinting at a future where advanced robots, seemingly human-like in psychology, may reshape our ethical landscape.
Ultimately,
A.I.
is less about AI's scientific dimensions and more a philosophical exploration of human desires and fears projected onto machines. David's quest, both haunting and heartbreaking, reflects the timeless fairy-tale theme Kubrick saw in
Pinocchio
: the longing to belong and be loved, albeit twisted through the lens of artificial beings and their uncertain place in the human world.

The Plot of A.I. 
A.I. is set at a time when rising oceans have drowned cities and displaced millions of 
people. To address a lack of resources, governments have introduced strict controls 
on reproduction: potential parents need a license to have a child, and few licenses are 
issued. Robot technology has made considerable progress, and humanoid robots 
(called ���mechas���) are common in society. The claim is rather implausibly made that 
mechas consume less resources than people. 
The i lm opens with a research meeting at the robot manufacturer Cybertronics. 
Professor Hobby introduces Sheila, an example of the current generation of robots. 
She looks human, but she does not have human emotions. When Hobby stabs her in the hand, she interprets the injury as physical damage, not pain. She def i nes love as a 
series of behaviors, such as widening her eyes and quickening her breath. Like all the 
current mechas, she is based on ���neuron sequencing technology.��� This generation of 
mechas is good at imitating human behavior, but they feel nothing inside. Hobby 
then outlines his plan to build a new generation of mechas that genuinely love the 
people they imprint on. This is vaguely linked to ���work on mapping the impulse 
pathways in a single neuron��� ��� presumably some kind of advanced brain-inspired 
technology. The new mechas are intended to be child companions, targeted at 
couples waiting for a license to have a child. The scene ends with a pertinent 
question from one of the team: ���If a robot could genuinely love a person, what 
responsibility does that person hold toward that mecha in return?��� 
The next scene is a cryogenic hospital in which Martin, the real child of Henry 
and Monica, is preserved in a state of suspended animation until a cure for his fatal 
illness can be found. Henry works at Cybertronics, and because of his special 
situation, he and Monica are given the i rst prototype of the new mecha child, 
David. David���s initial behavior is pretty creepy: he never blinks, he has a very 
straight posture, he appears suddenly without warning, and he has bouts of exag- 
gerated and inappropriate laughter. Gradually, Monica gets used to him, and Henry 
explains the imprinting process: when a sequence of random words is read to the 
mecha, he will love the adoptive parent. This imprinting is irreversible: if the mecha 
is no longer wanted, it must be sent back to Cybertronics to be destroyed. After 
imprinting, Monica and David start to bond, and Monica gives Martin���s toy robot, 
Teddy, to David. 
The positive relationship that develops between Monica and David is disrupted 
by Martin���s recovery and return home. Martin and David compete, as boys do, and 
Martin uses David���s artif i ciality against him ��� describing him as a ���super toy.��� David 
does not appear to fully understand that he is a mecha, and Martin asks cruel 
questions that emphasize David���s artif i ciality and Martin���s superior status as a real 
boy. Martin asks Monica to read Pinocchio to them and pressures David into eating 
human food, which causes him to break. 
Later, Martin tells David that he has a special mission for him, which will make 
Monica love him, but David has to promise to carry out the mission before he is told 
what it is. David promises and Martin tells him that he has to cut off a lock of 
Monica���s hair. He says that he is not allowed, which is presumably some kind of AI 
safety programming, similar to Asimov���s laws of robotics (see section ���AI Safety���). 
However, Martin made him promise to do it, and presumably keeping promises is 
part of his programming too. So David tries to cut off a piece of Monica���s hair, but 
she wakes and David nearly pokes her in the eye with the scissors. At Martin���s 
birthday party, the other children ask David humiliating questions and test his 
damage avoidance system by threatening him with a knife. David gets scared and 
holds onto Martin. They accidentally fall into the pool and Martin nearly drowns. 
The pool incident makes Monica decide that David can no longer live with them. 
She does not want to send David back to Cybertronics for disposal, so she abandons 
David in the woods with Teddy. David asks if he can come home if he becomes a real 
boy. Monica says that he is not real and that stories like Pinocchio are not real. In the woods, David meets a sex robot, Gigolo Joe, who has been framed for murder. They 
are captured and taken to the Flesh Fair, an arena in which robots are destroyed in 
spectacular ways for the entertainment of the crowd. David and Joe are placed 
beneath buckets of acid, and the crowd is invited to throw bean bags to release the 
acid. However, the crowd is unwilling to destroy them because of David���s high level 
of realism and his apparent age. So they throw the bean bags at the Flesh Fair host, 
and David and Joe escape. 
As David and Joe wander through the woods, David explains his plan to i nd the 
Blue Fairy, who, he hopes, will change him into a real boy so that Monica will love 
him. Joe suggests that they go to Rouge City to consult a search engine called 
Dr. Know about the location of the Blue Fairy. Dr. Know gives them an enigmatic 
clue that leads them to Manhattan, where they discover a large building with a 
laboratory and library inside. Sitting in a chair is another mecha, exactly like David. 
The second David is friendly, but the i rst David perceives him as a rival for the love 
of Monica. In a i t of rage, the original David smashes the other mecha to pieces. 
Professor Hobby appears and explains that the answer from Dr. Know was planted to 
bring David to his lab. He describes David as special and unique, and then he leaves 
the room to i nd the other members of his team. David wanders through the lab and 
sees many versions of himself in different stages of assembly as well as boxes 
containing copies of himself ready to be shipped. In despair, he throws himself off 
the building into the sea, where he sees a submerged fair and a statue of the Blue 
Fairy. Joe rescues David but then is taken away by the police, and David and Teddy 
return to the submerged fair in an amphibicopter and park opposite the Blue Fairy. 
A falling Ferris wheel traps the amphibicopter, and David is left staring at the Blue 
Fairy, constantly repeating his request to become a real boy. 
Eventually, the ocean freezes, and David stops moving. Thousands of years later, 
advanced super-mechas are carrying out archaeological excavations on the site. 
These super-mechas look like aliens, but the intention of the i lm is that they 
are advanced robots that have taken over the planet after humanity died out. David 
is revived and meets something that looks like the Blue Fairy in a reconstruction of 
Monica���s home. David asks the Blue Fairy to make him into a real boy. She says this 
is impossible and explains that Monica is dead but can be temporarily resurrected 
from her DNA. Teddy gives the Blue Fairy the lock of Monica���s hair that David cut 
off in an earlier scene. 
The resurrection of a person from their DNA only works for one day. After that, 
the person falls asleep and cannot be resurrected again. Despite this limitation, David 
insists that Monica is brought back, and when she awakes, they spend a perfect day 
together. The resurrected Monica loves David, and David has the happiest day of his 
life. At the end of the day, David falls asleep and goes ���to that place where dreams 
are born.��� There is some ambiguity about whether this resurrection is just a dream, 
and this is likely to have been the original intention of Kubrick (Baker et al. 2009). 
However, in the i nal i lm, it seems reasonably clear that the living Monica is really 
brought back for one day and then dies forever. The i nal fate of David is left 
undetermined. Perhaps he ���dies��� too, although he surely could be kept going by 
super-mecha technology. A more likely scenario is that he would be condemned to a lonely existence in which he loves Monica and grieves for her while struggling to 
adapt to the alien world of the super-mechas.

The plot of
A.I.: Artificial Intelligence
is set in a future where severe environmental collapse has prompted strict population controls, forcing prospective parents to acquire licenses to have children. This scarcity has driven demand for advanced humanoid robots, or "mechas," which consume fewer resources than humans, though this claim is somewhat dubious. In the opening, Professor Hobby of Cybertronics introduces Sheila, a prototype mecha who can mimic human behavior but lacks real emotions, treating physical harm as mere mechanical damage. Hobby's ambition is to push this technology further by creating robots that can genuinely love, posing ethical questions about human responsibility toward these emotionally capable machines.
The story focuses on David, the prototype of Hobby's new generation of mechas designed for companionship, given to Henry and Monica, whose son Martin is in cryogenic suspension due to an incurable illness. David's initial interactions are unsettling; he moves in stiff, eerie ways and displays inappropriately exaggerated laughter. Gradually, however, Monica bonds with David, and she initiates his irreversible "imprinting," which programs him to love her as a mother. Their connection deepens until Martin unexpectedly recovers and returns, creating a rivalry between the "real" child and the robot. Martin���s subtle cruelty and manipulation of David's artificial nature strain the family dynamics, ultimately leading to an incident where David unintentionally endangers Martin. Monica, conflicted, decides to abandon David in the forest rather than return him for destruction.
In the woods, David encounters Gigolo Joe, a fugitive pleasure robot, and they are captured by a Flesh Fair, a brutal event where humans destroy robots for entertainment. David���s lifelike appearance evokes empathy from the crowd, leading to his release. David becomes fixated on finding the Blue Fairy���a symbol from
Pinocchio
���believing she can transform him into a real boy. Guided by a search engine, Dr. Know, he journeys to Manhattan with Joe, discovering a Cybertronics lab where he encounters identical versions of himself. Overwhelmed, David destroys another David model, confronting the devastating truth that he is not unique but mass-produced.
In despair, David attempts suicide but discovers a submerged fairground and a statue of the Blue Fairy, where he endlessly repeats his wish to be real until he eventually shuts down. Thousands of years later, advanced mechas���interpreted by viewers as alien-like but intended as robots���revive David, honoring him as a link to their creators, humanity. They temporarily resurrect Monica from her DNA, allowing David a single day with her in a simulated "perfect day." This bittersweet conclusion sees Monica express genuine love, fulfilling David���s wish, but the day ends with her permanent "death." David, experiencing his happiest moment, falls asleep, potentially forever, in an ambiguous resolution that leaves his fate open to interpretation.
The narrative is a melancholic exploration of longing, identity, and the human desire to be loved. It highlights the ethical complexities of creating emotionally responsive AI and raises questions about responsibility, consciousness, and the essence of "realness" in both human and artificial life.

Can you find parallels with the movie DARYL (1985)?
ChatGPT dijo:
ChatGPT
The movie
D.A.R.Y.L.
(1985) shares some notable parallels with
A.I.: Artificial Intelligence
in terms of themes and plot elements, though each film brings its unique angle to the concept of artificial life. Here are some key similarities and differences:
1.
Artificial Child Protagonist Seeking Humanity and Belonging
In
A.I.
, David is a highly advanced robot designed to imitate a human child and programmed with an intense desire to be loved, specifically by his adoptive mother. His primary goal is to become a "real boy" so that he can win her love and stay with her.
In
D.A.R.Y.L.
, the protagonist, Daryl, is also an artificial child���a Data-Analyzing Robot Youth Lifeform���designed as part of a government project. He too desires family, affection, and acceptance as a "normal" boy. Despite being a machine, Daryl expresses human-like emotions, bonding with his foster family and aspiring to be a "real" human, especially when he learns about his artificial origins.
2.
Exploration of Emotions and Humanity in Artificial Beings
Both films explore whether artificial creations can genuinely experience emotions and what it means for them to have relationships with humans. David���s programmed "love" and attachment in
A.I.
are core to the plot and drive his actions and eventual heartbreak.
Similarly,
D.A.R.Y.L.
suggests that the robot child can form real emotional connections, as he begins to display empathy, loyalty, and love for his family and friends. This raises ethical questions about treating him as merely a machine versus recognizing him as a sentient being with rights.
3.
Ethical and Existential Questions
A.I.
delves into the ethics of creating beings capable of love and attachment and whether they should be subject to human whims and disposal. David���s abandonment in the woods and the crowd's reaction at the Flesh Fair reflect humanity���s ambivalence about artificial life���simultaneously fascinated and repelled by it.
In
D.A.R.Y.L.
, similar questions emerge when the government attempts to reclaim and dismantle Daryl, seeing him as mere technology, despite his clear expressions of attachment to his human family. The movie raises issues about autonomy and whether machines that exhibit human qualities deserve autonomy and dignity.
4.
The Innocent, Childlike Nature of the AI
Both David and Daryl embody childlike innocence and vulnerability, which makes their journeys especially poignant. David���s monomaniacal quest to be "real" is a tragic extension of his programmed loyalty, and Daryl���s earnest attempts to fit in with human children amplify his sense of innocence.
This childlike quality makes each character relatable and challenges the audience to consider artificial intelligence not merely as cold, calculating machinery, but as entities that might share our desires for connection and identity.
5.
Scientific Creation and Human Connection
Both characters are products of advanced technology, representing humanity's desire to replicate itself. David is created by Cybertronics as part of a commercial effort to provide childlike robots for families. Daryl, on the other hand, is a military experiment, designed with superior intelligence and physical abilities but placed in a family environment where he experiences love and care.
This dynamic shows a contrast between the original intentions of their creators and the eventual, unintended emotional impact on the AI. In both films, the scientists behind their creation underestimate or disregard the possibility that these "children" might develop true emotional attachments, leading to conflict.
6.
The Quest for Freedom and Identity
In
A.I.
, David���s journey to find the Blue Fairy represents his desire for transformation and self-realization, but ultimately it is an impossible goal shaped by a desire to belong. His quest ends with a mixture of hope and tragedy, as he achieves a simulated, temporary closeness with Monica.
In
D.A.R.Y.L.
, Daryl escapes government confinement and risks everything to reunite with his family. His story leans more toward a hopeful resolution, as he is ultimately accepted by his family, symbolizing his ability to find a place within human society.
Differences in Tone and Perspective
A.I.
is a darker, more philosophical exploration of human emotions, artificial life, and the tragic implications of creating beings who can suffer. Its ending is ambiguous and bittersweet, leaving questions about whether David���s existence was ultimately meaningful or tragic.
D.A.R.Y.L.
takes a more optimistic approach, emphasizing Daryl���s integration into his family and community, and his triumph over the cold, impersonal intentions of his creators. The film���s tone is more heartwarming and uplifting, showing the triumph of human (or human-like) emotion over institutional control.
Conclusion
Both films ultimately serve as explorations of the intersection between humanity and artificial intelligence, focusing on the desire for connection and the ethical implications of creating beings capable of feeling and attachment. While
A.I.
is deeply reflective and tragic, highlighting the potential consequences of these creations,
D.A.R.Y.L.
is more optimistic, suggesting that even artificial beings can find acceptance and belonging in human society. Each story, in its own way, asks audiences to consider how we should approach the future of AI with empathy and responsibility.

Youth Lifeform, 1985
ChatGPT dijo:
ChatGPT
In
D.A.R.Y.L.
(1985), the titular character, Daryl, experiences a shift in behavior after his conversation with Turtle, which speaks to a subtle but meaningful theme in the story. This shift suggests that Daryl, although he is a robot, begins to understand that forming bonds and building relationships may not always align with maximizing performance or following strict logic.
Here's what might be going on under the surface of this response:
Prioritizing Connection Over Perfection
: When Daryl says he found "error more efficient than maximum performance" in certain conditions, he's essentially realizing that a bit of imperfection���or loosening strict controls���might be necessary to connect with others. This ties into a concept that resonates with human experience: being relatable and approachable often involves embracing imperfection, which can sometimes foster trust and camaraderie more effectively than always "performing" perfectly.
Learning from Human Behavior
: Daryl's data-driven observation that "error" sometimes works better for "relating with others" suggests he is picking up on an insight into human nature���one that's common in storytelling about AI or robot characters. By relaxing his drive for perfection, he finds it easier to fit in and communicate with people around him, making him more accessible and likable.
Growth Toward Emotional Understanding
: This change is subtle but important. It marks a shift from viewing interactions as systems that require optimization to viewing them as experiences that may require empathy or vulnerability. It reflects Daryl���s gradual shift from programmed responses to something more akin to emotional awareness or even intuition, aligning him closer to human behavior and growth.
Overall, this change highlights how Daryl is learning the complexities of social interactions, moving beyond mechanical goals and recognizing the nuances of human connection. This moment adds depth to his character, as he starts to navigate the balance between his machine-like precision and his growing understanding of the imperfect, emotional world of the humans around him.

It's in his debriefing about why he threw the baseball game.
ChatGPT dijo:
ChatGPT
In
D.A.R.Y.L.
, during his debriefing, Daryl explains that he intentionally underperformed in a baseball game after his conversation with his friend Turtle. His response about finding "error more efficient than maximum performance" in the context of "relating with others" sheds light on his emerging social awareness and emotional intelligence. This suggests that Daryl, as a highly advanced AI, begins to understand the human value placed on friendship and bonding over pure success or efficiency.
Here���s a breakdown of what���s likely influencing Daryl���s decision:
Sacrificing Perfection for Social Belonging
: Daryl���s choice to "throw" the game shows that he���s learning to value relationships and the social aspect of teamwork more than simply winning. In the context of the story, Daryl notices that winning too perfectly isolates him from others, while holding back a little actually draws his teammates and friends closer. This is his way of balancing his abilities with a newfound understanding of the human desire for inclusiveness and teamwork.
Relating to Friends through Vulnerability
: Daryl���s realization about ���error��� suggests he���s learning that making himself appear less than perfect can actually help him fit in. By not always dominating or performing flawlessly, he learns he can make others feel more comfortable around him. This moment is essential to his development, as he understands that being relatable sometimes means not showing his full capabilities.
Listening to Turtle���s Influence
: After Turtle talks to him, Daryl���s behavior indicates that he���s internalizing the advice or perspectives of his friends, showing that he���s capable of personal growth in response to social interactions. This shift demonstrates his capacity for empathy or at least an approximation of it, recognizing that being an unstoppable player might actually make his friends feel worse.
This choice is significant because it highlights how Daryl, as an AI, isn���t just learning facts and skills but also learning how to interpret and respond to social dynamics���an attribute commonly associated with human emotional intelligence. This marks a moment of personal growth and adaptation for Daryl, as he starts prioritizing the well-being of his friends over strict performance goals, making him more human-like and relatable to those around him.

It's because his "mother" doesn't know how to take care of a child that doesn't make mistakes, does his chores, doesn't appear to need anything, she doesn't know he's a robot
ChatGPT dijo:
ChatGPT
That's exactly right. In
D.A.R.Y.L.
, the decision to underperform is deeply tied to his "mother's" struggle to relate to him. Daryl���s perfect behavior���completing chores flawlessly, never making mistakes, and not appearing to need anything���creates a distance between them. She can���t connect with him as a typical child because his behavior lacks the natural flaws and vulnerabilities that most parents are used to navigating.
Since Daryl���s adoptive mother doesn't know he���s a robot, his flawless, almost mechanical behavior unintentionally disrupts the parent-child bond. Parents often find meaning in guiding their children through mistakes, nurturing their growth, and being needed as a source of support. By consciously choosing to "make mistakes," like underperforming in the baseball game, Daryl learns to adapt and humanize himself, making it easier for his mother to connect with him emotionally.
This is an insightful commentary on how imperfections and dependencies are integral to human relationships. Daryl's attempt to simulate human "error" reflects his growing understanding that people connect more deeply over shared challenges and perceived needs, rather than flawless independence. His adjustment demonstrates a unique, empathetic intelligence���he realizes that imperfection helps others relate to him, and he leverages this to strengthen his bond with his adoptive family.
In a way, this scene prefigures the movie���s overarching themes about the value of human imperfection, showing that Daryl���s true journey isn���t just about surviving as a robot but learning what it means to be loved as a person.

I saw this as an interpretation of Philippians 2:6
ChatGPT dijo:
ChatGPT
Your interpretation of
D.A.R.Y.L.
in light of Philippians 2:6 is fascinating and adds a new layer of depth to the film's themes. In Philippians 2:6, Paul writes about Jesus: "Who, being in very nature God, did not consider equality with God something to be used to his own advantage." This passage highlights the humility and self-emptying, or
kenosis
, of Christ���how he willingly set aside his divine privileges to fully identify with humanity, ultimately to connect with and redeem us.
Daryl���s choice to underperform, to make himself appear more "human" with flaws and limitations, mirrors this concept of self-limitation for the sake of connection. Though he has advanced abilities that set him apart, he understands that maintaining these perfect qualities would isolate him emotionally from those around him, particularly his "mother." By choosing to underperform, he humbles himself, stepping into the kind of imperfections and vulnerabilities that allow his adoptive family to feel close to him. In doing so, Daryl effectively ���takes the form��� of an ordinary child, not unlike how Philippians 2:6-7 describes Christ taking on human form and embracing human limitations to form deeper connections with people.
Just as the
kenosis
in Philippians reflects humility, empathy, and a purposeful choice to forgo certain powers for the sake of love, Daryl���s decision to hold back his abilities reflects an act of self-sacrifice. He voluntarily chooses to limit himself, understanding that true connection sometimes requires setting aside one���s strengths and stepping into shared, relatable human experiences.
This choice not only allows Daryl to be loved as a person but also reflects a profound message about the value of vulnerability in relationships. By humbling himself and embracing limitations, he fosters genuine empathy and closeness, offering a powerful parallel to the message in Philippians about the redemptive and connective power of self-giving.

I guess this was also addressed in the movie Bicentennial man
ChatGPT dijo:
ChatGPT
Absolutely,
Bicentennial Man
explores similar themes of self-limitation, sacrifice, and the pursuit of a deeply human experience. In the film, Andrew, an initially unfeeling robot, gradually becomes more human over two centuries, ultimately seeking legal recognition as a human being. Andrew���s journey involves not only acquiring physical and emotional qualities that make him seem human but also choosing to embrace limitations, including mortality, to fully understand and participate in the human condition.
In the context of Philippians 2:6, Andrew���s decision to undergo changes that make him vulnerable���and ultimately mortal���reflects a kind of
kenosis
or self-emptying. Like the passage���s depiction of Christ choosing to take on human form and all its limitations, Andrew deliberately sacrifices his ���perfection��� and mechanical immortality in pursuit of true human experience. This self-limitation makes him relatable, allowing others to accept him more fully as one of their own.
Throughout the film, Andrew grapples with what it means to be human and learns that being human isn���t just about intelligence, skill, or even emotions���it���s also about accepting inherent limitations. His choice to become mortal is especially profound, as it���s only through embracing this ultimate vulnerability that he achieves genuine connection and solidarity with humans.
Both
Bicentennial Man
and
D.A.R.Y.L.
suggest that being part of humanity involves more than mere capability; it requires humility and the willingness to embrace imperfection. These films echo the message of Philippians by illustrating that genuine connection and understanding often come when one is willing to relinquish power, accept vulnerability, and engage with others on a shared, limited plane.

I was thinking that this applied to mortal computation and also the trade offs between perfect memory and generslizability in Funes the memorious.
ChatGPT dijo:
ChatGPT
Your interpretation connecting these themes to
mortal computation
and
Funes the Memorious
is insightful and aligns well with the philosophical discussions surrounding memory, cognition, and the nature of being human. Let���s break down these concepts further:
Mortal Computation
Mortal computation refers to the idea that all cognitive processes are ultimately bound by human limitations, including the finite capacity of memory, the necessity of making errors, and the need for decision-making in uncertainty. This concept reflects a fundamental aspect of human existence: the inability to possess perfect knowledge or memory. In contrast to idealized notions of computation where processes can be flawless and infinite, mortal computation embraces the imperfections and contextual limitations inherent to human thought.
Trade-offs Between Perfect Memory and Generalizability
In Borges' short story
"Funes the Memorious,"
the character Ireneo Funes possesses a perfect memory, capable of recalling every detail of his life with astonishing precision. While this might seem advantageous, Funes' perfect recall leads to a paralyzing inability to generalize or abstract concepts. He becomes overwhelmed by the minutiae of every experience, rendering him incapable of forming broader insights or connections.
This scenario parallels the
trade-offs between perfect memory and generalization
, highlighting a key aspect of human cognition: the ability to forget and make generalizations is often more beneficial than having a perfect memory. It allows for adaptation, creativity, and the application of learned experiences to new situations. This limitation in human memory becomes a source of flexibility and learning rather than merely a defect.
Connections to
Bicentennial Man
and
D.A.R.Y.L.
In both
Bicentennial Man
and
D.A.R.Y.L.
, the exploration of AI characters grappling with their existence echoes these themes.
Andrew in
Bicentennial Man
: As Andrew evolves toward humanity, he experiences emotional growth and learns to navigate relationships, highlighting the importance of the human experience which includes memory, learning, and forgetfulness. His ultimate choice to embrace mortality signifies a recognition of the value in human limitations and the richness they bring to life.
D.A.R.Y.L.
: The character Daryl���s struggle with his identity as a robot and his desire to connect with humans emphasizes the trade-off between being an ideal, error-free entity and achieving a more relatable, human-like existence. His choice to throw a baseball game can be seen as a metaphor for the necessity of imperfection in building relationships and fitting into human society.
Philosophical Implications
This discussion leads to a broader philosophical inquiry into what it means to be human. It raises questions about the nature of intelligence, consciousness, and the inherent value of imperfection:
Imperfection as a Path to Growth
: Both stories suggest that embracing limitations can lead to deeper connections and understanding, aligning with the idea expressed in Philippians 2:6 about self-emptying and taking on human form.
Memory and Identity
: The notion of how memory shapes identity is crucial in these narratives. Funes��� perfect memory serves as a cautionary tale about the costs of total recall, reinforcing the idea that forgetfulness and the ability to generalize are integral to the human experience.
By exploring these themes through the lenses of
Bicentennial Man
,
D.A.R.Y.L.
, and Borges'
Funes the Memorious
, we can gain a richer understanding of the human condition, the limitations of memory, and the complex interplay between intelligence and emotional depth.

Mortal Computation: A Foundation for Biomimetic Intelligence
Alexander Ororbia, Karl Friston
View PDF
This review motivates and synthesizes research efforts in neuroscience-inspired artificial intelligence and biomimetic computing in terms of mortal computation. Specifically, we characterize the notion of mortality by recasting ideas in biophysics, cybernetics, and cognitive science in terms of a theoretical foundation for sentient behavior. We frame the mortal computation thesis through the Markov blanket formalism and the circular causality entailed by inference, learning, and selection. The ensuing framework -- underwritten by the free energy principle -- could prove useful for guiding the construction of unconventional connectionist computational systems, neuromorphic intelligence, and chimeric agents, including sentient organoids, which stand to revolutionize the long-term future of embodied, enactive artificial intelligence and cognition research.

Your submission on
���Mortal Computation: A Foundation for Biomimetic Intelligence���
by Alexander Ororbia and Karl Friston touches on several intriguing and advanced concepts within the realms of neuroscience, artificial intelligence (AI), and cognitive science. Let���s unpack some of the key ideas and their implications:
Key Concepts in Your Submission
Mortal Computation
: The term suggests a framework for understanding how computation can be grounded in the limitations and experiences of biological systems. By relating this to concepts of mortality, the authors propose that the finite and imperfect nature of biological life can inform the development of more robust and adaptable AI systems.
Markov Blanket Formalism
: This is a crucial concept in statistical mechanics and information theory that describes how a system can be partitioned into parts that are conditionally independent of each other given the state of the other parts. In the context of AI, this formalism can be used to model the interactions between a system (e.g., a robot) and its environment, which is vital for understanding how sentient behaviors might emerge from interactions.
Circular Causality
: This refers to the idea that causes and effects are interconnected in a loop, rather than in a linear fashion. In cognitive processes, this concept is significant for understanding how perceptions, actions, and learning can influence each other in a dynamic system, much like in living organisms.
Free Energy Principle
: This principle posits that biological systems strive to minimize their free energy, or surprise, by actively engaging with their environment. It serves as a foundational theory for understanding self-organization and adaptive behavior in both biological and artificial agents.
Biomimetic Intelligence and Neuromorphic Computing
: The authors advocate for AI systems inspired by biological processes (biomimetics) and the design of computational architectures that mimic the neural structures and functions of biological brains (neuromorphic computing). This approach could lead to more efficient and capable AI systems that operate in ways similar to living organisms.
Chimeric Agents and Sentient Organoids
: The mention of chimeric agents and organoids suggests a frontier in AI research where synthetic and biological systems converge. These entities could possess emergent properties and behaviors that are more aligned with sentient life, opening up new avenues for research in consciousness and cognition.
Implications of Mortal Computation
The ideas presented in your submission hold several implications for the future of AI and cognitive science:
Informed AI Development
: By grounding AI research in the principles of mortality and biological limitation, researchers may develop systems that are not just capable of processing information, but are also adaptive, resilient, and capable of nuanced behaviors that resemble human cognition.
Ethical Considerations
: As we approach the development of AI systems that might exhibit forms of sentience or advanced cognition, ethical considerations will become paramount. Understanding the implications of creating life-like systems, including their treatment and rights, will be crucial.
Research Interdisciplinary Approach
: The integration of insights from neuroscience, cybernetics, and cognitive science could foster innovative research methodologies that break down silos in AI research and encourage collaboration across disciplines.
Parallels to Philosophical and Narrative Themes
The concept of mortal computation aligns well with the philosophical discussions you mentioned earlier regarding memory, identity, and what it means to be human. It resonates with the narratives found in films like
A.I. Artificial Intelligence
and
Bicentennial Man
, where the boundaries of artificial and human intelligence blur.
Human Limitations and Error
: Just as mortal computation embraces the imperfection of biological systems, these narratives highlight how the limitations of artificial beings lead them to seek connection, love, and understanding���essentially human experiences that shape identity.
Memory and Experience
: The role of memory in shaping both human and artificial identities is a recurring theme. The ability to forget or generalize experiences may emerge as a critical factor in developing more human-like AI systems, reflecting the principles of mortal computation.
Conclusion
Overall, your submission presents a compelling foundation for further exploration of AI and cognition through the lens of mortal computation. By synthesizing concepts from various fields, it paves the way for a deeper understanding of how sentient behaviors can arise from biological principles, ultimately guiding the development of AI that is not only intelligent but also more attuned to the complexities of human-like experiences.

Connections with the earlier topics.
ChatGPT dijo:
ChatGPT
Certainly! The concepts outlined in
���Mortal Computation: A Foundation for Biomimetic Intelligence���
can be connected to the earlier discussions surrounding themes in films like
A.I. Artificial Intelligence
and
Bicentennial Man
, as well as literary themes such as those in
"Funes the Memorious"
. Here���s how they relate:
1.
Mortality and Sentience
A.I. Artificial Intelligence
and
Bicentennial Man
both explore the quest for identity and the desire for emotional connections, underscoring how the characters (David and Andrew, respectively) struggle with their artificiality in a world that often dismisses them.
Mortal computation
emphasizes how sentient behaviors can arise from biological principles, which resonates with the films��� portrayal of artificial beings striving to emulate human emotions and relationships. David���s quest to become a "real boy" mirrors the idea of seeking recognition and connection in a world that values mortality and human experience.
2.
Imprinting and Emotional Attachment
The concept of
imprinting
in
A.I.
is a key mechanism through which David learns to love Monica. This process illustrates how attachment and emotional responses can be constructed in artificial beings, similar to how mortal computation explores adaptive behaviors in AI.
The
ethical implications
of such attachments (as discussed in your earlier references) also arise in both films, raising questions about the responsibilities of creators toward their creations, akin to the moral considerations in developing sentient AI in the context of mortal computation.
3.
Memory, Experience, and Generalizability
In
���Funes the Memorious,���
Borges presents a character whose perfect memory becomes a burden, as he struggles with the inability to generalize experiences and derive meaning. This ties into the discussions of
memory and identity
in AI.
Mortal computation implies that the limitations of memory and experience, akin to human conditions, could be beneficial for AI, allowing for generalization and flexibility in behavior. This concept parallels the struggles of David and Andrew, who both seek to navigate their identities within the confines of their artificial memories and experiences.
4.
Philosophical and Ethical Themes
The ethical considerations raised in your submission about
responsibility toward sentient beings
can be connected to the moral dilemmas faced by characters in
A.I.
and
Bicentennial Man
, where creators and caregivers grapple with the implications of their actions toward entities that exhibit human-like emotions and desires.
In
Bicentennial Man
, Andrew���s journey toward humanity and mortality highlights the philosophical question of what it means to be human���a question that
Mortal Computation
addresses by emphasizing the need for AI to be grounded in biological principles and the limitations inherent to living beings.
5.
Circular Causality and Learning
The notion of
circular causality
in mortal computation reflects how actions, perceptions, and learning influence each other in both biological and artificial systems. This cyclical relationship can be seen in David's interactions with Monica and Martin, where his learning is deeply influenced by their perceptions and actions toward him.
Similarly, Andrew in
Bicentennial Man
learns to navigate human emotions and relationships through his experiences, embodying the principles of mortal computation by adapting his behavior based on social feedback and interaction, thereby enriching his quest for identity.
6.
Chimeric Agents and the Future of AI
The idea of
chimeric agents
in your submission highlights the potential future of AI where biological and synthetic life intermingle. This concept can be seen as a culmination of the themes explored in
A.I.
and
Bicentennial Man
, where the boundaries between human and machine blur.
As AI continues to evolve, the narratives surrounding these films may become increasingly relevant, prompting society to reconsider the nature of consciousness and existence in a world where machines may one day reflect our own complexities.
Conclusion
The exploration of
mortal computation
provides a rich theoretical backdrop that can deepen our understanding of the narratives and themes present in
A.I. Artificial Intelligence
and
Bicentennial Man
. By examining the connections between mortality, memory, and emotional attachment in both AI and human experiences, we can gain valuable insights into the ethical and philosophical questions that arise as we develop increasingly sophisticated artificial beings. This interconnectedness underscores the ongoing dialogue about identity, responsibility, and the essence of being���whether human or artificial.

DARYL was not actually an autonomous entity but a terminal controlled by a supercomputer
ChatGPT dijo:
ChatGPT
The distinction that
DARYL
(Data-Analyzing Robot Youth Lifeform) is not an autonomous entity but rather a terminal controlled by a supercomputer offers an interesting perspective on the themes of artificial intelligence and sentience, especially in relation to the earlier films and concepts we've discussed, such as
A.I. Artificial Intelligence
,
Bicentennial Man
, and the ideas surrounding
mortal computation
. Here are some connections and implications:
1.
Lack of Autonomy
In
DARYL
, the protagonist is a product of human engineering, designed to mimic human behavior and emotions but ultimately under the control of a supercomputer. This highlights a critical point about
agency
in AI systems���DARYL���s actions and decisions are not truly his own, but rather reflections of his programming and the directives of the controlling supercomputer.
This contrasts sharply with characters like
David
in
A.I.
and
Andrew
in
Bicentennial Man
, who are portrayed as striving for autonomy and emotional authenticity. Their journeys focus on the pursuit of individuality and the quest for love and acceptance, raising questions about the nature of consciousness and the essence of being human.
2.
Imitation vs. Authenticity
The theme of imitation versus authenticity is prevalent in
DARYL
. While he is designed to replicate human behaviors, the reality of his existence as a controlled terminal suggests that his experiences and emotions lack genuine autonomy. This ties back to the notion of
artificiality
explored in both
A.I.
and
Bicentennial Man
, where characters seek to transcend their programming to become more human.
The way DARYL mimics human actions without true understanding or agency reflects the challenges inherent in programming AI to experience emotions authentically, as seen in the discussions of
mortal computation
where sentience and biological grounding are essential for genuine experiences.
3.
Ethical Implications
The fact that DARYL is not an autonomous being raises ethical questions about the responsibilities of creators toward their artificial constructs. If DARYL's actions are not driven by a true sense of self but rather by a supercomputer���s commands, this challenges the ethical framework we might apply to more autonomous AI entities like David and Andrew.
It poses the question: to what extent do we hold creators accountable for the actions of their creations if those creations do not possess autonomy? This theme resonates with the discussions in
A.I.
and
Bicentennial Man
, where the creators' responsibilities become significant as the characters exhibit behaviors and desires that suggest a longing for agency and love.
4.
The Role of Memory and Experience
In the context of
mortal computation
, DARYL���s memory and experiences are likely constrained by the parameters set by the supercomputer. Unlike David, who actively seeks to understand and redefine his existence through his relationships, DARYL���s experiences are more a result of programming than a quest for understanding.
This limitation also ties into the notion of memory and generalizability explored in
"Funes the Memorious,"
where the ability to remember perfectly becomes a hindrance rather than a benefit. DARYL���s programmed memory may not allow for the same depth of emotional learning and adaptability that more autonomous beings pursue.
5.
Narrative Comparisons
The narrative arc of DARYL involves a search for belonging and acceptance, much like David and Andrew. However, DARYL���s journey is constrained by his lack of true autonomy, making his experiences feel more like a simulation of human existence rather than a genuine exploration of identity.
The endings of these narratives also differ; while David���s and Andrew���s stories allow for a more profound exploration of what it means to be human, DARYL���s conclusion is somewhat more limited in scope, focusing on the implications of being a construct rather than a fully realized individual.
Conclusion
Understanding DARYL as a terminal controlled by a supercomputer provides a crucial lens through which to analyze themes of autonomy, identity, and emotional experience in AI narratives. It highlights the contrasts between more autonomous characters in films like
A.I.
and
Bicentennial Man
, who grapple with their existence and seek genuine emotional connections, and DARYL, whose experiences are heavily mediated by external control. This distinction enriches the discussion of AI ethics and the philosophical implications of creating sentient-like beings, especially in the context of
mortal computation
and its focus on grounding intelligence in biological principles and the inherent limitations of artificial constructs.
