Introduction
Artificial intelligence (AI) is increasingly applied across all sectors utilizing information technology and is expected to be one of the main economic drivers. A consequence of this trend is that certain applications can give rise to societal challenges over the coming years.
This document intends to help organizations responsibly perform their role with respect to AI systems (e.g. to use, develop, monitor or provide products or services that utilize AI). AI potentially raises specific considerations such as:
��� The use of AI for automatic decision-making, sometimes in a non-transparent and non-explainable way, can require specific management beyond the management of classical IT systems.
��� The use of data analysis, insight and machine learning, rather than human-coded logic to design systems, both increases the application opportunities for AI systems and changes the way that such systems are developed, justified and deployed.
��� AI systems that perform continuous learning change their behaviour during use. They require special consideration to ensure their responsible use continues with changing behaviour.
This document provides requirements for establishing, implementing, maintaining and continually improving an AI management system within the context of an organization. Organizations are expected to focus their application of requirements on features that are unique to AI. Certain features of AI, such as the ability to continuously learn and improve or a lack of transparency or explainability, can warrant different safeguards if they raise additional concerns compared to how the task would traditionally be performed. The adoption of an AI management system to extend the existing management structures is a strategic decision for an organization.
The organization���s needs and objectives, processes, size and structure as well as the expectations of various interested parties influence the establishment and implementation of the AI management system. Another set of factors that influence the establishment and implementation of the AI management system are the many use cases for AI and the need to strike the appropriate balance between governance mechanisms and innovation. Organizations can elect to apply these requirements using a risk-based approach to ensure that the appropriate level of control is applied for the particular AI use cases, services or products within the organization���s scope. All these influencing factors are expected to change and be reviewed from time to time.
The AI management system should be integrated with the organization���s processes and overall management structure. Specific issues related to AI should be considered in the design of processes, information systems and controls. Crucial examples of such management processes are:
��� determination of organizational objectives, involvement of interested parties and organizational policy;
��� management of risks and opportunities;
��� processes for the management of concerns related to the trustworthiness of AI systems such as security, safety, fairness, transparency, data quality and quality of AI systems throughout their life cycle;
��� processes for the management of suppliers, partners and third parties that provide or develop AI systems for the organization.

equality
		relation between two entities a and b having the following properties:
reflexivity: a = a,
symmetry: if a = b then b = a,
transitivity: if a = b and b = c then a = c, where c is a third entity,
if a = b and ���{u} is any statement involving the entity u, then ���{a} is true if and only if ���{b} is true
Note 1 to entry: The equality of two entities a and b is denoted by a = b and expressed by "a is equal to b".
ChatGPT
ChatGPT
The definition provided explains the concept of equality between two entities, denoted as "a" and "b." This concept has several properties:
Reflexivity
: This property states that any entity "a" is always equal to itself. In mathematical terms, it is represented as "a = a." This means that an entity is always equal to itself.
Symmetry
: Symmetry means that if entity "a" is equal to entity "b," then entity "b" is also equal to entity "a." In mathematical terms, it is expressed as "if a = b, then b = a." Equality is a symmetric relationship.
Transitivity
: Transitivity means that if entity "a" is equal to entity "b," and entity "b" is equal to entity "c," then entity "a" is also equal to entity "c." In mathematical terms, it is represented as "if a = b and b = c, then a = c." This property ensures that equality forms a transitive relationship.
Substitution
: This property states that if entity "a" is equal to entity "b," and there is any statement ���{u} involving another entity "u," then the statement ���{a} is true if and only if the statement ���{b} is true. In other words, if two entities are equal, they can be substituted for each other in statements or equations without changing the truth value of those statements.
These properties of equality are fundamental principles in mathematics and logic, ensuring that equality is well-defined and behaves consistently. The notation used to express equality is "a = b," indicating that entity "a" is equal to entity "b."
You
set
		collection of distinguishable entities such that for any entity it is determined without ambiguity whether it belongs to the collection or not
Note 1 to entry: The concept of set is a primitive concept in mathematics.
ChatGPT
ChatGPT
The definition provided explains the concept of a "set" in mathematics:
A
set
is a collection of distinguishable entities in which, for any given entity, it can be determined without ambiguity whether it belongs to the collection or not.
Key points in this definition:
Collection of Entities
: A set is essentially a group or collection of individual entities or elements. These elements can be numbers, objects, symbols, or anything that can be clearly defined.
Distinguishable Entities
: Each entity within a set is unique and distinguishable from the others. In a set of numbers, for example, each number is distinct from the others.
Determining Membership
: One of the defining characteristics of a set is that for any given entity or element, it can be unequivocally determined whether it belongs to the set or not. In other words, it is clear whether a particular entity is a member of the set or not.
This concept of a "set" is foundational in mathematics and forms the basis for various mathematical operations, theories, and structures. Sets are often represented using braces {} and a list of their elements, such as {1, 2, 3}, which represents a set containing the numbers 1, 2, and 3. Sets play a fundamental role in various branches of mathematics, including set theory, algebra, and calculus.

element of a set
element
		entity belonging to a given set
Note 1 to entry: The notation x ��� A expresses that the entity x is an element of the set A. The notation x ��� A expresses that the entity x is not an element of the set A. Another wording is "x belongs to A" or "x does not belong
ChatGPT
ChatGPT
The definitions provided explain the concept of an "element" of a set:
Element of a Set
:
An element of a set is an entity that belongs to a given set. It is a member or part of that set.
Key points in these definitions:
Entity in a Set
: An element is an individual entity or item that is part of a particular set. The set can consist of one or more elements.
Membership Relation
: The notation "x ��� A" is used to express that the entity "x" is an element of the set "A." This notation indicates that "x" belongs to the set "A."
Non-Membership Relation
: Conversely, the notation "x ��� A" is used to express that the entity "x" is not an element of the set "A." This notation indicates that "x" does not belong to the set "A."
For example, if we have a set A = {1, 2, 3}, then each of the numbers 1, 2, and 3 is an element of set A. This is denoted as 1 ��� A, 2 ��� A, and 3 ��� A. If we consider another number, say 4, that is not in the set A, we express this as 4 ��� A, indicating that 4 is not an element of set A. These notations are fundamental in set theory and mathematical logic to describe the membership or non-membership of entities in sets.
You
subset
		set, the elements of which all belong to a given set
Note 1 to entry: The notationA ��� B
express that the set A is a subset of the set B. The symbol���
is sometimes used instead of���
, but this is not recommended. A is also said to be included in B.
ChatGPT
ChatGPT
The definition provided explains the concept of a "subset" in set theory:
Subset
:
A subset is a set in which all of its elements belong to a given set.
Key points in this definition:
Set with Shared Elements
: A subset is a set that contains only elements that are also elements of another given set. In other words, every element in the subset is also an element in the larger set.
Notation
: The notation "A ��� B" is used to express that the set "A" is a subset of the set "B." This notation indicates that every element in set A is also an element in set B. It means that set A is entirely contained within set B.
Symbol for Subset
: While "���" is the recommended symbol to denote a subset, "���" is sometimes used as well, but it is not the preferred notation. Both symbols indicate a subset relationship, with "���" being more inclusive, allowing for the possibility of the sets being equal, while "���" strictly denotes a proper subset, meaning that the two sets are not equal.
For example, if we have a set A = {1, 2} and a set B = {1, 2, 3}, then set A is a subset of set B, which is denoted as A ��� B. All the elements in set A (1 and 2) are also elements in set B. However, if we have a set C = {1, 2, 3} and a set D = {1, 2, 3}, both sets are equal, and we use the notation C = D to indicate that they are not only subsets but also equal sets.
You

Key points in this definition:
Subset with Distinct Elements
: A proper subset is a subset of a set in which it contains some of the elements of the given set, but not all of them.
Notation
: The notation "A ��� B" is used to express that the set "A" is a proper subset of the set "B." This notation indicates that every element in set A is also an element in set B, but A is not equal to B. It means that set A is a subset of set B, and there are elements in set B that are not in set A.
Symbol for Proper Subset
: The symbol "���" is commonly used to denote a proper subset. While "������" is sometimes used instead, it is not the recommended notation, and it should be used when "���" is used for any subset of B, whether proper or not.
For example, if we have a set A = {1, 2} and a set B = {1, 2, 3}, then set A is a proper subset of set B, which is denoted as A ��� B. All the elements in set A (1 and 2) are also elements in set B, but set B contains an additional element (3) that is not in set A. This is why A is considered a proper subset of B.

Total Order
: A total order is an order relation in which at least one of the relations "a ��� b" or "b ��� a" is true for any elements "a" and "b." In a total order, every pair of elements is comparable, and it is often denoted as "���" (less than or equal to). The usual order for real numbers is a total order because for any two real numbers "a" and "b," either "a ��� b" or "b ��� a."
Partial Order
: A partial order is an order relation in which, for at least two elements "a" and "b," neither "a ��� b" nor "b ��� a" is true. In a partial order, not all pairs of elements are comparable, and it is often denoted as "���" (less than or equal to) as well. Examples of partial orders include the divisibility relation for natural numbers (not all natural numbers are divisible by each other) and the inclusion relation for subsets of a set (not all subsets are contained in each other).
Order relations are fundamental in mathematics, especially in areas such as set theory, algebra, and discrete mathematics, where they provide a structured way to compare and order elements within sets.

square root
of a given real or complex number is any real or complex number that, when multiplied by itself, equals the given number.
Here are some key points about square roots:
For every non-zero real or complex number, there are two square roots, with one being the negative of the other. For example, for a real number "a," both "���a" and "-���a" are square roots of "a."
When dealing with non-negative real numbers, the square root is typically denoted as "���a" or "a^(1/2)," and it represents the positive square root.
When dealing with negative real numbers, the square roots are complex numbers. For example, for a negative real number "a," the two square roots are "j���(-a)" and "-j���(-a)," where "j" is the imaginary unit.
When working with complex numbers, the square roots can be expressed in terms of the modulus (magnitude) and argument (phase) of the complex number. If a complex number is represented as "c = |c|ej��," then the two square roots are "|c|^(1/2)ej(��/2)" and "|c|^(1/2)ej(��/2 + ��)," where "|c|^(1/2)" represents the positive square root of the magnitude, and the two square roots are separated by a phase shift of �� radians.

The
argument
of a non-zero complex number "c" is a real number denoted by �� and is typically restricted to the range -�� < �� ��� ��. It represents the angle that the complex number makes with the positive real axis in the complex plane when expressed in polar form.
For a complex number c = |c|ej��, where |c| is the modulus of c, "a" and "b" are real numbers (c = a + jb), and �� is the argument, the argument �� is calculated as follows:
If b ��� 0, then �� = arccos(a / |c|).
If b < 0, then �� = -arccos(a / |c|).
In both cases, the argument �� is determined using the arccosine function, and it falls within the range -�� < �� ��� ��.

A
vector space
, also known as a
linear space
, is a mathematical structure defined by a set of elements and a set of scalars (usually real or complex numbers) that satisfy specific properties. These properties include rules for addition and scalar multiplication. A vector space is characterized by the following properties:
Closure under Addition
: The sum of any two vectors (elements) in the vector space must also be an element of the vector space. In other words, if U and V are vectors in the space, then U + V is also in the space.
Associativity of Addition
: The addition operation is associative, meaning that for any vectors U, V, and W in the space, (U + V) + W = U + (V + W).
Commutativity of Addition
: The addition operation is commutative, meaning that for any vectors U and V in the space, U + V = V + U.
Existence of a Zero Vector
: There exists a special vector, often denoted as "0," called the zero vector, which serves as the neutral element for addition. For any vector U, U + 0 = U.
Existence of an Additive Inverse
: For every vector U in the space, there exists another vector, denoted as "-U" or "U," called the additive inverse or opposite of U, such that U + (-U) = 0.
Closure under Scalar Multiplication
: The product of any vector in the space by a scalar (a real or complex number) must also be an element of the space.
Distributive Properties
: Scalar multiplication distributes over vector addition and scalar addition distributes over vector scalar multiplication. Specifically:
For any vector U and scalars �� and ��, (�� + ��)U = ��U + ��U.
For any vectors U and V and scalar ��, ��(U + V) = ��U + ��V.
For any vectors U and scalar �� and ��, (����)U = ��(��U).
Scalar Identity
: Multiplying a vector by the scalar "1" (the multiplicative identity for scalars) leaves the vector unchanged: 1U = U.
Vector spaces are fundamental mathematical structures used in various areas of mathematics, physics, engineering, and computer science to describe and analyze phenomena that involve both magnitude and direction. Examples of vector spaces include Euclidean spaces (such as three-dimensional space), spaces of functions, and spaces of matrices, among others.

A
point space
, also known as an
affine space
, is a mathematical structure that extends the concept of a vector space. It is associated with a vector space and consists of a set of elements called points. In an affine space, vectors from the associated vector space are used to define the relationship between points. Affine spaces are used in geometry and other mathematical disciplines to describe properties of space that do not depend on a specific coordinate system or origin.
Here are the key properties of an affine space:
Vector Space Association
: An affine space is associated with a vector space. The vector space provides the set of vectors, and these vectors are used to define the relationships between points in the affine space.
Vector Representation
: Points in the affine space are associated with vectors from the vector space. Specifically, for any ordered pair of points A and B, there is a unique vector UAB from the vector space.
Negative Vectors
: For any two points A and B, the vector UBA is the negative of the vector UAB from the vector space, i.e., UBA = -UAB.
Vector Addition
: For any three points A, B, and C, the vector UAB added to the vector UBC equals the vector UAC from the vector space, i.e., UAB + UBC = UAC.
Translation Property
: Given a point O and a vector r from the vector space, there is a unique point P in the affine space such that UOP (the vector associated with points O and P) is equal to the vector r.
The concept of an affine space is particularly useful in geometry because it allows for the study of geometric properties and relationships that are independent of specific coordinate systems or origins. Affine spaces are used to describe properties like collinearity, parallelism, and distances between points, without relying on a fixed coordinate grid.
In practical terms, when working with affine spaces, you can think of points as locations in space, and vectors as displacements or directions between those points. This framework is essential in various fields, including computer graphics, computer-aided design, and geometry, where it provides a more flexible and coordinate-independent way of describing spatial relationships and transformations.

Here are some key properties and considerations related to subspaces:
Vector Space Subspace
: If the original space is a vector space, then a subspace is a subset of that vector space that is also a vector space. This means that it satisfies all the properties of a vector space, including closure under addition and scalar multiplication.
Point Space Subspace
: If the original space is a point space, then a subspace is a subset of that point space that is also a point space. A point space is essentially an affine space, and a subspace retains the affine structure.
Dimension
: The dimension of a subspace is the maximum number of linearly independent vectors or points that can be chosen from it. In the context of vector spaces, the dimension of a subspace is less than or equal to the dimension of the original vector space.
Proper Subspace
: A proper subspace is a subspace whose dimension is strictly less than the dimension of the original space. In other words, it is a subset that does not span the entire space.
Examples
:
In three-dimensional Euclidean space, a plane passing through the origin is a subspace because it is closed under vector addition and scalar multiplication.
In two-dimensional Euclidean space, a line passing through the origin is a subspace.
In a point space, any subset of points that retains the affine structure (properties related to collinearity, parallelism, etc.) is a subspace.
Subspaces are important in linear algebra and geometry because they allow us to study and analyze structures within larger vector spaces or point spaces. They are used to define subproblems, reduce complexity, and find solutions within the context of a larger space. Additionally, subspaces play a crucial role in understanding the fundamental concepts of linear independence, basis, and dimension in vector spaces.

ChatGPT

In mathematics, a set of vectors U���, U���, ..., Un is said to be
linearly dependent
if there exist non-zero scalar coefficients �����, �����, ..., ��n, not all equal to zero, such that a linear combination of these vectors equals zero. In other words, the vectors are linearly dependent if there is a non-trivial solution to the equation:
�����U��� + �����U��� + ... + ��nUn = 0
where at least one of the coefficients �����, �����, ..., ��n is not zero.
When a set of vectors is linearly dependent, it implies that there is some redundancy or overlap in the information they provide, and they can be expressed as linear combinations of each other. In contrast, linearly independent vectors cannot be expressed as non-trivial linear combinations of each other, and they form a basis for the vector space.
Determining whether a set of vectors is linearly dependent or independent is a fundamental concept in linear algebra and is essential for various mathematical and engineering applications, such as solving systems of linear equations, diagonalizing matrices, and finding eigenvalues and eigenvectors.

An n-dimensional vector space, often denoted as ������ (if the scalars are real numbers) or ������ (if the scalars are complex numbers), is a vector space in which there are n linearly independent vectors, but not (n + 1) linearly independent vectors.
In other words, in an n-dimensional vector space, you can find n vectors that are linearly independent, and any attempt to add another vector to the set will result in linear dependence, meaning the new vector can be expressed as a linear combination of the original n vectors.
This concept is fundamental in linear algebra and geometry, where n-dimensional vector spaces are used to represent spaces of dimension n, such as n-dimensional Euclidean space, which is familiar as three-dimensional space (�����) in everyday geometry, but can be generalized to any dimension n.

The vector product, often denoted as U��V, is a mathematical operation defined for two given vectors, U and V, in three-dimensional Euclidean space. This operation results in an axial vector (also known as a pseudovector) that is orthogonal to both U and V. The magnitude of the vector product is equal to the product of the magnitudes of the given vectors and the sine of the angle, ��, between them, and it follows a specific orientation convention (right-handed or left-handed) depending on the space orientation.
Here are the key characteristics of the vector product:
Definition:
The vector product, U��V, is an axial vector that is perpendicular to both U and V. It is determined by the following equation:
|U��V| = |U| ��� |V| ��� sin(��)
Orientation:
The orientation (right-handed or left-handed) of the resulting vector U��V depends on the chosen space orientation. This means that the direction of U��V is determined by the right-hand rule or left-hand rule, and it forms a trihedron (three-dimensional analog of a triangle) with U and V.
Calculation:
For two vectors U and V, expressed as linear combinations of unit vectors (ex, ey, ez), the vector product U��V is calculated component-wise using the following formula:
U��V = [(UyVz - UzVy)ex] + [(UzVx - UxVz)ey] + [(UxVy - UyVx)ez]
Complex Vectors:
For complex vectors U and V, you can choose between different conventions for the vector product, depending on the application. The choice may involve using U��V, U�����V, or U��V���.
Scalar Quantities:
In the context of scalar quantities associated with vectors, the vector product of two vector quantities is determined by multiplying the associated unit vectors and scalar values.
Notation:
The vector product operation is commonly denoted by a cross symbol (��) between the symbols representing the vectors, such as U��V. The use of the ��� symbol for the vector product is deprecated.
In summary, the vector product is a mathematical operation that results in an axial vector orthogonal to two given vectors, with its magnitude determined by the sine of the angle between the vectors. The orientation (right-handed or left-handed) of the resulting vector depends on the chosen space orientation and follows specific rules for determining direction.

Dependence on Linear Independence:
When the vectors in the set are linearly dependent (meaning they can be expressed as linear combinations of each other), the determinant is equal to 0.
Value for Base Vectors:
For the base vectors of the given base (e.g., unit vectors in a specific coordinate system), the determinant takes the value of 1.
Orientation:
The sign of the determinant determines whether the set of vectors and the given base have the same orientation (positive determinant) or opposite orientations (negative determinant).

If this upper bound exists, it represents the length of the curve.
In mathematical terms, for a curve defined by the position vector r = f(u) as a function of a parameter u in the interval [a, b], the length of the curve from point A to point B is calculated as the line integral:
���[A, B] |dr| = ���[a, b] |df/du| du

ChatGPT
ChatGPT
The
orientation of a curve
is a property that describes the direction in which the curve is traced as the parameter u increases. In other words, it indicates whether the curve is "moving" from one point to another in a forward or reverse direction along its path.
For example, if you have a curve described by the position vector r(u), and as u increases, the curve moves from point A to point B in a specific direction, then that direction represents the orientation of the curve. If you were to trace the curve from point A to point B, the orientation would indicate whether you are following the curve from A to B or in the opposite direction from B to A.
Orientation is a fundamental concept in curve theory, and it helps specify the directionality of the curve, which can be important in various mathematical and physical contexts.

An
oriented curve
is a curve for which one of the two possible orientations (directions) has been chosen. In mathematics, when working with curves and paths, it's often important to specify a consistent direction for traversing the curve. This choice of direction is what makes it an oriented curve.
For example, if you have a curve in space described by a parameterized vector function r(u), an orientation would specify whether you should traverse the curve from the initial point to the final point or in the reverse direction. This orientation choice is necessary when dealing with line integrals, path integrals, and other mathematical operations involving curves.

It is particularly important in physics, astronomy, and engineering when dealing with measurements related to the angular extent of objects or radiation in three-dimensional space.

Symmetry
in a Euclidean space refers to a mathematical transformation, other than the identity transformation, that preserves the distances between all pairs of points in that space. Additionally, for a transformation to be considered symmetrical, when it is composed with itself, it should yield the identity transformation.
In simpler terms, if you apply a symmetry transformation to a configuration of points in a Euclidean space, the relative distances between those points will remain the same, and if you apply the same transformation again, you will get back to the original configuration.
Symmetric
, as an adjective, describes a configuration of points in Euclidean three-dimensional space that remains unchanged when subjected to a specific symmetry transformation. Examples of such transformations include:
Symmetric by translation:
This means the configuration is periodic and repeats itself when you shift it by a certain distance.
Symmetric by rotation of 2��/n:
This implies that the configuration remains the same when you rotate it by a certain angle (2��/n radians) where n is an integer.
Symmetric by mirroring:
This indicates that the configuration remains identical when mirrored, like a reflection.
Symmetry is a fundamental concept in mathematics and has applications in various fields, including geometry, physics, and crystallography, where it helps describe the regular and repeating patterns observed in nature and the physical world.

	symmetry with respect to a point
		symmetry which associates with any point M the point M��� such that a given point O is the middle of the straight-line segment MM���
ChatGPT
ChatGPT
Central symmetry
, also known as
symmetry with respect to a point
, is a type of symmetry transformation in which every point M in a geometric configuration is associated with another point M' such that a given point O (often called the center of symmetry) lies at the midpoint of the line segment MM'.
In simpler terms, central symmetry means that if you take any point M, draw a straight line from that point through the center of symmetry O, and continue it an equal distance on the other side of O, you will arrive at the corresponding point M'. This transformation maintains equal distances from O to M and O to M', making it a central symmetry.

ChatGPT
ChatGPT
The
center of symmetry
is a point in space where a given portion of space exhibits symmetry. In other words, if there is a center of symmetry within a space, it means that you can find a point in that space such that when you perform a symmetry transformation (like reflection, rotation, or inversion) with respect to that point, the portion of space remains unchanged or invariant. This point is called the center of symmetry because it's the focal point around which the symmetry occurs.

ChatGPT
ChatGPT
Symmetry with respect to a line
is a type of symmetry where every point M is associated with another point M��� in such a way that the line segment MM��� is perpendicular to a given straight line, and the midpoint of this line segment lies on the given straight line. In other words, it's a reflection or mirror symmetry where points are mirrored across the specified line, and the line serves as the axis of reflection. This means that for every point on one side of the line, there is a corresponding point at the same distance but on the opposite side of the line, with the line segment connecting them being perpendicular to the given line.

An
axis of symmetry
is a straight line in space such that a given portion of space is unchanged or invariant when subjected to a symmetry transformation with respect to this line. In other words, if you perform a symmetry operation (such as reflection, rotation, or inversion) with respect to this axis, the object or configuration remains the same. The axis of symmetry is the line about which the object exhibits symmetry, and it plays a significant role in various geometric and physical contexts.

Symmetry with respect to a plane
, also known as
mirror symmetry
, is a type of symmetry operation that associates each point M in space with a corresponding point M' such that the line segment MM' is perpendicular to a given plane and its midpoint lies on this plane. In other words, if you perform a mirror symmetry operation with respect to the specified plane, the object or configuration remains unchanged.
A
plane of symmetry
is a specific plane in space such that a given portion of space is invariant under a symmetry transformation with respect to this plane. Objects or configurations that possess a plane of symmetry exhibit this type of symmetry, and such planes play a crucial role in determining the symmetry properties of various geometric and physical systems.

ChatGPT
ChatGPT
The
angle between a straight line and a plane
is defined as the angle between the straight line and its orthogonal projection onto the plane. This angle measures how much the line deviates from being perpendicular to the plane. It is typically measured in degrees or radians, depending on the context, and it provides information about the orientation of the line relative to the plane.

The
angle between two planes
, often referred to as the
dihedral angle
, is the angle between two straight lines that are perpendicular to the two planes, respectively. It measures how much the two planes deviate from being parallel to each other. The dihedral angle can be measured in degrees or radians and provides information about the orientation of one plane relative to the other. It is commonly encountered in geometry and engineering when dealing with intersecting or adjacent planes.
