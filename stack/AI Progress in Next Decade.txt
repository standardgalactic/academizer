AI Progress in Next Decade
As a high level summary of the main points in this post:

AI will have a very large impact, possibly in the coming decade
Rapid and continuing AI progress is a predictable consequence of the exponential increase in computation used to train AI systems, because research on "scaling laws" demonstrates that more computation leads to general improvements in capabilities. Simple extrapolations suggest AI systems will become far more capable in the next decade, possibly equaling or exceeding human level performance at most intellectual tasks. AI progress might slow or halt, but the evidence suggests it will probably continue.
The post discusses the potential impact of AI in the near future, highlighting the exponential increase in computation used to train AI systems and how this is leading to rapid progress in AI capabilities. It mentions "scaling laws" research, which suggests that increasing computation leads to general improvements in capabilities. The author suggests that simple extrapolations suggest AI systems will become far more capable in the next decade, possibly reaching or surpassing human-level performance at most intellectual tasks. While progress might slow or halt, the evidence suggests that it will likely continue.
