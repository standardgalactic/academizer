Hello everybody, today I have the distinct pleasure of speaking with Dr. Gadzad, a friend
of mine, a colleague, an early supporter of mine when those were few and far between when
all the publicity emerged initially surrounding me and the videos I made regarding Bill C-16
in Canada.
Gadzad was one of the first people to interview me and he took, I would say, a substantial
risk in doing so.
We stayed in contact since then, doing some podcasts together.
We've done each other's podcasts and we spoke together at a free speech rally in Toronto
and that's a couple of years ago now, three years ago I think, three tumultuous years
to say the least.
Gad has recently written The Parasitic Mind, how infectious ideas are killing common sense
and a number of other books as well which you can see arrayed behind him, The Consuming
Instinct, a contributor to the evolutionary basis of consumption, if I remember correctly.
No, the sole author of that one, but the other author of that one is the edited book.
Right and that's evolutionary psychology in the business sciences.
Yeah, yeah.
So we're going to talk about Gad's book today but a variety of other things too and I think
that conversation will naturally tend towards the topics that are outlined in the book in
any case.
So let's start with that.
You talk about infectious ideas, anyways I should say, it's very nice to see you Gad
and thank you very much for coming on to this podcast.
You too, Jordan, it's so nice to have you back in the public sphere.
I can speak for millions of fans, we've missed you and I'm delighted to be with you.
Well I tell you, for me it's a lifesaver man to be able to come back after being sick for
so long and to be able to jump back into doing this, I'm certainly not at my peak by any
stretch of the imagination but it's such a relief that I still have a life waiting
to be picked up and that I can ask people to come and talk to me and they will and I
can start communicating with people again.
It's literally a lifesaver and I mean that most sincerely so I really do appreciate you
coming to talk to me and I hope we get a long ways today.
There's lots of things I want to talk to you about.
You talk about infectious ideas and let's talk about that a little bit.
Your book, so I'm going to take a bit of a critical stance to begin with I think.
Your book concentrates a lot on infectious ideas on the left and of course that's been
a particular preoccupation of mine in recent years although I spent a lot of my career
dissecting infectious ideas on the right because I was very appalled as any reasonable person
would be about what happened.
I mean it's ridiculous to even have to say it but I was preoccupied in some sense by
what happened in Germany in the 1930s and the 1940s and the infectious ideas that possessed
that entire community, that entire country and the devastating consequences of that.
And so it's obviously the case that infectious ideas can emerge across the political spectrum.
Even in the moderate center but certainly on the right but your book concentrates almost
solely on the excesses, the ideological excesses of the left and I'm wondering what you think
of that as a scientist.
Sure.
It's a great point that you raise and I actually address it very early in the book where I
argue that it is absolutely not the case that it's only one side of the political aisle
that could be parasitized by bad ideas and idea pathogens.
The reason why I specifically focus on ideas stemming from the left is not because this
is a political book but rather because I operate and you've operated your entire life within
an ecosystem called academia and within the context of academia the idea pathogens that
are most likely to proliferate are those that are stemming that are being spawned by leftist
professors.
Certainly does not apply that the right could not itself be parasitized by countless other
idea pathogens.
So it's not because I was trying to take a political position but rather as any epidemiologist
would do or I call myself a parasitologist of the human mind, I happen to be focusing
on idea pathogens that are the ones that define my daily reality.
Okay, I can sympathize with that because I would say as well that as an academic I haven't
felt the pressure of right wing conspiratorial theories in relationship to my work.
But I would say this is something that has happened is that I started to talk about political
ideas because of the consequences of left wing ideological thinking in the academy.
And what happened as a consequence of that was that I was branded as you have been as
a right wing thinker, an alt-right thinker, maybe even a Nazi because I was called out
on more than one occasion and I think that might be true of you too although you make
a more, a less believable Nazi than me I would say given your background, a less plausible
Nazi let's say.
So I found that when I objected to the excesses of the left the people who sprang to my defense
tended logically enough to come from the right and there were tendrils, feelers out from
even the more radical right to see if because I was opposed to the radical left that I might
be a supporter say of the radical right and what was interesting about that to me watching
that is that you tend to think better of people when they come to your defense.
And so I noticed what would I say?
It's hard to keep your centrist bearings when you go after one side of the political equation
and you're befriended at least in part by the other or that the feelers are there.
And so I'm wondering what you think about that do you think that have you shifted more
towards the right as a consequence of opposing the radical left?
I don't think so because oftentimes people ask me you know you never espouse a particular
position about your political tribe and I answer them not to be coy or to be evasive
I tell them that's because I truly don't believe in sort of an all-encompassing label
that defines my political positions.
Many positions on which you would think oh this is a conservative position so for example
when it comes to open door policy or a a a immigration policy then you would think I'm
quote conservative when it comes to you know capital punishment for predatory serial pedophiles
I have absolutely no moral restraint in the idea of executing someone who's raped five
children that would be considered a conservative idea when it comes to social issues then you
would think of me as extremely socially liberal and quote progressive so really my own personal
tribe is one that is defined by examining each individual issue and then proposing a
position based on sort of universal foundational principles so the fact again that I criticize
largely the left says nothing about my ability to have most of my friends be leftist by me
believing in many of their positions it's simply that you know the way I like to compare it is
if I were an endocrinologist who specializes in treating diabetes it would be silly for someone
to come to me and say but wait a second Dr. Sad how come you're never exploring melanoma
don't you know that melanoma is a deadly disease well of course it is I just happen to be someone
who is studying diabetes that that doesn't state anything about the dangers of the endless other
panoply of diseases that might afflict human beings and so I think it's really very much in that
spirit that I wrote this book it's not at all that the right cannot be parasitized take for
example anti scientific reasoning oftentimes my leftist colleagues will pretend as though it is
the right who engages in anti science rhetoric now let's take a discipline that I'm in evolutionary
psychology well when it comes to the rejection of evolution it is much more likely to be people on
the right who reject evolution when it comes to evolutionary psychology in particular though
it's a lot more likely to be people on the left who reject you know evolutionary arguments for
to explain for example sex differences so it's not that one party is anti science more than the
other it's that each party has its own anti scientific lenses and myopia okay so I guess these
questions are particularly germane given what happened in washington in the last two weeks and
what still might happen in the next few days we'll see um there's I've noticed recently
among friends and family members as well as more broadly in the culture that there is a pronounced
increase in the degree to which conspiratorial theories in particular and paranoid theories
are propagating on the right I think now I don't know much about QAnon I've been out of the loop
and and I should be more on top of that but I'm not but I do know that that it's
popular and pervasive and I do know that Trump's claims to have won the election
are supported by a network of conspiratorial thinking I was speaking with Douglas Murray
about that and you tell me what you think about this this is sort of the conclusion of our discussion
was that so Trump claims that he lost or that he won the election and and actually that he
wanted by a substantial margin that's the claims as far as I've been able to understand them and
then to believe that this is what you have to believe you have to believe that the electoral
system in the United States is broken to the degree that fraud is widespread and pervasive
and of sufficient magnitude to move an election you have to believe that people as close to Trump
as Mike Pence have become part of a conspiratorial network or have been shut down by people who are
able to put sufficient pressure on him you have to believe that the judiciary in the United States
which I believe has ruled something like 60 times against his claims and one time in favor
you have to believe that it's become uncontrollably corrupt even on the Republican side even when
those Republicans were nominated by Trump or Trump's people and you have to believe that the
only person standing on moral high ground through all of this has been Trump and each of those
propositions seems to me to be have a low probability of truth and their combined probability is
infinitesimally small so but there is widespread support for Trump's claims that he that he won
the election and was robbed of it and so so someone who is looking at your book especially from a
leftist perspective would say well not only are you concentrating on the wrong side of the equation
with regards to clear and present danger but the the omission of analysis of conspiratorial
thinking on the right shows a blind spot that is of sufficient magnitude to threaten the stability
of society now not to say that you're personally responsible for that by any stretch of the
imagination but um see I've really been thinking about this because I have felt as an academic
that the greatest threat to my scientific inquiry and to my free inquiry has clear and to my students
for that matter has clearly come from the left but well but there's no doubt that conspiratorial
thinking is on the increase on the right I mean I knew that was going to happen five years ago
and that's partly the sorts of warnings that I was trying to put out that with enough cage
rattling the right was going to wake up and but well I'll let you comment on that so to go back
I guess to to to reiterate what I said earlier but in a slightly different way uh I think what
you're this the argument that you're making is that the susceptibility to believe BS there's
actually now a a psychometric scale which perhaps you're aware of that actually measures
susceptibility to BS it's actually published I think in the journal called judgment and
decision making and there's been several follow-ups of that work so really looking at
the our ability to believe nonsense using a psychometric scale all all I think that you are
demonstrating in the in the question that you're posing is that the capacity for people to think
in non-critical ways is not restricted to a political aisle the left could be anti-scientific
the right can be anti-scientific the left can succumb to idea pathogens the right can succumb
to idea pathogens in chapter six of my book I talk about a particular cognitive malady which I
coined as ostrich parasitic syndrome I think ostrich parasitic syndrome is something that
all people can succumb to by the way not only the left and the right can succumb to ostrich
parasitic syndrome being highly educated and otherwise intelligent does not inoculate you
from many of these cognitive distortions and and and you know irrational ways of thinking
so you would typically think oh well you know well professors who are in the business of you
know critically thinking would be the ones who might be immune from this and meanwhile as I
describe in the book the ones who spawn all of this nonsense are typically professors so again
to reiterate I truly don't think that it is a political statement to argue that people can
think irrationally I simply chose to focus on the left because as you said that's the world
that I inhabit that's the those the dangers come from those folks now that doesn't mean that listen
in 2017 when you and I finally appeared at that event in in Toronto I had received because of what
had happened with that journalist where she wasn't invited and so on and do you remember all that
stuff during sure faith Goldie faith Goldie I can remember where he made the extraordinarily
difficult decision to not include her on the free speech panel well right and more than that I mean
we sort of advised the organizer what our thinking was and then ultimately it was up to her since
she was the one who was organizing well by simply stating that the and the number of death threats
that I had received and I and without being able to absolutely know for sure I would predict that
based on the demographic profile of many of the people who were sending me death threats
they would have been much more on the right right so again it's not as though I am negating the
possibility that people on the right could be absolutely insane in their own unique and flowery
ways all I'm doing though in the book is I am focusing on diabetes without rejecting the fact
that melanoma could also be important so again it's really I hope that people don't read the book
as though it is a political treatise it just so happens that that's the ecosystem that I reside in
so what do you think the metaphor buys you I mean you're a biologically oriented thinker you talk
about ideas in some sense as if they're analogous to life forms and and so let's explore that metaphor
a little bit what do you think that buys you in terms of explanatory power well what it does is
it contextualizes the the fact that many people slowly walk into the abyss of infinite lunacy
in complete complicity wait so let me let me give you a couple of analogies because again
in part it's just a prose that allows me to draw a powerful analogy but I actually do think that
there are literal comparisons in using those biological metaphors so take for example the
spider wasp the spider wasp looks for a spider to sting rendering it zombified it's still alive
it then carries this much larger spider into its burrow it and then it while the spider is fully
alive but zombified it lays an egg and then the offspring will eat the spider the spider in vivo
well I argue that political correctness is akin to the spider wasps sting right it zombifies us
into being complicit in our silence leading us slowly into the burrow of infinite lunacy
so you could view it as just powerful writing rhetoric or literally the equivalent a a memetic
form equivalent of what happens in biological systems take now when I talk for example about
parasitic ideas well in neuroparasitology what you typically study is how a particular
parasite will end up making its way to the brain of its host altering its neural circuitry
so that then the host will engage in behaviors that are maladaptive to it but adaptive for the
parasite and so when I was trying to come up with a powerful way of explaining why do people hold on
and get infected by these alluring parasitic ideas I thought aha the neural parasitological
parasitological framework is the ideal framework to try to explain why otherwise supposedly
rational people could completely become parasitized by insanity right why it would be that the lgbtq
community could suddenly become in favor of queers for Palestine as that this is an actual group so
it's queers for Paris time for Palestine but down down Zionist pigs so Tel Aviv is one of the
most welcoming spots for the lgbtq community and so if I'm a member of that community
it would make rational sense for me to be supporting a system a political system a country
where I could live in safety and freedom but instead I walk around saying queers for Palestine
that sounds parasitic it sounds like the idea the framework that would cause me to say queers for
Palestine rather than yeah yeah Tel Aviv is not a good position to hold because as someone who comes
from the Middle East I could tell you that lgbtq community in Gaza or the West Bank are not usually
embraced with infinite warmth so this is why I thought that using a neural parasitological model
would be really apt in describing why we become so intoxicated with these bad ideas okay so
a parasite takes over a host so that the parasite can replicate so it has an interest in the outcome
so to speak or it acts like it has an interest in the outcome that might be a more accurate way of
thinking about it so in order for that parasite metaphor to hold true the ideas the ideas which
are acting as parasites would have to have an interest in the outcome so are you presupposing
that ideas I guess you're presupposing like Dawkins that ideas compete in a Darwinian fashion
and those that are the best at taking over their hosts are the ones that propagate
the the difference between and I of course I cite Dawkins work
the difference between say a memetic approach and the approach that I take in the book is
I guess twofold one memes can be negatively valenced they could be neutral and they can
be positively valenced right so memes a jingle if I start humming a jingle and you happen to hear me
you know humming that jingle Jordan then you might hum it as well and so my memetic jingle has now
infected your brain so that could be a completely neutral meme or it could be a positive meme so
first the the valence of memes can be you know all possible options whereas the the parasitic
idea pathogens I'm speaking of I'm implicitly if not explicitly stating that they are negative
that's that's one number two the memetic framework operates as though they're viral whereas I'm
there's a unique element to it being parasitic right so pathogens can be viruses they could be
bacteria they could be parasites they could be fungi and so I am the reason why I call them idea
pathogens is because pathogen is a broader term that can incorporate viral infection
or parasitic infestation so there are a few of these types of nuances between the approach that
I'm taking and the one that Dawkins took so many years ago so a parasite tends to make a host act
in ways that that aren't that good for the host and it seems to me that that's potentially where
the metaphor breaks down here because it's it also seems to me that people who are pushing these ideas
forward or who are allowing themselves to become possessed by them which is a metaphor I've used
actually gain as a consequence so they're working they're working for the same purposes as the
parasite and so then you have to wonder if that actually constitutes a parasite I mean the people
who are pushing I'm given ideological position or even a given theoretical position hypothetically
benefit from pushing that position as a consequence of the effects it has on their success within their
broad community sorry if I may interrupt no I think I would look at it as does the parasitizing
of your mind result in the proliferation of the idea pathogen the idea pathogen doesn't care about
you know your reproductive fitness so for example take islamophobia if I can if now I'm speaking as a
you know islamic islamic supremacist if I want my society to become more islamic or not my
society the west to be more islamic spreading islamophobia as a narrative is certainly very
good so if I could convince a lot of people in intelligentsia in the humanities and the social
sciences that it is islamophobic to ever criticize anything about islam so if the islamophobia
memoplex to use docking term or I would call it more of an idea pathogen if I can parasitize enough
minds to repeat this then that is islamophobia memoplex by its spreading from brain to brain
has an ultimate goal of creating greater islamic islamization of the west I don't care about the
reproductive fitness of the humanities professor who is spreading that islamic islamophobia idea
pathogen do you follow what I mean so yeah well but it might be to your benefit if you actually did
enhance the function of your host if by being parasitized by the idea pathogen it improves
the reproductive fitness of the host yes or or in or in this situation maybe the the ideological
or the academic status of the host because then the ideas could be spread more rapidly
that it certainly does right so if we can create an echo chamber where we could then spread that
idea pathogen more readily as as happens in the in the academic ecosystem that's perfect
but the reality is the reason why I like the term parasitic rather than memetic is because
by having so go back to the example of queers for Palestine by having someone from the LGBT
community fighting hard against islamophobia and fighting hard against the zionist pigs and so on
it is actually detrimental to my reproductive fitness I mean or never mind my reproductive
fitness my survival right being someone who is a member of the LGBT community and standing up for
a system that would be brutal and repressing me is not exactly a good rational strategy to pursue
and yet I pursue it precisely because I have been infected by a parasitic idea pathogen you follow
what I'm saying all right well I follow it but it doesn't it doesn't explain to me exactly the
motivation for putting the idea forward you know because the idea the idea isn't literally hijacking
the nervous system of its host in the same way that the parasitic wasp that you described
hijacks the nervous system of the spider like there's no direct there's no direct
what there is connection between the ideas and and the motivations of the host and so
I guess that's partly I'm I'm striving to understand that yeah so I mean in the sense that the
parasitic wasp is actually causing a neuronal alteration a direct neuronal alteration that
causes the spider to become zombified you're right but ultimately you know not to to be too
reductionist ultimately everything that we do including our ideas could be translated
to neuronal firings right right but you have to hopefully you'd be able to specify that mechanism
so that leads to it well I mean I'm not suggesting that you should have pushed your research to the
point where you could specify the neural mechanisms but it does open up a problem I would say maybe
the problem would be what do you see in some sense in the continual debate between right and left
might be construed in the terms that you're using as a constant battle between proponents of the claim
that one set of ideas is parasitical well the other set isn't and so for example people who
object to a biological definition of sex or gender would claim that the reason that that the person
who puts that claim forward has been parasitized by an idea in your parlance and I think this is
actually quite close to the claim that is made but that the true reason for the claim so the true
the true motivation for the claim is is something operating behind the scenes is that the person
who's making the claims is bolstering their position of power or maintaining their position
in the status quo or attempting to put down another group but mostly for the purposes of
maintaining the status quo within which they have an interest so they're actually not putting
forth an idea that has any objective validity but but being possessed in some sense by an
idea that has a function similar to the function that you're describing so how do you using this
metaphor how do you protect yourself or protect even the entire critical game where ideas are
assessed from degenerating into something like claim and counterclaim that all the ideas that
are arguing or nothing but or that are competing or nothing but parasites so at first I'm going to
hear maybe surprisingly be more charitable in attributing a cause to the people who originally
espoused and spawned all those idea pathogens and so when I was looking at all those pathogens and
by the way let me just mention them very quickly for your viewers who have yet read the book so
postmodernism would be the granddaddy of all idea pathogens cultural relativism identity politics
biophobia the fear of using biology to explain human affairs militant feminism you know critical
race theory each of these is an idea pathogen so as I was trying to think of some common thread
that runs through all these idea pathogen very much like if I were an oncologist
I may be someone specializing in pancreatic cancer which is very different than melanoma
and yet of course all cancers at least share the one mechanism of unchecked cell division right
so even though they might manifest themselves and project through different trajectories
there is some conciliant commonality across all cancers and so I was trying to look for a similar
synthetic explanation for what do all these idea pathogens have in common and here's where I'm going
to be charitable uh I think that these idea pathogens start off from a noble place and they
start off from a uh a desire to pursue a noble cause but regrettably in the pursuit of that noble
cause then they end up then they meaning the the proponents of those idea pathogens end up
willing to murder truth in the service of pursuing that otherwise noble goal right so for example if
we take equity feminism most people who are going to be watching this show are probably equity
feminists I'm an equity feminist and if I can speak for you I bet you're an equity feminist which
means basically what we are you know men and women should be equal under the law under the law
there should not be any institutional uh sexism or misogyny against one sex or the other so the
Christina Huff summer position so we can start off with that being a great idea right well we
could even push that a little bit further and say that if we had any sense we'd want the the sex
is to be open up to equal exploitation so to speak because everybody has something to offer and that
only a fool would want to restrict half the population from offering what they have to offer
even if he was driven by nothing but self-interest fair enough great and so the problem then arises
when militant feminism comes in they argue that in the service of that original goal and the desire
to squash the patriarchy and the status quo and so on we must now espouse a position that rejects
the possibility that men and women are distinguishable from one another not better not worse but there
are evolutionary trajectory that would have resulted in recurring sex differences that are fully
explained by biology and by evolution while militant feminists will reject that and hence
they'll suffer from biophobia another idea pathogen in the service of that original noble goal
so take first i'll just do one more if i may cultural relativism the idea that who you know
there are no human universals each culture has to be identified based on its own merits and so on
again it starts off with a kernel of truth it seems to make sense the gentleman who first
espoused this france boas the anthropologist out of columbia was trying to stop the possibility
that people might use biology in explaining differences between cultures and so on and
therefore justify them that way exactly right if the biologists would say this is how it is and
therefore that's how it should be exactly so in the service of that original noble goal they then
end up building edifices of evidence for the next 100 years where the word biology is never
uttered right i mean and that's been my whole career right which is i go into a business school
and i look at organizational behavior and consumer behavior and personnel psychology and all of the
other panoply of ways that we manifest our human nature in a business context and never do we ever
mention the word biology well how could you study all of these purposive important behaviors
without recognizing that humans might be privy to their hormonal fluctuations uh to me it seems
like a trivial trivially obvious statement to most economists this is hearsay what does what the
hormones have to do with the economy so again you start off with france boas having a noble cause
but then it metamorphosizes into complete lunacy in the service of that original noble goal so i
think if i were to look for a conciliate explanation as to why all these idea pathogens arise it's
because they start off with a kernel of truth with a noble cause but then they metamorphosize into
bullshit all right so here's another way that they might be conceptualized as parasites too
um imagine that the academy has built up a reputation which is like a a reputation is
like a storehouse of value in some sense so you get a good reputation if you trade equitably with
people and then your ability to trade equitably is relatively assured in the future right you'll
be invited to trade and so reputation is like a storehouse in some sense now academia at least
principle or the intellectual exercise has built up a certain reservoir of goodwill
which is indicated by the fact that people will pay to go to universities to be educated
and the hypothesis there is that the universities have something to offer that's of practical utility
of of sufficient magnitude so that the cost is justifiable you go to university and you come
out more productive and the reason you come out more productive is because the intellectual
enterprise that the university has been engaged in has had actual practical relevance and you
might justify that claim by pointing to the fact that the technological improvements that have been
generated in no small part by raw research have radically improved the standard of living of people
everywhere in the world and some of that's a consequence of pure academic research a fair
bit of it pure scientific research now what happens is that other ideas come along that
don't have the same functional utility but have the same appearance and so they're not so much
paris they don't so much parasitize individuals let's say as they they they parasitize the entire
system the system has has built up a reputation because it was offering solutions of pragmatic
utility even training students to think clearly and to assess arguments clearly and to communicate
properly has tremendous economic value if you do it appropriately because that means they can
operate more efficiently when they're solving problems now but once that system is in place
with its academic divisions and its modes of proof and all of that it can be mimicked by
by systems that that perform the same functions putatively but don't have the same pragmatic
uh they don't have the same history of demonstrating practical utility well let
me give you an example um the idea of peer review a peer review works in the sciences because
there's a scientific method and because you can bring scientists together and you can ask them to
adjudicate how stringently the scientific method was adhered to in a given research program
um but then you can take the idea of peer review and you can translate it into a field like let's
say sociology and you can mimic the uh academic writing style that's characteristic of the sciences
and you can make claims that look on the surface of them to have been um generated using the same
technologies that the sciences use but all it is is a facade yeah and it's so that's where
that it's that it's at that level where their parasitic metaphor seems to me to be most appropriate
and so so let me let me that you raise a great point uh so a couple of things to mention here
number one i i reside in a business school it's and if i were residing in an engineering school
i would probably say the exact same thing that i'm about to say which is the idea pathogens that
i discuss in the parasitic mind have simply not proliferated in the business school and the
engineering school for exactly the reasons that you began enunciating at the start of your of
your of the current comment right because those disciplines are coupled with reality i cannot
build a good economic model using postmodernist economics i cannot build a econometric model
of consumer choice that literally that predicts well you know how you know that develops an ai
model that learns what i should prefer on amazon using a feminist glaciology so i cannot build a
bridge using postmodernist physics so because those disciplines are intimately coupled with
reality it becomes a lot more difficult for their epistemology to be parasitized by idea
package yes okay okay so so now this brings up some questions about exactly what constitutes a
claim to truth and and i think engineering is actually a really good place to start because
the scientists often claim and i've had discussions with sam harris about this a lot and
um we never did get to the bottom of it partly because it's too damn complicated but you know i
tend to adopt a pragmatic theory of truth even in the scientific domain and what that essentially
means is that your theory predicts the consequences of a set of actions in the world and if you undertake
those set of actions and that consequence emerges then your theory is true enough so what what is
done is it's just demonstrated its validity within that set of predictions now whether it can predict
outside that's a different question hopefully it could it would be generalizable but it's at least
it's true enough to have predicted that outcome and so in engineering and i would say also in
business maybe not in business schools but certainly in business in engineering and you build
when you build a bridge there's a simple question which is does the bridge stand up to the load that
it needs to uh it needs to be resistant to um and if the answer to that is yes then your theory
was good enough to build that bridge now maybe you could have built it more efficiently and maybe
there's a more uh you could have got more strength for less use of materials in time that's certainly
possible but there is that there's the bottom line there that's that's very very close and in
business it's the same thing which is part of the advantage of a market economy is that
your idea can be killed very rapidly and that's actually an advantage because it helps you determine
what a valid idea is in that domain and what a valid idea isn't and it does seem like the closer
that disciplines in the universities have adhered to the scientific methodology the more resistant
they have been to these parasitic ideas in your terminology we should go over again exactly what
those ideas are right um just just so that everybody's clear about it last time with post
modernism since this is one that you've uh tackled also many times yeah you want to define it and do
you want to uh let let let's let everybody know exactly what we're talking about but it's most
basic level post modernism begins with the tenet that you know there is no objective truth that
we are completely shackled by subjectivity we're shackled by a wide range of biases and so to
argue about absolute truth is silly and so maybe okay so so there's sorry let me add a bit to that
so we can flesh it out so the post modernists also seem to claim and i'm going to be as charitable
as i possibly can in this description because i don't want to build up a straw man um they're very
very concerned with the effect that language has on defining reality yes and the french post
modernist thinkers in particular seem to have come to the conclusion that reality is defined
in totality by language there's no getting outside of the language game there isn't anything outside
of language so that would be exactly that right deconstructionism language creates reality is
exactly what you just described right right and it's it's weak theory in some sense because it
doesn't abide by its own principles so for example and this is one of its fundamental weaknesses as
far as i'm concerned is that derrida says that but then he acts as if and also explicitly claims
that power exists right right and so that language the so if you're building realities with language
the question arises of why you would do that and the answer seems to be for the post modernists is
that it's power and that's a quasi marxism in right right okay so you do you think that that
seems fair don't you think what is that would someone who was a post modernist agree with that
definition uh i mean yes the the the problem though is that post modernism allows for a
complete breakdown of reality as understood by a three year old it is a form of this is why by the
way in the book i i refer to it as intellectual terrorism and i don't use these terms just to
kind of come up with pro poetic pros i genuinely mean so i i compare post modernism to the 9 11
hijackers who flew planes onto buildings uh i i argue that post modernist fly buildings of bullshit
into our edifices of reason and maybe if i could share uh a couple of personal interactions that
i've had with post modernists that capture the extent to which they depart from reality may i do
that sure and then we'll get back to elucidating the list of ideas that you've you've defined as
as parasitic fantastic so in 2002 and i think this story might be particularly relevant to you
Jordan because of course you you know you broke through in the in the public conscience
because of the gender pronoun stuff well you'll see that this 2002 story was prophetic in predicting
what would eventually happen so in 2002 one of my doctoral students had just uh defended his
dissertation and we were going out for a celebratory dinner it was myself my wife uh him and his date
for the evening and so he contacts me before the we you know we go out for the dinner and he
kind of gives me a heads up and he says well you know my date is a graduate student in cultural
anthropology radical feminism and post modernism it's kind of the holy trinity of bullshit and so
basically the reason why he was telling me this is he's basically saying hopefully
please be on your best behavior let's not yes and you recount this in the book yeah okay so
yeah that's okay you know go ahead i'm i'm just letting everybody know yes yes exactly and so
uh i said oh yeah don't don't worry i'm you know i i get it i get you this is your night
i'm gonna be on my best behavior of course that wasn't completely true because i couldn't resist
trying to at least get a sense what this woman what her positions were so at one point i said
oh i hear that you are a postmodernist uh yes uh do you mind so i'm an evolutionary psychologist
i i do believe that there are certain human universals that serve as kind of a a bedrock of
uh similarities that we share whether we are peruvian nigerian or or japanese do you mind if i
maybe propose what i consider to be human universal and then you can tell me how that
you don't think that that's the case she goes absolutely go for it is it not the case that
within homo sapiens only women bear children is that not a human universal so then she she scoffs
at my stupidity at my narrow-mindedness at my misogyny says absolutely not no it's so it's not
true that women bear children she said no because in some japanese tribe and their mythical folklore
it is the men who bear children and so by you restricting the conversation to the biological
realm that's how you you know keep us uh barefoot and pregnant so once i kind of recovered from
hearing such a position i then said okay well let me take a less maybe less controversial or contentious
example is it not true from any vantage point on earth sailors since time immemorial have
relied on the premise that the sun rises in the east and sets in the west and here jordan she
used the kind of language creates reality the deli that position she goes well what do you mean by
east and west those are arbitrary labels and what do you mean by the sun that which you call the sun
i might call dancing hyena exact words i said okay well the the dancing hyena rises in the east
and sets in the west and she said well i don't play those label games so the reason why this is a
powerful story that i continuously recount and hence included in the book is because she wasn't
some you know psychiatric patient who escaped from the psychiatric institute she was exactly
aping what post-modernist espouse on a daily basis to their thousands of adoring students
when we can't agree that only women bear children and that there is such a thing as east and west
and that there is such a thing as the sun then it's intellectual terrorism
all right so back back to the the parasite idea so okay no no let's not do that let's finish listing
the ideas that you describe in your book as as having this commonality so there's post-modernism
and we already defined that as the the hypothesis that reality is constituted by language right
which by the way is it is a close is a close ally to another idea pathogen social constructivism
or if you want social constructivism on steroids which basically and the reason why i add the
on steroids because yes social constructivism the idea that we are prone to socialization
no serious behavioral scientists would disagree with that and no avowed evolutionary behavioral
scientists would disagree with the idea that socialization is is an important force in shaping
who we are and no serious intellectual would deny that language shapes our conceptions of
reality exactly right so the issue is degree exactly the problem and hence the steroid part
is when you argue that everything that we are is due to social constructivism right it's the
collapse of a multivariate scenario into a univariate scenario an inappropriate collapse
and that's by the way i remember your brilliant chat with the the woman from the British woman
that you know i don't remember her name that the lobster stuff where Kathy Newman Kathy Newman thank
you where you made exactly that point about multifactorial right where you are where she was
arguing everything related to the gender gap must be due to misogyny when the reality is that of
course there might be 17 other factors with greater explanatory power that explains why
we're there but she can't see the world in a in a multifactorial way she only sees it as due to
a single look with this might that's might have some bearing on on the attractiveness of of certain
sets of ideas we might even see if it's the attractiveness of the so-called parasitic ideas
i think it was einstein who said that it probably wasn't i probably got the source wrong but
it doesn't matter that a scientific explanation should be as simple as possible but no simpler
right right and so and and that's an aukham's razor exactly with a bit of a modification there
and you want to a good theory buys you a lot and and you want your theory to buy you as much as
possible because it means you only have to learn a limited number of principles and you can explain
a very large number of phenomena so but there's there's the attraction of the inappropriate
collapse of the complex landscape into its simplified counterpart whereby you you rid yourself of
complexity that's actually necessary and inevitable what that means is that you couldn't make progress
employing your theory in a pragmatic way but if you don't ever test it in a way that it could be
killed you'll never find that out right and so it's it's very easy in my new book
which is called beyond order i wrote a chapter called abandon ideology and i'm making the point
in there that um you it's it's very tempting to collapse the world into um to collapse the world
such that one explanatory mechanism can account for everything and that it's a game that intellectuals
are particularly good at because their intellectual function it enables them to
generate plausible causal hypotheses and so you can take something like power or sexuality or
relative economic status or economics for that matter um or love or hate or resentment and you
can generate a theory that accounts for virtually everything relying on only one of those factors
and that's because virtually everything that human beings do are is affected by those factors and so
that that that that's that proof is it it's that it's the attractiveness of that simplification
that accounts for the attractiveness of these is it the attractiveness of that simplification
that accounts for the attractiveness of these parasitic ideas so i would say the the idea of
you or the the the process of finding a simple explanation for an otherwise more complex phenomenon
maybe could be linked to i don't know if you're familiar with the work do you know are you familiar
with gerd gigarenzer yes right so so if you remember in his work which by the way i love the
fact that he roots it in an evolutionary framework yes i like his work a lot great i actually had
done uh many years ago he he his group had invited me to spend some time at the max plank institute
and so he's got the idea of fast and frugal heuristics right yes right it's a pragmatic theory
essentially exactly because it basically says look uh you know economists think that before we
choose a given car we engage in these elaborate laborious calculations because we're seeking to
maximize our utility because otherwise we won't pick the optimal car if we don't engage in utility
maximization of course while that's a beautiful normative theory it doesn't describe what consumers
actually do because you and i when we chose our last car we didn't look at all available options
along on all available attributes before we make a choice rather we couldn't we couldn't we use too
many exactly we use a simplifying strategy and in the parlance of gigarenzer it would be a fast
and frugal heuristic because we've evolved i mean if i sit there and calculate all of the
distribution functions of what happens if i hear a wrestling behind me the tiger will eat me before
i finish all of the distributions right the calculations all the distributions therefore
in many cases when i deploy a fast and frugal heuristic it makes perfect adaptive sense but
the downside of that so to go back to your point is that oftentimes i will apply a fast and frugal
heuristic when i shouldn't have done so right so for certain complex phenomena my innate
tension to want to seek that one causal mechanism is actually in this case suboptimal so knowing
when i should deploy the fast and frugal heuristic and when i should rely on more complex multifactorial
reasoning is the real challenge here okay so so let's say that a robust discipline
offers a set of simplifications that are pragmatically useful okay and then
being a developing mastery in the application of those heuristics
boosts you up the hierarchy that is built around their utilization okay so you have a theory that
allows you to get a grip on the world and and to do things in the world like build bridges and then
if you're good at applying that theory you become good at building bridges and that and because
people value that that gives you a certain amount of status and and authority and maybe even power
but we'll go for status and authority so you have the simultaneous construction of a system that
allows you to act in the world in a in a manner that is productive but also organizes a social
organize a society now it seems to me the postmodernists get rid of the application to the
world side of things so they really have constructed a language game that actually operates according
to their principles of reality it isn't it isn't hemmed in by the constraints of the actual world
except in so far as that world consists of a struggle for academic power and endless definitions
of reality within the confines of a of a language game I've actually argued exactly for what you
just said and speculatively trying to explain why otherwise intelligent people like Michel Foucault
and Jacques Lacan and Jacques Derrida would have espoused all the nonsense that they did
and I argue and I think there is some evidence to support my otherwise speculative hypothesis
so let me let me put it in colloquial terms so I am one of those postmodernists I'm Jacques Lacan
or I'm you know Jacques Derrida and I'm looking with envy at at the physicists and the biologists
and the neuroscientists and the mathematicians getting all the glory they're the hot quarterbacks
on campus getting all the pretty women right why aren't we getting any attention well you know what
if I create a world of full profundity where I appear as though I'm saying something deeply
profound and meaningful whereas in reality I'm uttering complete gibberish then maybe my prose
can be as impenetrable as those hardy mathematicians right yeah physicists yeah exactly happen to be
generally if you do IQ ranking among the disciplines the physicists are the smartest surprise surprise
and so so we have physics envy exactly so the or physicist envy economists have physics envy
and that's why they've created now sub disciplines of economics that are completely mathematical
but fully devoid from any real world applications it all stemmed originally from wanting to be
accepted in the in the at the table of serious scientists right you're making two arguments
now I think I think one is that in the example you just gave it's actually the thinker that's the
parasite right because the thinker wants to ratchet him or herself up the hierarchy and it
is the thinker is it Jacques Lacan yes exactly exactly the originators of these of these theories
in your in your example they want to accrue to themselves the meritorious status that a true
scientist or engineer would have generated yes okay and so and they do that by setting up a
false system that looks like the true system but doesn't have any of this real world practicality
and they justify that by eliminating the notion of the real world yes and so in that case going
back to our earlier conversation in that case the originator of the parasite is actually getting
I mean literally reproductive fitness right well but is also acting as a parasite on a system that's
functional but then you could say on top of that now he's allowing ideas to enter his consciousness
and some of those will some of those will fulfill the function of producing this full
reality in which he can rise and so it's it's it's a parasitical set of ideas within a parasitical
strategy yes yes I like it and by the way for it for this particular parasitic slight of hand
to work it relies actually on a principle that you and I probably teach in sort of the introductory
psychology course so fundamental attribution error the the idea of that that people sometimes
attribute this dispositional traits to otherwise for example situational variables or vice versa
right I did well on the exam because I'm smart rather than because the exam was easy right
well they Jacques Derrida being the brilliant parasite that he was he was relying on exactly
that and let me explain how if I get up in front of an audience so now I'm Jacques Derrida or Jacques
Lacan and I espouse a never-ending concatenation of of syllables that are completely void of
semantic meaning but that sound extraordinarily profound two things can happen the audience
member can either say I don't understand what Jacques Lacan is saying because I'm too dumb
and he's very profound or I don't understand what Jacques Lacan is saying because he's a charlatan
who's engaging in full profundity well guess what most people in the audience go for the former
right what when I when I explained this to my wife by the way she said you know what you just
liberated me from a sense of feeling that I was inadequate in college well it's really a complicated
problem like look my assumption generally is that if I don't it's not always this that I can't read
physics papers in physics journals I'm not mathematically gifted and so there are all
sorts of scientific and mathematical claims that I can't evaluate but most of the time when I read
a book if I don't understand it I believe that the author hasn't made it clear right and and I've
read some difficult people I've read Jung who's unbelievably difficult um Nietzsche uh and neuroscience
texts York Panksepp Jeffrey Gray Gray's book Neuropsychology of Anxiety that bloody book took
me six months to read it's a tough book 1500 references something like that and an idea pretty
much in every sentence very very carefully written but a very complicated book but I hit the I read
Foucault and I could understand him but I thought most of what he said was trivial of course power
plays a role in human behavior but it doesn't play the only role of course mental illness definitions
are socially constructed in part every psychiatrist worth his salt knows that it's hardly a radical
claim um when I hit Lacan and Derrida it was like no sorry what you guys are saying it's not that
I'm stupid it's that you're playing a game you had enough self-confidence in your cognitive abilities
that you didn't succumb to their fundamental attribution slight of hand right so you you're one
of those rare animals that said wait a minute he's saying bullshit because I know that I can think
and I'm not getting him the problem is that most people that are sitting passively in the audience
didn't come with your confidence well maybe that's it maybe it's that they also didn't have a good
alternative like I was fortunate a because by the time I started reading that sort of thing
I'd always already established something approximating a career path in in psychology
in clinical psychology with it with a heavy biological basis and so but if I was a student
who had encountered nothing but that kind of theorizing and I I was interested in
and having an academic career I might well believe that learning how to play that particular
language game was valid and also the only route to success I mean one of the things that really
staggers me about the post-modernist types that I read and encounter is that they they have absolutely
no exposure to biology as a science whatsoever they don't know anything about evolutionary theory
by the way not just post-modernist most social scientists yes yes of course walking around in
the business school think that biology is some Nazi vulgar oh it's the same it's the same in
psychology to some degree and but my my sense has been that psychology has managed to steer clear of
the worst excesses of let's call it this this degeneration into this abandonment of pragmatic
yeah necessity they've managed to steer clear to that to the degree that the that the sub-disciplines
have been rooted in biology it's actually been a corrective it's interesting you say this because
I and I discussed this briefly in the book I gave once when my first book was released this
this one right here evolutionary basis of consumption this is a book where I try to explain
how you could apply evolutionary thinking to understand our consumer nature I had given
two talks at University of Michigan the first day on I think it was a Thursday I gave the exact
same talk in the so I was giving the exact same talk in two different buildings two different
audiences on one day it was in the psychology department and as for your viewers who don't
know University of Michigan has consistently always ranked in you know the top three to five
psychology departments in the United States my former doctoral supervisor got his PhD in psychology
in University of Michigan he actually overlapped with Amos Dversky by the way just a little bit
of a historical you know parenthesis so I give the talk on Thursday in front of the psychology
department and because as you said many of them are neuroscientists biological psychologists and so
on they're listening to it and they're like oh yeah this is gorgeous good stuff god love it
the exact same talk the next day at the business school which again you would think based on what
we said earlier they should be very pragmatic in their theoretical orientations if if if something
explains behavior then I should accept it but because they were so bereft of biological based
thinking Jordan I couldn't get through a single sentence it was as if I was metaphorically dodging
tomatoes being thrown at me I couldn't get through maybe five or six slides of my talk
because they were so aghast and and felt such disdain for my arguing that consumers are driven
by biological mechanisms and so yeah well the business schools can drift away from the real
world I think more effectively than the engineering schools can or or the biologists and you'd hope
that the necessity of contending with free market realities would protect the business
school to some degree but my experience with business schools well often positive has often
been that the theorizers couldn't necessarily produce a business right well interesting because
I found that when I give a talk in front of business practitioners then it's always very well
received when I give that same talk in front of business school professors depending on how vested
they are in their apriori paradigms it either goes well or not so if they are hardcore social
constructivist then I am a Nazi I am a biological vulgarizer it's it's Cortes what are you talking
about with all this hormone business so the practitioners are not vested in a paradigm
if I can offer them some guidelines for how to design advertising messages that are maximally
effective using an evolutionary lens they go sure sign me up I don't yeah right right because
there's a there's a practical problem to be so everybody has two practical problems we might say
broadly speaking one is contending with the actual world so because you have to get enough to eat
that that's the world of biological necessity and then there's the world of sociological necessity
which is which is produced by the fact that you have to be with others while you solve
your biological problems and you can solve your biological problems by adapting extraordinarily
well to the sociological world as long as the sociological world has its tendrils out in the
world and is solving problems so you can be a post-modernist and believe that there's nothing in
the world except language as long as the university is nested in a system that's dealing with the
world well enough to feed you and that isn't your immediate problem so you lose the corrective
okay so let's continue with the list of let me give you another one that I think you're particularly
I think sensitive to and you've probably also opined on so the dye religion which stems from
identity politics another idea about the dye is the acronym for diversity inclusion and equity
that is such a dreadfully bad parasitic idea because it really removes so let's again speak in
the context of academia but it could apply to other projects that apply to HR departments
human resources department yes I think before I start are you you're out of your position at
University of Toronto now Jordan are you or no I'm on leave you're on leave okay well maybe it's a
good thing because since you were last at the university environment the dye religion has only
proliferated with much greater alacrity so that now when you apply to grants for grants you know
with all of the major grants the equivalent for our American viewers the equivalent of say an NSF
grant the national science foundation we have similar grants for people in engineering or social
sciences or national sciences in Canada you have to have a a dye statement that basically says you
know you know what have you done in the past to to advance dye causes what will you do if you get
this grant if you if this grant were granted to you how would you uphold dye principles and
there is a colleague of mine a physical that's for sure can insert and and the medical research
grant say oh my god exactly so yeah that's unbelievable a physical chemist at one of our
mutual alma maters McGill University maybe I've given too much information here
was denied a grant because it didn't pass the dye threshold right in other words it didn't matter
what was what was the substantive content of his grant application the scientific content
he just wasn't sufficiently convinced by the way right so so that's an indication that's a situation
where the elevation of that particular ideological game that's been elevated over the game of science
exactly now that would be fine if they were both games but science isn't a game
right it's a technique for solving it's a technique for solving genuine problems
science is what allows you and I friends that haven't otherwise seen each other physically
for many years to reconnect today and have a fantastic conversation as if we were sitting
next to each other it's science that did that it's not postmodernism it's not booga booga
it's not indigenous knowledge now again people think let me mention why I just said now indigenous
knowledge yeah people people will think oh that's racist that's that's that's hateful
if I want to study something about the flora or fauna of an indigenous territory where indigenous
people have lived there for thousands of years I can defer to their domain specific knowledge
because they've lived within that ecosystem so specific knowledge about a particular phenomenon
could be attributed to group a knowing more than group b that's what ethnobotanists do
exactly but the epistemology of how I study the flora or fauna how I adjudicate scientific issues
within that ecosystem there isn't a competition between the scientific method and indigenous
way of knowing there is only one game in town it's called the scientific method yeah well that's
what knowing is that's the thing that's why there's only one game is because there there's
as soon as we use the word knowing and we apply it in a domain that would pertain to indigenous
knowledge and a domain that would pertain to science as soon as we use the uniting word knowledge
we're presupposing that knowledge is one thing and knowledge is knowledge has to be something like
the use of abstractions to predict and control the use of abstractions to predict and control
it's as simple as that and you could be predicting and controlling all sorts of things but you act
in a way you act in a manner that is intended to produce the outcome that you desire and the
better you are at that the more knowledge you have right so imagine if now in the university
your the dye principles are not only being used to determine who gets a shared professorship
who gets a grant who do we hire as an assistant professor but it's also used to make the point
that there isn't a singular epistemology for seeking truth which by the way I would love later
to talk about chapter seven in my book where I talk about how to seek truth which is maybe relevant
to the many conversations that you and Sam have had because I introduce I think a a very powerful way
of adjudicating different claims of truth and we can talk about that that's a normal logical
network exactly thank you so we can talk about that if you want later but I mean imagine how
grotesque it is to teach students that I mean is there a Lebanese Jewish way of knowing is there
a green-eyed people way of knowing is there an indigenous way the distribution of prime numbers
is the distribution of prime numbers irrespective of the identity of the person who is studying the
distribution of prime numbers isn't that what liberates us from the shackles of our personal
identity you know and you can say that and you can still say that people use knowledge to obtain
power so that's a primary that's a primary post-modernist claim people use knowledge to obtain
power now that gets exaggerated into the statement that people only use knowledge to obtain power
and that's all that's worth obtaining and then of course that becomes wrong because both of those
claims are too extreme but even in science you can criticize science and the manner in which
science is practiced by saying well scientists are biased just and self-interested just like
all other people and they're going to use their theories to advance themselves in the sociological
world and then you can be skeptical of their theories for exactly that reason but then you
also have to point out that well scientists have recognized this and just like the wise founders
of the American state put in a system of checks and balances scientists have done the same thing
and said well because we're likely to be blinded even when making the most objective claims about
reality that we can we're likely to be blinded by our self-interest so we'll put scientists into
verbal competition with one another to help determine who's playing a straight game and so
the checks are already there and which is to say that you can adopt much of the criticism
that the post-modernists level against the scientific game without throwing the baby out with
the bathwater you still say well despite all that despite the human nature despite the primate
nature of the scientific endeavor and the jockeying for position that goes along with it
there's still a residual that constitutes progressive um what progressive expansion of
the domain of knowledge well so when you're talking about the checks and balances uh that
replication is something that is central to the scientific method that is second nature in physics
or chemistry or biology but not in the social sciences is where the social sciences fail now
obviously you know about the reproducibility crisis and so on i mean i yeah i was always less
pessimistic than about that than everyone else because i or not everyone but most people because
i always assumed that 95 percent of what i was reading wasn't reproducible and that we were
bloody fortunate if we ever got five percent of our research findings right it's still five percent
five percent improvement in knowledge if that's an annual rate let's say that's an unbelievably
rapid rate of knowledge accrual and if 95 percent of it is noise well say la vie it's a lot a hundred
percent but but by the way that's one of the things that i love so much about evolutionary
psychology which might allow us to segue eventually into a neurological network is uh many of the
phenomena that evolutionists study by the very nature of for example them there being human
universals it forces you to either engage in a conceptual replication or rather a direct
replication of that phenomenon so for example if you want to demonstrate that facial symmetry
is one of the markers that are used when deciding that someone is beautiful i can demonstrate that
in 73 different cultures right right we could talk about the nomological networks a little bit so
this is a this is a way to establish let me let me introduce it a bit okay because i think this
is a simple way of introducing it what you want to do to demonstrate that something is real you
sort of triangulate except you use more than three positions of reference so for example
we've evolved our senses are a nomological network system so we say that something is real
if we can see it taste it smell it touch it and hear it now each of those senses relies on a different
set of physical phenomena so they're unlikely to be correlated randomly and we've evolved
five senses because it's been our experience evolutionarily that unless you can identify
something with certainty across five independent dimensions it's not necessarily real yes but
we go even farther than that in our attempts to define what's real outside of our conceptions
once we've established the reality of something using our five senses then we consult with other
people to see if we can find agreement on the phenomenon and then we assume that if my five
senses and your five senses report the same thing especially if there's 50 of us and not just two
and that and across repeated occasions then probably that thing is real
and a nomological network is sort of the formalization of that idea across measurement
techniques in the sciences yeah I love the way you use the senses to introduce this because
there is a term that I didn't I didn't describe this phenomenon in the parasitic mind but I've
discussed it in other contexts I call it sensorial convergence so for example there's a classic study
in evolutionary psychology by two folks that I know well one of whom is a friend of mine
Randy Thornhill where they asked women to rate the pleasantness of t-shirts that were worn by men
and it turns out that the one that they judge as most pleasing of factorily speaking
is the one that is also identifying the guy who is the most symmetric yes so in other words
there's sensorial convergence so that two independent senses are arriving at the same
final product in this case the product being the optimal male for me to choose and it would make
perfect evolutionary sense for there to be that sensorial convergence so right and in the in the
book you introduce the nomological network which isn't discussed very frequently in books that are
that are written popularly right that's an idea that that hasn't been discussed much yes outside of
specialty courses say in in methodology in psychology I actually think the psychologist
came up with the idea of nomological networks so I'm going to describe what you just said and
tell you how my approach of nomological networks is it is grander if you'd like so the the folks who
came up with the term nomological networks in psychology were coming up with a nomological
network of triangulated evidence when establishing the validity of a psychological construct right
so when you're establishing convergent validity and discriminant validity right the the Campbell
and Fisk stuff which by the way if there are any graduate students in psychology what never mind
graduate student psychology any any student should read the 1959 paper the multi-trade
multi-method matrix by Campbell and Fisk it's one of the most right and there's an earlier one
as well by Cronback and Meal in 1955 very good validity and psychological tests exactly right
and it was part of the American psychological association's efforts to develop standards
for psychological testing so it is in fact a method of defining what's real how do you know
that something's real and that's what a normal yeah each of these validity constructs points to
ticking off this this construct as being valid then I've now in a nomological network sense
established the the veracity of that construct the validity of that construct right and that's
actually something a bit different than maybe than a pragmatic uh a proof of truth because from
the pragmatic perspective the the theory is evaluated with regards to its utility as a tool
this is more more like an analogy to sensory reality exactly if something registers across
multiple different methods of detecting it it's probably real detecting it across cultures across
space across time across methodologies across paradigms so it's really the grand daddy of
nomological networks if Cronback and and Campbell and Fisk were talking in a more limited sense of
how do you validate a psychological contra construct this is saying how do you validate
the veracity of a phenomenon how do I establish that toy preferences are not singularly socially
constructed how can I establish that so maybe right and you do that by studying primates for
example you study pride so not here i'm doing across species now i'm going to do across cultures
now i'm going to do across time periods and then you might look at androgenized versus
non-androgenized children and you can look across a variation in hormonal status i am so
delighted by how closely you've read the book i am honored my good man uh that you're exactly right
and so if one box within my nomological network did not convince you oftentimes the data in that
one box is sufficient to convince you but if it isn't then by assiduously building that entire
network i'm going to drown you in a tsunami of evidence and so i i consider this an incredibly
powerful way to adjudicate between competing and by the way this is why in the book i demonstrate
that it is not only used for scientific phenomena or evolutionary phenomena by building a nomological
network for the question of is islam a peaceful religion or not in other words i could use this
this grand epistemological tool to tackle imported phenomena even if they are outside the realm of
science does that make sense yes definitely well it's a matter of it so to put it simply it's a
matter of collecting evidence okay um if you study us if if you approach a phenomenon from
one perspective you might see a pattern there but then the question is are you seeing that pattern
because of your method or are you seeing that pattern like are you reading into the data or
are the data revealing the pattern and the answer to that is with one methodology you don't know
exactly so what you want to do is use multiple methodologies and and the more separate they
are in their approach the better and so when i wrote my when i wrote maps of meaning which was
my first book i wanted i was looking for patterns and but i was skeptical of it i wanted to ensure
that the patterns i was looking at sociologically and in literature and were also manifest in
psychology and in neuroscience and i thought that that was for that gave me the ability to use
four dimensions of triangulation so to speak right and the claim was well if the pattern emerges
across these disparate modes of approach it's probably it there's more there's a higher probability
that it's real and so a psychology that's biologically informed is going to be richer than one that
isn't because your theory has to not only account for behavior let's say in the instance but it also
has to be in accord with what's currently known about the function of the brain exactly and that's
the approach that you're taking to analysis of business problems exactly and and by the way it
it is truly a liberating way to view the world because it allows you in a sense to so if you
have epistemic humility you're able to say you know if now you jordan you were asking hey you know
in canada jordan just in true to opacity laws legalizing cannabis what do you think of those
laws well then i would say you know what i have epistemic humility i simply don't know enough
i haven't built the requisite nomological network to pronounce a definitive position on this on the
other hand if you ask me a question on a phenomenon for which i have built my nomological network
then i can enter that debate at that conversation with all the epistemic swagger that i'm afforded
by the protection of having built that nomological network so it's a really wonderful way to view
the world because it allows me to exactly know when i can engage an issue with with with well
deserved self-assuredness and where and when i should say you know i really just don't know enough
about this topic and by the way and someone like you who is of course also been a professor for
many years if you establish that epistemic honesty with your students it's actually quite powerful
because if an undergraduate student asks me a question and in front of everyone i say wow you
really stumped me with that question you know what why don't you send me an email and let me look
into it what that does is it builds trust with those students because it's saying this guy is not
standing up in front of us pretending to know everything as a matter of fact he was willing
to admit that he was stumped by the student of a 20 year old okay so so let let let me ask you
something about that epistemic humility in relate because we want to tie this back you defined a
number of um intellectual subfields as included in this parasitic network let's say um under the
parasitic rubric and would it be reasonable to say that one of the then you're left with a question
which is how do you identify valid theories of knowledge from invalid theories of knowledge
it seems to me that postmodernism has to deny biological science because biological science
keeps producing facts claims keeps making claims that are incommensurate with the postmodernists
now it seems to me that a reasonable approach would be to say well the claim can't be real
unless it meets the tenets of the postmodernist theory but also manifests itself in the biological
sciences it has to do both it can't just do one or the other now maybe that wouldn't work for the
biologist but the fact that the postmodernists tend to throw biology out is one of the facts that
sheds disrepute on their intellectual endeavor as far as i'm concerned because if they were
honest theorists they'd look for what was solid in biology and ensure that the theories that
they're constructing were in accordance with that rather than having to throw the the entire science
out the window either by omission not knowing anything about it or by defining it as politically
suspect and so so i'll introduce here another term i didn't discuss this much in in this book in
the parasitic mind but i certainly have discussed it in some way other words so the the notion of
conciliance which by so let me let me introduce this term for for your viewers who don't know it
the the term was reintroduced into the vernacular by eo wilson the the harvard biologist
who wrote a book in the late 1990s of that title conciliance unity of knowledge
so conciliance is very much related to the idea of nomological networks because what yeah conciliance
is basically saying that can you put a bunch of things under one explanatory rubric so physics
is more conciliant than sociology not necessarily although notwithstanding what you said earlier
about the iq of physicists it's not because physicists are smart and sociologists are dumb
it's because physicists operate using a conciliant tree of knowledge which by the way evolutionary
theorists also do you start with a meta theory that then goes into mid-level theories which then
goes into universal phenomena which then generates hypotheses so that the field becomes very organized
the problem with postmodernists is that they exist in a leaf node of bullshit right it is perfectly
unrelated to any conciliant tree of knowledge therefore they can never advance anything because
as you said earlier they exist within an ecosystem where they reward one another but they can never
build coherence right that's why physics and biology and the neurosciences and chemistry
are prestigious it's not because they are necessarily more scientific than sociology
it's because they take conciliance at heart does that make sense
yes it i mean i think to some degree too that you know you you also have to note that the
phenomena that physicists deal with are in some sense simpler than the phenomena that
sociologists deal with right so the physicists and the chemists and even the biologists to some
degree have plucked the low-hanging fruit that's august colt by the way we said this right august
colt created a hierarchy of the sciences and perhaps because he was a sociologist inclined
he placed sociology at the apex of the sciences precisely arguing what you just said which is
it's a lot easier to study the crystallography of a diamond than it is to study the rich complexity
of humans within a social system right although it that doesn't make it simple it's still really
complicated so so i you know it still requires a tremendous amount of intelligence to be a physicist
and to manage the mathematics because although the theories have tremendous explanatory power
they're still very sophisticated so okay so i've been trying to think about this from the
perspective of a post-modernist to say well we're making the claim that biology and chemistry and
physics all these this multitude of pragmatic disciplines engineering um to some degree psychology
and business they're valid enterprises and they need to take each other's findings into account
so the post-modernist might say well these very at various disciplines don't take our findings
into account and so they're being just as exclusionary as we are right now is that a valid argument
no because there are no useful findings that they've come up with and if you are no any please
tell me about it i actually challenged are they useful in restructuring society so that it's fairer
no why not that's the claim right and then no no it's not that straightforward because
it's not like so let's let's make the presumption for a moment that these are essentially left-wing
theories it's it's the case that it's not the case that the left wing politically has had nothing
to offer the improvement of society right you see all sorts of ideas that are generated initially
by the left that move into the mainstream that that have have made society a more civil place i mean
maybe that's the introduction of the eight-hour workday or the 40-hour workweek or universal pension
or at least in canada and and most other countries apart from the united states universal health care
and i mean almost everybody now presumes that those things are um that they've improved the
quality of life for everyone rich and poor alike and and i think i think that that's a reasonable
claim is the is the is the are the claims of the postmodernists justified by the political
effects of their actions can you give me an example of a postmodernist nugget that had it not been
espoused specifically by a postmodernist the world would be a poorer place whether it be practically
theoretically epistemologically can you think of one off the top of your head dork i can only
do it generally like in the manner that i just did to say that well it's it's part of it's part of the
the the domain of left-wing thought and it's not reasonable to assume that nothing of any benefit
has come out of the domain of left-wing thought it's i mean that's a very general it's a very
general analysis i'm not pointing to a particular theorem for example right but see take for example
in your field of clinical psychology we can say okay cognitive behavior therapy by studying that
process and then by testing it using the scientific method in terms of its efficacy
in reducing anxiety symptoms in in patients if i say nothing more i've just offered a single
example of a valuable insight coming from clinical psychology whether it be theoretical
or in the practice of therapy and of course there are many more than that singular CBD example that
i just gave it would not be hyperbolic for me to say and maybe i don't know enough about postmodernism
but i think i do you can't even come up with one i don't mean you i mean in general yeah no one
can come up with a single example as simple as me just enunciating the the value of cognitive
behavior therapy at that level you can't come up with one postmodernist insight the only insight
that we have is that we are shackled by subjectivity we are shackled by our personal biases and that is
true and any human being with a functioning brain could have told you that so do we need to build
well that kind of criticism has been leveled within fields by the practitioners in those
fields many times including by the postmodernists to their field i i would hesitate to say i would
say you know reflexively i would say no because if everything's a language game then why play
the postmodernist game you know why does it why does it obtain privileged status in the
hierarchy of truth claims if if if there's nothing more than the world that's produced by language
well i i think i mean because some of your viewers might be saying but why are they spending so much
time on postmodernism and there are other idea practices the reason why actually it's important
to talk about postmodernism because it's it's a fundamental attack on the epistemology of truth
that's right when that is something we need to point out why that's right exactly right so
so i had a uh a very good friend of mine who actually happens to be a clinical psychologist
also just a lovely guy uh who once asked me very politely he said you know gad do you mind
if i ask you a personal question i said go ahead he said how come you are such a truth defender and
so on and you're perfectly happy to criticize all these leftist idea pathogens very much along the
lines of how you started our conversation today jordan and yet you're not as critical of donald
trump's attacks on truth and so let me answer that question here because in a sense it will sound
a good one right so trump attacks specific truth statements i have the biggest penis all women
have told me that i'm the greatest lover ever there's never been a president who is as great as me
i have the biggest audiences at my rallies each of these might be demonstrably false and lies and
therefore they are taxed on a particular truth statement that to me is a lot less problematic
while it is reprehensible i disagree with any form of lying that is a lot less concerning to me
than a group of folks that are devoted to attacking the epistemology of truth
therefore define that and define the epistemology of truth so that we can get right down the
border is a way of tackling truth the nomological networks that we spoke about earlier is a way
of adjudicating between competing statements as to what is true or not those are so the scientific
method and and all of its offshoots are ways by which we've agreed that that's the epistemology
by which we create core knowledge and then build that front right okay so so let's let's outline
that a little bit so so that's a that's a really good point i so there are there are degrees
there are degrees of assault on truth yes and the more fundamental the axiom that you're
assaulting the more dangerous you're assault bingo okay so so the non-postmodernist claim
so maybe this is the enlightenment claim perhaps is that there is a reality i think it's deeper
than that because i think it's that's actually grounded in in judaeo christian christianity
and and even and and grounded far beyond that probably grounded in biology itself but doesn't
matter for the sake of this discussion there is an objective world there is a knowable reality
yes okay there's a no knowable reality that multiple people can have access to
there's a knowable reality but our biases and and limitations intellectually and and physiologically
make it difficult for us to to know it it's complex and we're limited there's a method by
which we can overcome that the method is the nomological method which you just described
essentially which is the the use of multiple um lines of evidence yes lines of evidence to
derive from multiple sources multiple people multiple places across time that enables us to
determine with some certainty what that objective reality is that enables us to predict and control
things for our benefit beautiful okay and the post the postmodernists the postmodern attack
is on all of that everything it's that's and that's why now i hope you might agree that it's not too
harsh for me to say they are intellectual terrorists because they put these little bombs of bs
that blow up the nomological network that blows up the epistemology of truth right and so you're
making a claim even beyond that though in in the book which is and this is the claim that i want to
get right too which is that they put forward that theory in order to benefit from being theorists
that that benefit accrues to them personally as they ratchet themselves up their respective
intellectual hierarchies and gain the status and power that goes along with that and the fact
that it does damage to the entire system of knowledge itself is irrelevant that's that's
that's that's uh what do you call that damage that you don't mean when you bomb something
collateral damage collateral damage right so they're willing to sacrifice the entire game of
truth seeking to the promotion of their own individual careers within this
within the language hierarchy that that that they've built and by the way you hit on a wonderful
segue to another i think important point in the book and that is the distinction between
the ontological ethics and consequentialist ethics right the ontological ethics for the
viewers who don't know if i say it is always wrong to lie that's an absolute statement right
if i say it is okay to lie if i'm trying to spare my spouse's feelings that's a consequential
statement well it turns out in many cases the ones who espouse those parasitic idea pathogens
are engaging their consequentialist ethical system right because what they're saying is
if i murder truth in the service of this more important noble social justice goal so be it right
whereas if you are an absolutist and the ontological you're you're pausing an objective
reality even in the domain of ethics well that's another place where the the postmodern
effort fails is that it can't help but refer to things that are outside of the language game so
by relying on consequentialist ethics and i'd have to i haven't been able to think it through
just figure out whether i agree with your claim that the postmodernists tend to be
consequentialists it makes sense to me and i think that their emphasis on hurt feelings is
an indication of that right never because there's no objective reality you can't sacrifice people's
feelings or lived experience to any claim about objective reality but by doing that they elevate
the subjective to the position of ultimate authority and you know maybe that's
maybe that's part of the driving motivation is the the the desire to elevate the subjective
to omniscience exactly and and this is why and so i i know you're not mathematically uh
you know minded but if i can just divert into my background of mathematics in the book i talk
about the field of operations research which is the field where you try to
axiomatize if you'd like to to put an axiomatic form an objective function that you're trying to
maximize or minimize right so for example when i was a a research assistant when i was a
undergrad and a graduate student i worked on a problem called the two-dimensional cutting
stock problem uh so if you have for example uh rectangles of metal and you get an order
to produce 20 x by y sub sheets within that broader metal how should i do the cut
as to minimize the waste of metal so operations research is a field that is commonly applied
for example in in business problems where you're trying to minimize the queue time that consumers
wait or maximize profits right so it's a very very complicated mathematical field applied
mathematics field to solve real world problems so now let's apply it to this consequential story
in the old days the objective function of a university was maximize intellectual growth
maximize uh human knowledge today it is predicated on the idea that there was knowledge
that was that was genuine there was a difference between forms of knowledge some were better than
others some were more valid than others right so that's part of the claim that you can have
knowledge at all exactly whereas now the objective function is minimize hurt feelings or it might be
maximize learning whilst minimizing hurt well you know i wouldn't mind that so much if if the claim
that feelings were ultimately real was made tangible because then at least we'd have an
ultimate reality that was outside of words but you can't say that the world is a construct of
words and then say at the same time but there's nothing more real than my subjective feelings
like i have some sympathy for that because i'm not sure that there is anything more real than pain
all things considered like pain seems really real to me and it's fundamentally subjective
and i think that a lot of what we consider ethical behavior is an attempt to minimize
pain given its fundamental reality so it's not like i don't believe that subjective feelings
are real and important but i'm willing to claim that there is such a thing as real and important
and true and so it's so it's it's logically coherent for me to to to make that claim it's
the incoherence of the claims that bothers me right well it's part of what bothers me
was we should we should probably sum up to some degree because we'd be going for a while
i know i know but i'm starting to get i'm starting to get tired and and i'm starting to lose my
train of concentration and so i don't i don't want to do anything but a top-rate job on this
let me summarize for a second what we've discussed and then if you have other things to add that we
haven't talked about then we can go there so we talked about ideas as parasites and and then we
spent some time unraveling what parasite might meant might mean and the conversation moved
so that we kind of built a two-dimensional or two strata model of parasitization of a parasitical
idea there'd be the parasitical behavior of the theorist who puts forth a theory that mimics
a practically useful theory in a in in the attempt to accrue to himself or herself
goods that have been produced by theories that actually have broad practical utility
so there's that and then there's the parasitical idea that serves that function for the person
who's using it in a parasitical way okay so and then we talked about post-modern ideas in
particular as examples of that and i guess the one one of the things we haven't tied together
there is exactly how the why is it necessary or why has it happened that the ontological and
epistemological claims of the post-modernists aid in a bet the parasitical function that's
that's a tough one like why did they take the the shape they actually took yeah that's actually
i i make an attempt to explain that and let me know if if you buy it so remember earlier i was
talking about what are some of the commonalities across the idea pathogens yeah and i said that
they they kind of start off with a kernel of truth and they start off with some noble original
goal the other thing that i would say which i think answers the question that you just posed
is that each of those idea pathogens freeze us from the pesky shackles of reality right so in a
sense they are liberated right so post-modernism yes liberates me from capital t truth there is
my truth there is my lived experience the trans prefix liberates me from the shackles of my biology
and my genitalia so it's the attractiveness of that liberation that that provides the
that provides the motive at least in part the lure of the parasite exactly right i if biology is
useless i don't need to know anything about it and people do that a lot people do that a lot
look social constructivism another one of those idea pathogens freeze me from the shackles of
realizing that i will never be nor will my son be the next michael jordan because social constructivism
as espoused originally in by behaviorism right the the famous quote which i i cite in the book
give me 12 children and i could make anyone a beggar or a surgeon or whatever that is basically
saying that it's only the unique socialization forces that constrain you in life that don't
turn you into the next michael jordan there is nothing apriori that didn't start us all with
equal potentiality well that's a lovely message well it's two now you got two messages there is
my subjective reality is the only reality that's the first thing and the second thing is socialization
can produce any outcome so that's a huge that's a huge exp that's a huge expansion of my potential
power right i'm right by dint of my existence and my ability to modify the nature of reality is
without without restriction yeah exactly exactly and therefore it is hopeful because it frees me
from the shackles of the constraints of reality right i want to believe that any child that i
could have produced could have genuinely had an equal probability of being the next albert
einstein or michael jordan that's hopeful that's wonderful it's also rooted in bullshit right
so i think all of these idea pathogens share the the common desire for people to believe
hopeful messages that are rooted in nonsense well that's probably a good place to stop
hey jordan so nice to see you we've been discussing the parasitic mind by gad sod and
when was it published uh october 6 of this past year so it's it's just a bit more than three months
how's it doing it's uh if it's due if you're comparing it to all possible books it's a mash
smashing success if we compare it to jordan peterson's last book then it's not doing very well
so it's life is about i don't want to compare my next book to that book so but it's been doing well
hey it's it's doing very well thank you so good i'm glad to hear it i'm glad to hear it so do you
think we did we miss anything in our discussion no i well we did but it was the discussion
sufficiently complete so that you're satisfied with i am more than anything i'm just satisfied
that you're feeling better that your family is doing well that you're back into this on the saddle
and that hopefully will have your voice and i've been trying to hold the fort but having someone
like you missing makes it that much tougher so i'm i'm so glad you're back big e hug to you
and thank you so much for inviting me jordan thank you it i'm thank you very much for for talking with
me i found it very enjoyable and i i felt that i i got i know something more than i did when i
started the conversation which is always the hallmark of a good conversation and i mean we can
dig into these things the things we discussed today endlessly we never get to the bottom of them
fully but but maybe a little bit farther with each genuine conversation and maybe maybe the next
when your book comes out you'll be sure to come on my show so that we can discuss yes well if i if
i have the wherewithal and the energy i'd be happy to do that and maybe we can discuss some of the
things that where we haven't established any concordance i know that i'll just i noticed that
you would talk admiringly about role theory in the parasitic mind and i kind of and i'd notice
before that you're not very fond of the idea of archetypes and i thought without something we could
talk about at some point because let's do it i think archetypes are biologically instantiated
roles and so it seems to me that we could probably come to some agreement on that front i actually
agree with you if we leave it within the biological realm then an analysis of archetypes works well
for me when we start introducing a bit of the kind of mythological occultist stuff that
regrettably one of your heroes engages in that's when i start yeah well that's something that we
could profitably discuss because i i think there's a much stronger biological um
well look at it this way god if you imagined imagine a culture imagined an ideal
and then imagine that approximations to that ideal people who approximated that ideal
were more biologically fit as a consequence they were more attractive which you would be if you
embodied a true ideal well so what that would mean is that over time the society would come
to evolve towards its imagined ideal yes so that makes a biologically instantiated archetype a very
complicated thing because it starts an imagination but it ends it instantiated in biology and no
one's ever come up with a real mechanism for that right it doesn't but but that works you you pause
it an ideal then if you manifest it you're more attractive then the ideal starts to become something
that evolution tilts toward so i'm in agreement with everything you said so maybe we won't have
much to disagree about yeah well well we should be able to clear things up anyways and sometimes
that's a good way of resolving disagreements i look forward to adjourning so good okay okay god
thanks very much hey my pleasure all right bye bye bye bye take care
