L'acc��l��ration du changement social
Caract��risation
Caract��risation : transformation grandissante des modes d'association sociale , des formes de pratique et de la substance du savoir (pratique). Les rythmes de changement sont eux-m��mes en train de changer. Ainsi, les attitudes et les valeurs autant que les modes de vie, relations et obligations sociales autant que les groupes, classes ou milieux, les langages sociaux autant que les formes de pratiques et les habitudes changent �� des rythmes en constante augmentation. C'est ce qui peut-��tre appel�� Acceleration de la soci��t��.

D��finition
Il n'y a aujourd'hui pas d'indicateurs pertinents permettant une mesure de la vitesse de changement d'une soci��t��. Hartmut Rosa propose d'utiliser le concept de [[Compression du pr��sent]]^[ Hermann L��bbe : la compression du pr��sent rel��ve d'une acc��l��ration des vitesses d'innovation, culturelle et sociale] comme rep��re permettant une mesure empirique. Aussi, "l'acc��l��ration sociale est d��finie par une augmentation de la vitesse de d��clin de la fiabilit�� des exp��riences et des attentes et par la compression des dur��es d��finies comme le pr��sent". La stabilit�� des institutions^[ [[Institution]] ] et des pratiques sociales peut servir de rep��re pour mesurer l'acc��l��ration / la d��c��l��ration du changement social.

Exemple d'acc��l��ration de changement social dans la famille et le travail (voir [[Institution]] ainsi que [[Modernit��]]) :

pr��moderne > moderne : passage d'un rythme - de changement - interg��n��rationnel �� un rythme g��n��rationnel.
moderne > post-moderne : passage d'un rythme - de changement - g��n��rationnel �� un rythme intrag��n��rationnel
Note compl��mentaire
Arjun Appadura�� : remplace la symbolisation du monde social en tant qu'ensemble de groupements sociaux stables localisables sur une carte, par des ��crans fluides et turbulents representant des flux culturels qui ponctuellement se cristallisent en diff��rents paysages ( [[Ethnoscape et ethnosph��re]], [[Technoscape et technosph��re]], [[Finanscape et finansph��re]], [[Mediascape et m��diasph��re]], [[Ideoscape et id��osph��re]] ).

<< [[Social Acceleration]]
The acceleration of social change
Characterization
Characterization: Growing transformation of social association modes, forms of practice, and the substance of knowledge (practice). The rhythms of change themselves are changing. Thus, attitudes and values as much as lifestyles, social relations and obligations, as well as groups, classes, or environments, social languages as much as forms of practices and habits are changing at constantly increasing rates. This can be called the Acceleration of society.
Definition
There are no relevant indicators today to measure a society's rate of change. Hartmut Rosa suggests using the concept of [[Compression of the Present]]^[ Hermann L��bbe: The compression of the present is due to an acceleration of innovation, cultural and social speeds] as a benchmark for empirical measurement. Therefore, "social acceleration is defined by an increase in the speed of decline of the reliability of experiences and expectations and by the compression of durations defined as the present." The stability of institutions^[ [[Institution]] ] and social practices can serve as a benchmark for measuring the acceleration / deceleration of social change.
Example of acceleration of social change in family and work (see [[Institution]] and [[Modernity]]) :
pre-modern > modern : shift from an intergenerational rhythm - of change - to a generational rhythm.
modern > post-modern : shift from a generational rhythm - of change - to an intra-generational rhythm.
Complementary Note
Arjun Appadurai: replaces the symbolization of the social world as a set of stable social groupings locatable on a map, with fluid and turbulent screens representing cultural flows that periodically crystallize into different landscapes ( [[Ethnoscape and Ethnosphere]], [[Technoscape and Technosphere]], [[Finanscape and Finanosphere]], [[Mediascape and Mediasphere]], [[Ideoscape and Ideosphere]] ).
