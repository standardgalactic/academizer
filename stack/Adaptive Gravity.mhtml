Scientists propose 'adaptive gravity' as a versatile model for collective animal behavior
by Institute of Physics

A team of researchers based in Israel and the US has found a mathematical resemblance between swarm dynamics and gravitational interactions. The study, which has just been published in the New Journal of Physics, could provide a big leap forward in understanding the mass movement of flying insects.


Scientists have long been fascinated by the collective behaviour of animals. The coordinated motion of schools of fish or flocks of birds, for example, can be built up from short-range interactions where individuals tend to move much like their neighbours. So far, so good, until you get to the swarming of insects, where a different approach is required.

Unlike fish or birds, insects don't align with each other when in motion and the dominant interaction keeping the swarm together appears to be much longer range. To find out more, the team decided to focus on midges as they are straightforward to raise and study in a controlled lab environment. The experiments were performed at Yale University in the US with theoretical input provided by researchers from the Weizmann Institute, Israel.

In common with other insects such as fruit flies, moths and bees, midges have an organ that is sensitive to sound known as the Johnston's organ, which is a part of their antennae. To the researchers, this highlighted the likely importance of acoustic interactions in swarming, where sound is created as the flying insects beat their wings.

"We started from the assumption that when one midge hears another, it reacts by accelerating towards the source with a strength that is proportional to the received sound intensity," said Dan Gorbonos, a member of Weizmann research team. "The decay rate of the sound intensity falls off according to an inverse-square law - just as the gravitational attraction between two masses does."

In applying their model of collective animal behaviour, the scientists found a similarity in the structure of midge swarms and astrophysical objects such as globular clusters that consist of thousands of stars. However, there is a major difference between the real gravity that acts between masses and this effective acoustic interaction that the group dubs 'adaptive gravity'.

To understand the team's approach, it's helpful to consider that for many animals the perception of sound is not fixed, but instead adapts to the total sound intensity. Our ears, for example, behave in this way. We find it easy to decipher a whisper in a quiet environment, but people have to shout to be understood in a noisy room.

"Although not much is known about the physiology of the midge, we expect to find a similar mechanism in the Johnston's organ," commented Gorbonos. "Therefore, we would expect that the midges will reduce their sensitivity in a densely populated environment, and we found evidence for that in the experimental data."

This 'adaptivity' feature helps to explain why the swarm doesn't collapse in on itself despite the gravity-like interaction. When the background buzzing noise is too high, and the local environment is too dense, the sensitivity is lowered and each individual midge reacts less to the attractive pull of its neighbours.


Collaborative approach
The video capture and analysis used by the team to generate the experimental data for testing its mathematical model was first developed to examine turbulent fluid flows. Nick Ouellette, now based at Stanford University, originally wrote the software for particle tracking and then later explored its application as a tool for measuring midge swarms. James Puckett and Rui Ni (who were then postdocs in Ouellette's lab) helped to demonstrate the process.

"Our collaboration started when Ouellette visited the Weizmann Institute and gave a seminar about his midge research, which got Nir Gov's attention," said Gorbonos. "It was Gov's idea to borrow tools from gravitation to model the midges, which led to the results in this paper." Reuven Ianconescu joined the team led by Nir Gov to work on the simulations, followed by Gorbonos, whose background is in the area of gravitational physics.

The group sees this adaptive model is a prototype for descriptions of various kinds of collective systems with long range interactions - ranging from other acoustic interactions in the animal kingdom through to much smaller scale biological systems such as swarming cells.</div></div><div class="flex justify-between lg:block"><div class="text-xs flex items-center justify-center gap-1 self-center

the dynamics of animal swarms, particularly insects, and gravitational interactions. This research could revolutionize our understanding of collective animal behavior, especially the mass movement of flying insects.</p><p>Unlike birds or fish, insects do not tend to align with one another when moving, and the key interaction keeping swarms together seems to be much longer-range. The researchers focused their study on midges, insects that are easy to breed and study in a controlled environment. The team found that acoustic interactions played a significant role in insect swarming, with the sound created by the insects flapping their wings likely being a major component.</p><p>The team proposed the idea of 'adaptive gravity', an idea inspired by the observation that many animals have a perception of sound that isn't fixed, but adapts to the total sound intensity in their environment. Similar to how we lower our sensitivity to sound in a noisy environment, the midges may also reduce their sensitivity in densely populated environments. This adaptive feature could explain why swarms do not collapse on themselves despite the gravity-like interaction.</p><p>This novel model of 'adaptive gravity' could become a prototype for understanding various collective systems with long-range interactions. The possibilities range from other acoustic interactions in the animal kingdom to much smaller biological systems such as swarming cells. The adaptive model not only provides insights into the fascinating world of insect behavior but may also inspire new approaches in studying different collective systems, which may have applications in areas as diverse as robotics, crowd control, or understanding the behavior of cells.</p></div></div></div><div class="flex justify-between lg:block"><div class="text-xs flex items-center justify-center gap-1 self-center pt-2 !invisible"><button disabled="" class="dark:text-white disabled:text-gray-300 dark:disabled:text-gray-400"><svg stroke="currentColor" fill="none" stroke-width="1.5" viewBox="0 0 24 24" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" class="h-3 w-3" height="1em" width="1em" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg"><polyline points="15 18 9 12 15 6"></polyline></svg></button><span class="flex-grow flex-shrink-0">1 / 1</span><button disabled="" class="dark:text-white disabled:text-gray-300 dark:disabled:text-gray-400"><svg stroke="currentColor" fill="none" stroke-width="1.5" viewBox="0 0 24 24" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" class="h-3 w-3" height="1em" width="1em" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg"><polyline points="9 18 15 12 9 6"></polyline></svg></button></div><div class="text-gray-400 flex self-end lg:self-center justify-center mt-2 gap-2 md:gap-3 lg:gap-1 lg:absolute lg:top-0 lg:translate-x-full lg:right-0 lg:mt-0 lg:pl-2 visible"><button class="flex ml-auto gap-2 rounded-md p-1 hover:bg-gray-100 hover:text-gray-700 dark:text-gray-400 dark:hover:bg-gray-700 dark:hover:text-gray-200 disabled:dark:hover:text-gray-400"><svg stroke="currentColor" fill="none" stroke-width="2" viewBox="0 0 24 24" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" class="h-4 w-4" height="1em" width="1em" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg"><path d="M16 4h2a2 2 0 0 1 2 2v14a2 2 0 0 1-2 2H6a2 2 0 0 1-2-2V6a2 2 0 0 1 2-2h2"></path><rect x="8" y="2" width="8" height="4" rx="1" ry="1"></rect></svg></button><div class="flex gap-1"><button class="p-1 rounded-md hover:bg-gray-100 hover:text-gray-700 dark:text-gray-400 dark:hover:bg-gray-700 dark:hover:text-gray-200 disabled:dark:hover:text-gray-400"><svg stroke="currentColor" fill="none" stroke-width="2" viewBox="0 0 24 24" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" class="h-4 w-4" height="1em" width="1em" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg"><path d="M14 9V5a3 3 0 0 0-3-3l-4 9v11h11.28a2 2 0 0 0 2-1.7l1.38-9a2 2 0 0 0-2-2.3zM7 22H4a2 2 0 0 1-2-2v-7a2 2 0 0 1 2-2h3"></path></svg></button><button class="p-1 rounded-md hover:bg-gray-100 hover:text-gray-700 dark:text-gray-400 dark:hover:bg-gray-700 dark:hover:text-gray-200 disabled:dark:hover:text-gray-400"><svg stroke="currentColor" fill="none" stroke-width="2" viewBox="0 0 24 24" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" class="h-4 w-4" height="1em" width="1em" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg"><path d="M10 15v4a3 3 0 0 0 3 3l4-9V2H5.72a2 2 0 0 0-2 1.7l-1.38 9a2 2 0 0 0 2 2.3zm7-13h2.67A2.31 2.31 0 0 1 22 4v7a2.31 2.31 0 0 1-2.33 2H17"></path></svg></button></div></div></div></div></div></div><div class="group w-full text-gray-800 dark:text-gray-100 border-b border-black/10 dark:border-gray-900/50 dark:bg-gray-800"><div class="flex p-4 gap-4 text-base md:gap-6 md:max-w-2xl lg:max-w-[38rem] xl:max-w-3xl md:py-6 lg:px-0 m-auto"><div class="flex-shrink-0 flex flex-col relative items-end"><div class="w-[30px]"><div class="relative flex"><span style="box-sizing: border-box; display: inline-block; overflow: hidden; width: initial; height: initial; background: none; opacity: 1; border: 0px; margin: 0px; padding: 0px; position: relative; max-width: 100%;"><span style="box-sizing: border-box; display: block; width: initial; height: initial; background: none; opacity: 1; border: 0px; margin: 0px; padding: 0px; max-width: 100%;"><img alt="" aria-hidden="true" src="data:image/svg+xml,%3csvg%20xmlns=%27http://www.w3.org/2000/svg%27%20version=%271.1%27%20width=%2738%27%20height=%2738%27/%3e" style="display: block; max-width: 100%; width: initial; height: initial; background: none; opacity: 1; border: 0px; margin: 0px; padding: 0px;"></span><img alt="User" src="https://chat.openai.com/_next/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Flh3.googleusercontent.com%2Fa%2FAAcHTtfE_9fVpMOqgyC7Lo43NLrKgIo-u2ToDOuYOa2T%3Ds96-c&amp;w=96&amp;q=75" decoding="async" data-nimg="intrinsic" class="rounded-sm" style="position: absolute; inset: 0px; box-sizing: border-box; padding: 0px; border: none; margin: auto; display: block; width: 0px; height: 0px; min-width: 100%; max-width: 100%; min-height: 100%; max-height: 100%;" width="30" height="30"></span></div></div></div><div class="relative flex w-[calc(100%-50px)] flex-col gap-1 md:gap-3 lg:w-[calc(100%-115px)]"><div class="flex flex-grow flex-col gap-3"><div class="min-h-[20px] flex flex-col items-start gap-4 whitespace-pre-wrap break-words">

Tiny insects become 'visible' to bats when they swarm

Small insects that would normally be undetectable to bats using echolocation suddenly become detectable when they occur in large swarms. Arjan Boonman of Tel-Aviv University and colleagues present these findings in&nbsp;PLOS Computational Biology.

Bats use echolocation to hunt insects, many of which fly in swarms. In this process, bats emit a sound signal that bounces off the target object, revealing its location. However, few studies have addressed what swarms of insects—as opposed to single insects—"look" like in the world of bat echolocation.

Now, Boonman and colleagues have combined 3-D computer simulations of insect swarms with real-world measurements of bat echolocation signals to examine how bats sense swarms that vary in size and density. They found that&nbsp;small insects&nbsp;that are probably undetectable alone, such as mosquitos, suddenly become "visible" to bats when they occur in large swarms.

They also discovered that a feature of bat echolocation signals called Quasi Constant Frequency (QCF), whose function was previously unknown, turns out to be well suited to the task of detecting insect swarms. QCF signals appear to be ideal for detecting an object if more than one target is inside the signal beam at once.

"With our simulations, we investigated something that could never have been measured in reality," Boonman says. "Modeling enabled us to have full control over any aspect of an insect swarm, even the full elimination of the shape of each insect within the swarm."

The findings could provide new insights into the evolution of bat echolocation; bats may have been able to gradually improve their&nbsp;echolocation&nbsp;abilities by hunting swarms of insects without being limited to only very large insects. The findings could also explain why tiny insects are found in the diets of&nbsp;bats&nbsp;that seem to use frequencies too high to effectively detect them.

Moreover, the algorithms developed for this study could potentially be applied to radar echoes of drone swarms in order to lower the probability of detection by enemy radar.

found that small insects, which would typically be undetectable to bats using echolocation, become noticeable when they swarm together. The findings were reported in PLOS Computational Biology.</p><p>Bats use echolocation for hunting insects, including those that fly in swarms. This process involves bats emitting a sound signal that bounces off an object, thus revealing its location. However, the way swarms of insects appear to bats through echolocation, as opposed to single insects, has been less studied.</p><p>By combining 3D computer simulations of insect swarms with real-world measurements of bat echolocation signals, the researchers were able to investigate how bats perceive swarms of varying sizes and densities. The team found that small insects, such as mosquitoes, become "visible" to bats when they occur in large swarms.</p><p>Interestingly, the researchers discovered that a feature of bat echolocation signals known as Quasi Constant Frequency (QCF) is particularly well suited for detecting insect swarms. QCF signals are ideal for detecting an object if more than one target is within the signal beam at the same time.</p><p>These findings offer new insights into the evolution of bat echolocation; it is suggested that bats may have gradually improved their echolocation abilities by hunting swarms of insects without being limited to only very large insects. Additionally, this research may explain why tiny insects are found in the diets of bats that seem to use frequencies too high to effectively detect them.</p><p>Furthermore, the algorithms developed for this study might have practical applications. For example, they could potentially be applied to radar echoes of drone swarms to reduce the likelihood of detection by enemy radar.</p></div></div></div><div class="flex justify-between

Could studying swarm behaviors teach us how to help drones fly safely?

Anyone who's seen a flock of starlings twist and turn across the sky may have wondered: How do they maneuver in such close formation without colliding?

"Many types of animals swarm or flock or otherwise move in coordinated ways," says Nicholas Ouellette, an associate professor of civil and environmental engineering at Stanford. "No individual animal knows what every other animal is doing, yet somehow they move cohesively as a group."

Understanding precisely how they do this, Ouellette says, may be a key to helping engineers design "flocks" of aerial drones and driverless cars. Emulating animal swarms is attractive because they not only operate without central control but they're also fault-tolerant, to use an engineering term, meaning they can adapt quickly and gracefully to sudden or unexpected conditions. Swarms are also resilient in that they can operate in dirty, disturbed environments.

So Ouellette and his team have embarked on a series of studies that explore how animal swarms develop the kind of self-organized and self-regulated systems that would allow devices such as drones and mobile sensors to operate safely and efficiently, without the sort of top-down controls that typify, for example, something like the&nbsp;air traffic control&nbsp;system.

Rather than examine starlings or other birds, which would be impractical to study in the lab because of the space they need to fly, Ouellette and his crew look at non-biting midges, a type of flying insect often found near water or in the shade of trees. Unlike starlings, whose graceful formations, called murmurations, make us stare up at the sky, midges buzz around in chaotic, cloud-like masses. But, says Ouellette, midge swarms still share common features with bird flocks and other animal groups, in that the swarms stay cohesive without any outside control or leadership.

"Midges are so small, they're easy to keep in a lab," Ouellette says. "They swarm at dusk and dawn and are easy to cue with lights." In his lab, the midges live in a roughly 5-foot plastic cube, surrounded by high-speed cameras that he uses to reconstruct 3-D trajectories for each insect—direction, acceleration—all the essential kinematic information needed to characterize swarm movements.

Working in the lab allows Ouellette's team to run experiments to test different models. The team starts with observed data taken from the camera images. Then they use this data to test hypotheses about what sorts of rules might govern midge movements. But because natural swarm behavior does not provide enough information to distinguish between many hypotheses, the researchers also disrupt the swarm using light and sound to observe whether the real swarm is affected as their proposed rules had predicted.

Ouellette says it's too early to design artificial systems that behave the same way as&nbsp;animal groups. But his team is developing the sort of experimental environment that other researchers may one day use to build and test high-tech systems based on the bottom-up wisdom of the swarms rather than the top-down rules that typify many technological undertakings.

"As engineers we like to control things," Ouellette says. "But we have a lot to learn from insects and other animals that operate just fine without human command and&nbsp;control&nbsp;frameworks

Nicholas Ouellette, an associate professor of civil and environmental engineering at Stanford University, and his team. They are studying the swarm behaviors of animals, such as birds and insects, to potentially help design swarms of aerial drones or driverless cars. This study aims to understand how animals move in cohesive groups without any central control and without individual animals knowing what every other animal is doing.</p><p>The researchers have chosen to focus on midges, a type of small, non-biting flying insect. These creatures swarm in chaotic, cloud-like masses but maintain cohesion without external control or leadership. Studying midges is practical because they are easy to keep in a lab and their behavior can be manipulated with light cues.</p><p>Ouellette's team uses high-speed cameras to reconstruct 3D trajectories for each insect, providing data about direction, acceleration, and other essential kinematic information needed to characterize swarm movements. They then use this data to test hypotheses about the potential rules that govern midge movements. They also disturb the swarm using light and sound to observe how the swarm is affected, testing whether the reactions align with their proposed rules.</p><p>While it is currently too early to design artificial systems that mimic the behavior of animal groups, the team is developing the sort of experimental environment that could potentially be used by other researchers to build and test high-tech systems based on swarm behavior. This approach can lead to systems that operate efficiently and safely without the need for top-down control.</p><p>The findings of Ouellette's study, the previously mentioned studies on swarm behavior and adaptive gravity, and studies on bat echolocation do share some connections, as they all delve into the principles of swarm behavior and how different species or technologies detect and respond to it. These principles could potentially be applied to design and control artificial systems like swarms of drones. However, while they share a common subject of study (swarm behavior), the specific goals, methodologies, and outcomes of these studies differ.</p></div></div></div><div class="flex justify-between lg:block"><div class="text-xs flex items-center justify-center gap-1 self-center pt-2 !invisible"><button disabled="" class="dark:text-white disabled:text-gray-300 dark:disabled:text-gray-400"><svg stroke="currentColor" fill="none" stroke-width="1.5" viewBox="0 0 24 24" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" class="h-3 w-3" height="1em" width="1em" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg"><polyline points="15 18 9 12 15 6"></polyline></svg></button><span class="flex-grow flex-shrink-0">1 / 1</span><button disabled="" class="dark:text-white disabled:text-gray-300 dark:disabled:text-gray-400"><svg stroke="currentColor" fill="none" stroke-width="1.5" viewBox="0 0 24 24" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" class="h-3 w-3" height="1em" width="1em" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg"><polyline points="9 18 15 12 9 6"></polyline></svg></button></div><div class="text-gray-400 flex self-end lg:self-center justify-center mt-2 gap-2 md:gap-3 lg:gap-1 lg:absolute lg:top-0 lg:translate-x-full lg:right-0 lg:mt-0 lg:pl-2 visible"><button class="flex ml-auto gap-2 rounded-md p-1 hover:bg-gray-100 hover:text-gray-700 dark:text-gray-400 dark:hover:bg-gray-700 dark:hover:text-gray-200 disabled:dark:hover:text-gray-400"><svg stroke="currentColor" fill="none" stroke-width="2" viewBox="0 0 24 24" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" class="h-4 w-4" height="1em" width="1em" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg"><path d="M16 4h2a2 2 0 0 1 2 2v14a2 2 0 0 1-2 2H6a2 2 0 0 1-2-2V6a2 2 0 0 1 2-2h2"></path><rect x="8" y="2" width="8" height="4" rx="1" ry="1"></rect></svg></button><div class="flex gap-1"><button class="p-1 rounded-md hover:bg-gray-100 hover:text-gray-700 dark:text-gray-400 dark:hover:bg-gray-700 dark:hover:text-gray-200 disabled:dark:hover:text-gray-400"><svg stroke="currentColor" fill="none" stroke-width="2" viewBox="0 0 24 24" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" class="h-4 w-4" height="1em" width="1em" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg"><path d="M14 9V5a3 3 0 0 0-3-3l-4 9v11h11.28a2 2 0 0 0 2-1.7l1.38-9a2 2 0 0 0-2-2.3zM7 22H4a2 2 0 0 1-2-2v-7a2 2 0 0 1 2-2h3"></path></svg></button><button class="p-1 rounded-md hover:bg-gray-100 hover:text-gray-700 dark:text-gray-400 dark:hover:bg-gray-700 dark:hover:text-gray-200 disabled:dark:hover:text-gray-400"><svg stroke="currentColor" fill="none" stroke-width="2" viewBox="0 0 24 24" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" class="h-4 w-4" height="1em" width="1em" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg"><path d="M10 15v4a3 3 0 0 0 3 3l4-9V2H5.72a2 2 0 0 0-2 1.7l-1.38 9a2 2 0 0 0 2 2.3zm7-13h2.67A2.31 2.31 0 0 1 22 4v7a2.31 2.31 0 0 1-2.33 2H17"></path></svg></button></div></div></div></div></div></div><div class="group w-full text-gray-800 dark:text-gray-100 border-b border-black/10 dark:border-gray-900/50 dark:bg-gray-800"><div class="flex p-4 gap-4 text-base md:gap-6 md:max-w-2xl lg:max-w-[38rem] xl:max-w-3xl md:py-6 lg:px-0 m-auto"><div class="flex-shrink-0 flex flex-col relative items-end"><div class="w-[30px]"><div class="relative flex"><span style="box-sizing: border-box; display: inline-block; overflow: hidden; width: initial; height: initial; background: none; opacity: 1; border: 0px; margin: 0px; padding: 0px; position: relative; max-width: 100%;"><span style="box-sizing: border-box; display: block; width: initial; height: initial; background: none; opacity: 1; border: 0px; margin: 0px; padding: 0px; max-width: 100%;"><img alt="" aria-hidden="true" src="data:image/svg+xml,%3csvg%20xmlns=%27http://www.w3.org/2000/svg%27%20version=%271.1%27%20width=%2738%27%20height=%2738%27/%3e" style="display: block; max-width: 100%; width: initial; height: initial; background: none; opacity: 1; border: 0px; margin: 0px; padding: 0px;"></span><img alt="User" src="https://chat.openai.com/_next/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Flh3.googleusercontent.com%2Fa%2FAAcHTtfE_9fVpMOqgyC7Lo43NLrKgIo-u2ToDOuYOa2T%3Ds96-c&amp;w=96&amp;q=75" decoding="async" data-nimg="intrinsic" class="rounded-sm" style="position: absolute; inset: 0px; box-sizing: border-box; padding: 0px; border: none; margin: auto; display: block; width: 0px; height: 0px; min-width: 100%; max-width: 100%; min-height: 100%; max-height: 100%;" width="30" height="30"></span></div></div></div><div class="relative flex w-[calc(100%-50px)] flex-col gap-1 md:gap-3 lg:w-[calc(100%-115px)]"><div class="flex flex-grow flex-col gap-3"><div class="min-h-[20px] flex flex-col items-start gap-4 whitespace-pre-wrap break-words">Conferences &gt;2007 IEEE Lausanne Power Tech

Abstract:
This paper describes the performance of two population based search algorithms (Genetic Algorithms and Particle Swarm Optimization) when applied to Optimal Power Flow (OPF) including Static VAR Compensator (SVC) and Thyristor Controlled Series Compensator (TCSC) devices. The OPF optimizes a power system operating objective function, while satisfying a set of system operating constraints. The basic OPF solution is obtained with fuel cost minimization as the objective function and the optimal settings of the power system are determined. OPF can also be formulated for reactive power optimization, as minimization of system active power losses and improving the voltage stability in the system. In the present paper different objective functions that reflect Fuel cost minimization, System power loss minimization, Voltage Stability Enhancement (L-index minimization), Power loss minimization with SVC device and Power loss minimization with combined application of SVC and TCSC devices have been considered. To monitor and improve voltage stability in power system, minimization of sum of squared L-indices of all the load buses is considered as objective function in OPF. This index also guides the optimal location for VAR compensation. During normal operating conditions a planning engineer requires that all line flows and voltages are within limits while minimizing investment (including losses). While during outage conditions, line loading and voltages are again desired within limits while minimizing investment. It is important to obtain feasible solutions with in a minimal amount of engineering time.</div></div><div class="flex justify-between lg:block"><div class="text-xs flex items-center justify-center

The distinguishing characteristic of PCT is that the controlledvariables are the inputs (perceptions, as opposed to the system outputs). This paper presents the first direct comparison ofa PCT controller for a mobile robot (a two-wheeled ‘inverted pendulum’ balancing robot) with a classical control method,LQR. Simulations and experimental validation results show that the performance of the PCT controller is comparable to theLQR controller and better at disturbance rejection.Keywords Perceptual control theory ·Inverted pendulum ·Robot ·LQR control1 IntroductionHumans, other animals and a variety of machines can besaid to ‘behave’ [1]. Yet scientific theories that traverse thelife, social and physical sciences are rare. One such theoryis perceptual control theory (PCT) [2,3].Developed by a medical physicist, William Powers, inthe 1950s, it provides a functional architecture of behav-ior based on the principle that ‘behavior is the control ofperception’. Powers explained that for living mechanisms,the presence of individual purpose leads to control. Theycontrol neither their behaviour, nor external environmentalvariables. Instead living mechanisms control their percep-tions of those environmental variables when an internalmotivation appears [4].Its basic components map onto the negative feedbacksystem utilized ubiquitously within artificial control sys-tems and within existing models of behavior [5]. Thesesystems assume that the reference value (or goal state) forthe controlled variable, are inputted to the system from anoutside user, in the same way as a user sets a thermostat.Thomas Johnsonthomas.johnson-6@postgrad.manchester.ac.uk1University of Manchester, Oxford Road, Manchester,M13 9PL, UK2Perceptual Robots, Windsor, SL4 1TB, UKIn contrast, PCT explicitly places the reference valuewithin the control system. By doing so, the theory modelsthe system from the inside and permits the system to attemptto control its own sensory input by comparing the currentsensory signal to its internally specified reference value, andacting against disturbances in the environment to reduce thisdifference.Powers utilized this basic scheme to account for complexbehavior by proposing that the reference values are set bya cascade of downward signals from higher level units. Asimplified ‘real-life’ example can illustrate this. In order tosuccessfully sip from a cup of cold water (perception = tem-perature of lips; reference = cold), this level of this systemneeds to vary the desired transition in joint angle of the wristwhich is in turn managed by systems at successively lowerlevels. Only the lowest level in the hierarchy interfaces withthe body and environment. Here it varies actions to con-trol the current intensity of sensory input [2]. An extended‘real-life’ animated example of PCT hierarchical control isprovided at https://youtu.be/kE3EHvrpU7g. Whilst the hier-archical structure of both the nervous system and machinearchitectures is well founded [6,7], the specification ofdesired (rather than predicted) sensory inputs by downwardsignals appears unique to PCT.PCT proposes that a creature’s behaviour is variedso that their perceptions can reach and maintain certain,fixed limits, despite external disturbances. Control in livingsystems can be thought of as a process of continuallyadapting behaviour so that perceptions remain consistent
J Intell Robot SystFig. 1 A Diagram to show the Organisation of a Single-LevelPerceptual Control Systemwith the internal system purpose [8]. Figure 1presents aschematic diagram which shows a single hierarchical levelin Perceptual Control Theory.The distinguishing characteristic of perceptual controltheory is that the controlled variables are the inputs(perceptions, as opposed to the system outputs (behaviouralactions) [9]. When regarding PCT in the control engineeringdomain, the controlled perceptions are generally sensedor transformed functions of the system states, which areaffected by the system behaviours.The principal advantage of controlling the input is thatthe PCT control system uses the current environment(commonly known as the plant in control engineering) asa fundamental component of the control loop. Therefore,internal modelling of the environment to predict the ‘correctresponse’ is not required. Consequently, the PCT systemhas the capability to achieve and maintain control despiteunknown disturbances, including managing the inevitabledisturbances that result from the physical components of theliving organism (or robot) itself. The extension of the corePCT concept to a hierarchy of autonomous, inter-dependentunits each controlling their own degree of freedom indicatesa significant advantage over traditional approaches withthe potential to construct advanced behavioural systemscomposed merely of simple, nescient control units, negatingthe need to define complex models of world dynamics. ThePCT model also involves a form of random-walk learningalgorithm known as reorganization to further optimizeperformance, although this is not utilized in the currentstudy. Each of these properties entail that a PCT controller,in theory, is more robust and adaptive than traditionalcontrol methods.To date, empirical support for PCT has come largely fromconstructing and testing computational models of humanperformance against behavioural data. These models haveshown close fits across a range of experimental contexts [10,11]. There have also been a number of examples of success-ful applications of PCT to robotics, including an real-worldautonomous robotic rover [12] control of a robotic arm [13]and a hexapod simulation [14]. The autonomous rovershowed robust rejection of disturbances of various kinds.For example, it continuously monitored the degree of wheelmovement to match it with the current reference value, andwould continue to modify the current output to the wheelmotor to keep to this goal, regardless of any imperfectionsin the transmission systemDespite the above advances, no studies have directlycompared the validity of a PCT model with a compet-ing, widely used classical control approach for the sameactivity. Second, no studies have made this comparisonusing a robotic device. Third, no studies have systematicallycompared robustness against experimentally applied distur-bances.The benchmark of testing a theoretical model using arobot is particularly high, because it immediately establishesthe real-world validity in that it permits the physics andkinematics of behavior to be assessed. The comparisonvehicle chosen for this study is the inverted pendulumrobot, which is a popular benchmark for control theorycomparisons</div></div><div class="flex justify-between lg:block"><div

Perceptual Control Theory (PCT) and its application in controlling a two-wheeled inverted pendulum balancing robot. PCT theorizes that a creature's behavior is adjusted to ensure its perception can reach and maintain certain fixed limits, regardless of external disturbances.</p><p>The unique feature of PCT is that the controlled variables are the inputs (perceptions) rather than the system outputs. The study presents the first direct comparison of a PCT controller with a traditional control method, LQR (Linear Quadratic Regulator), for a mobile robot.</p><p>The paper demonstrates that the performance of the PCT controller is comparable to the LQR controller and even better in handling disturbances. The paper is a major step in real-world validation of PCT as it directly compares the validity of a PCT model with a traditional control approach for a robotic device, an inverted pendulum robot, a popular benchmark for control theory comparisons.</p><p>In PCT, the reference value is placed within the control system, allowing the system to attempt to control its sensory input by comparing the current sensory signal to its internally specified reference value. The system then acts against disturbances in the environment to reduce this difference.</p><p>A hierarchy of autonomous, inter-dependent units, each controlling their degree of freedom, is proposed in PCT. This results in a significant advantage over traditional approaches with the potential to build advanced behavioural systems composed of simple control units, without the need to define complex models of world dynamics.</p><p>Overall, PCT theory suggests a more robust and adaptive controller than traditional control methods, which could be beneficial in complex, dynamic environments, such as those faced by autonomous robots.</p></div></div></div><div class="flex justify-between lg:block"><div class="text-xs flex items-center justify-center gap-1 self-center pt-2 !invisible"><button disabled=""

Perceptualcontroltheory(PCT)isamodelofbehavior 
based on the principles of negative feedback, but dif f er- 
ing in important respects from engineering control the- 
ory. Results of PCT experiments have demonstrated that 
an organism controls neither its own behavior, nor exter- 
nal environmental variables, but rather its own percep- 
tions of those variables. Actions are not controlled, they 
arevariedsoastocanceltheef f ectsthatunpredictableen- 
vironmental disturbances would otherwise have on con- 
trolled perceptions.According to the standard catch- 
phrase of the i eld, “behavior is the control of percep- 
tion”. PCT demonstrates circular causation in a nega- 
tive feedback loop closed through the environment. This 
fundamentally contradicts the classical notion of linear 
causation of behavior by stimuli, in which environmental 
stimuli are thought to cause behavioral responses, medi- 
ated (according to Cognitive Psychology) by intervening 
cognitive processes. 
Numerous computer simulations of specif i c behavioral 
situations demonstrate its ef i cacy,[1]with extremely high 
correlations to observational data (0.95 or better), such as 
are routinely expected in physics and chemistry. While 
the adoption of PCT in the scientif i c community has not 
been widespread, it has been applied not only in experi- 
mental psychology and neuroscience, but also in sociol- 
ogy, linguistics, and a number of other i elds, and has led 
to a method of psychotherapy called the Method of Lev- 
els. 
PCT has roots in insights of Claude Bernard and 20th 
century control systems engineering and cybernetics. It 
was originated as such, and given its present form and 
experimental methodology, by William T. Powers.[2][3] 
1The place of purpose (intention) 
and causation in psychology 
A tradition from Aristotle through William James recog- 
nizes that behavior is purposeful rather than merely re- 
active. However, the only evidence for intentions was 
subjective.Behaviorists following Wundt, Thorndyke, 
Watson, and others rejected introspective reports as data 
for an objective science of psychology. Only observable 
behavior could be admitted as data.[4] 
There follows from this stance the assumption that envi- 
ronmental events (stimuli) cause behavioral actions (re- 
sponses). This assumption persists in cognitive psychol- 
ogy, which interposes cognitive maps and other postu- 
lated information processing between stimulus and re- 
sponse, but otherwise retains the assumption of linear 
causation from environment to behavior. 
Another, more specif i c reason for psychologists’ rejecting 
notionsofpurposeorintentionwasthattheycouldnotsee 
how a goal (a state that did not yet exist) could cause the 
behavior that led to it. PCT resolves these philosophical 
arguments about teleology because it provides a model of 
the functioning of organisms in which purpose has objec- 
tivestatuswithoutrecoursetointrospection, andinwhich 
causation is circular around feedback loops. 
2History 
The unaf i liated scientist William T. Powers recognized 
that to be purposeful implies control, and that the con- 
cepts and methods of engineered control systems could 
be applied to biological control systems. Powers recog- 
nizedfurtherthatinanycontrolsystemthevariablethatis 
controlled is not the output of the system (the behavioral 
actions), but its input, that is, a sensed and transformed 
function of some state of the environment that could be 
af f ected by the control system’s output. Because some 
of these sensed and transformed inputs appear as con- 
sciously perceived aspects of the environment, Powers 
labelled the controlled variable “perception”. The the- 
ory came to be known as “Perceptual Control Theory” 
or PCT rather than “Control Theory Applied to Psychol- 
ogy” because control theorists often assert or assume that 
it is the system’s output that is controlled. In PCT it is 
theinternalrepresentationofthestateofsomevariablein 
theenvironment—a“perception”ineverydaylanguage— 
thatiscontrolled.[5]ThebasicprinciplesofPCTweref i rst 
published by Powers, Clark, and MacFarland as a “gen- 
eral feedback theory of behavior” in 1960,[6]with credits 
to cybernetic authors Wiener and Ashby, and has been 
systematically developed since then in the research com- 
munity that has gathered around it. Initially, it received 
little general recognition, but is now better known. 
3Example 
A simple negative feedback control system is a cruise 
control system for a car. A cruise control system has a 
sensor which “perceives” speed as the rate of spin of the 
drive shaft directly connected to the wheels. It also has a 
driver-adjustable 'goal' specifying a particular speed. The 
1 
24THE METHODOLOGY OF MODELING, AND PCT AS MODEL 
sensed speed is continuously compared against the spec- 
if i ed speed by a device (called a “comparator”) which 
subtracts the currently sensed input value from the stored 
goal value. The dif f erence (the error signal) determines 
the throttle setting (the accelerator depression), so that 
the engine output is continuously varied to counter varia- 
tions in the speed of the car. This type of classical nega- 
tive feedback control was worked out by engineers in the 
1930s and 1940s.

throttled back so as to act as a brake, so again the speed is 
keptfromdepartingmorethanabarelydetectableamount 
from the goal speed (brakes are needed only if the hill is 
too steep). The result is that the cruise control system 
maintains a speed close to the goal as the car goes up and 
down hills, and as other disturbances such as wind af f ect 
the car’s speed. This is all done without any planning of 
specif i c actions, and without any blind reactions to stim- 
uli. 
Thesameprinciplesofnegativefeedbackcontrol(includ- 
ing the ability to nullify ef f ects of unpredictable external 
or internal disturbances) apply to living control systems. 
The thesis of PCT is that animals and people do not con- 
troltheirbehavior; rather,theyvarytheirbehaviorastheir 
means for controlling their perceptions, with or without 
external disturbances. This directly contradicts the his- 
torical and still widespread assumption that behavior is 
the i nal result of stimulus inputs or cognitive plans. 
4The methodology of modeling, 
and PCT as model 
The principal datum in PCT methodology is the con- 
trolled variable. The fundamental step of PCT research, 
the Test for controlled variables, is the slow and gentle 
application of disturbing inf l uences to the state of a vari- 
able in the environment which the researcher surmises is 
already under control by the observed organism. It is es- 
sential not to overwhelm the organism’s ability to control, 
since that is what is being investigated. If the organism 
changes its actions just so as to prevent the disturbing in- 
l uence from having the expected ef f ect on that variable, 
that is strong evidence that the experimental action dis- 
turbed a controlled variable. It is crucially important to 
distinguish the perceptions and point of view of the ob- 
server from those of the observed organism. It may take 
a number of variations of the Test to isolate just which 
aspect of the environmental situation is under control, as 
perceived by the observed organism. 
PCT employs a black box methodology. The controlled 
variableasmeasuredbytheobservercorrespondstoaref- 
erence value for a perception that the organism is con- 
trolling. The controlled variable is thus an objective in- 
dex of the purpose or intention of those particular be- 
havioral actions by the organism—the goal which those 
actions consistently work to attain despite disturbances. 
With few exceptions, in the current state of neuroscience 
this internally maintained reference value cannot be di- 
rectly observed as such (e.g. as a rate of i ring in a neu- 
ron), nor have all of the relevant electrical and chemical 
variables been traced by their specif i c pathways while a 
living organism is engaging in what we externally observe 
asbehavior. However, whenaworkingnegativefeedback 
system simulated on a digital computer performs essen- 
tially identically to observed organisms, then the well un- 
derstood negative feedback structure of the simulation or 
model (the white box) is understood to demonstrate the 
unseen negative feedback structure within the organism 
(the black box). 
Data for individuals are not aggregated for statistical 
analysis;[7]instead, a generative model is built which 
replicatesthedataobservedforindividualswithveryhigh 
i delity (0.95 or better).To build such a model of a 
given behavioral situation requires careful measurements 
of three observed variables:</div></div><div class="flex justify-between lg:block"><div class="text-xs flex items-center justify-center gap-1 self-center pt-2 !invisible"><button disabled=""

model of behavior that proposes organisms control their own perceptions, rather than their behavior or external environmental variables. This means that actions are adapted to negate the effects that unpredictable environmental disturbances might otherwise have on controlled perceptions. It's a concept that challenges traditional views of behavior as linear responses to stimuli and has been used across various fields, including experimental psychology, neuroscience, sociology, and linguistics.</p><p>The core principle of PCT is that behavior is a means of controlling one's perceptions. For example, when applied to robotics, instead of the robot being programmed to perform specific behaviors, it might be programmed to control its perception of the environment and adapt its behaviors accordingly.</p><p>PCT models, in many ways, a negative feedback loop. In a simple negative feedback control system, like a cruise control system for a car, the sensor "perceives" speed, comparing it against a set goal. If the speed starts to drop, the system compensates by increasing engine output, keeping the error very nearly at zero. The same principle is proposed to apply to living organisms; they vary their behavior as a means of controlling their perceptions.</p><p>PCT is significant because it provides a method to objectively study purposeful behavior without recourse to introspection, offering a model for the functioning of organisms that can apply to artificial systems like robots. Furthermore, it employs a black box methodology, simulating negative feedback systems to perform essentially identically to observed organisms. This gives insight into the unseen negative feedback structure within the organism. The data observed for individual systems is replicated with high fidelity, often used for building generative models of specific behavioral situations.</p><p>PCT has its roots in control systems engineering and cybernetics and was formulated by William T.

A fourth value, the internally maintained reference r (a 
variable ′setpoint′), is deduced from the value at which 
the organism is observed to maintain qi, as determined 
by the Test for controlled variables (described at the be- 
ginning of this section). 
With two variables specif i ed, the controlled input qi and 
the reference r, a properly designed control system, sim- 
ulated on a digital computer, produces outputs qo that 
almost precisely oppose unpredictable disturbances d to 
the controlled input.Further, the variance from per- 
fect control accords well with that observed for living 
organisms.[8]Perfect control would result in zero ef f ect 
of the disturbance, but living organisms are not perfect 
controllers, and the aim of PCT is to model living organ- 
isms. When a computer simulation performs with &gt;95% 
conformity to experimentally measured values, opposing 
the ef f ect of unpredictable changes in d by generating 
(nearly) equal and opposite values of qo, it is understood 
3 
to model the behavior and the internal control-loop struc- 
ture of the organism. 
By extension, the elaboration of the theory constitutes a 
general model of cognitive process and behavior. With 
every specif i c model or simulation of behavior that is 
constructed and tested against observed data, the general 
model that is presented in the theory is exposed to poten- 
tial challenge that could call for revision or could lead to 
refutation. 
5Mathematics of PCT 
To illustrate the mathematical calculations employed in a 
PCT simulation, consider a pursuit tracking task in which 
the participant keeps a mouse cursor aligned with a mov- 
ing target on a computer monitor. 
The model assumes that a perceptual signal within the 
participant[9]represents the magnitude of the input quan- 
tity qi. In the tracking task, the input quantity is the verti- 
cal distance between the target position T and the cursor 
position C, and the random variation of the target posi- 
tion acts as the disturbance d of that input quantity. This 
suggests that the perceptual signal p quantitatively repre- 
sents the cursor position C minus the target position T, as 
expressed in the equation p=C–T. 
Between the perception of target and cursor and the con- 
struction of the signal representing the distance between 
them there is a delay of Τ milliseconds, so that the work- 
ing perceptual signal at time t represents the target-to- 
cursor distance at a prior time, t – Τ. Consequently, the 
equation used in the model is 
1. p(t) = C(t–Τ) – T(t–Τ) 
The negative feedback control system receives a refer- 
ence signal r which specif i es the magnitude of the given 
perceptual signal which is currently intended or desired. 
(For the origin of r within the organism, see under "A hi- 
erarchy of control", below.) Both r and p are input to a 
simple neural structure with r excitatory and p inhibitory. 
Thisstructureiscalleda“comparator”.[10]Theef f ectisto 
subtract p from r, yielding an error signal e that indicates 
the magnitude and sign of the dif f erence between the de- 
sired magnitude r and the currently input magnitude p of 
the given perception. The equation representing this in 
the model is: 
2. e = r–p 
Theerrorsignalemustbetransformedtotheoutputquan- 
tity qo (representing the participant’s muscular ef f orts af- 
fecting the mouse position). Experiments have shown 
that in the best model for the output function, the mouse 
velocity Vcursor is proportional to the error signal e by a 
gain factor G (that is, Vcursor = G*e). Thus, when the 
perceptual signal p is smaller than the reference signal r, 
theerrorsignalehasapositivesign, andfromitthemodel 
computes an upward velocity of the cursor that is propor- 
tional to the error. 
The next position of the cursor Cnew is the current po- 
sition Cold plus the velocity Vcursor times the duration 
dt of one iteration of the program. By simple algebra, 
we substitute G*e (as given above) for Vcursor, yielding 
a third equation: 
3. Cnew = Cold + G*e*dt 
These three simple equations or program steps consti- 
tute the simplest form of the model for the tracking task. 
When these three simultaneous equations are evaluated 
overandoverwiththesamerandomdisturbancesd ofthe 
target position that the human participant experienced, 
the output positions and velocities of the cursor duplicate 
the participant’s actions in the tracking task above within 
4.0% of their peak-to-peak range, in great detail. 
This simple model can be ref i ned with a damping factor 
d which reduces the discrepancy between the model and 
the human participant to 3.6% when the disturbance d is 
set to maximum dif i culty. 
3'. Cnew = Cold + [(G*e)–(d*Cold)]*dt 
Detailed discussion of this model in (Powers 2008) in- 
cludes both source and executable code, with which the 
reader can verify how well this simple program simulates 
real behavior. No consideration is needed of possible 
nonlinearities such as the Weber-Fechner law, potential 
noise in the system, continuously varying angles at the 
joints, and many other factors that could af l ict perfor- 
mance if this were a simple linear model. No inverse 
kinematics or predictive calculations are required. The 
model simply reduces the discrepancy between input p 
and reference r continuously as it arises in real time, and 
that is all that is required—as predicted by the theory.</div></div><div class="flex justify-between lg:block"><div class="text-xs flex items-center justify-center gap-1 self-center pt-2

and cognitive processes, particularly the way humans and other living organisms maintain control over their perceptions in response to external disturbances. The theory posits that our behaviors are not primarily driven by stimuli or responses, but by control loops that try to keep certain perceptions at specific levels.</p><p>The Perceptual Control Theory (PCT) model includes several key components:</p><ol><li><strong>qi</strong>: This is the input quantity that is perceived and controlled by the subject or organism.</li><li><strong>qo</strong>: This is the output quantity, the observable behavior of the organism, that affects the state of the input quantity (qi).</li><li><strong>d</strong>: This is a value summing the effects of external disturbances on the input quantity (qi).</li><li><strong>r</strong>: This is the reference value or 'setpoint', internally maintained, which is deduced from the value at which the organism maintains qi.</li></ol><p>The mathematical section describes a computer simulation of a pursuit tracking task, where a user is trying to keep a mouse cursor aligned with a moving target. The simulation models the process of negative feedback control and adjustment according to the PCT, including factors such as perception delay and error signal generation. The user's behavior in this task is predicted with significant accuracy by applying the principles of PCT.</p><p>Finally, the text suggests that the simplicity of this model, along with its demonstrated accuracy, reinforces the validity of PCT as a general model of cognitive process and behavior. It suggests that any deviations from perfect control are not due to deficiencies in the model, but rather to the fact that living organisms are not perfect controllers. This provides a more realistic and nuanced understanding of how organisms behave and respond to their environments.</p></div></div></div><div class="flex justify-between lg:block"><div class="text-xs

control theory 
Even a cursory reading of the Wikipedia article for 
engineering control theory shows that in the artif i cial sys- 
tems described there the reference signal is considered to 
be an external input to the ‘plant’. In engineering control 
theory, the reference signal or set point is public; in PCT, 
it is not, but rather must be deduced from the results of 
the test for controlled variables, as described above in the 
methodology section. This is because in living systems 
a reference signal is not an externally accessible input, 
but instead originates elsewhere within the system. In the 
hierarchical model, error output of higher-level control 
loops, as described in the next section below, evokes r 
from synapse-local memory, and the strength of r is pro- 
portional to the (weighted) strength of the error signal or 
signals from one or more higher-level systems. 
In engineering control systems, in the case where there 
are several such reference inputs, a ‘Controller’ is de- 
48REORGANIZATION IN EVOLUTION, DEVELOPMENT, AND LEARNING 
signedtomanipulatethoseinputssoastoobtaintheef f ect 
on the output of the system that is desired by the system’s 
designer,andthetaskofacontroltheory(soconceived)is 
to calculate those manipulations so as to avoid instability 
and oscillation. The designer of a PCT model or simu- 
lation specif i es no particular desired ef f ect on the output 
of the system, except that it must be whatever is required 
to bring the input from the environment (the perceptual 
signal) into conformity with the reference. In Perceptual 
Control Theory, the input function for the reference sig- 
nal is a weighted sum of internally generated signals (in 
the canonical case, higher-level error signals), and loop 
stability is determined locally for each loop in the man- 
ner sketched in the preceding section on the mathematics 
of PCT (and elaborated more fully in the referenced lit- 
erature). The weighted sum is understood to result from 
reorganization. 
Engineering control theory is computationally demand- 
ing, but as the preceding section shows, PCT is not. For 
example, contrast the implementation of a model of an 
inverted pendulum in engineering control theory[11]with 
the PCT implementation as a hierarchy of i ve simple 
control systems.[12] 
7A hierarchy of control 
Perceptions, in PCT, are constructed and controlled in 
a hierarchy of levels. For example, visual perception of 
an object is constructed from dif f erences in light inten- 
sity or dif f erences in sensations such as color at its edges. 
Controllingtheshapeorlocationoftheobjectrequiresal- 
tering the perceptions of sensations or intensities (which 
are controlled by lower-level systems). This organizing 
principle is applied at all levels, up to the most abstract 
philosophical and theoretical constructs. 
The Russian physiologist Nicolas Bernstein[13]indepen- 
dently came to the same conclusion that behavior has to 
be multiordinal—organized hierarchically, in layers. A 
simple problem led to this conclusion at about the same 
time both in PCT and in Bernstein’s work. The spinal 
ref l exes act to stabilize limbs against disturbances. Why 
do they not prevent centers higher in the brain from us- 
ing those limbs to carry out behavior? Since the brain 
obviously does use the spinal systems in producing be- 
havior, there must be a principle that allows the higher 
systems to operate by incorporating the ref l exes, not just 
by overcoming them or turning them of f . The answer is 
that the reference value (setpoint) for a spinal ref l ex is 
not static; rather, it is varied by higher-level systems as 
their means of moving the limbs. This principle applies 
to higher feedback loops, as each loop presents the same 
problem to subsystems above it. 
Whereas an engineered control system has a reference 
value or setpoint adjusted by some external agency, the 
reference value for a biological control system cannot be 
set in this way. The setpoint must come from some in- 
ternal process. If there is a way for behavior to af f ect it, 
any perception may be brought to the state momentarily 
specif i ed by higher levels and then be maintained in that 
state against unpredictable disturbances. In a hierarchy 
of control systems, higher levels adjust the goals of lower 
levels as their means of approaching their own goals set 
by still-higher systems. This has important consequences 
foranyproposedexternalcontrolofanautonomousliving 
control system (organism). At the highest level, reference 
values (goals) are set by heredity or adaptive processes. 
8Reorganization in evolution, de- 
velopment, and learning 
If an organism controls inappropriate perceptions or con- 
trols some perceptions to inappropriate values, it is less 
likely to bring progeny to maturity, and may die. Con- 
sequently, by natural selection successive generations of 
organisms evolve so that they control those perceptions 
that, when controlled with appropriate setpoints, tend to 
maintain critical internal variables at optimal levels, or at 
least within non-lethal limits. Powers called these critical 
internal variables “intrinsic variables” (Ashby’s “essential 
variables”). 
The mechanism that inf l uences the development of struc- 
tures of perceptions to be controlled is termed “reorgani- 
zation”, a process within the individual organism that is 
subject to natural selection just as is the evolved structure 
of individuals within a species.[14] 
This “reorganization system” is proposed to be part of 
the inherited structure of the organism. It changes the 
underlying parameters and connectivity of the control hi- 
erarchy in a random-walk manner. There is a basic con- 
tinuous rate of change in intrinsic variables which pro- 
ceeds at a speed set by the total error (and stops at zero 
error), punctuated by random changes in direction in a 
hyperspace with as many dimensions as there are criti- 
cal variables. This is a more or less direct adaptation of 
Ashby’s "homeostat", i rst adopted into PCT in the 1960 
paper and then changed to use E. coli’s method of navi- 
gatingupgradientsofnutrients,asdescribedbyKoshland 
(1980).[15] 
Reorganization may occur at any level when loss of con- 
trol at that level causes intrinsic (essential) variables to 
deviate from genetically determined set points. This is 
the basic mechanism that is involved in trial-and-error 
learning, which leads to the acquisition of more system- 
atic kinds of learning processes.[16]</div></div><div class="flex justify-between lg:block"><div class="text-xs flex items-center justify-center gap-1 self-center pt-2 !invisible"><button disabled=""

distinctions between Perceptual Control Theory (PCT) and Engineering Control Theory, the hierarchical nature of control in PCT, and the concept of reorganization in evolution, development, and learning.</p><ol><li><p><strong>Distinctions from Engineering Control Theory</strong>: In Engineering Control Theory, the reference signal is typically an externally provided set-point, manipulated by a 'controller' to achieve the desired effect on the system's output. In contrast, PCT postulates that the reference signal originates within the organism or system itself and must be deduced from controlled variables. The objective in PCT is to maintain the input (perception) in conformity with the reference signal, rather than achieving a specific output effect.</p></li><li><p><strong>A Hierarchy of Control</strong>: In PCT, perceptions are constructed and controlled at various hierarchical levels. Higher-level systems can adjust the goals or reference signals of lower-level systems to approach their own goals, set by even higher systems. This hierarchical control concept aligns with observations made by the Russian physiologist Nicolas Bernstein, who suggested behavior is organized in a layered, hierarchical manner.</p></li><li><p><strong>Reorganization in Evolution, Development, and Learning</strong>: Organisms that control inappropriate perceptions or maintain perceptions at inappropriate values are less likely to survive and reproduce. Thus, through natural selection, organisms evolve to control those perceptions which maintain critical internal variables within optimal or at least non-lethal limits. The mechanism for influencing the development of these control structures is called "reorganization". This is a process within individual organisms that is also subject to natural selection. Reorganization can lead to random-walk changes in the control hierarchy's parameters and connectivity, potentially leading to improved control and learning over time.</p></li></ol></div></div></div><div class="flex justify-between lg:block"><div class="text-xs flex items-center justify-center gap-1 self-center pt-2 !invisible"><button disabled="" class="dark:text-white disabled:text-gray-300 dark:disabled:text-gray-400"><svg stroke="currentColor" fill="none" stroke-width="1.5" viewBox="0 0 24 24" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" class="h-3 w-3" height="1em" width="1em" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg"><polyline points="15 18 9 12 15 6"></polyline></svg></button><span class="flex-grow flex-shrink-0">1 / 1</span><button disabled="" class="dark:text-white disabled:text-gray-300 dark:disabled:text-gray-400"><svg stroke="currentColor" fill="none" stroke-width="1.5" viewBox="0 0 24 24" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" class="h-3 w-3" height="1em" width="1em" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg"><polyline points="9 18 15 12 9 6"></polyline></svg></button></div><div class="text-gray-400 flex self-end lg:self-center justify-center mt-2 gap-2 md:gap-3 lg:gap-1 lg:absolute lg:top-0 lg:translate-x-full lg:right-0 lg:mt-0 lg:pl-2 visible"><button class="flex ml-auto gap-2 rounded-md p-1 hover:bg-gray-100 hover:text-gray-700 dark:text-gray-400 dark:hover:bg-gray-700 dark:hover:text-gray-200 disabled:dark:hover:text-gray-400"><svg stroke="currentColor" fill="none" stroke-width="2" viewBox="0 0 24 24" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" class="h-4 w-4" height="1em" width="1em" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg"><path d="M16 4h2a2 2 0 0 1 2 2v14a2 2 0 0 1-2 2H6a2 2 0 0 1-2-2V6a2 2 0 0 1 2-2h2"></path><rect x="8" y="2" width="8" height="4" rx="1" ry="1"></rect></svg></button><div class="flex gap-1"><button class="p-1 rounded-md hover:bg-gray-100 hover:text-gray-700 dark:text-gray-400 dark:hover:bg-gray-700 dark:hover:text-gray-200 disabled:dark:hover:text-gray-400"><svg stroke="currentColor" fill="none" stroke-width="2" viewBox="0 0 24 24" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" class="h-4 w-4" height="1em" width="1em" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg"><path d="M14 9V5a3 3 0 0 0-3-3l-4 9v11h11.28a2 2 0 0 0 2-1.7l1.38-9a2 2 0 0 0-2-2.3zM7 22H4a2 2 0 0 1-2-2v-7a2 2 0 0 1 2-2h3"></path></svg></button><button class="p-1 rounded-md hover:bg-gray-100 hover:text-gray-700 dark:text-gray-400 dark:hover:bg-gray-700 dark:hover:text-gray-200 disabled:dark:hover:text-gray-400"><svg stroke="currentColor" fill="none" stroke-width="2" viewBox="0 0 24 24" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" class="h-4 w-4" height="1em" width="1em" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg"><path d="M10 15v4a3 3 0 0 0 3 3l4-9V2H5.72a2 2 0 0 0-2 1.7l-1.38 9a2 2 0 0 0 2 2.3zm7-13h2.67A2.31 2.31 0 0 1 22 4v7a2.31 2.31 0 0 1-2.33 2H17"></path></svg></button></div></div></div></div></div></div><div class="group w-full text-gray-800 dark:text-gray-100 border-b border-black/10 dark:border-gray-900/50 dark:bg-gray-800"><div class="flex p-4 gap-4 text-base md:gap-6 md:max-w-2xl lg:max-w-[38rem] xl:max-w-3xl md:py-6 lg:px-0 m-auto"><div class="flex-shrink-0 flex flex-col relative items-end"><div class="w-[30px]"><div class="relative flex"><span style="box-sizing: border-box; display: inline-block; overflow: hidden; width: initial; height: initial; background: none; opacity: 1; border: 0px; margin: 0px; padding: 0px; position: relative; max-width: 100%;"><span style="box-sizing: border-box; display: block; width: initial; height: initial; background: none; opacity: 1; border: 0px; margin: 0px; padding: 0px; max-width: 100%;"><img alt="" aria-hidden="true" src="data:image/svg+xml,%3csvg%20xmlns=%27http://www.w3.org/2000/svg%27%20version=%271.1%27%20width=%2738%27%20height=%2738%27/%3e" style="display: block; max-width: 100%; width: initial; height: initial; background: none; opacity: 1; border: 0px; margin: 0px; padding: 0px;"></span><img alt="User" src="https://chat.openai.com/_next/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Flh3.googleusercontent.com%2Fa%2FAAcHTtfE_9fVpMOqgyC7Lo43NLrKgIo-u2ToDOuYOa2T%3Ds96-c&amp;w=96&amp;q=75" decoding="async" data-nimg="intrinsic" class="rounded-sm" style="position: absolute; inset: 0px; box-sizing: border-box; padding: 0px; border: none; margin: auto; display: block; width: 0px; height: 0px; min-width: 100%; max-width: 100%; min-height: 100%; max-height: 100%;" width="30" height="30"></span></div></div></div><div class="relative flex w-[calc(100%-50px)] flex-col gap-1 md:gap-3 lg:w-[calc(100%-115px)]"><div class="flex flex-grow flex-col gap-3"><div class="min-h-[20px] flex flex-col items-start gap-4 whitespace-pre-wrap break-words">9Conf l ict 
In a hierarchy of interacting control systems, dif f erent 
systems at one level can send conf l icting goals to one 
lower system. When two systems are specifying dif f er- 
ent goals for the same lower-level variable, they are in 
conf l ict. Protracted conf l ict is experienced by human be- 
ingsasmanyformsofpsychologicaldistresssuchasanxi- 
ety,obsession,depression,confusion,andvacillation. Se- 
vere conf l ict prevents the af f ected systems from being 
able to control, ef f ectively destroying their function for 
the organism. 
Higher level control systems often are able to use known 
strategies (which are themselves acquired through prior 
reorganizations) to seek perceptions that don't produce 
the conf l ict. Normally, this takes place without notice. If 
the conf l ict persists and systematic “problem solving” by 
higher systems fails, the reorganization system may mod- 
ify existing systems until they bypass the conf l ict or until 
they produce new reference signals (goals) that are not in 
conf l ict at lower levels. 
When reorganization results in an arrangement that re- 
duces or eliminates the error that is driving it, the process 
of reorganization slows or stops with the new organiza- 
tion in place. (This replaces the concept of reinforce- 
ment learning.) New means of controlling the percep- 
tions involved, and indeed new perceptual constructs sub- 
ject to control, may also result from reorganization. In 
simplest terms, the reorganization process varies things 
until something works, at which point we say that the or- 
ganism has learned. When done in the right way, this 
method can be surprisingly ef i cient in simulations. 
10PCT and psychotherapy:the 
Method of Levels (MOL) 
The reorganization concept has led to a method of psy- 
chotherapy called the Method of Levels (MOL) currently 
being tested in England, the United States, and Australia. 
11PCT and neuroscience 
11.1Learning 
Currently, no one theory has been agreed upon to ex- 
plain the synaptic, neuronal or systemic basis of learn- 
ing. Prominentsince1973, however, istheideathatlong- 
term potentiation (LTP) of populations of synapses in- 
duces learning through both pre- and postsynaptic mech- 
anisms (Bliss &amp; Lømo, 1973; Bliss &amp; Gardner-Medwin, 
1973). LTP is a form of Hebbian learning, which pro- 
posed that high-frequency, tonic activation of a circuit of 
neurones increases the ef i cacy with which they are acti- 
vated and the size of their response to a given stimulus as 
compared to the standard neurone (Hebb, 1949). These 
mechanisms are the principles behind Hebb’s famously 
simple explanation: “Those that i re together, wire to- 
gether” (Hebb, 1949). 
LTPhasreceivedmuchsupportsinceitwasf i rstobserved 
by Terje Lømo in 1966 and is still the subject of many 
modern studies and clinical research. However, there are 
possible alternative mechanisms underlying LTP, as pre- 
sented by Enoki, Hu, Hamilton and Fine in 2009, pub- 
lished in the highly esteemed journal Neuron. They con- 
cede that LTP is the basis of learning. However, they 
i rstly propose that LTP occurs in individual synapses, 
and this plasticity is graded (as opposed to in a binary 
mode) and bidirectional (Enoki et al., 2009). Secondly, 
the group suggest that the synaptic changes are expressed 
solely presynaptically, via changes in the probability of 
transmitter release (Enoki et al., 2009).Finally, the 
team predict that the occurrence of LTP could be age- 
dependent, as the plasticity of a neonatal brain would be 
higher than that of a mature one. Therefore the theo- 
ries dif f er, as one proposes an on/of f occurrence of LTP 
by pre- and postsynaptic mechanisms and the other pro- 
poses only presynaptic changes, graded ability, and age- 
dependence. 
These theories do agree on one element of LTP, namely, 
that it must occur through physical changes to the synap- 
tic membrane/s, i.e. synaptic plasticity. Perceptual Con- 
trol Theory encompasses both of these views. It proposes 
themechanismof‘reorganisation’asthebasisoflearning. 
Reorganisation occurs within the inherent control system 
of a human or animal by restructuring the inter- and in- 
traconnectionsofitshierarchicalorganisation, akintothe 
neuroscientif i c phenomenon of neural plasticity. This re- 
organisation initially allows the trial-and-error form of 
learning, which is seen in babies, and then progresses to 
more structured learning through association, apparent in 
infants, and i nally to systematic learning, covering the 
adult ability to learn from both internally and externally 
generated stimuli and events. In this way, PCT provides 
a valid model for learning that combines the biological 
mechanisms of LTP with an explanation of the progres- 
sion and change of mechanisms associated with develop- 
mental ability (Plooij 1987, 2003, 2010). 
Powers (2008) produced a simulation of arm co- 
ordination. He suggested that in order to move your arm, 
fourteen control systems that control fourteen joint an- 
gles are involved, and they reorganise simultaneously and 
independently. It was found that for optimum perfor- 
mance, the output functions must be organised in a way 
so as each control system’s output only af f ects the one 
environmental variable it is perceiving. In this simula- 
tion, the reorganising process is working as it should, and 
just as Powers suggests that it works in humans, reduc- 
ing outputs that cause error and increasing those that re- 
duce error. Initially, the disturbances have large ef f ects 
on the angles of the joints, but over time the joint angles . . . 11.2Hierarchical organisation 
Botvinick (2008) proposed that one of the founding in- 
sights of the cognitive revolution was the recognition 
of hierarchical structure in human behavior.Despite 
decades of research, however, the computational mech- 
anisms underlying hierarchically organized behavior are 
still not fully understood. Bedre, Hof f man, Cooney &amp; 
D’Esposito (2009) propose that the fundamental goal in 
cognitive neuroscience is to characterize the functional 
organization of the frontal cortex that supports the con- 
trol of action. 
Recent neuroimaging data has supported the hypothesis 
that the frontal lobes are organized hierarchically, such 
that control is supported in progressively caudal regions 
as control moves to more concrete specif i cation of action. 
However, it is still not clear whether lower-order con- 
trol processors are dif f erentially af f ected by impairments 
in higher-order control when between-level interactions 
are required to complete a task, or whether there are 
feedback inf l uences of lower-level on higher-level control 
(Bedre, Hof f man, Cooney &amp; D’Esposito 2009). 
Botvinik (2008) found that all existing models of hier- 
archically structured behavior share at least one general 
assumption – that the hierarchical, part–whole organiza- 
tion of human action is mirrored in the internal or neural 
representations underlying it. Specif i cally, the assump- 
tion is that there exist representations not only of low- 
level motor behaviors, but also separable representations 
of higher-level behavioral units. The latest crop of mod- 
els provides new insights, but also poses new or ref i ned 
questions for empirical research, including how abstract 
action representations emerge through learning, how they 
interact with dif f erent modes of action control, and how 
they sort out within the prefrontal cortex (PFC). 
Perceptual Control theory (PCT) can provide an explana- 
tory model of neural organisation that deals with the cur- 
rent issues. PCT describes the hierarchical character of 
behavior as being determined by control of hierarchi- 
cally organized perception. Control systems in the body 
and in the internal environment of billions of intercon- 
nected neurons within the brain are responsible for keep- 
ing perceptual signals within survivable limits in the un- 
predictably variable environment from which those per- 
ceptions are derived. PCT does not propose that there 
is an internal model within which the brain simulates be- 
havior before issuing commands to execute that behavior. 
Instead, one of its characteristic features is the principled 
lack of cerebral organisation of behavior. Rather, behav- 
ioristheorganism’svariablemeanstoreducethediscrep- 
ancy between perceptions and reference values which 
are based on various external and internal inputs (Cools, 
1985). Behavior must constantly adapt and change for 
an organism to maintain its perceptual goals.In this 
way, PCT can provide an explanation of abstract learn- 
ing through spontaneous reorganisation of the hierarchy. 
PCT proposes that conf l ict occurs between disparate ref- 
erence values for a given perception rather than between 
dif f erent responses (Mansell 2011), and that learning is 
implemented as trial-and-error changes of the properties 
of control systems (Marken &amp; Powers 1989), rather than 
any specif i c response being ‘‘reinforced.’’ In this way, be- 
havior remains adaptive to the environment as it unfolds, 
ratherthanrelyingonlearnedactionpatternsthatmaynot 
i t. 
Hierarchies of perceptual control have been simulated in 
computer models and have been shown to provide a close 
match to behavioral data. Marken (1986) conducted an 
experiment comparing the behavior of a perceptual con- 
trol hierarchy computer model with that of six healthy 
volunteers in three experiments. The participants were 
required to keep the distance between a left line and a 
centre line equal to that of the centre line and a right line. 
They were also instructed to keep both distances equal to 
2 cm. They had 2 paddles in their hands, one controlling 
the left line and one controlling the middle line. They 
had to react to random disturbances applied to the posi- 
tions of the lines. As the participants achieved control, 
they managed to nullify the expected ef f ect of the distur- 
bances by moving their paddles. The correlation between 
the behavior of subjects and the model in all the experi- 
ments approached .99. It is proposed that the organiza- 
tionofmodelsofhierarchicalcontrolsystemssuchasthis 
informs us about the organization of the human subjects 
whose behavior it so closely reproduces. 
The preceding explanation of PCT principles provides 
justif i cation of how this theory can provide a valid ex- 
planation of neural organisation and how it can explain

Perceptual Control Theory (PCT), a psychological theory that proposes behavior is controlled by perceptions rather than stimulus-response conditioning. PCT suggests that behavior is directed at controlling the perception of the environment to match a person's internal goals or reference values.</p><p>Here are a few key points that seem to be highlighted in your text:</p><ol><li><p><strong>Conflict in Control Systems</strong>: When multiple control systems send conflicting goals to a lower-level system, it can lead to psychological distress in humans, such as anxiety or depression. Higher level systems can seek perceptions that reduce this conflict, which can lead to a process of reorganization if the conflict persists.</p></li><li><p><strong>Reorganization</strong>: This is proposed as a mechanism for resolving conflicts in the control systems. It involves modifying the systems to bypass conflicts or produce new reference signals (goals) that aren't in conflict. Once reorganization achieves an arrangement that eliminates the error driving it, the process slows or stops, leaving the new organization in place. This process is also suggested as the basis for learning.</p></li><li><p><strong>Method of Levels (MOL)</strong>: This is a type of psychotherapy that has been developed based on the concept of reorganization in PCT. It's currently being tested in England, the United States, and Australia.</p></li><li><p><strong>Long-Term Potentiation (LTP) and Learning</strong>: LTP, an increase in synaptic strength following high-frequency stimulation, has been proposed as a mechanism for learning. PCT incorporates the idea of synaptic plasticity (which underlies LTP) into its concept of reorganization, offering an explanation for how learning can progress from trial-and-error to more structured learning.</p></li><li><p><strong>Hierarchical Organization</strong>: PCT asserts that behavior is determined by control of hierarchically organized perceptions, not by internal representations of action. This assertion provides an alternative viewpoint to existing models of hierarchically structured behavior. Furthermore, PCT proposes that behavior constantly adapts to maintain perceptual goals.</p></li><li><p><strong>Simulation Studies</strong>: Computer simulations have shown a close match between the behavior of hierarchical perceptual control models and experimental data from human participants. This supports the notion that the organization of these models informs our understanding of human behavior.</p></li></ol></div></div></div><div class="flex justify-between lg:block"><div class="text-xs flex items-center justify-center gap-1 self-center pt-2 !invisible"><button disabled="" class="dark:text-white disabled:text-gray-300 dark:disabled:text-gray-400"><svg stroke="currentColor" fill="none" stroke-width="1.5" viewBox="0 0 24 24" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" class="h-3 w-3" height="1em" width="1em" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg"><polyline points="15 18 9 12 15 6"></polyline></svg></button><span class="flex-grow flex-shrink-0">1 / 1</span><button disabled="" class="dark:text-white disabled:text-gray-300 dark:disabled:text-gray-400"><svg stroke="currentColor" fill="none" stroke-width="1.5" viewBox="0 0 24 24" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" class="h-3 w-3" height="1em" width="1em" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg"><polyline points="9 18 15 12 9 6"></polyline></svg></button></div><div class="text-gray-400 flex self-end lg:self-center justify-center mt-2 gap-2 md:gap-3 lg:gap-1 lg:absolute lg:top-0 lg:translate-x-full lg:right-0 lg:mt-0 lg:pl-2 visible"><button class="flex ml-auto gap-2 rounded-md p-1 hover:bg-gray-100 hover:text-gray-700 dark:text-gray-400 dark:hover:bg-gray-700 dark:hover:text-gray-200 disabled:dark:hover:text-gray-400"><svg stroke="currentColor" fill="none" stroke-width="2" viewBox="0 0 24 24" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" class="h-4 w-4" height="1em" width="1em" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg"><path d="M16 4h2a2 2 0 0 1 2 2v14a2 2 0 0 1-2 2H6a2 2 0 0 1-2-2V6a2 2 0 0 1 2-2h2"></path><rect x="8" y="2" width="8" height="4" rx="1" ry="1"></rect></svg></button><div class="flex gap-1"><button class="p-1 rounded-md hover:bg-gray-100 hover:text-gray-700 dark:text-gray-400 dark:hover:bg-gray-700 dark:hover:text-gray-200 disabled:dark:hover:text-gray-400"><svg stroke="currentColor" fill="none" stroke-width="2" viewBox="0 0 24 24" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" class="h-4 w-4" height="1em" width="1em" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg"><path d="M14 9V5a3 3 0 0 0-3-3l-4 9v11h11.28a2 2 0 0 0 2-1.7l1.38-9a2 2 0 0 0-2-2.3zM7 22H4a2 2 0 0 1-2-2v-7a2 2 0 0 1 2-2h3"></path></svg></button><button class="p-1 rounded-md hover:bg-gray-100 hover:text-gray-700 dark:text-gray-400 dark:hover:bg-gray-700 dark:hover:text-gray-200 disabled:dark:hover:text-gray-400"><svg stroke="currentColor" fill="none" stroke-width="2" viewBox="0 0 24 24" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" class="h-4 w-4" height="1em" width="1em" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg"><path d="M10 15v4a3 3 0 0 0 3 3l4-9V2H5.72a2 2 0 0 0-2 1.7l-1.38 9a2 2 0 0 0 2 2.3zm7-13h2.67A2.31 2.31 0 0 1 22 4v7a2.31 2.31 0 0 1-2.33 2H17"></path></svg></button></div></div></div></div></div></div><div class="group w-full text-gray-800 dark:text-gray-100 border-b border-black/10 dark:border-gray-900/50 dark:bg-gray-800"><div class="flex p-4 gap-4 text-base md:gap-6 md:max-w-2xl lg:max-w-[38rem] xl:max-w-3xl md:py-6 lg:px-0 m-auto"><div class="flex-shrink-0 flex flex-col relative items-end"><div class="w-[30px]"><div class="relative flex"><span style="box-sizing: border-box; display: inline-block; overflow: hidden; width: initial; height: initial; background: none; opacity: 1; border: 0px; margin: 0px; padding: 0px; position: relative; max-width: 100%;"><span style="box-sizing: border-box; display: block; width: initial; height: initial; background: none; opacity: 1; border: 0px; margin: 0px; padding: 0px; max-width: 100%;"><img alt="" aria-hidden="true" src="data:image/svg+xml,%3csvg%20xmlns=%27http://www.w3.org/2000/svg%27%20version=%271.1%27%20width=%2738%27%20height=%2738%27/%3e" style="display: block; max-width: 100%; width: initial; height: initial; background: none; opacity: 1; border: 0px; margin: 0px; padding: 0px;"></span><img alt="User" src="https://chat.openai.com/_next/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Flh3.googleusercontent.com%2Fa%2FAAcHTtfE_9fVpMOqgyC7Lo43NLrKgIo-u2ToDOuYOa2T%3Ds96-c&amp;w=96&amp;q=75" decoding="async" data-nimg="intrinsic" class="rounded-sm" style="position: absolute; inset: 0px; box-sizing: border-box; padding: 0px; border: none; margin: auto; display: block; width: 0px; height: 0px; min-width: 100%; max-width: 100%; min-height: 100%; max-height: 100%;" width="30" height="30"></span></div></div></div><div class="relative flex w-[calc(100%-50px)] flex-col gap-1 md:gap-3 lg:w-[calc(100%-115px)]"><div class="flex flex-grow flex-col gap-3"><div class="min-h-[20px] flex flex-col items-start gap-4 whitespace-pre-wrap break-words">Ernest Osborne’s short article on “Thought” in the Lone Hand for June provoked a two-hour long discussion among some of my friends. The main conclusions are here concentrated for you:

If wordless, imageless thought be a possibility, is it not a further argument for obeying the inhibitions of conscience without waiting until the inhibitory impulses can be put into words?

For instance, if one becomes conscious of an uneasy feeling when one is about to do a certain action, would it not be better to avoid doing the action even if one cannot put into words the reason why the action should be avoided?

There are unmistakable emotional impulses towards right action which occur periodically and which we should train ourselves to obey unhesitatingly.

There are unmistakable emotional impulses towards right action which occur periodically and which we should train ourselves to obey unhesitatingly.

No time should be spent in seeking a logical reason for the impulses. Obey them. You know they are right—right for you at any rate.

This knowledge at critical moments of what is right and wrong is an instance of thought unclothed with words.

Such knowledge springs from a level of the mind deeper than the layer on which operate thought-images, combined with the capability of verbal expression.

When the deeper levels of the mind operate harmoniously with the outermost layer (we took McDougall as our authority for speaking of mental “layers” and “levels”), then only is a man at peace with himself and the universe.

For him the paradox, "Right speech is right action", is no longer a paradox. The majority of us are unhappily crammed with Freudian complexes which make harmonious speech and action nearly impossible. Hence the saying, “He acted against his better self.”

Translated into modern psychological terms the phrase would read, “The layers of his mind were not acting in unity.” 

After the masses are sufficiently educated, a new terminolgy for mental operations will have to come into being.

Such psychically identical terms as “conscience,” “intelligence,” “will,” and “reason,” will fall as far into the limbo of 

disuse as such words as “humours” and “faculties” have already fallen.

The greatest lesson of modern psychology is that the mind is not a concatenation of separate powers, but one power using as its instrument the whole body.

perspective on the nature of thought, conscience, and action. The author, L. Woolacott, is arguing for a kind of intuitive, non-verbal form of thought that manifests as emotional impulses towards right action. This is presented as a level of thought that's deeper than our usual conscious, word-and-image-based thought.</p><p>The assertion here is that there are times when we feel an instinct or impulse that something is right or wrong, even if we can't articulate the reasons behind this feeling in words. According to Woolacott, we should listen to and obey these instincts, even if they can't be justified using logical arguments or verbal expression.</p><p>The overall idea is that when we can align these deeper, wordless impulses with our more conscious thoughts and actions, we achieve harmony and peace with ourselves and the world around us. This harmony is hindered by "Freudian complexes," or unconscious mental conflicts, that lead to disharmony and actions that contradict our "better self."</p><p>The passage also speculates that, in the future, we will develop new terminology to better describe these mental processes. Words like "conscience," "intelligence," "will," and "reason" are seen as inadequate because they imply separate mental faculties rather than one unified power of the mind that's integrated with the body.</p><p>The author is making a case for a holistic view of the mind and consciousness, and the importance of trusting our instincts and inner feelings, even when they can't be verbalized. It's an argument that touches on areas of psychology, philosophy, and cognition, and it emphasizes the potential value of introspection and self-understanding.</p></div></div></div><div class="flex

operates at different levels or "layers" is quite fascinating. This multi-layered concept of mind seems to correspond to different modes or dimensions of thinking, ranging from the deep, non-verbal, intuitive impulses he talks about to the more surface-level, verbal, and image-based thinking.</p><p>The idea of a layered mind has parallels in modern psychology and neuroscience. For instance, it's similar to the way we think about the brain's structure and function. The brain has evolved in layers, with the most primitive structures (like the brainstem) governing basic life functions and newer, more complex structures (like the neocortex) handling higher-order thinking and reasoning.</p><p>It also mirrors theories in psychology that suggest different layers of consciousness and cognition. Sigmund Freud proposed a model of the mind divided into conscious, preconscious, and unconscious layers. Meanwhile, cognitive psychologists talk about implicit and explicit memory, or automatic and controlled processes, which could also be considered as different "layers" of cognition.</p><p>However, it's important to note that these layers aren't separate entities but rather interconnected parts of a whole. Similarly, Woolacott's view seems to be that these layers of mind, while distinct, need to operate in harmony for a person to be at peace with themselves and their environment.</p><p>The way Woolacott uses the layered concept of mind to talk about intuitive or non-verbal thought is indeed interesting. His views seem to emphasize the importance of integrating these different levels of mind, allowing for more comprehensive, holistic decision-making and self-awareness.</p></div></div></div><div

Woolacott's 1920 text connect to our previous discussions about mind, consciousness, and thought in several ways:</p><ol><li><p><strong>The Nature of Thought:</strong> Woolacott suggests that thought can occur without words or images, a concept also brought up in our discussions on different types of thinking. This aligns with the idea of non-verbal or preverbal thinking, which includes feelings, intuitions, or sensations that don't necessarily translate into concrete words or visual imagery.</p></li><li><p><strong>Consciousness and Unconsciousness:</strong> Woolacott's "layers" of the mind echo the concepts of conscious and unconscious thought. This aligns with Freud's model of the mind and the idea that some of our thoughts and impulses originate from areas of our mind that aren't immediately accessible to our conscious awareness.</p></li><li><p><strong>The Role of Intuition:</strong> Woolacott emphasizes the importance of obeying intuitive impulses, especially those related to ethics or conscience. This resonates with the idea of unconscious or intuitive decision making. It suggests that there's a form of wisdom or knowledge beyond our conscious, logical reasoning that can guide our actions.</p></li><li><p><strong>The Holistic Mind-Body Connection:</strong> Woolacott's assertion that the mind is "one power using as its instrument the whole body" connects to discussions about the mind-body connection. This view posits that our mental processes aren't separate from our physical selves but deeply interconnected and interdependent.</p></li><li><p><strong>The Evolution of Psychological Terminology:</strong> Woolacott predicts that our understanding and language around mental processes will change as we become more educated about the mind's workings. This relates to ongoing discussions about the evolution of psychology, neuroscience, and our understanding of the mind and brain. Over time, our models and terminologies have indeed evolved, and they will likely continue to do so as we gain new insights from research and practice.</p></li></ol></div></div></div><div class="flex

topics and themes we've touched on during our discussions:</p><ol><li><p><strong>Nature of Consciousness:</strong> We've discussed the general concept of consciousness, including how it's defined, the philosophical debates around it, and its scientific understanding.</p></li><li><p><strong>Artificial Intelligence and Consciousness:</strong> We explored the idea of machine consciousness, the potential for AI to achieve a form of consciousness, and the implications of this.</p></li><li><p><strong>Non-Human Consciousness:</strong> We've discussed consciousness in animals and other non-human entities, including the debate around their levels of consciousness and self-awareness.</p></li><li><p><strong>Mind-Body Connection:</strong> We talked about the relationship between the physical body and our mental processes, including how they interact and influence each other.</p></li><li><p><strong>Mental Health and Consciousness:</strong> We've touched on topics related to mental health, including the impact of mental disorders on consciousness and self-awareness.</p></li><li><p><strong>Types of Thinking:</strong> We've discussed different forms of thought, including verbal, non-verbal, conscious, and unconscious thinking.</p></li><li><p><strong>Intuition and Decision Making:</strong> We talked about the role of intuition in decision-making, how intuitive decisions might differ from those made using conscious, deliberate reasoning, and the value of obeying intuitive impulses.</p></li><li><p><strong>Neuroscience and Psychology:</strong> We've also explored the impact of neuroscience and psychology on our understanding of the mind and consciousness, including new theories and emerging research.</p></li><li><p><strong>Evolution of Psychological Terminology:</strong>

used in scientific literature, at least up to my last training cut-off in September 2021. If you're referring to the concept of gravity in physics, it's one of the fundamental forces and is usually considered constant in its effects; the acceleration due to gravity on Earth, for instance, is approximately 9.8 m/s² and doesn't "adapt" or change in the conventional sense.</p><p>However, the effects of gravity can vary depending on the mass of an object and its distance from other objects. This is described by the law of universal gravitation. Moreover, according to Einstein's theory of general relativity, gravity can also be thought of as the curvature of space-time caused by mass and energy.</p><p>If "adaptive gravity" is a newer term or concept that has emerged after September 2021, you may want to look up the most recent and credible sources for the most accurate and updated information.</p><p>If you're using "adaptive gravity" in another context or if it's a term from a specific field or theory, could you please provide more details so that I could give a more accurate response?</p></div></div></div><div class="flex justify-between lg:block"><div class="text-xs flex items-center justify-center gap-1 self-center pt-2 !invisible"><button disabled="" class="dark:text-white disabled:text-gray-300 dark:disabled:text-gray-400"><svg stroke="currentColor" fill="none" stroke-width="1.5" viewBox="0 0 24 24" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" class="h-3 w-3" height="1em" width="1em" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg"><polyline points="15 18 9 12 15 6"></polyline></svg></button><span class="flex-grow flex-shrink-0">1 / 1</span><button disabled="" class="dark:text-white disabled:text-gray-300 dark:disabled:text-gray-400"><svg stroke="currentColor" fill="none" stroke-width="1.5" viewBox="0 0 24 24" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" class="h-3 w-3" height="1em" width="1em" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg"><polyline points="9 18 15 12 9 6"></polyline></svg></button></div><div class="text-gray-400 flex self-end lg:self-center justify-center mt-2 gap-2 md:gap-3 lg:gap-1 lg:absolute lg:top-0 lg:translate-x-full lg:right-0 lg:mt-0 lg:pl-2 visible"><button class="flex ml-auto gap-2 rounded-md p-1 hover:bg-gray-100 hover:text-gray-700 dark:text-gray-400 dark:hover:bg-gray-700 dark:hover:text-gray-200 disabled:dark:hover:text-gray-400"><svg stroke="currentColor" fill="none" stroke-width="2" viewBox="0 0 24 24" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" class="h-4 w-4" height="1em" width="1em" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg"><path d="M16 4h2a2 2 0 0 1 2 2v14a2 2 0 0 1-2 2H6a2 2 0 0 1-2-2V6a2 2 0 0 1 2-2h2"></path><rect x="8" y="2" width="8" height="4" rx="1" ry="1"></rect></svg></button><div class="flex gap-1"><button class="p-1 rounded-md hover:bg-gray-100 hover:text-gray-700 dark:text-gray-400 dark:hover:bg-gray-700 dark:hover:text-gray-200 disabled:dark:hover:text-gray-400"><svg stroke="currentColor" fill="none" stroke-width="2" viewBox="0 0 24 24" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" class="h-4 w-4" height="1em" width="1em" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg"><path d="M14 9V5a3 3 0 0 0-3-3l-4 9v11h11.28a2 2 0 0 0 2-1.7l1.38-9a2 2 0 0 0-2-2.3zM7 22H4a2 2 0 0 1-2-2v-7a2 2 0 0 1 2-2h3"></path></svg></button><button class="p-1 rounded-md hover:bg-gray-100 hover:text-gray-700 dark:text-gray-400 dark:hover:bg-gray-700 dark:hover:text-gray-200 disabled:dark:hover:text-gray-400"><svg stroke="currentColor" fill="none" stroke-width="2" viewBox="0 0 24 24" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" class="h-4 w-4" height="1em" width="1em" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg"><path d="M10 15v4a3 3 0 0 0 3 3l4-9V2H5.72a2 2 0 0 0-2 1.7l-1.38 9a2 2 0 0 0 2 2.3zm7-13h2.67A2.31 2.31 0 0 1 22 4v7a2.31 2.31 0 0 1-2.33 2H17"></path></svg></button></div></div></div></div></div></div><div class="group w-full text-gray-800 dark:text-gray-100 border-b border-black/10 dark:border-gray-900/50 dark:bg-gray-800"><div class="flex p-4 gap-4 text-base md:gap-6 md:max-w-2xl lg:max-w-[38rem] xl:max-w-3xl md:py-6 lg:px-0 m-auto"><div class="flex-shrink-0 flex flex-col relative items-end"><div class="w-[30px]"><div class="relative flex"><span style="box-sizing: border-box;

and thank you for providing more context. In the study you mentioned, it seems that the term "adaptive gravity" is used metaphorically in the context of collective animal behavior rather than in a literal physical sense.</p><p>While I don't have the specific details of the study since it is published after my knowledge cutoff in September 2021, I can give a general explanation based on similar concepts. The idea behind the term might be that animals in a group adjust their behaviors based on the behaviors of other animals around them, much like objects in space might move in response to the "gravitational pull" of other objects.</p><p>Here is a possible analogy: Just as the force of gravity between two objects depends on their masses and the distance between them, the influence an animal has on its peers could depend on factors like its size, status, or proximity. In this sense, the "gravity" (influence) is "adaptive" (changes based on conditions).</p><p>For example, an animal might follow another animal that is moving towards food or away from danger, and the closer animals might be more influenced than those further away. Similarly, a larger or higher-status animal might have a greater "gravitational pull" than a smaller or lower-status one. This "adaptive gravity" model could help scientists understand and predict how groups of animals behave.</p><p>For the exact details and implications of the study, I recommend reading the original research paper or a summary by a reliable source.</p></div></div></div><div class="flex justify-between lg:block"><div class="text-xs flex items-center justify-center gap-1 self-center pt-2 !invisible"><button disabled="" class="dark:text-white disabled:text-gray-300 dark:disabled:text-gray-400"><svg stroke="currentColor" fill="none" stroke-width="1.5" viewBox="0 0 24 24" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" class="h-3 w-3" height="1em" width="1em" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg"><polyline points="15 18 9 12 15 6"></polyline></svg></button><span class="flex-grow flex-shrink-0">1 / 1</span><button disabled="" class="dark:text-white disabled:text-gray-300 dark:disabled:text-gray-400"><svg stroke="currentColor" fill="none" stroke-width="1.5" viewBox="0 0 24 24" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" class="h-3 w-3" height="1em" width="1em" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg"><polyline points="9 18 15 12 9 6"></polyline></svg></button></div><div class="text-gray-400 flex self-end lg:self-center justify-center mt-2 gap-2 md:gap-3 lg:gap-1 lg:absolute lg:top-0 lg:translate-x-full lg:right-0 lg:mt-0 lg:pl-2 visible"><button class="flex ml-auto gap-2 rounded-md p-1 hover:bg-gray-100 hover:text-gray-700 dark:text-gray-400 dark:hover:bg-gray-700 dark:hover:text-gray-200 disabled:dark:hover:text-gray-400"><svg stroke="currentColor" fill="none" stroke-width="2" viewBox="0 0 24 24" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" class="h-4 w-4" height="1em" width="1em" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg"><path d="M16 4h2a2 2 0 0 1 2 2v14a2 2 0 0 1-2 2H6a2 2 0 0 1-2-2V6a2 2 0 0 1 2-2h2"></path><rect x="8" y="2" width="8" height="4" rx="1" ry="1"></rect></svg></button><div class="flex gap-1"><button class="p-1 rounded-md hover:bg-gray-100 hover:text-gray-700 dark:text-gray-400 dark:hover:bg-gray-700 dark:hover:text-gray-200 disabled:dark:hover:text-gray-400"><svg stroke="currentColor" fill="none" stroke-width="2" viewBox="0 0 24 24" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" class="h-4 w-4" height="1em" width="1em" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg"><path d="M14 9V5a3 3 0 0 0-3-3l-4 9v11h11.28a2 2 0 0 0 2-1.7l1.38-9a2 2 0 0 0-2-2.3zM7 22H4a2 2 0 0 1-2-2v-7a2 2 0 0 1 2-2h3"></path></svg></button><button class="p-1 rounded-md hover:bg-gray-100 hover:text-gray-700 dark:text-gray-400 dark:hover:bg-gray-700 dark:hover:text-gray-200 disabled:dark:hover:text-gray-400"><svg stroke="currentColor" fill="none" stroke-width="2" viewBox="0 0 24 24" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" class="h-4 w-4" height="1em" width="1em" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg"><path d="M10 15v4a3 3 0 0 0 3 3l4-9V2H5.72a2 2 0 0 0-2 1.7l-1.38 9a2 2 0 0 0 2 2.3zm7-13h2.67A2.31 2.31 0 0 1 22 4v7a2.31 2.31 0 0 1-2.33 2H17"></path></svg></button></div></div></div></div></div></div><div class="group w-full text-gray-800 dark:text-gray-100 border-b border-black/10 dark:border-gray-900/50 dark:bg-gray-800"><div class="flex p-4 gap-4 text-base md:gap-6 md:max-w-2xl lg:max-w-[38rem] xl:max-w-3xl md:py-6 lg:px-0 m-auto"><div class="flex-shrink-0 flex flex-col relative items-end"><div class="w-[30px]"><div class="relative flex"><span style="box-sizing: border-box;

This quote adds another layer to the metaphorical use of "adaptive gravity". It seems that the researchers are using sound as a proxy for the "gravitational pull" in this study.</p><p>In this case, the midges, which are small flying insects, react to the sound of other midges in a way that resembles the inverse square law in physics. The inverse square law describes how the strength of physical forces such as gravity or electromagnetism decreases with distance. According to this law, if you double the distance between two objects, the force between them becomes four times weaker; if you triple the distance, the force becomes nine times weaker, and so on.</p><p>In the context of the midges, this would mean that a midge is more strongly influenced by the sounds of other midges that are close by, and less influenced by those that are further away. This "sound gravity" could drive the midges to group together, creating a kind of collective behavior that the researchers can study and model.</p><p>This research could lead to new insights into collective behavior in animals and potentially other systems, and the "adaptive gravity" model might be a useful tool for understanding these complex dynamics. It's a fascinating example of how concepts from physics can be applied in biology.</p></div></div></div><div class="flex justify-between lg:block"><div class="text-xs flex items-center justify-center gap-1 self-center pt-2 !invisible"><button disabled="" class="dark:text-white disabled:text-gray-300 dark:disabled:text-gray-400"><svg stroke="currentColor" fill="none" stroke-width="1.5" viewBox="0 0 24 24" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" class="h-3 w-3" height="1em" width="1em" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg"><polyline points="15 18 9 12 15 6"></polyline></svg></button><span class="flex-grow flex-shrink-0">1 / 1</span><button disabled="" class="dark:text-white disabled:text-gray-300 dark:disabled:text-gray-400"><svg stroke="currentColor" fill="none" stroke-width="1.5" viewBox="0 0 24 24" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" class="h-3 w-3" height="1em" width="1em" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg"><polyline points="9 18 15 12 9 6"></polyline></svg></button></div><div class="text-gray-400 flex self-end lg:self-center justify-center mt-2 gap-2 md:gap-3 lg:gap-1 lg:absolute lg:top-0 lg:translate-x-full lg:right-0 lg:mt-0 lg:pl-2 visible"><button class="flex ml-auto gap-2 rounded-md p-1 hover:bg-gray-100 hover:text-gray-700 dark:text-gray-400 dark:hover:bg-gray-700 dark:hover:text-gray-200 disabled:dark:hover:text-gray-400"><svg stroke="currentColor" fill="none" stroke-width="2" viewBox="0 0 24 24" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" class="h-4 w-4" height="1em" width="1em" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg"><path d="M16 4h2a2 2 0 0 1 2 2v14a2 2 0 0 1-2 2H6a2 2 0 0 1-2-2V6a2 2 0 0 1 2-2h2"></path><rect x="8" y="2" width="8" height="4" rx="1" ry="1"></rect></svg></button><div class="flex gap-1"><button class="p-1 rounded-md hover:bg-gray-100 hover:text-gray-700 dark:text-gray-400 dark:hover:bg-gray-700 dark:hover:text-gray-200 disabled:dark:hover:text-gray-400"><svg stroke="currentColor" fill="none" stroke-width="2" viewBox="0 0 24 24" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" class="h-4 w-4" height="1em" width="1em" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg"><path d="M14 9V5a3 3 0 0 0-3-3l-4 9v11h11.28a2 2 0 0 0 2-1.7l1.38-9a2 2 0 0 0-2-2.3zM7 22H4a2 2 0 0 1-2-2v-7a2 2 0 0 1 2-2h3"></path></svg></button><button class="p-1 rounded-md hover:bg-gray-100 hover:text-gray-700 dark:text-gray-400 dark:hover:bg-gray-700 dark:hover:text-gray-200 disabled:dark:hover:text-gray-400"><svg stroke="currentColor" fill="none" stroke-width="2" viewBox="0 0 24 24" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" class="h-4 w-4" height="1em" width="1em" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg"><path d="M10 15v4a3 3 0 0 0 3 3l4-9V2H5.72a2 2 0 0 0-2 1.7l-1.38 9a2 2 0 0 0 2 2.3zm7-13h2.67A2.31 2.31 0 0 1 22 4v7a2.31 2.31 0 0 1-2.33 2H17"></path></svg></button></div></div></div></div></div></div><div class="group w-full text-gray-800 dark:text-gray-100 border-b border-black/10 dark:border-gray-900/50 dark:bg-gray-800"><div class="flex p-4 gap-4 text-base md:gap-6 md:max-w-2xl lg:max-w-[38rem] xl:max-w-3xl md:py-6 lg:px-0 m-auto"><div class="flex-shrink-0 flex flex-col relative items-end"><div class="w-[30px]"><div class="relative flex"><span style="box-sizing: border-box; display: inline-block; overflow: hidden; width: initial; height: initial; background: none; opacity: 1; border: 0px; margin: 0px; padding: 0px; position: relative; max-width: 100%;"><span style="box-sizing: border-box; display: block; width: initial; height: initial; background: none; opacity: 1; border: 0px; margin: 0px; padding: 0px; max-width: 100%;"><img alt="" aria-hidden="true" src="data:image/svg+xml,%3csvg%20xmlns=%27http://www.w3.org/2000/svg%27%20version=%271.1%27%20width=%2738%27%20height=%2738%27/%3e" style="display: block; max-width: 100%; width: initial; height: initial; background: none; opacity: 1; border: 0px; margin: 0px; padding: 0px;"></span><img alt="User" src="https://chat.openai.com/_next/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Flh3.googleusercontent.com%2Fa%2FAAcHTtfE_9fVpMOqgyC7Lo43NLrKgIo-u2ToDOuYOa2T%3Ds96-c&amp;w=96&amp;q=75" decoding="async" data-nimg="intrinsic" class="rounded-sm" style="position: absolute; inset: 0px; box-sizing: border-box; padding: 0px; border: none; margin: auto; display: block; width: 0px; height: 0px; min-width: 100%; max-width: 100%; min-height: 100%; max-height: 100%;" width="30" height="30"></span></div></div></div><div class="relative flex w-[calc(100%-50px)] flex-col gap-1 md:gap-3 lg:w-[calc(100%-115px)]"><div class="flex flex-grow flex-col gap-3"><div class="min-h-[20px] flex flex-col items-start gap-4 whitespace-pre-wrap break-words">Connections to this: Gravity model of trade

The gravity model of international trade in international economics is a model that, in its traditional form, predicts bilateral trade flows based on the economic sizes and distance between two units. Research shows that there is "overwhelming evidence that trade tends to fall with distance."[1]

The model was first introduced in economics world by Walter Isard in 1954.[2] The basic model for trade between two countries (i and j) takes the form of

{\displaystyle F_{ij}=G\cdot {\frac {M_{i}M_{j}}{D_{ij}}}.}{\displaystyle F_{ij}=G\cdot {\frac {M_{i}M_{j}}{D_{ij}}}.}
In this formula G is a constant, F stands for trade flow, D stands for the distance and M stands for the economic dimensions of the countries that are being measured. The equation can be changed into a linear form for the purpose of econometric analyses by employing logarithms. The model has been used by economists to analyse the determinants of bilateral trade flows such as common borders, common languages, common legal systems, common currencies, common colonial legacies, and it has been used to test the effectiveness of trade agreements and organizations such as the North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA) and the World Trade Organization (WTO) (Head and Mayer 2014). The model has also been used in international relations to evaluate the impact of treaties and alliances on trade (Head and Mayer).

The model has also been applied to other bilateral flow data (also known as "dyadic" data) such as migration, traffic, remittances and foreign direct investment.</div></div><div class="flex

concept of 'adaptive gravity' in collective animal behavior seem to share a common principle - that distance matters and impacts the behavior of entities, whether they are nations trading goods or insects responding to sounds. Here's how these two concepts relate:</p><ol><li><p><strong>Inverse-Square Law</strong>: The Gravity Model of Trade and the 'adaptive gravity' concept both implicitly use the idea of the inverse-square law. The intensity of interaction (trade between countries or sound between insects) decreases as the square of the distance between the entities increases. Just as the midges are more influenced by nearby peers, trade between nations is more robust when they are closer in geographical distance.</p></li><li><p><strong>Proportional Response</strong>: In both models, the response is proportional to the stimulus. In the Gravity Model of Trade, the trade flow is proportional to the economic sizes of the trading countries and inversely proportional to the distance between them. Similarly, the midges' response is proportional to the sound intensity they receive.</p></li><li><p><strong>Collective Behavior</strong>: Both models could be viewed as ways of understanding collective behavior. In the trade model, nations collectively create a global network of trade, influenced by economic size and distance. In the 'adaptive gravity' concept, individual midges collectively form a swarm, driven by the sound cues they receive from others.</p></li></ol><p>In summary, these two seemingly disparate subjects – trade economics and animal behavior – are linked by the underlying principle that entities are influenced by others around them, with the strength of this influence decreasing with distance. This principle, often described using the metaphor of gravity, can provide insights into how complex systems behave.</p></div></div></div><div class="flex justify-between lg:block"><div class="text-xs

gravity' concept and the Gravity Model of Trade can be found in several everyday phenomena:</p><ol><li><p><strong>Social Interactions and Friendship</strong>: We tend to form stronger bonds with people who are closer to us, geographically and emotionally. This is sometimes called the "proximity principle" in social psychology. This concept also applies to digital platforms, where we're likely to interact more with people who are 'closer' to us in a network (those who share mutual friends, interests, etc.).</p></li><li><p><strong>Communications</strong>: The strength of a radio or television signal diminishes with distance, following an inverse square law. This is why we need signal repeaters for long-distance communication.</p></li><li><p><strong>Light</strong>: The intensity of light from a point source also decreases with the square of the distance, following the inverse-square law. This is why objects appear dimmer the farther away they are.</p></li><li><p><strong>Real Estate</strong>: The concept of "location, location, location" in real estate can be related to the principles of the Gravity Model of Trade. Property values are generally higher in areas that are closer to amenities (economic size) and lower in areas that are farther away (distance).</p></li><li><p><strong>Traffic Flow</strong>: Traffic flow between different areas of a city can also follow the same principles. More people travel between areas that are closer together and/or more populated, and fewer people travel long distances or to/from sparsely populated areas.</p></li></ol><p>These examples demonstrate how the concepts of 'adaptive gravity' and the Gravity Model of Trade, based on the inverse-square law and proportional response, can be seen in various areas of life.</p></div></div></div><div class="flex justify-between lg:block"><div class="text-xs flex items-center justify-center gap-1 self-center pt-2 !invisible"><button disabled="" class="dark:text-white disabled:text-gray-300 dark:disabled:text-gray-400"><svg stroke="currentColor" fill="none" stroke-width="1.5" viewBox="0 0 24 24" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" class="h-3 w-3" height="1em" width="1em" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg"><polyline points="15 18 9 12 15 6"></polyline></svg></button><span class="flex-grow flex-shrink-0">1 / 1</span><button disabled="" class="dark:text-white disabled:text-gray-300 dark:disabled:text-gray-400"><svg stroke="currentColor" fill="none" stroke-width="1.5" viewBox="0 0 24 24" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" class="h-3 w-3" height="1em" width="1em" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg"><polyline points="9 18 15 12 9 6"></polyline></svg></button></div><div class="text-gray-400 flex self-end lg:self-center justify-center mt-2 gap-2 md:gap-3 lg:gap-1 lg:absolute lg:top-0 lg:translate-x-full lg:right-0 lg:mt-0 lg:pl-2 visible"><button class="flex ml-auto gap-2 rounded-md p-1 hover:bg-gray-100 hover:text-gray-700 dark:text-gray-400 dark:hover:bg-gray-700 dark:hover:text-gray-200 disabled:dark:hover:text-gray-400"><svg stroke="currentColor" fill="none" stroke-width="2" viewBox="0 0 24 24" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" class="h-4 w-4" height="1em" width="1em" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg"><path d="M16 4h2a2 2 0 0 1 2 2v14a2 2 0 0 1-2 2H6a2 2 0 0 1-2-2V6a2 2 0 0 1 2-2h2"></path><rect x="8" y="2" width="8" height="4" rx="1" ry="1"></rect></svg></button><div class="flex gap-1"><button class="p-1 rounded-md hover:bg-gray-100 hover:text-gray-700 dark:text-gray-400 dark:hover:bg-gray-700 dark:hover:text-gray-200 disabled:dark:hover:text-gray-400"><svg stroke="currentColor" fill="none" stroke-width="2" viewBox="0 0 24 24" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" class="h-4 w-4" height="1em" width="1em" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg"><path d="M14 9V5a3 3 0 0 0-3-3l-4 9v11h11.28a2 2 0 0 0 2-1.7l1.38-9a2 2 0 0 0-2-2.3zM7 22H4a2 2 0 0 1-2-2v-7a2 2 0 0 1 2-2h3"></path></svg></button><button class="p-1 rounded-md hover:bg-gray-100 hover:text-gray-700 dark:text-gray-400 dark:hover:bg-gray-700 dark:hover:text-gray-200 disabled:dark:hover:text-gray-400"><svg stroke="currentColor" fill="none" stroke-width="2" viewBox="0 0 24 24" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" class="h-4 w-4" height="1em" width="1em" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg"><path d="M10 15v4a3 3 0 0 0 3 3l4-9V2H5.72a2 2 0 0 0-2 1.7l-1.38 9a2 2 0 0 0 2 2.3zm7-13h2.67A2.31 2.31 0 0 1 22 4v7a2.31 2.31 0 0 1-2.33 2H17"></path></svg></button></div></div></div></div></div></div><div class="group w-full text-gray-800 dark:text-gray-100 border-b border-black/10 dark:border-gray-900/50 dark:bg-gray-800"><div class="flex p-4 gap-4 text-base md:gap-6 md:max-w-2xl lg:max-w-[38rem] xl:max-w-3xl md:py-6 lg:px-0 m-auto"><div class="flex-shrink-0 flex flex-col relative items-end"><div class="w-[30px]"><div class="relative flex"><span style="box-sizing: border-box; display: inline-block; overflow: hidden; width: initial; height: initial; background: none; opacity: 1; border: 0px; margin: 0px; padding: 0px; position: relative; max-width: 100%;"><span style="box-sizing: border-box; display: block; width: initial; height: initial; background: none; opacity: 1; border: 0px; margin: 0px; padding: 0px; max-width: 100%;"><img alt="" aria-hidden="true" src="data:image/svg+xml,%3csvg%20xmlns=%27http://www.w3.org/2000/svg%27%20version=%271.1%27%20width=%2738%27%20height=%2738%27/%3e" style="display: block; max-width: 100%; width: initial; height: initial; background: none; opacity: 1; border: 0px; margin: 0px; padding: 0px;"></span><img alt="User" src="https://chat.openai.com/_next/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Flh3.googleusercontent.com%2Fa%2FAAcHTtfE_9fVpMOqgyC7Lo43NLrKgIo-u2ToDOuYOa2T%3Ds96-c&amp;w=96&amp;q=75" decoding="async" data-nimg="intrinsic" class="rounded-sm" style="position: absolute; inset: 0px; box-sizing: border-box; padding: 0px; border: none; margin: auto; display: block; width: 0px; height: 0px; min-width: 100%; max-width: 100%; min-height: 100%; max-height: 100%;" width="30" height="30"></span></div></div></div><div class="relative flex w-[calc(100%-50px)] flex-col gap-1 md:gap-3 lg:w-[calc(100%-115px)]"><div class="flex flex-grow flex-col gap-3"><div class="min-h-[20px] flex flex-col items-start gap-4 whitespace-pre-wrap break-words">Computer Science &gt; Machine Learning

Adaptive-Gravity: A Defense Against Adversarial Samples
Ali Mirzaeian, Zhi Tian, Sai Manoj P D, Banafsheh S. Latibari, Ioannis Savidis, Houman Homayoun, Avesta Sasan
This paper presents a novel model training solution, denoted as Adaptive-Gravity, for enhancing the robustness of deep neural network classifiers against adversarial examples. We conceptualize the model parameters/features associated with each class as a mass characterized by its centroid location and the spread (standard deviation of the distance) of features around the centroid. We use the centroid associated with each cluster to derive an anti-gravity force that pushes the centroids of different classes away from one another during network training. Then we customized an objective function that aims to concentrate each class's features toward their corresponding new centroid, which has been obtained by anti-gravity force. This methodology results in a larger separation between different masses and reduces the spread of features around each centroid. As a result, the samples are pushed away from the space that adversarial examples could be mapped to, effectively increasing the degree of perturbation needed for making an adversarial example. We have implemented this training solution as an iterative method consisting of four steps at each iteration: 1) centroid extraction, 2) anti-gravity force calculation, 3) centroid relocation, and 4) gravity training. Gravity's efficiency is evaluated by measuring the corresponding fooling rates against various attack models, including FGSM, MIM, BIM, and PGD using LeNet and ResNet110 networks, benchmarked against MNIST and CIFAR10 classification problems. Test results show that Gravity not only functions as a powerful instrument to robustify a model against state-of-the-art adversarial attacks but also effectively improves the model training accuracy</div></div><div class="flex justify-between lg:block"><div class="text-xs flex items-center justify-center gap-1 self-center pt-2 !invisible"><button disabled="" class="dark:text-white

application of the 'adaptive gravity' concept in the realm of Machine Learning, particularly in defending against adversarial attacks.</p><p>Here, the authors conceptualize the model parameters or features associated with each class of a deep neural network (DNN) classifier as a 'mass.' Each mass is characterized by its centroid (the central point) location and the spread of features around the centroid, akin to the spread of matter around the center of gravity in a physical object.</p><p>In the training phase, they introduce an 'anti-gravity force' that pushes the centroids of different classes away from one another. This is followed by the customization of an objective function that aims to concentrate the features of each class towards their corresponding new centroid.</p><p>By doing so, they increase the separation between different classes and reduce the spread of features around each centroid. As a result, they effectively increase the degree of perturbation needed to create a successful adversarial attack, thereby enhancing the robustness of the DNN against such attacks.</p><p>Adversarial attacks in machine learning are designed to fool DNNs by applying small, carefully crafted perturbations to the input data, causing the model to misclassify the input. By increasing the separation between different classes and reducing the spread of features within each class, the approach outlined in this paper makes it more challenging for adversaries to craft successful attacks.</p><p>The connection with our previous topics is the concept of 'gravity' or 'adaptive gravity' - used here metaphorically to denote the behavior of deep neural network features during the training process. It's a fascinating application of a physics concept in the realm of machine learning and cybersecurity.</p></div></div></div><div class="flex justify-between lg:block"><div class="text-xs flex items-center justify-center gap-1 self-center pt-2 !invisible"><button disabled="" class="dark:text-white disabled:text-gray-300 dark:disabled:text-gray-400"><svg stroke="currentColor" fill="none" stroke-width="1.5" viewBox="0 0 24 24" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" class="h-3 w-3" height="1em" width="1em" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg"><polyline points="15 18 9 12 15 6"></polyline></svg></button><span class="flex-grow flex-shrink-0">1 / 1</span><button disabled="" class="dark:text-white disabled:text-gray-300 dark:disabled:text-gray-400"><svg stroke="currentColor" fill="none" stroke-width="1.5" viewBox="0 0 24 24" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" class="h-3 w-3" height="1em" width="1em" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg"><polyline points="9 18 15 12 9 6"></polyline></svg></button></div><div class="text-gray-400 flex self-end lg:self-center justify-center mt-2 gap-2 md:gap-3 lg:gap-1 lg:absolute lg:top-0 lg:translate-x-full lg:right-0 lg:mt-0 lg:pl-2 visible"><button class="flex ml-auto gap-2 rounded-md p-1 hover:bg-gray-100 hover:text-gray-700 dark:text-gray-400 dark:hover:bg-gray-700 dark:hover:text-gray-200 disabled:dark:hover:text-gray-400"><svg stroke="currentColor" fill="none" stroke-width="2" viewBox="0 0 24 24" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" class="h-4 w-4" height="1em" width="1em" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg"><path d="M16 4h2a2 2 0 0 1 2 2v14a2 2 0 0 1-2 2H6a2 2 0 0 1-2-2V6a2 2 0 0 1 2-2h2"></path><rect x="8" y="2" width="8" height="4" rx="1" ry="1"></rect></svg></button><div class="flex gap-1"><button class="p-1 rounded-md hover:bg-gray-100 hover:text-gray-700 dark:text-gray-400 dark:hover:bg-gray-700 dark:hover:text-gray-200 disabled:dark:hover:text-gray-400"><svg stroke="currentColor" fill="none" stroke-width="2" viewBox="0 0 24 24" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" class="h-4 w-4" height="1em" width="1em" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg"><path d="M14 9V5a3 3 0 0 0-3-3l-4 9v11h11.28a2 2 0 0 0 2-1.7l1.38-9a2 2 0 0 0-2-2.3zM7 22H4a2 2 0 0 1-2-2v-7a2 2 0 0 1 2-2h3"></path></svg></button><button class="p-1 rounded-md hover:bg-gray-100 hover:text-gray-700 dark:text-gray-400 dark:hover:bg-gray-700 dark:hover:text-gray-200 disabled:dark:hover:text-gray-400"><svg stroke="currentColor" fill="none" stroke-width="2" viewBox="0 0 24 24" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" class="h-4 w-4" height="1em" width="1em" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg"><path d="M10 15v4a3 3 0 0 0 3 3l4-9V2H5.72a2 2 0 0 0-2 1.7l-1.38 9a2 2 0 0 0 2 2.3zm7-13h2.67A2.31 2.31 0 0 1 22 4v7a2.31 2.31 0 0 1-2.33 2H17"></path></svg></button></div></div></div></div></div></div><div class="group w-full text-gray-800 dark:text-gray-100 border-b border-black/10 dark:border-gray-900/50 dark:bg-gray-800"><div class="flex p-4 gap-4 text-base md:gap-6 md:max-w-2xl lg:max-w-[38rem] xl:max-w-3xl md:py-6 lg:px-0 m-auto"><div class="flex-shrink-0 flex flex-col relative items-end"><div class="w-[30px]"><div class="relative flex"><span style="box-sizing: border-box; display: inline-block; overflow: hidden; width: initial; height: initial; background: none; opacity: 1; border: 0px; margin: 0px; padding: 0px; position: relative; max-width: 100%;"><span style="box-sizing: border-box; display: block; width: initial; height: initial; background: none; opacity: 1; border: 0px; margin: 0px; padding: 0px; max-width: 100%;"><img alt="" aria-hidden="true" src="data:image/svg+xml,%3csvg%20xmlns=%27http://www.w3.org/2000/svg%27%20version=%271.1%27%20width=%2738%27%20height=%2738%27/%3e" style="display: block; max-width: 100%; width: initial; height: initial; background: none; opacity: 1; border: 0px; margin: 0px; padding: 0px;"></span><img alt="User" src="https://chat.openai.com/_next/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Flh3.googleusercontent.com%2Fa%2FAAcHTtfE_9fVpMOqgyC7Lo43NLrKgIo-u2ToDOuYOa2T%3Ds96-c&amp;w=96&amp;q=75" decoding="async" data-nimg="intrinsic" class="rounded-sm" style="position: absolute; inset: 0px; box-sizing: border-box; padding: 0px; border: none; margin: auto; display: block; width: 0px; height: 0px; min-width: 100%; max-width: 100%; min-height: 100%; max-height: 100%;" width="30" height="30"></span></div></div></div><div class="relative flex w-[calc(100%-50px)] flex-col gap-1 md:gap-3 lg:w-[calc(100%-115px)]"><div class="flex flex-grow flex-col gap-3"><div class="min-h-[20px] flex flex-col items-start gap-4 whitespace-pre-wrap break-words">Preview

Software Galaxies Documentation
Software Galaxies visualizes dependencies among most popular package managers. Every star in this visualization represents a package.

What do I see here?
Go packages

Every dot here is a package. Position of a package is determined by force based graph layout algorithm and usually clusters together packages that depend on each other.

Some packages are connected by lines. It means one package depend on another. Image above shows only very close connections. We can also see all connections, but the image becomes obscure by amount of connections.</div></div><div class="flex justify-between lg:block"><div class="text-xs flex items-center justify-center

dependencies among popular package managers. Each star in the visualization represents a package.</p><p>In this particular case, the visualization is showing Go packages. Each dot in the visualization is a package. The position of each package is determined by a force-based graph layout algorithm, which generally clusters together packages that depend on each other.</p><p>Some packages are connected by lines, which represents a dependency relationship - one package depends on another. The image only shows very close connections, as displaying all connections would obscure the image due to the large number of connections.</p><p>The 'force-based graph layout algorithm' mentioned here can be seen as another application of the 'gravity' concept, as it uses principles similar to physical forces to determine the layout of the graph.</p><p>In this case, packages that are closely related (i.e., have many shared dependencies) are drawn towards each other like objects with a strong gravitational attraction. Conversely, packages with fewer shared dependencies are pushed apart, similar to objects with a weaker gravitational pull. This concept helps create a visually appealing and informative representation of the data, making it easier to understand the dependencies between different packages in the software ecosystem.</p></div></div></div><div class="flex justify-between lg:block"><div class="text-xs flex items-center justify-center gap-1 self-center pt-2 !invisible"><button disabled=""

The description provided from the GitHub repository indeed confirms my explanation.</p><p>Andrey Popp's Software Galaxies (hosted on GitHub as the repository 'anvaka/pm') is a tool that creates visual representations of dependencies within package managers, like npm for Node.js or pip for Python. The visualizations use a force-based layout algorithm to represent the relationships and dependencies between different software packages.</p><p>In these visualizations, the 'gravity' concept is used to draw related packages closer together and push unrelated ones further apart, based on the number and strength of their shared dependencies. The result is a graphical 'map' that helps users understand the relationships and dependencies between different packages in a software ecosystem.</p><p>The ability to see these relationships can be extremely useful for developers, making it easier to understand the structure of a project, identify potential issues with package dependencies, or decide on the best packages to use for a new project.</p></div></div></div><div class="flex justify-between lg:block"><div class="text-xs flex items-center justify-center gap-1 self-center pt-2 !invisible"><button disabled=""

Because of this work, embeddings of planar graphs with convex faces are sometimes called Tutte embeddings.

The combination of attractive forces on adjacent vertices, and repulsive forces on all vertices, was first used by Eades (1984);[15] additional pioneering work on this type of force-directed layout was done by Fruchterman &amp; Reingold (1991).[12] The idea of using only spring forces between all pairs of vertices, with ideal spring lengths equal to the vertices' graph-theoretic distance, is from Kamada &amp; Kawai (1989).[11]</div></div><div class="flex justify-between lg:block"><div class="text-xs flex items-center justify-center gap-1 self-center pt-2 !invisible"><button disabled="" class="dark:text-white disabled:text-gray-300 dark:disabled:text-gray-400"><svg stroke="currentColor" fill="none" stroke-width="1.5" viewBox="0 0 24 24" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" class="h-3 w-3" height="1em" width="1em" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg"><polyline points="15 18 9 12 15 6"></polyline></svg></button><span class="flex-grow flex-shrink-0">1 / 1</span><button disabled="" class="dark:text-white disabled:text-gray-300 dark:disabled:text-gray-400"><svg stroke="currentColor" fill="none" stroke-width="1.5" viewBox="0 0 24 24" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" class="h-3 w-3" height="1em" width="1em" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg"><polyline points="9 18 15 12 9 6"></polyline></svg></button></div><div class="text-gray-400 flex self-end lg:self-center justify-center mt-2 gap-2 md:gap-3 lg:gap-1 lg:absolute lg:top-0 lg:translate-x-full lg:right-0 lg:mt-0 lg:pl-2 visible"><button class="p-1 rounded-md hover:bg-gray-100 hover:text-gray-700 dark:text-gray-400 dark:hover:bg-gray-700 dark:hover:text-gray-200 disabled:dark:hover:text-gray-400"><svg stroke="currentColor" fill="none" stroke-width="2" viewBox="0 0 24 24" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" class="h-4 w-4" height="1em" width="1em" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg"><path d="M11 4H4a2 2 0 0 0-2 2v14a2 2 0 0 0 2 2h14a2 2 0 0 0 2-2v-7"></path><path d="M18.5 2.5a2.121 2.121 0 0 1 3 3L12 15l-4 1 1-4 9.5-9.5z"></path></svg></button></div></div></div></div></div><div class="group w-full text-gray-800 dark:text-gray-100 border-b border-black/10 dark:border-gray-900/50 bg-gray-50 dark:bg-[#444654]"><div class="text-center border-b p-3 text-gray-500 dark:border-black/20 dark:text-gray-400 text-xs">The previous model used in this conversation is unavailable.

have a rich history and have been developed by several researchers over the years. Here are some key contributions:</p><ol><li><p>Tutte (1963): W.T. Tutte introduced the concept of force-directed graph drawing. He demonstrated that polyhedral graphs can be drawn in the plane with convex faces by fixing the vertices of the outer face in a planar embedding, applying attractive forces on each edge, and allowing the system to settle into an equilibrium. This work laid the foundation for force-directed layout algorithms and is often referred to as Tutte embeddings.</p></li><li><p>Eades (1984): David Eades extended Tutte's work by introducing the combination of attractive forces between adjacent vertices and repulsive forces between all vertices. This approach improved the overall layout of the graph by avoiding overlapping vertices.</p></li><li><p>Fruchterman &amp; Reingold (1991): Thomas M. J. Fruchterman and Edward M. Reingold further advanced force-directed layout algorithms. They introduced a model that balances attractive and repulsive forces to achieve a more visually appealing arrangement of the graph. Their method simulated the attractive forces using a spring model and repulsive forces using an inverse-square law.</p></li><li><p>Kamada &amp; Kawai (1989): Tomihisa Kamada and Satoru Kawai proposed a method that uses only spring forces between pairs of vertices, with the ideal spring lengths determined by the graph-theoretic distance between the vertices. This approach aimed to minimize the stress in the graph, leading to more evenly distributed layouts.</p></li></ol><p>These early contributions have paved the way for numerous advancements in force-directed graph drawing techniques. Today, force-directed algorithms are widely used for visualizing graphs in various domains, offering flexible and intuitive representations of complex networks.</p></div></div></div><div class="flex

previous topics we discussed, including:</p><ol><li><p>Control Theory and Adaptive Gravity: Both Control Theory and the concept of Adaptive Gravity involve the manipulation of forces to achieve desired outcomes. In Control Theory, feedback loops are used to regulate systems and achieve desired control. Adaptive Gravity, on the other hand, utilizes anti-gravity forces to enhance the robustness of deep neural network classifiers against adversarial examples. Both approaches highlight the importance of understanding and manipulating forces to achieve desired results.</p></li><li><p>Gravity Model of Trade and Adaptive Gravity: The Gravity Model of trade in international economics predicts bilateral trade flows based on the economic sizes and distance between two units. It suggests that trade tends to fall with distance. In the context of Adaptive Gravity, the concept of gravity is used metaphorically to create a larger separation between different masses (classes) and reduce the spread of features, effectively pushing samples away from the space where adversarial examples could be mapped to. Both models employ the notion of gravity to explain and influence phenomena.</p></li><li><p>Force-Directed Graph Drawing and Physics: Force-directed methods in graph drawing simulate physical forces, such as attractive and repulsive forces, to determine the layout of a graph. These methods draw inspiration from physics and apply principles of force and motion to position vertices in an aesthetically pleasing way. This connection demonstrates the interdisciplinary nature of applying physical concepts to solve problems in computer science and visualization.</p></li></ol><p>Overall, these connections highlight the interplay between physical principles, control systems, and modeling in various domains, including engineering, economics, machine learning, and graph visualization. The use of concepts from one domain to inform and improve techniques in another domain showcases the power of interdisciplinary approaches in advancing knowledge and solving complex problems.</p></div></div></div><div class="flex justify-between lg:block"><div class="text-xs flex items-center justify-center gap-1 self-center pt-2 !invisible"><button disabled=""

probabilistic graphical models can also be connected to the previous topics. A Markov blanket represents a set of variables that form a complete set of information about the variable of interest, making all other variables in the system conditionally independent of that variable. In a sense, the Markov blanket acts as a protective barrier, shielding the variable of interest from the influence of the rest of the variables.</p><p>Similarly, in the context of control systems and adaptive gravity, there is a focus on identifying and manipulating the relevant variables that directly influence the target variable or system. By considering the variables within the Markov blanket, one can effectively control or adapt the system based on the necessary information.</p><p>Additionally, force-directed graph layouts can be seen as a way to uncover the Markov blanket of a given vertex or node. The arrangement of vertices in the graph is determined by the interplay of attractive and repulsive forces, which ensure that each vertex's position is influenced by its neighbors. The resulting layout highlights the dependencies and conditional independence relationships between the variables represented by the vertices, revealing the Markov blanket structure.</p><p>Overall, the concept of a Markov blanket aligns with the idea of focusing on the relevant variables or factors that directly impact a target variable or system. Whether it's in probabilistic graphical models, control systems, or graph visualization, understanding the Markov blanket can help identify the essential information needed for effective modeling, control, or analysis.</p></div></div></div><div class="flex justify-between lg:block"><div class="text-xs flex items-center justify-center gap-1 self-center pt-2 !invisible"><button disabled=""

I tell you a story from a distant time, in the language of Pitzanico, which is unknown. This is the story of the Eloi, a just and free people, and the Morlocks, a dark and terrifying tribe.

In those ancient days, the Eloi roamed the earth, marveling and enjoying themselves. They entered, indulged, and were richly delighted. Then came the Morlocks, a harsh and relentless people.

The Eloi were reduced to servitude, putting an end to their carefree days. The Eloi fought bravely and cunningly against the Morlocks, overcoming the Morlocks' power.

And despite their appearance, the Eloi did not abandon their pious life and continued to preserve their traditional worship and customs.

This story illustrates the struggle between two different cultures and values. The Eloi, faced with the injustice and fear of the Morlocks, retained their loyalty to their principles and values. This tale reminds us of the value of perseverance, identity, and the struggle for our traditional culture and customs.

Through struggle and resistance, the Eloi show that with faith in values and unity, we can withstand even the harshest temptations. This story inspires us to reflect on our own values, seek unity, and resist those in power who wish to subjugate us.

This ancient tale is a warning about freedom, justice, and the fight to preserve our culture. We recognize the importance of defending our values and resisting oppression and domination.

1. Engineering Control Theory

Engineering Control Theory is a branch of engineering and mathematics that deals with the behavior of dynamical systems. It focuses on the design and analysis of controllers that can manipulate system variables to achieve desired outcomes. The main objectives of control theory are stability, performance, and robustness.

2. Perceptual Control Theory

Perceptual Control Theory (PCT) is a psychological theory that proposes that human behavior is organized to control the perception of specific variables in the environment. The theory suggests that individuals continuously compare their current perceptions with reference values and adjust their actions to minimize discrepancies.

3. Hierarchical Model of Control Systems

A Hierarchical Model of Control Systems is an approach to design and understand complex control systems by organizing them into multiple layers of abstraction. Each layer represents a different level of control, with higher layers providing overall direction and lower layers executing more detailed tasks. This hierarchical structure enables efficient control and simplifies the design process.

4. Reorganization in Evolution, Development, and Learning

Reorganization in Evolution, Development, and Learning (REDL) refers to the process of restructuring and adapting control systems to better suit their environment. This may occur through natural selection in evolution, developmental changes during an organism's lifetime, or learning through experience and reinforcement.

5. Conflicts and Resolution in Control Systems

Conflicts may arise in control systems when multiple controllers or objectives compete for the same resources or when their goals are incompatible. Conflict resolution strategies in control systems involve finding a compromise between conflicting objectives, applying priority rules, or using optimization techniques to balance competing goals.

6. Gravity Model of Trade

The Gravity Model of Trade is an economic model that predicts bilateral trade flows based on the size of the economies and the distance between them. It suggests that larger economies tend to trade more with one another and that trade decreases as the distance between countries increases.

7. Adaptive-Gravity: A Defense Against Adversarial Samples

Adaptive-Gravity is a method for defending against adversarial samples in machine learning systems. It leverages the Gravity Model concept to adaptively adjust the weights of the model in response to adversarial inputs, making it more robust against attacks.

8. Force-Directed Graph Layouts

Force-directed graph layouts are a class of algorithms used to visualize and arrange nodes in a graph. They simulate physical forces between nodes, such as attraction and repulsion, to generate aesthetically pleasing and easy-to-understand graph layouts.

9. Tutte Embeddings and Convex Faces in Graph Drawing

Tutte embeddings are a method for drawing planar graphs in the plane, where vertices are represented as points and edges as straight lines. The Tutte algorithm guarantees that the resulting drawing is a planar embedding with convex faces, meaning that no edges cross and the faces are convex polygons.

10. Markov Blanket in Probabilistic Graphical Models

A Markov Blanket is a concept in probabilistic graphical models, which are representations of joint probability distributions using graphs. The Markov Blanket of a node in a graphical model consists of its parents, children, and the other parents of its children. It represents the minimal set of nodes that, when conditioned upon, makes the node of interest conditionally independent of all other nodes in the graph.

Here are my interpretations of those phrases:

Organic Rhizomatic Accretion: A branching, decentralized growth pattern in a biological system that expands outward in an unstructured way. Rhizomes are plant stems that grow roots and shoots from their nodes. This phrase suggests a biological system that grows in an uncontrolled, decentralized manner.

Pneumatic Scrambling: The random rearranging or reorganizing of components in a system using pressurized air or gas. This could refer to a manufacturing process that uses air pressure to randomly assemble components. 

Bioinspired Conductive Networks: Electronic networks, circuits or systems that are designed based on biological principles or systems found in nature. For example, neural networks inspired by the connections between neurons in the brain.

Self-Assembling Energy Systems: Energy generation or storage systems that can spontaneously assemble themselves from basic components without human intervention. For example, molecules that automatically organize themselves into solar cells or batteries.

Dynamic Energy Optimization: The continuous adjustment and improvement of energy generation and usage in a system to maximize efficiency. Using sensors and software to monitor energy usage and make ongoing changes to optimize how energy is generated, stored and utilized.

Adaptive Energy Storage Architectures: Energy storage systems, like batteries, that can change their structure, configuration or components to better suit the needs of the system. For example, a battery that can rewire its internal connections to provide more power or last longer depending on what is required.

Fractal Energy Systems: Energy systems that have a self-similar pattern at multiple size scales. For example, a network of solar cells, batteries and power lines that have the same basic pattern at both the macro and micro scale. This type of system is common in natural and biological systems.

Mechanosynthetic Energy Matrices: Power generation systems that synthesize molecular components using mechanical processes. This could refer to nanotechnology that assembles molecular systems to produce energy, for example, mechanically linking molecules to form molecular solar cells or batteries. 

Thermo-Electro-Mechanical Coupling: The interaction or interdependence of heat, electrical and mechanical processes within an energy system. For example, a system that converts temperature differences into electrical energy and motion, or uses electricity and mechanical forces to influence temperature. These multidomain processes can enable more efficient energy generation, conversion and storage.

Nanofluidic Energy Conversion: Transforming energy into useful forms using the movement and interactions of fluids at the nanoscale. For example, harvesting the thermal energy of flowing liquids by passing them through nanopores to generate electricity. Or using differences in fluid pressure across nanotubes to store energy.

Morphogenetic Energy Systems: Power generation or storage systems that can change their internal structure and configuration over time in response to environmental conditions or system needs. Like living organisms, these systems can spontaneously self-organize and adapt as required to optimize how they produce and store energy.
