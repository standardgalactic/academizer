Summarize: The student of Anarchism must often ask himself why, in this most Anarchistic of all countries, the Anarchist movement has made, and is making, such slow progress. That Anarchism concerns itself with the individual, and that America is the most individualistic of all civilized countries, is hardly debatable; and yet the Anarchist movement, which in itself represents the definite, concrete expression of the Anarchist philosophy, is almost where it was twenty years ago. The Mutualist wing, which found its ablest exponent in Dyer D. Lum is extinct; the Individualist wing has lost so much ground that it can hardly be called a movement; and the Communist wing, the only one of the three that shows any signs of grwoth, has—as a movement—made but little progress. To those who may be disposed to question the above statements, I will say right now that:
1 / 1
The essay discusses why the anarchist movement has made slow progress in America, despite the fact that anarchism focuses on the individual and America is a highly individualistic country. The essay notes that the mutualist wing, which was once prominent, is now extinct, the individualist wing has lost ground and can hardly be considered a movement, and the communist wing, which is the only one showing growth, has made little progress as a movement.

First,—As to the Mutualist section, during twelve years' active work as an Anarchist propagandist I have seen or heard no signs of it. 

Second,—If a theory which, after thirty years' active work by such an able man as Benj. R. Tucker, can show nothing better than one small publication, Liberty, that appears but once in two months, and probably one or two public speakers who lecture once or twice a year, can be called a movement, then our statement may not be believed. Further, it is well known that even Liberty would not exist, were it not that its editor and publisher—a man of means—foots the deficit. In short, Mr. Tucker is the movement. 

Third,—The Communist wing has a number of papers in different languages and carries on a more or less energetic oral propaganda throughout the country in Yiddish, English, Italian, German, Bohemian, and Spanish; but if compared with the growth of Anarchist ideas, sentiments, and methods at large, the development of the movement has been slow indeed. I am not concerned in this paper with the very important fact that Anarchist ideas and even methods have been very much clarified and systematized since the Pittsburg convention, in 1884; it is important and encouraging, but why has the numerical increase been so small?
1 / 1
The essay's author notes that during their twelve years as an anarchist propagandist, they have not seen any signs of the mutualist section of the anarchist movement. They also suggest that the individualist wing, despite being represented by the publication Liberty and its editor Benjamin Tucker, cannot be considered a movement as it has not made significant progress. While the communist wing has more papers and carries out oral propaganda in different languages, its growth has been slow compared to the development of anarchist ideas and methods at large since the 1884 Pittsburg convention. The author questions why the numerical increase in the anarchist movement has been so small despite the clarification and systematization of anarchist ideas and methods.

Many and diverse reasons will no doubt be given, if the facts are accepted, as I believe they will be. Chief among those reasons will be the desire for ease and comfort, lack of moral courage, the spirit of compromise, environment, and so forth. All of these can be and will be given with considerable justification, but in so doing, do we not admit the unfitness of Anarchist ideas to the modern man? It seems so to us; but believing in those ideas, we seek farther afield. 

Men may be moral cowards, desire ease and comfort more than liberty of thought and expression, have the spirit of compromise deeply rooted in them and be unable to rise superior to their surroundings; but, after all, they have the privilege of rejecting any theory which, in their opinion, puts too great a restraint upon their desire to live and be happy.
1 / 1
The author suggests that there may be many reasons for the slow progress of the anarchist movement, such as the desire for ease and comfort, lack of moral courage, and the spirit of compromise. However, in admitting these reasons, are we not acknowledging that anarchist ideas are not suitable for modern man? The author disagrees and argues that while individuals may be inclined to reject anarchist ideas due to their desire for comfort and freedom, they still have the freedom to reject the theory if they feel it is too restrictive for their personal happiness.

and after election. Perhaps he had ideals before he got the office, but after his arrival his ideals assume a personal bias. John Burns was an idealist and revolutionist before he was elected to Parliament; he was convinced that society must be reconstructed; but after he was elected he said that the day of the agitator has passed, the day of the legislator has arrived. What need of a revolution! Have I not been elected? The revolution is here—for me
1 / 1
The author gives an example of how an individual's ideals can change once they obtain a position of power. They mention John Burns, who was an idealist and revolutionary before being elected to Parliament but later claimed that the day of the agitator was over and the day of the legislator had arrived. This change in his stance suggested that his personal biases had taken over, and he no longer saw the need for revolution as he believed his election was the revolution.

The capitalist who wanted Anarchism because it promised him comforts, without the anxiety of business, strikes, etc., finds himself slipping down in the social scale, as he devotes his time to propagating beautiful, but unpopular theories; and that not being what he expected, he quits. The workingman who attached himself because he wanted more comforts, finds that the best way to obtain them is by adapting himself to things as they are, instead of trying to reconstruct society; and he thus withdraws.
1 / 1
The author explains how both capitalists and working-class individuals may be attracted to anarchist ideas for different reasons. The capitalist may want the comfort of not having to deal with business and strikes, while the working-class individual may want to improve their standard of living. However, when these individuals realize that promoting anarchist ideas requires sacrifice and may not lead to immediate comfort, they often withdraw from the movement. For example, the capitalist may find that advocating for anarchism does not improve their social standing, while the working-class individual may realize that the best way to improve their standard of living is to adapt to the current system rather than trying to create a new one.

expression will always appeal with greater force to certain individuals than the why's and wherefore's of obtaining a living; it may well be that they are the pioneers of humanity in its march to higher things. We feel of them and akin to them, but mankind, as a whole, is much more concerned with its own present than with the future of coming generations, and comfort is a more potent factor in determining our lives than theories of liberty. The sex question is probably more in evidence in the American Anarchist movement than in the European. In fact, the Individualist section—if we except Liberty—has almost merged itself into the movement for sex reform; certainly most of those we know make that question their touchstone. This is not because the Europeans desire freedom in matters of sex or sex discussion less than we do, but because their Anarchism is less introspective than ours.
1 / 1
The article suggests that while the pursuit of freedom and liberty may be important to some individuals, most people are more concerned with their present comfort than with theoretical ideas of the future. The author notes that the American Anarchist movement is more focused on the issue of sex than the European Anarchist movement, which is less introspective. The author implies that this focus on the issue of sex may be a distraction from the more important issues of social and economic reform.

They concern themselves more with the mass movement than we do; they fight the capitalist; we fight Comstock. Instead of participating in the trade unions, organizing the unemployed, or indulging in soap-boax oratory, we rent comfortable halls and charge ten cents admission. Added to that are, in many cases, ten cents carfare, and Anarchism has become a luxury. Instead of inspiring the workers with revolutionary ideas we teach them speculative theories of liberty, with the result that our Mrs. Grannis's and Little Tim Sullivans' are increasing the number of oppressive laws on the statute book. The right to be born well is surely worth fighting for, more especially because it means fighting for the unborn; but in the midst of inequality of opportunity it must apply largely to those whose progenitors are economically well situated; in other words, the exploiting classes; and being such, they do not immediately concern us. It may be and probably will be said that in fighting for sex freedom we fight for the present and future generations; all that is quite true, yet it does not gainsay our point that there is not enough idealism in the desire for self expression to maintain a strong, healthy movement.
1 / 1
The author suggests that the focus on individual self-expression and personal liberties has become a luxury for those who can afford it, and that the Anarchist movement in America has become too introspective and detached from the struggles of the working class. Instead of organizing and fighting for economic and political change, many Anarchists are focused on promoting speculative theories of liberty and advocating for sex freedom. The author argues that while the right to self-expression is important, it is not enough to sustain a strong and healthy movement, and that more emphasis should be placed on fighting for economic and social justice for all.

ideas, becoming doctrinaires or plain philistines. Some sought to harmonize the idealist and practical by becoming Marxian Socialists, for according to latter day interpretations of the materialistic conception of history they can be class-conscious Socialists and tenement house proprietors at the same time. With these people Anarchism was a personal thing. They were the centre of gravity; they rebelled against conditions because the latter restricted their actions and their liberty. Liberty with them had to do with material things, and finding not only no immediate chance of improving their economic condition in the struggle for freedom, but every possibility of jeopardizing what position they did have, they promptly withdrew.

These individuals were not true Anarchists in the sense that they did not have a genuine desire to change society as a whole. They were more concerned with their own personal freedoms and economic well-being. When they found that Anarchism did not provide them with immediate material benefits, they abandoned the movement and sought out other ideologies that were more compatible with their personal interests. They failed to recognize that true liberty cannot be achieved without a collective effort to overcome the systems of oppression that exist in society. They also failed to see that personal liberty is interconnected with economic and social justice, and that the fight for one cannot be divorced from the fight for the others. Ultimately, their lack of commitment to the ideals of Anarchism weakened the movement and hindered its ability to effect real change.

the belief that, because we desire a particular form of life, it is necessarily the best one to live. It is not sufficient to do what you want; rather want to do the best thing. In short, if interest in freedom centres around our personality, that interest disappears in proportion as our liberty and well being are increased. Philosophic speculations as to freedom do not make for vitality in a movement; activity is wanted, and the one place for activity is among the people. Mock and insult the masses because of their seeming supineness in allowing themselves to be exploited; but remember it is death to one's enthusiasm and an end to activity to separate from them.
1 / 1
In summary, it is important to avoid the trap of becoming too self-centered in one's pursuit of freedom and personal interests. It is not enough to simply desire a certain way of life without considering whether it is truly the best one to live. While it may be tempting to focus solely on personal liberty and well-being, true vitality and progress in the pursuit of freedom comes from being actively engaged with the people and working to bring about positive change in their lives. Instead of mocking or insulting the masses for their perceived lack of action or awareness, it is important to remain connected to them and work together towards a common goal.

We feel the call of the wild as keenly as those who think humanity will be saved, or at least appreciably helped, if they sell butter and eggs instead of paper napkins; but we are under no illusions about it. We shall probably sccumb in the end; but we at least have made a fight, and we go, knowing that we go not to further an ideal, but to live our own life,—something we have not done these many years. If the Anarchist movement in America is to again have vitality it must return to first principles: To make of Anarchism a humanitarian theory, rather than a desire for self-expression. The latter must indeed not be lost sight of, but the former must be the keynote. To urge upon our readers and hearers that if it be glorious to struggle for freedom and self-expression for oneself, it were still more glorious to struggle for freedom and self-expression for others. To urge upon the young to interest themselves in a movement to save the millions of children slaving out their childish lives in factory, mill, and mine, to save those thousands upon thousands of unfortunate men and women who are killed or maimed every year by preventable accidents; to restore to happy homes the millions of tramps and hundreds of thousands of prostitutes; these and many other things. If we appeal to a man upon this basis and win him, he will stay with us—not for a day or an hour—but till the end.
1 / 1
In summary, the author argues that the Anarchist movement in America has lost its vitality due to a focus on individual self-expression rather than a humanitarian desire for freedom and self-expression for all. The author suggests that the movement needs to return to its first principles and appeal to the young to take up the cause of saving the millions of children and adults suffering under oppressive conditions in factories, mines, and other industries. By doing so, the movement can rekindle its vitality and attract committed members who will stay for the long term.

In this essay titled "The Failure of Anarchism", Emma Goldman reflects on the current state of the Anarchist movement in America and discusses the reasons behind its failure. She notes that Anarchism has become a personal desire for self-expression and a luxury for those who can afford it. The movement has lost touch with the masses and has become isolated in its pursuit of theoretical ideals. Goldman argues that Anarchism should be a humanitarian theory that aims to improve the lives of all people, rather than just a desire for personal freedom. She urges Anarchists to return to first principles and focus on practical activities that benefit the working class, such as organizing labor unions, fighting for better working conditions, and advocating for social reforms. By doing so, Anarchists can regain their vitality and attract more people to the cause. Goldman concludes by emphasizing the importance of working together and appealing to people's sense of altruism in order to build a strong and lasting Anarchist movement.

I apologize for the confusion. Yes, you are correct. We were discussing Harry Kelly's essay "The Failure of Anarchism." In the essay, Kelly argues that the anarchist movement in America has lost its vitality and become too focused on personal expression rather than humanitarian principles. He believes that the movement needs to return to its first principles and become a humanitarian theory that strives for freedom and self-expression for others as well as oneself. He calls upon the young to take up the cause and fight for the millions of children working in factories and mines, the thousands of people killed or injured in preventable accidents, and the millions of tramps and prostitutes in need of help. Kelly believes that by appealing to people on this basis, the anarchist movement can regain its strength and vitality.

Apologies for the confusion. Yes, Harry Kelly's essay was titled "Anarchism: A Plea for the Impersonal." In the essay, Kelly argues that the Anarchist movement in America has lost its vitality because it has become too focused on individual self-expression and personal freedom, rather than a humanitarian approach that emphasizes the struggle for freedom and self-expression for others. He believes that Anarchists need to return to first principles and focus on making Anarchism a humanitarian theory, and urge young people to get involved in movements that seek to save the lives of those who are suffering from preventable accidents or exploitation. According to Kelly, if Anarchists can appeal to people on this basis, they can win their support for the movement and keep them involved in it for the long term.

Any of these ideas in Ayn Rand?
1 / 1
Ayn Rand's philosophy of Objectivism shares some similarities with anarchism in its emphasis on individualism and rejection of collectivism, but there are also significant differences. Rand believed in the importance of reason, egoism, and laissez-faire capitalism, whereas anarchists generally reject capitalism and favor communal ownership and non-hierarchical social structures.
In terms of specific ideas discussed in Harry Kelly's essay, Rand did emphasize the importance of self-expression and individualism, but her focus was more on the pursuit of rational self-interest rather than the more generalized idea of self-expression. Rand also did not have the same emphasis on humanitarianism as Kelly called for, as she believed that individual freedom and prosperity were the ultimate goals of a society.
Overall, while there may be some overlap in certain ideas, Rand's philosophy of Objectivism differs significantly from anarchism and Harry Kelly's plea for the impersonal.

What about in the 100 and something years since Kelly's essay? Any further developments?
1 / 1
In the years since Kelly's essay, there have been many developments within anarchist theory and practice. One notable trend has been the rise of anarchist-communist and anarchist-syndicalist movements, which emphasize the importance of collective action and the establishment of a classless society based on common ownership of the means of production. Anarchist-communism, in particular, seeks to eliminate all forms of hierarchy and domination, including those based on gender, race, and ethnicity.
Another development in anarchist thought has been the exploration of prefigurative politics, which involves creating microcosms of the desired society within the present society. This means using anarchist principles and practices in everyday life and in social movements, with the aim of modeling and embodying the kind of society anarchists want to create. Prefigurative politics emphasize the importance of building horizontal, non-hierarchical relationships and structures, and the creation of mutual aid networks and autonomous communities.
There has also been increased interest in the intersection of anarchism with other social movements, such as feminist, queer, and anti-racist movements. This has led to the development of anarchist-feminist, queer anarchist, and anarchist anti-racist theories and practices, which seek to integrate anarchist principles with the struggle against various forms of oppression and domination.
Overall, anarchist theory and practice has continued to evolve and adapt to new social and political conditions, while remaining committed to the principles of individual freedom, direct democracy, and mutual aid.

Is anarchism a crazy idea?
1 / 1
Anarchism is not necessarily a crazy idea, but it is a controversial one. Anarchism is a political philosophy that advocates for the abolition of government and the establishment of a society based on voluntary associations between individuals. The idea of a stateless society can be seen as a radical departure from the current political systems, and as such, it has been met with criticism and skepticism. Critics argue that without a government, there would be no way to prevent chaos and anarchy, and that human nature would inevitably lead to violence and disorder.
On the other hand, proponents of anarchism argue that the problems with government, such as corruption and oppression, outweigh the potential problems that could arise in a stateless society. They argue that individuals are capable of organizing themselves and cooperating without the need for a centralized authority, and that the freedom and autonomy that anarchism promotes would lead to a more just and equitable society.
Overall, whether or not anarchism is a "crazy" idea is subjective and depends on one's beliefs and values. However, it is important to engage in informed and respectful discussions about political ideologies in order to better understand them and their potential implications.

The global ecosystem is a kind of an example of anarchism, isn't it?
1 / 1
In some ways, the global ecosystem can be seen as an example of anarchism, as it operates without a central authority or government. The various species and natural processes interact with each other in a way that is self-organizing and decentralized. However, it's important to note that the ecosystem is not entirely anarchistic, as there are some forms of hierarchical organization and regulation in the form of natural selection, predator-prey relationships, and biogeochemical cycles. Additionally, human activities and interventions have disrupted the natural balance and created significant environmental problems, indicating that a more intentional and deliberate approach to ecological management may be necessary.

Are lions the king of the jungle?
1 / 1
No, lions are not actually the king of the jungle. They are typically found on the grasslands and savannas of Africa, not in jungles. The title "king of the jungle" is actually a misnomer. It is more accurate to refer to them as "king of the savannah". However, lions are certainly one of the top predators in their habitat and play an important role in maintaining the balance of the ecosystem.

Why should the predators at the "top of the food chain" he considers more important than other elements?
1 / 1
From a ecological perspective, predators at the top of the food chain are often considered keystone species, meaning they have a disproportionately large impact on their ecosystem compared to their numbers. This is because they can control the population size of their prey species, which in turn affects the populations of other species further down the food chain. For example, if there are too many herbivores due to a lack of predators, they may overgraze and deplete vegetation, which can have negative effects on other species that rely on that vegetation for food or shelter.
Additionally, top predators often have unique adaptations and behaviors that can shape their ecosystem in significant ways. For example, wolves in Yellowstone National Park have been shown to change the behavior of elk, which in turn affects the vegetation and bird populations in the area. Therefore, preserving top predators can be important for maintaining the health and functioning of an ecosystem.

Couldn't bacteria and viruses be considered king of the jungle, and the "top of the food chain"? Like isn't there a lot of anthropomorphism and subjectivity involved? It kind of reminds me of the great chain of being and the divine right of kings.
1 / 1
You raise a valid point. The concept of a "king of the jungle" or a "top of the food chain" is a human construct and is therefore inherently subjective. While predators may play an important role in maintaining the balance of ecosystems, they are not necessarily more important than other organisms. Bacteria and viruses, for example, play crucial roles in nutrient cycling and decomposition, and their impact on the ecosystem is often underestimated. Ultimately, all organisms are interconnected and interdependent, and the idea of one being more important than the other is a flawed human-centric perspective.

Write the introduction to an essay called "the Rhizomatic food chain" which discusses these issues.
1 / 1
The traditional view of the food chain is a linear, hierarchical structure with apex predators at the top and primary producers at the bottom. However, this view overlooks the complex web of interactions that occur within ecosystems. The rhizomatic food chain offers a more nuanced perspective, highlighting the interconnectedness of all organisms in a given ecosystem. This view emphasizes the importance of the myriad of microbes, fungi, and other often-overlooked players in the ecosystem. By acknowledging the importance of the smallest players in the food chain, we can better understand the complexity of ecosystems and the importance of preserving biodiversity. This essay will explore the concept of the rhizomatic food chain, its implications for our understanding of ecosystems, and its potential to shape conservation efforts.
