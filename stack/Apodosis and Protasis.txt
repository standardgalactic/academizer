Explain protasis and apodosis in Latin grammar.
In Latin grammar, "protasis" refers to the introductory clause in a conditional sentence, which typically expresses a hypothetical situation or condition. The "apodosis" is the main clause in the sentence, which expresses the result or consequence of the condition stated in the protasis. For example, in the sentence "Si puer discit, bene facit" (If the boy learns, he does well), "si puer discit" (if the boy learns) is the protasis, and "bene facit" (he does well) is the apodosis.
Give an example of a deponent verb in Latin.
An example of a deponent verb in Latin is "amare", which means "to love." The present active infinitive form of this verb is "amare" but it has the passive form conjugation, even though the meaning is active. So, for example, the first person singular of the present tense is "amo" (I love), the first person singular of the perfect tense is "amavi" (I have loved), but the passive form of the participle is "amatus" (having been loved) instead of "amans" (loving).
Words like hortor, minor, sequor...
Words like "hortor," "minor," and "sequor" are also examples of deponent verbs in Latin.
"Hortor" is a verb that means "to exhort" or "to encourage." Its present active infinitive form is "hortari," but it conjugates using passive forms. For example, the first person singular of the present tense is "hortor" (I exhort), and the first person singular of the perfect tense is "hortatus sum" (I have exhorted).
"Minor" is a verb that means "to deny" or "to disapprove." Its present active infinitive form is "minari," but it conjugates using passive forms. For example, the first person singular of the present tense is "minor" (I deny), and the first person singular of the perfect tense is "negavi" (I have denied).
"Sequor" is a verb that means "to follow" or "to accompany." Its present active infinitive form is "sequi," but it conjugates using passive forms. For example, the first person singular of the present tense is "sequor" (I follow), and the first person singular of the perfect tense is "secutus sum" (I have followed).
Translate the following: sum seruus, aulam porto, coronas habent.
The translation of the sentence "sum seruus, aulam porto, coronas habent." is "I am a slave, I carry a tray, they have crowns."

How about, "honora patrem tuum et matrem tuam."
The translation of the sentence "honora patrem tuum et matrem tuam" is "Honor your father and your mother."
"Honora" is the second person singular of the verb "honorare" which means "to honor"
"Patrem" is a noun meaning "father"

What about, "uos est sal terrae, uos estis lux mundi"?

Ok, one last sentence. "Scelera audacia omnis pauper facer uult."
The translation of the sentence "Scelera audacia omnis pauper facer uult" is "All poor people want to commit all crimes with audacity."
"Scelera" is the noun in the accusative case, meaning "crimes"
"Audacia" is the noun in the ablative case, meaning "audacity"
"Omnis" is an adjective meaning "all"
"Pauper" is an adjective meaning "poor"
"Facer" is the infinitive form of the verb "facere" which means "to do, to make"
"Uult" is the third person singular of the verb "velle" which means "to want"
The sentence is expressing a generalization about poor people, and it implies that they are willing to do anything, including committing crimes, with boldness. It is worth mentioning that this kind of statement is not accurate, and it is unfair to generalize people based on their social class.
Ipsumum bonum. Optime tibi gratias ago, id est nunc omnia.
The translation of the sentence "Ipsumum bonum. Optime tibi gratias ago, id est nunc omnia." is "The ultimate good. I thank you very much, that is all for now."

I was just saying goodbye.
I see, my apologies. "Ipsumum bonum" and "Optime tibi gratias ago, id est nunc omnia" are two ways of saying goodbye in Latin. The first one "Ipsumum bonum" is wishing the ultimate good, and the second one "Optime tibi gratias ago, id est nunc omnia" is expressing gratitude and saying that it is all for now.
Is there a fancier way of saying Grammatica Latinna in Latin
A fancier way of saying "Grammatica Latina" in Latin would be "Latinae Linguae Grammatica" or "Grammatica Linguae Latinae."
"Latinae" is the genitive singular form of the adjective "Latina" which means "Latin"
"Linguae" is the genitive singular form of the noun "lingua" which means "language"
"Grammatica" is the noun form of "grammar"
By using the genitive case, you are expressing the idea of "the grammar of the Latin language". This construction is more formal than simply saying "Grammatica Latina" which is the way it is commonly referred.
What's the difference between "Grammatica Latinae" and "grammatica latina"
The difference between "Grammatica Latinae" and "grammatica latina" is that the former is in the genitive case, while the latter is in the nominative case.
"Grammatica Latinae" is the genitive singular form of "grammar of the Latin language"
"Grammatica latina" is the nominative singular form of "Latin grammar"
In the first case, you are expressing the idea of "of the grammar of the Latin language" or "related to the Latin grammar", in the second case you are simply referring to "Latin grammar" as a subject or the object of a sentence.
The genitive form is more formal, and it is often used in academic settings.
Ok cool that is what I thought, the first is sort of like Grammatica Linguae Latinae, with language or tongue implied, in my previous sentence.
Yes, that is correct. "Grammatica Latinae" is similar to "Grammatica Linguae Latinae," which literally means "Grammar of the Latin Language." The genitive case is used to indicate possession or association. In this case, it is indicating that the grammar belongs to or is associated with the Latin language. This construction is more formal and it is often used in academic settings, but in everyday language "grammatica Latina" would be the common way of referring to "Latin grammar".
