Abstract
Universally, female skin color is lighter than male skin color, irrespective of geographical location. This difference is a distinctive and universal adaptive pattern that emerges after puberty. We address whether this sexual dimorphism is cognitively and culturally represented to ground gender. To this end, we examine a non-Western, non-industrialized population, namely the Wichí (Salta, Argentina) and a Western industrialized population (Spain). The two cultural populations included both adults and prepubescent children. Across two experiments, we utilized a novel task with children and adults who had to make a choice for a female (male) target person between two identical objects that differed only in terms of their brightness. The results in both experiments revealed that the children from the two cultural communities choose a lighter colored object for the female target and a darker version of the same object for the male target. This pattern held across cultures irrespective of the age of participants, except for the male Wichí participants. We discuss how sexual dimorphism in skin color contributes to a universal grounding of the gender category, and advance possible explanations as to why Wichi males did not consistently link gender and brightness.

Introduction
Few abstract categories, if any, are marked unambiguously, both objectively and subjectively. Sex and gender, however, aside from their polymorphous cultural and political semantics, constitute precisely such categories. On the one hand, sex is marked, unambiguously and universally, by the sexual dimorphism of skin color—an objective, evolved physical reality. Universally, females carry a lighter skin than males (Frost, 1988; Jablonski & Chaplin, 2000). On the other hand, this objective dimorphism is anchored culturally on a brightness dimension in the case of gender, a socially constituted abstract category (e.g., Semin & Palma, 2014; Semin, Palma, Acartürk, & Dziuba, 2018). It is a representation that escapes conscious access (e.g., Carrito & Semin, 2019). Indeed, the anchoring of gender on the brightness dimension appears to be consistent across different cultures such as the Portuguese, Dutch, and Turkish cultures (i.e., Semin & Palma, 2014; Semin et al., 2018).

In short, objectively females have a lighter skin color than males irrespective of geographical location (e.g., Jablonski & Chaplin, 2018) and this difference is a distinctive and universal adaptive pattern (Jablonski, 2004; Jablonski & Chaplin, 2000, 2002). To complement this objective phenomenon, culturally the alignment of female-male with the bipolar dimension of light-dark has been demonstrated across a sample of European cultures. There are two questions that are addressed in the research reported here. The first is: can the grounding of gender on the brightness dimension be generalized to a non-Western, non-industrialized population, namely the Wichí (Salta, Argentina)? The second question we addressed was whether a sample of prepubescent children aged 6 to 9 years has the same grounding of gender on a brightness dimension? This age range is significant because it is well known that the sexual dimorphism of skin color emerges only after puberty and is not a feature prominent in the younger age groups that we targeted (see Robins, 1991). To address these questions, we conducted two studies with children and adults, namely one with a Wichí sample and one with a Spanish sample.

In the following, we start with a brief overview of the literature on the sexual dimorphism of skin color. We then turn to the research on the association between gender and brightness and then present an overview of the current research.

Sexual dimorphism in skin color as a result of natural selection
It is only recent that the difference in skin coloration between males and females has been objectively established and that the evolutionary bases as well as the adaptive function of this dimorphism have been systematically examined. The data based on analyses of unexposed skin areas collected in all the populations that have been studied indicate that women have a lighter skin than men (Jablonski, 2013; Jablonski & Chaplin, 2010), ruling out the possible argument that outdoor time budget can account for the differences between males and females. Moreover, this difference holds across latitudes, namely it is orthogonal to geographical variations in skin pigmentation.

A variety of arguments have been advanced to account for this phenomenon. It has been argued that the sexual dimorphism in skin color is the result of sexual selection, either because men preferentially select lighter female skin, or as a product of sexual competition between females, or even to reduce male aggressiveness. It is, however, the hypothesis advanced by Jablonski and Chaplin (e.g., 2000) that has garnered considerable empirical support. According to these authors, sexual dimorphism is primarily driven by natural selection (see also Madrigal & Kelly, 2007). Thus, skin pigmentation is an adaptive trait resulting from the tradeoff between protection against ultraviolet radiation (UVR) (provided by darker skin tones) and production of vitamin D (enhanced by lighter skin tones). Females need to maximize the synthesis of vitamin D during pregnancy and lactation to increase their infant's and their own biological fitness. Therefore, they benefit from having a lighter skin. In contrast, darker skin pigmentation may have been the result of natural selection in males as it optimizes the folate levels in body, which in turn safeguard sperm production. "Because folate is essential for the synthesis of DNA in dividing cells, anything that involves rapid cell proliferation, such as spermatogenesis (the production of sperm cells), requires folate" (Jablonski & Chaplin, 2002, p. 170). Thus, sexual dimorphism in skin color is adaptive for both females and males.

Interestingly, sex differences in skin color emerge late in development (Jablonski, 2012; Paik et al., 2012; Robins, 1991). Girls and boys are born with similar skin pigmentation. Through puberty, the skin of children progressively darkens with no differences between sexes prior to adolescence. Around the ages of 14-16, the skin lightens for both sexes, but the lightening process is more accentuated in females, producing the sex difference in skin color by the end of adolescence (e.g., Kalla & Tiwari, 1970; Mesa, 1983). These developmental trends in skin pigmentation are driven by sex hormones (Jablonski, 2013; Robins, 1991).

The study you mentioned, "The brightness dimension as a marker of gender across cultures and age" by Carla Sebastián-Enesco and Gün R. Semin, explores the association between gender and skin brightness in different cultures. The authors examine the sexual dimorphism of skin color and how it is cognitively and culturally represented in grounding gender.
According to the research, universally, female skin color is lighter than male skin color, regardless of geographical location. This difference is a distinctive and universal adaptive pattern that emerges after puberty. The study compares a non-Western, non-industrialized population (Wichí in Salta, Argentina) with a Western industrialized population (Spain) and includes both adults and prepubescent children.
The findings reveal that children from both cultural communities (Wichí and Spanish) choose a lighter colored object for the female target and a darker version of the same object for the male target. This pattern holds across cultures irrespective of the age of participants, except for the male Wichí participants. The study suggests that sexual dimorphism in skin color contributes to a universal grounding of the gender category.
It's important to note that this study focuses on the association between gender and skin brightness and how it is represented cognitively and culturally. The findings provide insights into the perception of gender based on skin color in different cultures but may not provide a comprehensive overview of all aspects related to skin color differences between men and women.

Do women spend more time indoors?

ChatGPT
ChatGPT
There is no definitive answer to whether women spend more time indoors than men as it can vary depending on various factors such as cultural norms, socioeconomic status, individual preferences, and geographical location. However, it is worth noting that research has shown some gender differences in activity patterns and preferences that may indirectly influence time spent indoors.
For example, studies have indicated that women may engage in more indoor activities related to household chores, caregiving responsibilities, or occupations that predominantly take place indoors. This can include activities such as cooking, cleaning, child-rearing, or working in office environments. On the other hand, men may participate in more outdoor activities or occupations that involve physical labor, construction work, or outdoor hobbies.
It is important to recognize that these are general trends and may not apply to all individuals or cultures. There are many exceptions and individual variations, and gender roles and activities can differ significantly across different societies and communities.
Moreover, it is crucial to avoid making sweeping generalizations and to consider the diversity and complexity of human behavior and lifestyles. Individual choices, personal interests, cultural factors, and societal changes can all influence how much time men and women spend indoors or outdoors.

The research article you referenced titled "The brightness dimension as a marker of gender across cultures and age" by Sebastián-Enesco and Semin (2020) does not directly account for factors such as time spent in the sun or nationality. The study primarily focused on investigating the association between gender and the brightness dimension, specifically related to the cognitive and cultural representation of gender in relation to skin color.
The authors conducted experiments involving children and adults from two cultural populations: the Wichí community in Salta, Argentina, and a Western industrialized population in Spain. They utilized a task where participants had to choose between two identical objects that differed only in brightness, with a female or male target person.
While the study did not directly examine factors such as time spent in the sun or nationality, it aimed to explore the universal grounding of the gender category through the sexual dimorphism of skin color. The research provided insights into how the cultural representation of gender may be influenced by the brightness dimension, as observed across different cultures.
To investigate factors such as time spent in the sun or nationality and their potential influence on skin color or related behaviors, specific studies focusing on those aspects would be necessary. It's important to note that various factors, including geography, climate, cultural practices, and individual behaviors, can contribute to differences in skin color and sun exposure patterns among populations.

The fair maiden of myth appears to have a basis in scientific reality, according to new research. Scientists looking into attractiveness in men and women suggest that men of all races are subconsciously attracted to fairer-skinned women, while women are more drawn to dark-complexioned men.

The researchers, whose study shows that across different races, lighter-skinned women are seen as the ideal, say the attraction is driven by preferences based on moral assumptions.

Men are subconsciously attracted to fairer skin because of its association with innocence, purity, modesty, virginity, vulnerability and goodness, according to researchers at the University of Toronto. Women are attracted to men with darker complexions because these are associated with sex, virility, mystery, villainy and danger.

From Desdemona to Nicole Kidman, fair-skinned beauties have been celebrated by artists and poets for centuries. Meanwhile, millions of women have been drawn to dark, brooding males, from Heathcliff to actor Javier Bardem.

In an analysis of more than 2,000 advertising photographs of men and women, the researchers found that the skin of white women was 15.2 per cent lighter than the skin of white males, and the skin of black women 11.1 per cent lighter than the skin of black men.

Advertising photographs were chosen because almost invariably the models were considered to be among the most attractive people of the races and genders.

"What the research shows is that our aesthetic preferences operate to reflect moral preferences. Within our cultures we have a set of ideals about how women should look and behave. Lightness and darkness have particular meanings attached to them and we subconsciously relate those moral preferences to women," said Dr Shyon Baumann, a sociologist at the University of Toronto. In effect, a preference for Colin Farrell over Daniel Craig or Monica Bellucci over Michelle Pfieffer expresses a preference for danger.

The researchers say many judgements about beauty are made at a conscious level, such as about height, weight, leg length, and the shape of the nose and the mouth. "In contrast, other physical attractiveness ideals, including complexion... are made at the subconscious level," they say.

When they analysed adverts featuring white women only, they found that women with the darkest complexions were more likely to be in an advanced state of undress. They were also more likely to have a bared midriff, and only they are shown with bared feet or are implied to be totally nude.

The darkest-complexioned women in this group were also likely to be provocatively dressed, wearing underwear or similar clothing. Women with the lightest complexion are more likely to be conservatively dressed and portrayed as friendly, happy and honest.

The researchers say the scale of the differences between male and female skin colour selected for their attractiveness is too big to be explained by pure biology. "I contend the complexion findings should be understood as a product of deeply rooted and enduring cultural values," says Dr Baumann.

"My argument to explain the findings has two key features. First, it is based on the meanings that lightness and darkness have in our culture. Second, it highlights the links between moral and aesthetic judgements.

"Physical lightness and darkness are aesthetic characteristics that... exemplify the link between aesthetic and moral judgements. On average, fair complexions in women are the dominant aesthetic ideal because sexual modesty and conventional femininity are the dominant behavioural ideal for women. However, there also exists an appreciation for a darker complexion in women, though less common, and this less-common aesthetic preference appears to coexist with a view of such women as more overtly sexual... darker women are seen as more promiscuous."

The evolution of human skin coloration
Skin color is one of the most conspicuous ways in which humans vary
and has been widely used to define human races. Here we present
new evidence indicating that variations in skin color are adaptive, and
are related to the regulation of ultraviolet (UV) radiation penetration
in the integument and its direct and indirect effects on fitness. Using
remotely sensed data on UV radiation levels, hypotheses concerning
the distribution of the skin colors of indigenous peoples relative to UV
levels were tested quantitatively in this study for the first time.
The major results of this study are: (1) skin reflectance is strongly
correlated with absolute latitude and UV radiation levels. The highest
correlation between skin reflectance and UV levels was observed at
545 nm, near the absorption maximum for oxyhemoglobin, suggesting that the main role of melanin pigmentation in humans is
regulation of the effects of UV radiation on the contents of cutaneous
blood vessels located in the dermis. (2) Predicted skin reflectances
deviated little from observed values. (3) In all populations for which
skin reflectance data were available for males and females, females
were found to be lighter skinned than males. (4) The clinal gradation
of skin coloration observed among indigenous peoples is correlated
with UV radiation levels and represents a compromise solution to
the conflicting physiological requirements of photoprotection and
vitamin D synthesis.
The earliest members of the hominid lineage probably had a mostly
unpigmented or lightly pigmented integument covered with dark
black hair, similar to that of the modern chimpanzee. The evolution
of a naked, darkly pigmented integument occurred early in the
evolution of the genus Homo. A dark epidermis protected sweat
glands from UV-induced injury, thus insuring the integrity of somatic
thermoregulation. Of greater significance to individual reproductive
success was that highly melanized skin protected against UV-induced
photolysis of folate (Branda & Eaton, 1978, Science 201, 625-626;
Jablonski, 1992, Proc. Australas. Soc. Hum. Biol. 5, 455-462, 1999,
Med. Hypotheses 52, 581-582), a metabolite essential for normal
development of the embryonic neural tube (Bower & Stanley, 1989,
The Medical Journal of Australia 150, 613-619; Medical Research
Council Vitamin Research Group, 1991, The Lancet 338, 31-37) and
spermatogenesis (Cosentino et al., 1990, Proc. Natn. Acad. Sci.
U.S.A. 87, 1431-1435; Mathur et al., 1977, Fertility Sterility 28,
1356-1360).
As hominids migrated outside of the tropics, varying degrees of
depigmentation evolved in order to permit UVB-induced synthesis of
previtamin D3. The lighter color of female skin may be required to
permit synthesis of the relatively higher amounts of vitamin D3
necessary during pregnancy and lactation.
Skin coloration in humans is adaptive and labile. Skin pigmentation
levels have changed more than once in human evolution. Because of
this, skin coloration is of no value in determining phylogenetic
relationships among modern human groups.

Introduction
Melanin accounts for most of the variation
in the visual appearance of human skin.
Variation in cutaneous melanin pigmentation in humans has been attributed to
many factors, with most authorities agreeing
that the observed variations reflect biological
adaptations to some aspect of the environment. Many hypotheses have centered on
the role of melanin pigmentation in the
regulation of the penetration of sunlight
and, more specifically, ultraviolet (UV)
radiation, into the skin. The more highly
melanized skins of indigenous tropical
peoples have been said to afford greater
protection against the deleterious effects of
UV radiation, such as sunburn, skin cancer
(Fitzpatrick, 1965) and nutrient photolysis
(Branda & Eaton, 1978). The more lightly
pigmented skins of peoples inhabiting
latitudes nearer the Arctic have been
explained as adaptations to the lower UV
radiation regimes of those regions and the
importance of maintaining UV-induced biosynthesis of vitamin D3 in the skin (Murray,
1934; Loomis, 1967). Other adaptationist
hypotheses have emphasized the role of
skin pigmentation in regulating sensitivity to
frostbite (Post et al., 1975a), in disease
prevention (Wassermann, 1965, 1974),
thermoregulation (Roberts & Kahlon, 1976;
Roberts, 1977), concealment (Cowles,
1959), or combinations of these factors
(Roberts & Kahlon, 1976; Roberts, 1977).
The concept of integumentary pigmentation as an environmental adaptation has
not been universally accepted, however.
Some authorities have argued that because
UV-radiation-induced sunburn or skin
cancers rarely affect reproductive success,
melanin pigmentation must be considered
only slightly adaptive or nonadaptive (Blum,
1961; Diamond, 1991). It has also been
argued that because the relationship
between skin color and sunlight appears
imperfect, skin color should not be viewed
only as an adaptation to the environment
(Diamond, 1991). Integumentary pigmentation has also been regarded as a pleiotropic
byproduct of selection acting on first functions of pigmentation genes, such as the
regulation of metabolic pathways (Deol,
1975), or as a characteristic controlled by
sexual selection for the enhancement of
attractiveness to the opposite sex (Diamond,
1988, 1991).
In this paper we demonstrate that the
previously observed relationship between
skin pigmentation in indigenous human
populations and latitude is traceable to the
strong correlation between skin color and
UV radiation. We also present evidence supporting the theory that variations in melanin
pigmentation of human skin are adaptive
and that they represent adaptations for the
regulation of the effects of UV radiation on
deep strata of the integument. Our presentation combines analysis and visualization of
data on the skin coloration of indigenous
peoples coupled with remote sensing data
on UV radiation levels at the Earth's surface
and physiological evidence concerning the
effects of UV radiation on levels of essential
vitamins and metabolites.
What skin color was primitive for the
hominid lineage?
Before questions about changes in integumentary pigmentation in modern human
evolution can be addressed, consideration
must be given to the probable primitive
condition of the integument in the earliest
members of the human lineage. It is likely
that the integument of the earliest protohominids was similar to that of our closest
living relative, the chimpanzee, being white
or lightly pigmented and covered with dark
hair (Post et al., 1975b). In the chimpanzee,
exposed areas of skin vary considerably in
their coloration depending on the species
and subspecies under consideration, but in
all groups facial pigmentation increases with
58 . .   . 
age and exposure to UV radiation (Post
et al., 1975b). Except for the face, eyelids,
lips, pinnae, friction surfaces, and anogenital
areas, the epidermis of most nonhuman
primates is unpigmented due to an absence
of active melanocytes (Montagna &
Machida, 1966; Montagna et al., 1966a,b),
suggesting that this is the primitive condition for primates in general. The hairless
areas listed above are pigmented to greater
or lesser extents in all primate species
(Montagna & Machida, 1966; Montagna
et al., 1966a,b), suggesting that the potential
for induction of melanogenesis (Erickson &
Montagna, 1975) in exposed skin is also
primitive for the group.
Physiological models have demonstrated
that the evolution of hairlessness and an
essentially modern sweating mechanism
were coordinated with the higher activity
levels associated with the modern limb
proportions and striding bipedalism
(Montagna, 1981; Schwartz & Rosenblum,
1981; Wheeler, 1984, 1996; Chaplin et al.,
1994). Throughout this transitional period,
the critical function of the integument in
thermoregulation was maintained through
evolution of an increased number of sweat
glands, particularly on the face (Cabanac &
Caputa, 1979; Falk, 1990), that increased
the maximum rate of evaporative cooling
available at any one time (Wheeler, 1996;
see also Mahoney, 1980). The brain is
extremely heat sensitive, and its temperature
closely follows arterial temperature (Nelson
& Nunneley, 1998). Evolution of a wholebody cooling mechanism capable of finely
regulating arterial temperature was, therefore, a prerequisite for brain expansion
and increased activity levels. Naked skin
itself affords a thermoregulatory advantage
because it makes for a reduced total thermal load requiring evaporative dissipation
(Wheeler, 1996). As the density of body hair
decreased and the density of sweat glands
increased, the need for protection of subepidermal tissues against the destructive
effects of UV radiation, particularly UVB,
also increased. This protection was accomplished by an increase in melanization of the
skin.

The excerpt you provided is from a scientific paper titled "The evolution of human skin coloration" by Nina G. Jablonski and George Chaplin. The paper discusses the adaptive nature of variations in human skin color and their relationship to the regulation of ultraviolet (UV) radiation penetration in the skin.
The authors present evidence that variations in skin color are adaptive and related to the level of UV radiation in different regions. They used data on UV radiation levels and skin reflectance of indigenous peoples to test hypotheses regarding the distribution of skin colors relative to UV levels.
The major findings of the study include:
Skin reflectance is strongly correlated with absolute latitude and UV radiation levels. The highest correlation was observed at 545 nm, suggesting that melanin pigmentation plays a role in regulating the effects of UV radiation on cutaneous blood vessels in the dermis.
Predicted skin reflectances aligned closely with observed values.
Females were found to be lighter skinned than males in all populations where skin reflectance data were available.
The clinal gradation of skin coloration observed among indigenous peoples is correlated with UV radiation levels and represents an adaptive compromise between photoprotection and vitamin D synthesis.
The paper also discusses the evolution of human skin coloration, starting from the primitive condition of lightly pigmented or unpigmented skin covered with dark hair, similar to that of modern chimpanzees. The development of a naked, darkly pigmented integument occurred early in the evolution of the genus Homo, providing protection against UV-induced injury and photolysis of folate, a metabolite essential for embryonic neural tube development and spermatogenesis.
As hominids migrated to regions with lower UV radiation levels, varying degrees of depigmentation evolved to enable UVB-induced synthesis of previtamin D3. The authors suggest that the lighter skin coloration of females may be necessary to facilitate higher vitamin D3 synthesis during pregnancy and lactation.
The paper concludes that skin coloration in humans is adaptive and subject to change throughout evolution. It emphasizes that skin color should not be used to determine phylogenetic relationships among human groups.

It's an evolutionary adaptation to child-bearing.

Women, on average, do have lighter skin than men, as you've noted. This is measurable, and, evidently, universal—it appears among people in all geographic regions. There's a nice anthropological study that covers this in detail here. I quote a relevant excerpt, below:

Comparison of skin reflectances between the sexes confirmed previous observations that human females are consistently lighter than males (Byard, 1981; Robins, 1991). Although female skin coloration darkens through adolescence and adulthood...females are still significantly lighter (that is, show a higher value for skin reflectance) than males for populations in which males and females are represented from the same location.

Light skin is more efficient than dark skin at photosynthesizing vitamin D. Vitamin D, in turn, is necessary for calcium absorption in the human body. Women have elevated need for calcium absorption during pregnancy and breastfeeding stages of child-bearing, since they're supporting the fetal and neonatal skeletal systems. And so women's skin is slightly demelanized, as compared with men's skin, for improved efficiency at vitamin D synthesis.

It's kind of a cool example of sexual dimorphism in humans.

Why do men have mostly darker skin compared to women?
This is true of most (but not every) human population, and I have heard that (relative) lightness of skin indicates higher fertility in females, and darkness possibly to higher resistance to parasites in males. Interestingly, although the trend is generally consistent, the very darkest skinned populations are not those historically exposed to the most sunlight, but those in almost no direct sunlight (under jungle canopies), an indication of parasite resistance.

I think that is more of a subjective pronouncement, than a fact. However since much of the world is agrarian, perhaps the men spend more time outside tending to crops and animals.

The lighter skin tone observed in women compared to men around the world is believed to be an evolutionary adaptation related to child-bearing. Women have higher calcium requirements during pregnancy and breastfeeding to support the development of the fetal and neonatal skeletal systems. Lighter skin is more efficient at photosynthesizing vitamin D, which is essential for calcium absorption in the body. Therefore, women's skin is slightly demelanized, or lighter, compared to men's skin to improve the efficiency of vitamin D synthesis.
This sexual dimorphism in skin coloration is thought to be a result of the selective pressures of reproductive success and the specific nutritional needs associated with child-bearing. However, it's important to note that this pattern may not be true for every individual or population, as there can be variations and exceptions based on different genetic, environmental, and cultural factors.

I read that ancient egyptian paintings sometimes used this in an exaggerated way. But maybe the women where kept in from the sun more and covered more than the men as well.

It is true that ancient Egyptian paintings sometimes depicted women with lighter skin tones than men, and this could be interpreted as an exaggerated representation of the natural sexual dimorphism in skin coloration. However, it is important to consider that ancient Egyptian art was also influenced by cultural and societal norms, as well as artistic conventions.
In ancient Egypt, women's clothing and headdresses often covered a larger portion of their bodies compared to men, providing more protection from the sun. Additionally, there is evidence to suggest that cosmetics and skin care practices in ancient Egypt involved the use of substances that could potentially lighten the skin tone. These cultural factors, along with artistic preferences, may have contributed to the portrayal of women with lighter skin in Egyptian art.
While these factors could have played a role in the artistic representations, it is important to note that they do not necessarily reflect the natural variation in skin color between ancient Egyptian men and women. The underlying biological and evolutionary factors, such as the higher calcium requirements during pregnancy and breastfeeding, are likely more significant in explaining the general pattern of lighter skin in women compared to men.

UV radiation at the surface of the
Earth
The sun emits electromagnetic radiation
from short-wavelength X-rays to longwavelength radio waves. Because X-rays and
the shortest UV waves (UVC, <280 nm) do
not penetrate the atmosphere, middle
(UVB, 280-320 nm) and long (UVA 320-
400 nm) wavelength UV radiation, along
with the visible wavelengths and infrared,
are of greatest biological significance.
In order for solar radiation to produce a
photochemical effect, it must be absorbed.
For an effective photon of radiation to be
absorbed, it must first travel from the sun to
the body's surface through the atmosphere.
Atmospheric absorption and scattering of
light are functions of the air mass through
which light must travel (Daniels, 1959). The
air mass, in turn, is a function of the angle of
the sun to the observer, which is determined
by the time of day, season, latitude and
altitude. The air mass has a great influence
on the transmission of UV radiation
because, in general, scattering is greatest in
the UV and shorter visible wavelengths
(Daniels, 1959). The transmission of UV
and visible radiation to the Earth's surface
are also determined by absorption in the
ozone layer, clouds, dust, haze and various
organic compounds (Daniels, 1959, 1964).
Prior to the utilization of remote sensing
technology, the intensity of UV radiation at
the Earth's surface and the erythemal
response of human skin to UV radiation
were estimated using mathematical models
(Paltridge & Barton, 1978). Although these
models were parameterized to account for
the effects of solar elevation, the amounts of
ozone and aerosols in the atmosphere,
and the surface albedo on estimated UV
      59
radiation, they were merely models, not
direct measurements. With the application
of remote sensing to this problem, however,
it has been possible to directly measure the
UV radiation reaching the Earth's surface,
taking ozone concentration and scene reflectivities (cloud conditions, and snow and ice
cover) into account (Herman & Celarier,
1996). The existence of directly measured
data means that it is possible to know exactly
how much UV radiation made it to the
Earth's surface at a specific day and time; it
is no longer necessary to rely on calculated
estimates. The present study is the first in
which direct measurements of UV radiation
at the Earth's surface have been used to test
hypotheses concerning the evolution of
human skin pigmentation.
Relethford (1997) recently suggested that
hemispheric differences in human skin color
were due to hemispheric differences in UV
radiation. In response to this claim, we have
demonstrated, using direct measurements of
UV radiation, that the annual erythemal
means for UV radiation in the northern and
southern hemispheres were not significantly
different, but that significant differences
between the hemispheres are found at the
summer and winter solstices (Chaplin &
Jablonski, 1998). The magnitude of these
differences can be predicted from today's
perihelion effect (i.e., that the Earth is
closest to the sun on 3 January, during the
Austral Summer). We have also shown
(Chaplin & Jablonski, 1998) that the
hemispheric differences in skin color that
Relethford demonstrated are due in large
part to the fact that, in the southern hemisphere, the areas receiving high annual UV
radiation constitute a much larger percentage of the total habitable land area than in
the northern hemisphere. In other words, a
larger proportion of the habitable land of
the southern hemisphere lies closer to the
equator than it does in the northern hemisphere. This area receives high annual doses
of UV radiation. In contrast, the vast
majority of habitable land in the northern
hemisphere lies north of the Tropic of
Cancer and receives low annual doses of
UV radiation. The hemispheric bias in the
latitudinal distribution of land masses has
had profound consequences for the evolution of skin pigmentation for the humans
inhabiting the two hemispheres (Chaplin &
Jablonski, 1998).
Melanin and the effects of UV
radiation on human skin
In the skin, melanin acts as an optical and
chemical photoprotective filter, which
reduces the penetration of all wavelengths
of light into subepidermal tissues (Daniels,
1959; Kaidbey et al., 1979). Electromagnetic radiation impinging on the human
skin can undergo a number of interactions:
it can be reflected by the surface of the
stratum corneum; it can enter the stratum
corneum after a slight change in its direction
of travel; it can interact with melanin dust in
the stratum corneum, resulting in partial or
total absorption; it can traverse deeper layers
and experience a possible additional scattering; or it can enter the viable epidermis
where it encounters melanin packaged
within melanosomes (Kollias et al., 1991).
Epidermal melanin has different forms at
different sites within the skin and these
interact differently with radiation (Kollias
et al., 1991). At all of these sites, melanin
works an optical filter to attenuate radiation
by scattering (Kollias et al., 1991). It also
acts as a chemical filter through its function
as a stable free radical that can absorb
compounds produced by photochemical
action which would be toxic or carcinogenic
(Daniels, 1959; Kollias et al., 1991). The
melanin dust of the stratum corneum
appears to be a degradation product of
the melanosomes, the organelles in which
the melanin pigment resides. This serves the
highly desirable function of attenuating
radiation close to the skin's surface, thus
60 . .   . 
sparing the deeper, viable layers. Most epidermal melanin is packaged in intact
melanosomes that are located deeper in the
skin, however. These organelles are distributed to keratinocytes throughout the
Malpighian layer of the epidermis by the
dendritic processes of melanocytes. Thus,
the superior photoprotection of highly melanized skin is accomplished by absorption
and scattering, which are influenced by the
density and distribution of melanosomes
within keratinocytes in the basal and parabasal layers of the epidermis (Kaidbey et al.,
1979) and by the presence of specks of
melanin dust in the stratum corneum
(Daniels, 1964). The heavily pigmented
melanocytes of darker skins also have the
ability to resume proliferation after
irradiation with UVB radiation, indicating
that they can recover more quickly from the
growth-inhibitory effects of UVB exposure
(Barker et al., 1995).
Most studies of the effects of UV radiation
on human skin have utilized as a standard
the minimum-erythemal dose (UVMED),
which is the quantity of UV radiation
required to produce a barely perceptible
reddening of lightly-pigmented skin.
Apart from its beneficial role in vitamin D
synthesis, the effects of UVB radiation on
the skin are universally harmful. Suppression of sweating and subsequent disruption
of thermoregulation due to sunburninduced damage to sweat glands are the
most serious immediate effects of excessive
UVB exposure (Daniels, 1964; Pandolf
et al., 1992). Other short-term harmful
effects include discomfort, lowering of the
pain threshold, vesiculation and possible
secondary infection following severe sunburn, desquamation and nutrient photolysis
(Branda & Eaton, 1978; Daniels, 1964).
Degenerative changes in the dermis and
epidermis due to UVB exposure are realized
over longer time courses, some eventually
resulting in skin cancers. The question from
an evolutionary point of view is do any of
these effects, singly or in combination, have
direct effects on reproductive success? Basal
cell and squamous cell carcinomas, for
instance, while a significant cause of morbidity in lightly pigmented peoples, rarely
influence fitness because they generally
affect individuals after reproductive age and
are rarely fatal (Blum, 1961; Roberts, 1977;
Robins, 1991). Malignant melanomas,
though rare (representing 4% of skin cancer
diagnoses) are more often fatal than other
skin cancers, but their effect on reproductive
success is still limited because of their late
onset, well beyond the age of first reproduction (Johnson et al., 1998).
We argue here that protection against
nutrient photolysis, and specifically photolysis of folate, was a prime selective agent
which brought about the evolution of deeply
pigmented skins among people living under
regimes of high UVB radiation throughout
most of the year because of the direct
connection between folate and individual
reproductive success. The importance to
individual fitness of protection of sweat
glands and maintenance of thermoregulatory capability is also seen as contributing
to increased melanization.
Folate and human reproductive
success
Folic acid is an essential nutrient, which is
required for nucleotide and, therefore, DNA
biosynthesis. Folic acid is converted in the
body to its conjugated form, folate. The lack
of folate has long been known to bring about
a macrocystic megaloblastic anemia because
folate is required for the maturation of
bone marrow and the development of red
blood cells. Folate deficiency in nonhuman
mammals has also been shown to produce
multiple fetal anomalies including malformations of the eye, central nervous system,
palate, lip, gastrointestinal system, aorta,
kidney and skeleton (Omaye, 1993, and
references cited therein). All of these
      61
problems can ultimately be traced to folate's
roles in purine and pyrimidine biosynthesis
(Omaye, 1993; Fleming & Copp, 1998).
It has recently been confirmed that there
is a connection between defective folate
metabolism and neural tube defects (NTDs)
in humans (Fleming & Copp, 1998; Bower
& Stanley, 1989; Medical Research Council
Vitamin Research Group, 1991). Neural
tube defects comprise a family of congenital
malformations that result from incomplete
neurulation and that are expressed as
deformities of varying severity. In craniorachischisis totalis, the entire neural tube fails
to close; embryos fail early in their development and are spontaneously aborted.
Failure of the cranial neuropore to fuse
results in anencephalus or craniorachischisis,
in which the brain is represented by an
exposed dorsal mass of undifferentiated
tissue. Anencephalic embryos often survive
into late fetal life or term, but invariably die
soon after birth. When failure of neural tube
closure disrupts the induction of the overlying vertebral arches, the resulting condition of an open neural canal is called spina
bifida. Cases of spina bifida vary in their
seriousness. The most disabling involve the
protrusion of neural tissue and meninges
through an open neural canal (meningomyelocele). The least serious involve failure
of a single vertebral arch to fuse with no
herniation of underlying neural tissue (spina
bifida occulta).
Since records have been kept in developed
countries, anencephalus and spina bifida have
been found to be particularly common in
light-skinned populations. These defects
accounted for as much as 15% of all perinatal and 10% of all postperinatal mortality
in the worst-affected populations prior to
the introduction of preventative nutritional
supplementation (Elwood & Elwood, 1980).
Since the advent of prenatal diagnosis, the
prevalence of NTDs in relation to all conceptions has been shown to be significantly
higher than birth prevalence (Velie & Shaw,
1996; Forrester et al., 1998), partly because
of the high rate of early miscarriage in the
case of the most serious defects (C. Bower,
personal communication).
Folic acid prevents 70% of NTDs in
humans and is thought to act by direct
normalization of neurulation through regulation of pyrimidine biosynthesis necessary for DNA production (Minns, 1996;
Fleming & Copp, 1998). In the body, folate
is most sensitive to two major environmental
agents, ethanol and UV radiation. In the
case of ethanol, folate deficiency is a welldocumented problem of chronic alcoholics
(Tamura & Halsted, 1983). The photosensitivity of folate is significant, and the
nutrient can be readily degraded by
natural sunlight or UV light (Kaunitz &
Lindenbaum, 1977). Photolysis of folate in
humans has been demonstrated by a significant decline in folate levels when serum
(in vitro) or light-skinned subjects (in vivo)
were exposed to simulated natural sunlight
(Branda & Eaton, 1978). A causal relationship between in vivo folate photolysis in
humans and NTDs, first suggested by
Jablonski (1992, 1999), has recently been
supported by the report of NTDs in three
unrelated subjects whose mothers had been
exposed to UV light on the sun beds of
tanning salons during the first weeks of
their pregnancies (Lapunzina, 1996). Folate
deficiencies brought about by UV photolysis
have also been implicated in the etiology of
NTDs in some amphibian populations
(Jablonski, 1998) because such defects have
been seen in amphibian embryos exposed
to UV radiation (Higgins & Sheard, 1926;
Licht & Grant, 1997).
In addition to its important role in ensuring embryonic survival through proper
neurulation, folate has been shown to be
critical to another important process central
to reproduction, spermatogenesis. In both
mice (Cosentino et al., 1990) and rats
(Mathur et al., 1977), chemically induced
folate deficiency resulted in spermatogenic

The passage you provided discusses the relationship between UV radiation, human skin pigmentation, and the role of folate in reproductive success. Here's a summary:
The sun emits a wide range of electromagnetic radiation, including X-rays, UV radiation, visible light, and infrared. Only a specific range of UV radiation (UVA and UVB) along with visible light and infrared reaches the Earth's surface and has biological significance.
The intensity of UV radiation at the Earth's surface is influenced by various factors such as the angle of the sun, atmospheric absorption and scattering, ozone concentration, cloud cover, dust, and organic compounds.
UV radiation is absorbed by the body's surface and can have photochemical effects. The skin's pigment, melanin, plays a crucial role in protecting against UV radiation. Melanin acts as both an optical and chemical filter, reducing the penetration of light into the skin and absorbing harmful compounds produced by UV radiation.
UV radiation, particularly UVB, has harmful effects on the skin, such as sunburn, discomfort, and long-term damage that can lead to skin cancer. However, the specific effects on reproductive success are not clearly defined. Skin cancers like basal cell and squamous cell carcinomas typically occur after reproductive age, while malignant melanomas, although more fatal, also affect individuals beyond reproductive age.
The passage suggests that the evolution of darkly pigmented skin among populations living in regions with high UVB radiation may be attributed to the need for protection against folate photolysis. Folate, an essential nutrient for DNA biosynthesis, is vulnerable to degradation by UV radiation. Folate deficiency can lead to various health issues, including neural tube defects (NTDs) during fetal development. The prevention of NTDs is a crucial factor for reproductive success.
The protective role of melanin against folate photolysis and the maintenance of thermoregulatory capabilities are seen as potential contributors to increased melanization.
Overall, the passage suggests that the selective pressure of protecting against folate photolysis, which directly affects reproductive success, may have played a significant role in the evolution of human skin pigmentation, particularly in regions with high UVB radiation.

Thus, through folate's roles in the survival
of embryos through normalization of
neurulation and maintenance of male
fertility, and its involvement in a range of
other physiological processes dependent on
nucleotide biosynthesis, regulation of folate
levels appears to be critical to individual
reproductive success. Folate levels in
humans are influenced by dietary intake of
folic acid and by destructive, exogenous
factors such as UV radiation. Therefore, the
solution to the evolutionary problem of
maintaining adequate folate levels in areas
of high UV radiation involved the ingestion
of adequate amounts of folic acid in the diet
and protection against UV radiationinduced folate photolysis. The latter was
accomplished by increasing the concentration of the natural sunscreen, melanin,
in the skin. The low prevalences of severe
folate deficiency (Lawrence, 1983;
Lamparelli et al., 1988) and NTDs (Carter,
1970; Elwood & Elwood, 1980; Buccimazza
et al., 1994; Wiswell et al., 1990; Shaw et al.,
1994) observed among native Africans and
African Americans, even among individuals
of marginal nutritional status, are probably
due to a highly melanized integument,
which protects against folate photolysis.
Skin pigmentation and vitamin D
synthesis
Vitamin D3 is essential for normal growth,
calcium absorption and skeletal development. Deficiency of the vitamin can cause
death, immobilization, or pelvic deformities
which prevent normal childbirth (Neer,
1975). Requirements for vitamin D3 are
elevated in females during pregnancy and
lactation because of the need for enhanced
maternal absorption of calcium in order to
build the fetal and neonatal skeletal system
(Whitehead et al., 1981; Kohlmeier &
Marcus, 1995; Brunvand et al., 1996). In
most humans, casual exposure to sunlight
leads to conversion of 7-dehydrocholesterol
in the skin to previtamin D3 by UV photons
and subsequent isomerization of the latter to
vitamin D3 at body temperature (Loomis,
1967; Webb et al., 1988). Increasing the
melanin in human skin increases the length
of exposure to UV light that is needed
to maximize synthesis of previtamin D3
(Holick et al., 1981). Deeply melanized
skins become nonadaptive under conditions
where the concentration of melanin is too
high to permit sufficient amounts of vitamin
D3 precursor to be synthesized in the skin
under conditions of available UV radiation
(Loomis, 1967; Holick et al., 1981; Clemens
et al., 1982). If the duration of UV exposure
is not sufficient to catalyze previtamin D3
synthesis, individuals are at much higher risk
of vitamin D3 deficiency and its manifestations (rickets, osteomalacia, and osteoporosis), as has been demonstrated by
recent migrants from Ethiopia to Israel
(Fogelman et al., 1995) or from the Indian
subcontinent to urban centers in the U.K.
(Henderson et al., 1987).
Following Murray (1934), Loomis (1967)
argued that depigmentation of the skin was a
necessary adaptation for humans attempting
to inhabit regions outside the tropics,
especially those north of 40N, which
receive low average amounts of UV radiation throughout the year. In addition, he
advocated the position that deeply pigmented skin was also an adaptation for
physiological regulation of vitamin D3
levels. To Loomis, a highly melanized
integument prevented UV-radiationinduced vitamin D3 toxicity caused by
over-synthesis of previtamin D3. Both of
Loomis's claims about integumentary pigmentation in humans and vitamin D3 levels
have been challenged.
The hypothesis that deeply pigmented
skin protects against hypervitamosis D
under conditions of high UV radiation has
      63
been conclusively disproven. Vitamin D
toxicity is prevented by a ceiling effect on
previtamin D3 synthesis combined with
in vivo photolysis of vitamin D3 itself
(Holick et al., 1981; Holick, 1987). Vitamin
D3 intoxication can occur as the result of
individuals overdosing on vitamin supplements, but no cases of naturally occurring
vitamin D3 intoxication have ever been
reported (Robins, 1991).
Loomis's central hypothesis concerning
depigmentation of the integument of
humans living at high latitudes as a requirement for adequate vitamin D synthesis has
been most strongly challenged by Robins
(1991). Robins' main points are that early
Homo at high latitudes was exposed to the
full impact of the natural environment. Even
when clad with animal skins and furs, he
claims that enough of the body's surface
would be exposed to permit synthesis of
adequate amounts of previtamin D3. While
he admits that winters in Europe during
glacials would have been particularly cold
and dim, he indicates that the late spring
and summer would have afforded good
opportunities for hominids to expose their
skin to UV radiation. According to Robins
(1991), the long, dull winters would not
have triggered widespread hypovitamosis D
and rickets because vitamin D can be stored
in fat and muscle (Rosenstreich et al., 1971;
Mawer et al., 1972). He suggests that
vitamin D deficiencies are a product of
''industrialization, urbanization and overpopulation'' (Robins, 1991:207) and supports his claim by pointing out that the
majority of modern human populations that
suffer from such problems are urban dwellers, deprived of natural sunlight and the
opportunity to synthesize previtamin D3.
According to Robins, dark-skinned human
populations living under conditions of low
annual UV radiation do not suffer from
vitamin D deficiencies that can be attributed
to lack of sunlight. The depigmentation conspicuous in peoples inhabiting the northern
hemisphere above 40N cannot be traced,
according to Robins, to the need to synthesize vitamin D in their skin. Rather, people
with deeply pigmented skin can survive well
under conditions of low annual UV radiation provided that they spend sufficient
time outdoors in the spring and summer to
build up physiological stores of vitamin D
for the winter (Robins, 1991). As is discussed below, the findings of the current
study and the weight of current clinical
evidence do not support Robins' counterarguments against the vitamin D hypothesis
of depigmentation.
Testing the relationship between skin
color and levels of UV radiation
Previous studies of the relationship between
environmental variables and the skin color
of indigenous populations using skin reflectance spectrophotometry demonstrated
highest associations with latitude (Roberts &
Kahlon, 1976; Roberts, 1977; Tasa et al.,
1985). These were interpreted as reflecting
the crucial role of UV radiation in determining skin color. Until this time, accurate tests
of this relationship were not possible
because accurate data on UVMED levels
at the Earth's surface were not available.
Because these data are now available
(Herman & Celarier, 1996), we were able to
apply them to two critical analyses: (1) in
the determination of the geographic distribution of the potential for previtamin D3
synthesis; and (2) in assessment of the relationship between surface UV radiation
levels and skin color reflectances for indigenous populations.
Methods
Skin reflectance data
A database of skin reflectance data was
compiled from the literature. The database
comprises samples designated as male,
female, and both sexes, for reflectance at
64 . .   . 
425 nm (blue filter), 545 nm (green filter)
and 685 nm (red filter), for the upper inner
arm site. In many primary reports, intermediate wavelength reflectance readings
were also provided, but these were not used.
The complete skin reflectance data set with
bibliographic sources is presented in the
Appendix. The vast majority of these data
had been collected with the E.E.L. (Evans
Electric Limited) reflectometer. Readings
for Colombian natives were the only ones
taken using the Photovolt abridged spectrophotometer. These measurements were converted to E.E.L.-comparable values by using
the regression equation for Belize Creoles
developed by Lees & Byard (1978) designated in the Appendix. As is obvious from
an inspection of the collated data, the skin
reflectance data set is far from complete and
is strongly skewed toward representation of
indigenous human populations from the Old
World. The inherent deficiencies of this
database limited the scope of analyses that
could be undertaken.
Indigenous populations were defined for
purposes of this study as those which had
existed in their current locations for a long
time prior to European colonization. The
names by which areas or groups were
identified were taken from the original
citations. Populations known to have high
levels of admixture or to have recently
migrated to their current locations were
excluded. Some populations were represented by males only, others by males and
females, and others where the values for the
two sexes had been averaged by the original
workers. In some cases, the sex of the subjects was not stated in the original report.
Because more skin reflectance data exist for
males than for females, analyses of skin
reflectance in which data for the sexes were
combined are slightly biased toward male
reflectance values. In cases where more than
one skin reflectance was measured for a
specific population, either for each sex or by
multiple workers, the means for each sex
were averaged, except in the cases noted
below where the reflectance values for the
sexes were analyzed separately.
Reflectance data were specified in original reports at varying levels of geographic
accuracy. Those specified to a small geographic area such as township or county
could be matched to a small number of
average UVMED cell values. For those
specified at the regional or country level, a
single skin reflectance value was associated
with multiple UVMED cell values, depending on the size of the region. These varied
from one cell (e.g., Germany, Mainz;
India, Goa) to 453 cells (Zaire). To overcome the problem of cell replication and
artificial exaggeration of variance, the
UVMED data for each specified area was
averaged for that area to produce a single
value. This data reduction exercise made it
possible for a single skin reflectance value
to be evaluated relative to a single average
UVMED value.
Because Relethford (1997) has suggested
that a different relationship between UV
radiation and skin reflectance exists between
the northern and southern hemispheres,
separate analyses were performed for both
hemispheres together and for each hemisphere separately. (The only analysis in
which this was not done was that comparing
the significance of differences in skin reflectance between the sexes. See below.)
Although the annual UVMED is equal for
both hemispheres, the seasonal distribution
of UV radiation is different (Chaplin &
Jablonski, 1998). The hemispheres also differ in their respective land surface area
(Chaplin & Jablonski, 1998) and degree of
land mass connectivity. It is impossible, for
instance, for non-seafarers to move around
the globe in the southern hemisphere.
Lastly, the proportion of different vegetation
zones between the hemispheres is different,
with the northern hemisphere exhibiting
more extensive areas of forest, desert and
mountains.

Calculation of annual average UVMED
The annual average values for UVMED
were derived from readings taken from the
NASA Total Ozone Mapping Spectrometer
(TOMS) which was flown aboard the
Nimbus-7 satellite between 1978 and 1993
(Herman & Celarier, 1996). The data represent the relative daily areal exposure of UV
radiation effective in causing skin irritation,
computed at each 1·25 degree longitude by
one degree latitude pixel, between 65S and
65N; the solar flux was measured at noon
(Herman & Celarier, 1996). These readings
were computed to account for the total
ozone column and scene reflectivities (cloud
and snow cover) in the same latitude-
longitude pixel. These measurements were
then combined with the results of radiative
transfer calculations, terrain height, solar
zenith angle and the model action spectrum
of erythemal sensitivity for caucasoid skin
(Herman & Celarier, 1996). The wavelength range of 280-400 nm sampled by
the TOMS ensured that all significant contributions to the erythemal exposure were
included in the UVMED. Because the
action spectrum is defined up to an arbitrary
multiplicative constant, the basic UVMED
data are of arbitrary dimensions.
The original dataset was very large (over
190,000 data points representing 37,400
readings taken each day from 1979-1992).
Therefore, an abridged dataset (the annual
average UVMED) was produced by taking
an average for all years of the average of the
21st to the 23rd days of each month.
All data analyses in this study were undertaken using S-Plus 2000 and ArcView,
reprojected in Mercator projection.
Analysis and visualization of the potential for
vitamin D3 synthesis
The rate of previtamin D3 synthesis in
lightly pigmented human skin exposed to
natural sunlight has been experimentally
determined (Webb et al., 1988). Working in
Boston, Massachusetts in 1986, Webb et al.
(1988) found that the earliest occurrence in
the year of previtamin D3 synthesis in neonatal caucasoid foreskin samples was on 17
March. Because the actual UVMED for that
place and time was available from the NASA
TOMS dataset, values representing the
potential for vitamin D3 synthesis relative to
annual average UVMED could be calculated for all locations included in the NASA
TOMS dataset. It was then possible to
define distinct geographic zones representing the differing potentials for vitamin D3
synthesis for light-skinned individuals. The
annual average UVMED and average skin
reflectance measurement for each zone were
then calculated and compared. The skin
reflectance data used for this analysis comprised data for indigenous people (males,
females, both sexes and unspecified sex),
averaged by country and then by zone.
We also sought to demonstrate the potential for vitamin D3 synthesis in the skin of
dark-skinned human populations. The
length of time required for endogenous
vitamin D3 biosynthesis increases with
increasing melanin concentration in the skin
(Clemens et al., 1982; Holick et al., 1981).
Thus, the data showing the time of exposure
to UV radiation necessary to maximize previtamin D3 formation in different human
groups were used to calculate the geographical zones in which annual UVMED was not
sufficient, averaged over the year, to catalyze
previtamin D3 synthesis in moderately and
highly melanized skin.
Sexual differences in skin reflectance
In order to test the hypothesis that females
and males of the same populations differ in
their average skin reflectance, we selected
data from specific population where skin
reflectance measurements had been taken
and reported separately for males and
females. A standard two-sample t-test was
used to determine the significance of the
differences between the sexes at the same
locality. Separate analyses for the northern
66 . .   . 
and southern hemispheres were not undertaken because the small sizes of the datasets that met the above criteria would
have rendered hemisphere-specific analyses
meaningless. Further, our objective here was
not to test the hypothesis that there is a
difference between the hemispheres in the
degree of differentiation between the two
sexes in skin reflectance.
The relationship of annual average UVMED
to skin reflectance
A correlation matrix was used to test the
strength of the relationships between annual
average UVMED, latitude and skin reflectance. This analysis was undertaken
specifically to determine the strength of the
correlation of skin reflectance to UVMED
relative to its correlation with latitude. The
skin reflectance data used in this analysis
comprised those from indigenous populations, all-sex samples combined, averaged
by country. For this analysis, latitude was
transformed to absolute latitude, i.e., the
absolute value of the latitude, which
expresses the angle of a location from the
Equator rather than relative north and
south. It is unclear from previous studies of
human skin pigmentation as to whether
workers utilized conventional latitude or
absolute latitude for purposes of correlation
or regression analyses. Transformation of
latitude to absolute latitude is necessary
because of the nonlinear relationship
between solar insolation and latitude. The
transformation to absolute latitude renders
this relationship more linear, and thus yields
much higher correlations.
The relationship between UVMED and
skin color reflectance was explored in
greater detail using a least squares regression. For this analysis, the skin reflectance
data used were the same as those employed
in the correlation matrix analysis described
above. Separate regressions were developed
for data from each hemisphere, for each
widely used skin reflectance filter (425, 545
and 685 nm).
Predicted vs. observed skin reflectances
In order to compare predicted vs. observed
values for the skin reflectances of indigenous
peoples, the largest available dataset for
observed skin reflectance (at 685 nm) was
used. It is important to note again that some
populations were represented by males only,
as both sexes combined, or as unspecified
sex, as discussed. Although these variations
in sexual classification of the raw data added
to the expected variance of the pooled dataset, this problem could not be avoided.
Significant outliers from the regression line
were then identified.
In order to construct a map of predicted
skin colors for modern terrestrial environments, a regression was computed between
annual average UVMED and the observed
skin reflectance. The observed reflectances
for indigenous populations were based on all
available data for a particular area or group.
A regression equation derived from a larger
data set including values for males, females,
both sexes and samples of unknown sex was
used:

The passage you provided discusses the roles of folate and vitamin D in human reproductive success and the relationship between skin color and UV radiation. Here's a summary of the main points:
Folate: Folate plays a critical role in embryo survival, neurulation (formation of the neural tube), and male fertility. Folate levels in humans are influenced by dietary intake of folic acid and external factors like UV radiation.
UV Radiation and Folate: Areas with high UV radiation pose a challenge to maintaining adequate folate levels. To counter this, humans have evolved to ingest sufficient folic acid in their diet and protect against UV-induced folate degradation by increasing melanin concentration in the skin. This is why native Africans and African Americans, who have highly melanized skin, have low prevalence of severe folate deficiency and neural tube defects.
Vitamin D: Vitamin D3 is essential for normal growth, calcium absorption, and skeletal development. Pregnant and lactating women have increased vitamin D3 requirements. Sun exposure to UV radiation helps the skin synthesize vitamin D3.
Skin Pigmentation and Vitamin D Synthesis: The production of melanin in human skin acts as a natural sunscreen, reducing the amount of UV radiation that can catalyze vitamin D synthesis. Darkly pigmented skin requires longer exposure to UV light to synthesize adequate vitamin D3. However, deeply melanized skin can become nonadaptive in regions with low annual UV radiation, leading to vitamin D deficiency.
Depigmentation and Vitamin D Hypothesis: Early humans at high latitudes were exposed to varying degrees of UV radiation. Some argue that depigmentation of the skin was necessary for adequate vitamin D synthesis, while others propose that vitamin D deficiencies are a result of modern lifestyle factors like reduced sun exposure. The relationship between skin color and vitamin D synthesis is still a topic of debate.
Testing the Relationship: The study mentioned in the passage analyzed skin reflectance data from various indigenous populations and compared it with UV radiation levels at the Earth's surface. The data showed a correlation between skin color and UV radiation, supporting the importance of UV radiation in determining skin color.
Overall, the passage highlights the evolutionary adaptations related to folate and vitamin D, as well as the complex relationship between skin color and UV radiation.

Analysis and visualization of the potential for
vitamin D3 synthesis
Three zones representing different potentials for UV-induced vitamin D3 synthesis
in light-skinned humans were identified
(Figure 1). The annual average UVMED
and average skin reflectance measurement
for each zone are presented in Table 1.
Zone 1 was delimited as the area in which
the average daily UVMED was sufficient to
catalyze previtamin D3 synthesis throughout
the year. This zone comprises the area from

the whole year, is indicated by heavy stippling.

approximately 5 north of the Tropic of
Cancer to approximately 5 south of the
Tropic of Capricorn. Here, previtamin D3
could be synthesized in lightly pigmented
skin as a result of casual exposure to UVB
throughout all months of the year. Zone 2
was defined as the area in which the average daily UVMED for at least one month
was not sufficient to produce previtamin
D3 in lightly pigmented skin. (This zone is
indicated by light stippling in Figure 1.)
Large areas of the northern hemisphere fall
within this zone. Zone 3 was defined as the
area in which the daily UVMED, averaged
over the whole year, was not sufficient to
catalyze previtamin D3 synthesis in lightly
pigmented skin. That is, it was the zone in
which previtamin D3 synthesis resulting
from UVB exposure, as averaged over the
course of a year, was not sufficient to
meet minimum physiological requirements.
(This zone is indicated by heavy stippling
in Figure 1.) Although there were some
months around the summer solstice during
which there was sufficient UV radiation
to bring about cutaneous previtamin D3
synthesis in Zone 3 (and the attendant
potential for vitamin D storage), the average daily dose, when averaged over the
course of a year, was not sufficient to
catalyze the reaction. In other words, insufficient ambient UV radiation is available
on a year by year (or long-term) basis to
permit adequate cutaneous biosynthesis of
previtamin D3.
It is important to note that the zones
defined in Figure 1 were calculated on the
basis of the potential for previtamin D3
synthesis in light skin. No comparable data
were available for dark skin. Data concerning the times of exposure necessary to maximize previtamin D3 synthesis in skin
samples with different melanin concentrations are known, however. These were
used to calculate the geographical zones in
which annual UVMED was not sufficient,
averaged over the year, to catalyze previtamin D3 synthesis in moderately and
highly melanized skin (Table 2; Figure 2).
Figure 2 is a comparison of the estimated
positions of Zone 3 from Figure 1 for human
populations with lightly, moderately and
deeply melanized skin. The fact that formation of previtamin D3 takes more than
five times as long in highly melanized (Type
VI) skin as it does in lightly melanized (Type
III) skin means that the continental areas
that are ''vitamin D safe'' for darker skins
are considerably smaller than they are for
lighter skins (Figure 2).
Sexual differences in skin reflectance
Females were found to be significantly
lighter (i.e., displaying higher reflectance
values) than males regardless of the filter
used to measure the reflectance (Table 3).
The relationship of annual average UVMED
to skin reflectance
When the relationship between annual average UVMED and values of skin reflectance
for the combined all-sexes dataset was
examined using a correlation matrix it was
found that, for skin reflectance at all wavelengths, the correlation with annual average
UVMED and absolute latitude were both
high (Table 4). The correlation between
skin reflectance and annual average
UVMED was stronger than the correlation
between skin reflectance and absolute

(green) filter reflectance for the separate
hemispheres and for the 685 nm (red) filter
reflectance for the southern hemisphere.
The correlation between skin reflectance
and annual average UVMED was only
slightly weaker than the correlation between
skin reflectance and absolute latitude in a
further four instances: for the 425 nm (blue)
filter reflectance for the southern hemisphere and both hemispheres combined, for
the 545 nm (green) filter reflectance for both
hemispheres combined, and for the 685 nm
(red) filter reflectance for both hemispheres
combined. In only two cases [425 nm (blue)
for the northern hemisphere and 685 nm
(red) for the northern hemisphere] was the
correlation between skin reflectance and
absolute latitude much higher than that
between skin reflectance and annual average
UVMED. The correlation between annual
average UVMED and absolute latitude
based on data from both hemispheres combined was found to be 0·935, much
higher than the correlation with untransformed latitude, 0·741.
When the relationship between annual
average UVMED and values of skin reflectance was examined using a least squares
regression model (Table 5), the highest r
2
values were associated with green (545 nm)
filter reflectance.
Predicted vs. observed skin reflectances
The differences between observed and predicted skin reflectance values at 685 nm for
indigenous populations were generally small
(Table 6; Figures 3 and 4), and the difference between the average observed and predicted values was not significant (P=0·9983;
two-sample t-test), and did not detract from
the validity of the predictive model.
Discussion
The results presented here strongly support
the theory that the degree of melanin pigmentation in human skin is an adaptation
for the regulation of penetration of UV
radiation into the epidermis.
The geographic distribution of the potential for
vitamin D3 synthesis
Skin pigmentation is determined as much by
the requirements of previtamin D3 synthesis
as by photoprotection. Within Zone 1 as
defined in this study, a clinal distribution of
skin reflectance relative to annual average
UVMED can be detected from inspection
of the values presented in Table 5. A cline

The annual average UVMED value for Zone 3 in Table 1 (for lightly pigmented skin) was multiplied by a factor
representing the increased number of hours necessary to catalyze previtamin D3 synthesis in more heavily
pigmented skin types, based on the results of Holick and colleagues (Holick et al., 1981). This yielded an estimate
of the minimum annual average UVMED necessary to catalyze previtamin D3 synthesis in darker skin types. The
designations of skin type and human population are from the original source.

of depigmentation is more noticeable in
Zone 2, where increasing depigmentation
has helped to ensure maintenance of
adequate vitamin D3 production in the skin
throughout most months of the year.
Although individuals in this zone do not
receive enough UVB during at least one
month each year to catalyze previtamin D3
synthesis, intake of vitamin D3-containing
foods and the ability of the body to store
vitamin D3 mitigates this short lapse in
previtamin D3 biosynthesis. For humans
living in this zone, however, the adoption
of more housebound lifestyles with low
UV radiation exposure combined with
inadequate vitamin D3 intake in recent years
has resulted in a high prevalence of hypovitaminosis D (Thomas et al., 1998). This
problem is exacerbated if the human inhabitants of Zone 2 are relatively dark-skinned.
The high prevalence of hypovitaminosis
D, rickets, osteomalacia and osteoporosis
among populations recently migrated from
the Indian subcontinent to the U.K. is
higher than that for the light-skinned general
population, and shows a marked north-
south gradient consistent with UV-radiation
dosage dependence (Hodgkin et al., 1973;
Henderson et al., 1987).
Humans inhabiting Zone 3 are at highest
risk of severe vitamin D3 deficiency. Successful, long-term human habitation of this
zone has depended upon two key factors:
the evolution of a depigmented integument
capable of permitting maximum cutaneous
previtamin D3 synthesis under conditions of
available UV radiation and the consumption
of foodstuffs naturally high in vitamin D3
(such as fish and marine mammals). Recent
migrants to high latitude regions, such as
Greenlanders, appear to be only very slowly

undergoing depigmentation because of their
vitamin D3-rich diet.
Robins (1991) has challenged the theory
that depigmentation in high latitude human
populations is due to the requirements of
endogenous vitamin D3 synthesis. He has
concluded that, for early Homo sapiens on
the Eurasian or North American landscapes
of the Pleistocene, ''there is not a scintilla of
paleontological or experimental evidence
that rickets (or osteomalacia) ever did or
would have manifested, regardless of skin
colour [sic]'' (Robins, 1991:208). The
paleoenvironmental and clinical evidence
now at hand militates against this
interpretation.
Populations of Homo sapiens (sensu stricto)
have been established above the 40th parallel, in areas of low annual UV radiation, for,
approximately, only the last 50,000 years.
(It is important to note in this connection
that there is no equivalent land mass in the
southern hemisphere available for human
habitation.) The period from approximately
50,000 to 10,000 years ago comprises the
Last Glaciation, and includes the Last
Glacial Maximum (LGM) at 18,000 B.P.
During this period, human habitation north
of the Tropic of Cancer and, particularly,
north of 40N was limited by low temperatures and the proximity of ice sheets.
Climatic oscillations were frequent and
sudden, and had profound impacts on the
distributions of humans and the mammals
they depended upon (Williams et al., 1993).
The minimum distance of habitation sites
from the southern margin of the ice sheets
was approximately 400-600 km (Madeyska,
1992). During the LGM, the areas of
Europe habitable by humans were characterized by extreme cold, with annual mean
air temperatures 8C colder than present
day, widespread decreases in precipitation,
and fierce dust storms (Frenzel, 1992a,b).
Accurate reconstruction of patterns of
human activity north of the 40th parallel
from the period of 50,000 to 10,000 B.P. is
not possible. It can be safely said, however,
that human populations—especially around
the LGM—here would have worn more
protective clothing and would have needed
to seek shelter from the elements more than
they do today. The latter would have been
particularly true of females and young
children.
Abundant clinical evidence attests to the
fact that moderately to deeply pigmented
humans suffer from various manifestations
of hypovitaminosis D3 (including rickets,
osteomalacia and osteoporosis) when their
opportunities for endogenous vitamin D3
synthesis are restricted as a result of changes
in lifestyle or geographical relocation.
Manifestations of vitamin D3 deficiency in
such populations can be attributed to lifestyle changes such as more indoor living in
urban environments and the wearing of concealing garments outdoors (Bachrach et al.,
1979; Haworth & Dilling, 1986; Henderson
et al., 1987; Gullu et al., 1998; Wauters &
Soesbergen, 1999). The phenomenon is
equally true of populations who have
recently relocated from an area of high
annual UV radiation to one of lower UV,
and who have otherwise maintained all
aspects of their original lifestyle (Hodgkin
et al., 1973; Fogelman et al., 1995).
Pregnant or lactating women and small
children undergoing rapid bone growth are
most susceptible to changes of UV radiation
regime (Bachrach et al., 1979; Fogelman
et al., 1995; Gessner et al., 1997; Namgung
et al., 1998; Waiters et al., 1999). Vitamin
D3 deficiencies are also common among the
elderly, where they render individuals more
susceptible to osteoporosis and its sequelae
(Davies et al., 1986; Thomas et al., 1998).
The key point here is that overwhelming
clinical evidence demonstrates that even a
relatively minor decrease in endogenous
synthesis of vitamin D3 as a result of
reduced annual UV radiation exposure can
trigger vitamin D3 deficiencies in moderately to deeply pigmented people. These

deficiencies are more marked in reproductive females, growing children and the
elderly. Because moderately to deeply pigmented people require from two to six times
as much UV radiation as lightly pigmented
individuals to catalyze the synthesis of an
equivalent amount of previtamin D3 (Table
2; Figure 2) (Holick et al., 1981; Clemens
et al., 1982), they are highly susceptible to
vitamin D3 deficiencies caused by a change
of UV radiation regime. We therefore conclude, contrary to Robins, that moderately
to deeply pigmented modern human populations are optimally tuned for endogenous
synthesis of vitamin D3 under the specific
UV radiation regimes under which they
evolved. This fine-tuning is easily disrupted
by changes of lifestyle or locale. This

situation applies equally to populations of
early Homo sapiens that undertook migrations from eastern Africa into the circumMediterranean region and Europe. Their
original levels of pigmentation would have
precipitated vitamin D3 crises in their new
environments, especially among females and
infants, and these crises would have been
more severe the farther north the populations ventured. Clinical evidence indicates
that the ability of humans to store vitamin
D3 and its metabolites for long periods of
time in fat and skeletal muscle is dependent
on their pre-existing stores of the vitamin
(Mawer et al., 1972). Individuals receiving
large doses of vitamin D3 by injection for the
first time showed rapid elimination of vitamin D3 metabolites within 7-10 days; those
who had previously received them showed a
much more protracted schedule of elimination (Mawer et al., 1972). Thus, the
potential for vitamin D3 storage is great if
the intake or the endogenous synthesis is
high; otherwise it is not. Robins' arguments
against the depigmentation hypothesis are,
therefore, not supported.
Sexual differences in skin reflectance
Comparison of skin reflectances between
the sexes confirmed previous observations
that human females are consistently lighter
than males (Byard, 1981; Robins, 1991).
Although female skin coloration darkens

only lightens after 45 (Wiskemann & Wisser,
1956; Byard, 1981), females are still significantly lighter (that is, show a higher value
for skin reflectance) than males for populations in which males and females are
represented from the same location. This
suggests that the lighter skin pigmentation of
females is needed to permit relatively greater
UV light penetration of the integument for
previtamin D3 synthesis. The extra calcium
needs of females during pregnancy and
lactation are met by increasing plasma concentrations of 1.25-dihydroxyvitamin D,
which in turn enhances calcium absorption in the intestine (Wilson et al., 1990;
Whitehead et al., 1981). Skin pigmentation
in human females thus represents a complex
compromise between the exigencies of photoprotection and previtamin D3 synthesis.
The documentation of lighter skin in
females than in males for all populations
raises a serious question concerning the
validity of the hypothesis that human skin
coloration is in large part determined by
sexual selection (Diamond, 1988, 1991).
Were this so, one would have to postulate
that there was a universal preference of
males for females slightly lighter than
themselves, even in populations purported
to prefer dark skin (e.g., Tasmanians;
Diamond, 1988, 1991). Avoidance of the
sun by females is practiced in some cultures
and is probably maintained as a custom in
those cultures in part by mate choice. It is
unlikely, however, that this acquired custom
would have any effect on constitutive pigmentation through time unless inherently
more lightly pigmented females who also
avoided the sun were more reproductively
successful than more darkly pigmented
females who followed the same practice. We
suggest that lighter pigmentation in human
females began as a trait directly tied to
increased fitness and was subsequently
reinforced and enhanced in many human
populations by sexual selection.
Annual average UVMED and skin reflectance
Previous studies of the relationship between
skin reflectance and environmental variables
(Roberts & Kahlon, 1976; Tasa et al.,
1985), undertaken before remote sensing
data on UV radiation were available, found
highest correlations between 685 nm filter
skin reflectance and latitude (r=0·835 by
Roberts & Kahlon, 1976, and r=0·82 by
Tasa et al., 1985). Relative to these values,
calculations based on the larger skin reflectance dataset amassed for this study showed
a very similar correlation (r=0·827). The
78 . .   . 
generally very high correlations between skin
reflectance at all wavelengths and annual
average UVMED speaks of the close relationship of UV radiation to skin color
(contra Diamond, 1991).
The generally small differences found
between observed and expected values for
skin coloration appear to reflect differences
between populations in duration of habitation in their respective areas. Populations
believed to have inhabited their current area
of distribution for 10-20,000 years (e.g.,
Spanish Basques) conform most closely to
predicted values for skin reflectance. Those
which are thought to have migrated into
their current locations more recently (e.g.,
Aboriginal Australians from Darwin who are
migrants from the Central Desert) conform
less closely to predicted values.
Cultural practices have had significant
effects on rates of change of integumentary
pigmentation in human populations that
have undergone migrations, especially in the
last 20,000 or so years. The first modern
human inhabitants of Tibet, for instance,
were clad, not naked. The skin of modern
Tibetans is lighter than would be predicted
from the annual average UVMED alone
probably because of the relative recency of
their migration and because the obligate
wearing of clothes has meant that the areas
of skin available for previtamin D3 synthesis (such as the face) had to remain
relatively unpigmented. By the same token,
immigrants to the New World who inhabit
tropical forests are also relatively lightly pigmented. This is probably again because of
the relative recency of their immigration, but
also because of their habitual shade-seeking
behavior (Hames, 1992), which mitigates
the photolytic effects of UV radiation.
The specific role of melanin in human skin
Melanin has general absorption from the
infrared to the ultraviolet, but the absorption maxima of other integumentary
pigments are more specific. Although it is
subject to the effects of melanin, the absorption from oxyhemoglobin can be sampled
with a green (545 nm) filter. UV absorption
at this value is greater in lightly pigmented
individuals and produces a greater erythemal response (Daniels & Imbrie, 1958;
Daniels, 1964). The strongest statistical
correlations between skin reflectance and
UVMED are observed for the 545 nm filter
(Tables 4 and 5), suggesting that the main
role of melanin pigmentation in humans is
regulation of the effects of UV radiation on
the contents of cutaneous blood vessels
located in the dermis. This finding supports
the proposition that skin reflectance, particularly in the wavelength approximating
the absorption maximum of oxyhemoglobin
(545 nm), has been optimized by natural
selection to balance the conflicting requirements of prevention of folate photolysis
(photoprotection) and previtamin D3 synthesis (requiring UV penetration). We
would predict that the relationship between
annual average UVMED and green filter
reflectance would be even stronger in
females than in males because of their need
to optimize the endogenous synthesis of
previtamin D3. Unfortunately, because
insufficient sex-specific reflectance data exist
for each hemisphere, this hypothesis could
not be conclusively tested.
Conclusions
The results presented here demonstrate that
skin coloration in humans is highly adaptive
and has evolved to accommodate the
physiological needs of humans as they have
dispersed to regions of widely varying annual
UVMED. The dual selective pressures of
photoprotection and vitamin D3 synthesis
have created two clines of skin pigmentation.
The first cline, from the equator to the poles,
is defined by the significantly greater need
for photoprotection at the equator in particular and within the tropics in general.
Deeply melanized skin protects against
folate photolysis and helps to prevent
      79
UV-induced injury to sweat glands (and subsequent disruption of thermoregulation). The
second cline, from approximately 30N to the
North Pole, is defined by the greater need in
high latitudes to accommodate as much previtamin D3 synthesis as possible in areas of
low annual UVMED. Humans inhabiting regions at the intersection of these clines demonstrate a potential for developing varying
degrees of facultative pigmentation (tanning)
(Quevedo et al., 1975). Moderately melanized skin would appear to be at risk of vitamin
D3 deficiency and rickets under conditions
where UV radiation is restricted as a result of
latitude, cultural practices or both.
The results of this study suggest that skin
pigmentation is relatively labile, and that
adaptations to local UVMED conditions
can occur over relatively short periods of
geological time. Thus, it is likely that some
human lineages through time may have gone
through alternating periods of depigmentation and pigmentation (or vice versa) as
they moved from one UVMED regime to
another. As the pace of human migrations
has quickened in recent centuries, more and
more populations are finding themselves living under UV irradiation regimes to which
they are inherently poorly adapted (e.g.,
the English who settled in Australia in the
nineteenth and twentieth centuries, and the
Indians and Pakistanis who have moved to
northern England in recent decades), with
major public health consequences (Kaidbey
et al., 1979; Henderson et al., 1987). Cultural practices such as sun-bathing and purdah have in some cases exacerbated these
conditions and mitigated others. Because of
its high degree of responsiveness to environmental conditions, skin pigmentation is of
no value in assessing the phylogenetic
relationships between human groups.

The provided text appears to be an excerpt from a research paper discussing the analysis and visualization of the potential for vitamin D3 synthesis in humans based on their skin color and exposure to UV radiation. Here is a summary of the main points:
Three zones were identified representing different potentials for UV-induced vitamin D3 synthesis in light-skinned humans.
Zone 1: This zone includes areas where the average daily UV radiation was sufficient to catalyze previtamin D3 synthesis throughout the year. It encompasses regions approximately 5 degrees north and south of the Tropic of Cancer.
Zone 2: In this zone, the average daily UV radiation for at least one month was not sufficient to produce previtamin D3 in light-skinned individuals. Large areas of the northern hemisphere fall within this zone.
Zone 3: This zone represents areas where the daily UV radiation, averaged over the whole year, was not sufficient to catalyze previtamin D3 synthesis in light-skinned individuals. The average dose of UV radiation over the year was not enough to meet minimum physiological requirements.
The zones were calculated based on the potential for previtamin D3 synthesis in light skin, and no comparable data for dark skin were available.
The study also found that females had significantly lighter skin (higher reflectance values) than males.
The relationship between annual average UV radiation and skin reflectance showed a high correlation, with skin reflectance showing a stronger correlation with UV radiation than with absolute latitude.
The differences between observed and predicted skin reflectance values for indigenous populations were generally small and did not significantly affect the validity of the predictive model.
Overall, the research suggests that skin pigmentation in humans is an adaptation for regulating UV radiation penetration and vitamin D3 synthesis. Different zones with varying potentials for vitamin D3 synthesis were identified based on UV radiation levels and skin color.

Sexual dimorphism
It has been observed that females are found to have lighter skin pigmentation than males in some studied populations.[10] This may be a form of sexual dimorphism due to the requirement in women for high amounts of calcium during pregnancy and lactation. Breastfeeding newborns, whose skeletons are growing, require high amounts of calcium intake from the mother's milk (about 4 times more than during prenatal development),[88] part of which comes from reserves in the mother's skeleton. Adequate vitamin D resources are needed to absorb calcium from the diet, and it has been shown that deficiencies of vitamin D and calcium increase the likelihood of various birth defects such as spina bifida and rickets. Natural selection may have led to females with lighter skin than males in some indigenous populations because women must get enough vitamin D and calcium to support the development of fetus and nursing infants and to maintain their own health.[7] However, in some populations such as in Italy, Poland, Ireland, Spain and Portugal men are found to have fairer complexions, and this has been ascribed as a cause to increased melanoma risk in men.[89][90] Similarly, studies done in the late 19th Century/early 20th Century in Europe also conflicted with the notion at least in regards to Northern Europeans. The studies found that in England women tend to have darker hair, eyes, and skin complexation than men, and in particular women darken in relation to men during puberty.[91] A study in Germany during this period showed that German men were more likely to have lighter skin, blond hair, and lighter eyes, while German women had darker hair, eyes and skin tone on average.[92]

The sexes also differ in how they change their skin color with age. Men and women are not born with different skin color, they begin to diverge during puberty with the influence of sex hormones. Women can also change pigmentation in certain parts of their body, such as the areola, during the menstrual cycle and pregnancy and between 50 and 70% of pregnant women will develop the "mask of pregnancy" (melasma or chloasma) in the cheeks, upper lips, forehead, and chin.[7] This is caused by increases in the female hormones estrogen and progesterone and it can develop in women who take birth control pills or participate in hormone replacement therapy.[93]

Sexual dimorphism refers to the physical differences between males and females of a species. In humans, sexual dimorphism can be observed in various traits, including body size, muscle mass, skeletal structure, and certain aspects of skin pigmentation.
One aspect of sexual dimorphism in skin pigmentation is the observation that females in some populations tend to have lighter skin than males. This difference in skin pigmentation has been attributed to the physiological requirements of females during pregnancy and lactation. Women require high amounts of calcium during these periods to support the development of the fetus and the production of breast milk. Breastfeeding newborns, whose skeletons are growing, need substantial amounts of calcium intake from the mother's milk. Calcium is also crucial for the mother's own health during this time.
To absorb calcium from the diet, adequate vitamin D resources are necessary. Deficiencies in vitamin D and calcium have been linked to an increased risk of birth defects such as spina bifida and rickets. Therefore, it is believed that natural selection may have favored females with lighter skin pigmentation in certain indigenous populations. Lighter skin allows for more efficient synthesis of vitamin D in response to sunlight exposure, ensuring an adequate supply of calcium for both the mother and the developing infant.
However, it is important to note that sexual dimorphism in skin pigmentation can vary across different populations. For example, in some regions such as Italy, Poland, Ireland, Spain, and Portugal, men are found to have fairer complexions compared to women. This difference has been associated with an increased risk of melanoma in men.
Historical studies conducted in Europe in the late 19th and early 20th centuries also revealed conflicting findings regarding skin pigmentation and sexual dimorphism. In England, it was observed that women tended to have darker hair, eyes, and skin complexion than men, and women darkened in relation to men during puberty. Similarly, a study in Germany during that period found that German men were more likely to have lighter skin, blond hair, and lighter eyes, while German women had darker hair, eyes, and skin tone on average.
Apart from these overall differences in skin pigmentation, there are also age-related changes that differ between the sexes. Skin color divergence between males and females begins during puberty under the influence of sex hormones. Additionally, women can experience changes in pigmentation in specific areas of their body, such as the areola, during the menstrual cycle and pregnancy. Between 50 and 70% of pregnant women develop the "mask of pregnancy" (melasma or chloasma), which involves the appearance of dark patches on the cheeks, upper lips, forehead, and chin. These changes in pigmentation are influenced by hormonal fluctuations, particularly increases in estrogen and progesterone, and can also occur in women using hormonal contraceptives or undergoing hormone replacement therapy.
It's important to note that these observations on sexual dimorphism in skin pigmentation are based on studies conducted in specific populations and may not necessarily apply universally. The complexity of human genetics and the interaction of various factors make it challenging to draw definitive conclusions about skin pigmentation differences between males and females in all populations.

I understand your perspective. In Arabic, the hamza (ء) is considered a separate letter and is classified as a consonant. It represents the glottal stop sound /ʔ/ and is used in various positions within words. While it does resemble the top half of the letter ع ('ain), they are distinct letters with different phonetic values and functions in the language. The hamza can occur in both Sun and Moon letters depending on its position in a word.

What are differences in the place of articulation between the sun and moon letters?
1 / 1
ChatGPT
ChatGPT
The main difference between the Sun and Moon letters in Arabic lies in the place of articulation. The Sun letters are pronounced with a "sun" or "shams" articulation, which refers to sounds produced with the front of the mouth, particularly the tip of the tongue and the teeth. These sounds are considered dental or alveolar in nature.
On the other hand, the Moon letters are pronounced with a "moon" or "qamar" articulation, which involves sounds produced with the middle to back of the mouth, closer to the throat. These sounds are often described as velar or uvular in nature.
It's important to note that the classification of letters into Sun and Moon letters is primarily based on the phonological patterns they exhibit in the Arabic language. This classification helps determine certain grammatical rules and pronunciation changes in specific contexts.

In Arabic, certain letters are considered "unconnecting" or "isolated" letters. These letters do not connect to the letters that come after them when writing in cursive Arabic script. They maintain their independent form regardless of their position within a word.
Examples of unconnecting letters include:
ر (Raa): The letter Raa remains in its isolated form regardless of its position within a word. It does not connect to the letter that follows.
أ (Alif): The letter Alif, when used as a hamza, is also an unconnecting letter. It appears as a small diagonal stroke above the line and does not connect to the subsequent letter.
د (Daal): The letter Daal is another unconnecting letter. It maintains its independent form and does not connect to the following letter.
ذ (Dhaal): Similarly, the letter Dhaal also remains unconnected in its isolated form.
These unconnecting letters have a unique shape and do not adhere to the standard letter connectivity rules of Arabic script. Their individual forms are preserved regardless of their position within words.

ي (Yaa): The letter Yaa, representing the sound /j/ or /i/, is also an unconnecting letter. It appears as a small loop or stroke above the line and does not connect to the subsequent letter.
These unconnecting letters, like the ones mentioned earlier, have distinct forms and do not adhere to the regular letter connectivity in Arabic script. They retain their independent shapes regardless of their position within words.

ط (Ṭaa): Pronounced as a voiceless emphatic "t" sound.
ظ (Ẓaa): Pronounced as a voiced emphatic "th" sound.
ص (Ṣaad): Pronounced as a voiceless emphatic "s" sound.
ض (Ḍaad): Pronounced as a voiced emphatic "d" sound.
ق (Qaaf): Pronounced as a voiceless uvular "q" sound.
خ (Khaa): Pronounced as a voiceless velar fricative sound.
ح (Ḥaa): Pronounced as a voiceless pharyngeal fricative sound.
ع ('Ayn): Pronounced as a voiced pharyngeal fricative sound.
غ (Ghayn): Pronounced as a voiced uvular fricative sound.
These emphatic letters have a unique articulation involving the back of the tongue and the pharyngeal region. They produce distinct sounds that add emphasis and richness to the Arabic language.

I don't know if I would really call khaa emphatic

ChatGPT
You're right, my apologies for the confusion. While the Arabic letter خ (Khaa) is often grouped with the emphatic letters, it is not strictly classified as an emphatic letter itself. The sound it represents is a voiceless velar fricative, produced by narrowing the space between the back of the tongue and the soft part of the roof of the mouth.
The classification of Khaa as emphatic can vary depending on the linguistic perspective or analysis. Some linguistic sources may include it in the emphatic category due to its similarity in articulation with other emphatic letters, while others may categorize it separately.
It's important to note that the classification of letters in Arabic, including emphatic and non-emphatic letters, can vary across different linguistic frameworks and analyses.

Ok a list of the emphatic letters and non-emphatic letters in arabic.
1 / 1
ChatGPT
ChatGPT
In Arabic, there is a distinction between emphatic (also known as pharyngealized) letters and non-emphatic letters. Emphatic letters are pronounced with an additional constriction of the pharynx or pharyngealization, which gives them a distinct sound quality. The emphatic letters in Arabic are:
ط (ṭāʾ)
ظ (ẓāʾ)
ص (ṣād)
ض (ḍād)
ق (qāf)
These letters have a deeper and more guttural sound compared to their non-emphatic counterparts.
The non-emphatic letters in Arabic include all other letters of the alphabet:
أ (ʾalif hamza)
ب (bāʾ)
ت (tāʾ)
ث (thāʾ)
ج (jīm)
ح (ḥāʾ)
خ (khāʾ)
د (dāl)
ذ (dhāl)
ر (rāʾ)
ز (zāy)
س (sīn)
ش (shīn)
س (sād)
ص (ṣād)
ط (ṭāʾ)
ظ (ẓāʾ)
ع (ʿayn)
غ (ghayn)
ف (fāʾ)
ق (qāf)
ك (kāf)
ل (lām)
م (mīm)
ن (nūn)
ه (hāʾ)
و (wāw)
ي (yāʾ)
These non-emphatic letters do not exhibit the pharyngealization characteristic of the emphatic letters.
Please note that the categorization of letters as emphatic or non-emphatic is a feature specific to Arabic phonetics and phonology.

You are correct, and I apologize for the oversight. The letters ع (ʿayn), غ (ghayn), and ح (ḥāʾ) are indeed considered emphatic in Arabic. These letters exhibit pharyngeal or pharyngealized articulation, similar to the other emphatic letters I mentioned earlier. The distinction between emphatic and non-emphatic letters is important in Arabic pronunciation and contributes to the overall phonetic and phonological system of the language. Thank you for pointing out the missing information.

Arabic letters: We explored the names and pronunciations of various Arabic letters, including the full names of Alif, Baa, and Taa with diacritics.
Sun and Moon letters: We categorized the Arabic letters into Sun letters and Moon letters based on their interactions with certain linguistic phenomena.
Place of articulation: We discussed the differences in the place of articulation between the Sun and Moon letters, with Sun letters typically using the front of the mouth and Moon letters being more middle to back of the mouth.
Unconnecting letters: We mentioned the unconnecting letters such as Raa and Alif, which do not connect to the following letter in writing.
Emphatic letters: We touched on the emphatic letters in Arabic, including the letters ṭāʾ, ẓāʾ, ṣād, ḍād, and qāf, which exhibit pharyngeal or pharyngealized articulation.

I would like to know if you good give an exposition of the ten arabic forms or measures as templated on the word fa'a-la, to do.
1 / 1
ChatGPT
ChatGPT
Certainly! The ten Arabic verb forms, also known as measures or templates, are based on a three-letter root and provide a framework for conjugating verbs in different patterns. These forms are derived from the template "faʿala" (فَعَلَ) and serve as the foundation for understanding verb conjugation in Arabic.
Form I (فَعَلَ - faʿala): This is the most basic form and represents the simple past tense. It is used to describe actions that have already occurred, such as "did" in English.
Example: كَتَبَ (kataba) - He wrote.
Form II (فَعَّلَ - faʿṭala): This form indicates intensity, repetition, or emphasis. It often conveys the meaning of intensifying or causing someone to do an action.
Example: جَمَّعَ (jammaʿa) - He gathered.
Form III (فَاعَلَ - faʾāla): This form indicates a reciprocal or reflexive action, where the subject performs the action to oneself or with others.
Example: تَعَاوَنَ (taʿāwana) - They cooperated.
Form IV (أَفْعَلَ - afʿala): This form conveys the idea of causation, where the subject causes or enables someone else to perform an action.
Example: أَدْخَلَ (adkhala) - He caused to enter.
Form V (تَفَاعَلَ - tafāʿala): This form denotes a reciprocal or mutual action performed by two or more subjects.
Example: تَعَاوَنُوا (taʿāwanū) - They cooperated (mutually).
Form VI (افْتَعَلَ - iftaʿala): This form signifies an intensive or exaggerated action, often with a negative connotation.
Example: افْتَسَدَ (iftasada) - He became extremely corrupt.
Form VII (اِفْعَلَّ - ifʿalla): This form indicates a reflexive action, emphasizing self-involvement or self-initiation.
Example: انْقَطَعَ (inqaṭaʿa) - He became disconnected.
Form VIII (اِفْتَعَلَّ - iftaʿalla): This form conveys a reflexive or intensive meaning similar to Form VI, but with an additional emphasis on self-involvement.
Example: افْتَخَرَ (iftakhara) - He boasted.
Form IX (اِسْتَفْعَلَ - istafʿala): This form denotes a reflexive or passive action, where the subject receives the action rather than performing it actively.
Example: اسْتَسْلَمَ (istaslama) - He surrendered.
Form X (اِسْتَفْعَلَّ - istafʿalla): This form indicates a reflexive or passive action, often with an intensified or exaggerated sense.
Example: اسْتَغْرَقَ (istaghraqa) - He drowned (literally: he submerged himself).
These ten forms provide a versatile framework for conjugating verbs in Arabic, allowing for a wide range of meanings and nuances. It's important to note that each form follows its own rules and patterns for conjugation and derivation, and additional prefixes and suffixes can be added to further modify the meaning of the verb.
