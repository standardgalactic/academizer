Jürgen Schmidhuber has proposed several metrics for measuring surprise, curiosity, and interestingness. Here are some of them:

Kolmogorov complexity: Schmidhuber has suggested that a measure of surprise can be derived from the Kolmogorov complexity of a piece of data, which is the length of the shortest computer program (in some fixed programming language) that outputs that data. The idea is that data with high Kolmogorov complexity is more surprising, because it cannot be easily compressed or predicted.

's theory of measuring surprise, curiosity, and interestingness through
Kolmogorov
complexity is a fascinating concept. The idea that data with high Kolmogorov complexity is more surprising because it cannot be easily compressed or predicted is a unique way of measuring these subjective qualities. Schmidhuber's work in the field of artificial intelligence, specifically artificial neural networks, has been groundbreaking and continues to push the boundaries of what is possible in the field.

how does the principle of compression progress explain interestingness
Perplexity
According to
Jürgen Schmidhuber
's principle of compression progress, data becomes temporarily interesting to a subjective observer once they learn to predict or compress the data in a better way, making it subjectively simpler and more compressible

. In other words, the principle of compression progress explains interestingness by suggesting that data that can be compressed or predicted in a better way is more interesting because it is simpler and more regular
4
. This principle is a simple way to explain essential aspects of subjective beauty, novelty, surprise, interestingness, attention, curiosity, creativity, art, science, music, and jokes

Compression progress: Schmidhuber has also proposed that curiosity can be measured by the progress made in compressing data. That is, an agent could seek out data that is initially hard to compress, but becomes easier to compress as the agent learns more about it. The idea is that this data is inherently interesting because it reveals patterns that were previously unknown.

Novelty: Schmidhuber has suggested that novelty (i.e., encountering something that has not been seen before) is a key component of interestingness. He proposes a measure of novelty that is based on the frequency of an event in a sequence of past events. If an event is rare in the past, it is more novel and therefore more interesting.

. This principle can be applied to curiosity by suggesting that curiosity is the desire to create or discover more non-random, non-arbitrary, regular data that is novel and surprising, not in the traditional sense of
Boltzmann

Shannon

Empowerment: Schmidhuber has proposed that an agent's degree of control over its environment (i.e., its "empowerment") can be a measure of interestingness. The idea is that an agent will seek out actions that increase its degree of control, which can lead to novel and interesting experiences.

Active learning progress: Schmidhuber has also proposed that curiosity can be measured

by the progress Schmidhuber has also proposed that curiosity can be measured by the progress made in actively learning about the world. That is, an agent could seek out information that reduces uncertainty about the world, but also seeks out new information that is currently unknown to the agent. The idea is that this new information is inherently interesting because it expands the agent's knowledge about the world.
