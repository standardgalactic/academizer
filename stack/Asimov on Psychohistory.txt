"Psychohistory dealt not with man, but with man-masses. It was the science of mobs; mobs in their billions. It could forecast reactions to stimuli with something of the accuracy that a lesser science could bring to the forecast of a rebound of a billiard ball." - Isaac Asimov, Foundation.

"Great occasions do not make heroes or cowards; they simply unveil them to the eyes. Silently and imperceptibly, as we wake or sleep, we grow strong or we grow weak, and at last some crisis shows what we have become." - Brooke Foss Westcott, a British bishop, theologian and biblical scholar.

I apologize for the confusion. Here's a quote from Isaac Asimov's Foundation's Edge that is similar to the one you mentioned earlier:
"Humanity's long childhood has been a developmental stage in which life was compared to lifelessness and consciousness to unconsciousness. The forces of nature were struggling to evolve a thinking animal, and the process was slow and uncertain. Now that the thinking animal is fully formed, it's time to stop looking back, stop looking down, and start looking up and ahead. But the future is not given to us. It is created by us. It is something we must build, with every thought and every action, in every moment of every day."
