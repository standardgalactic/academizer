Since Darwin, scientists have struggled to reconcile the evolution of seemingly endless biological 
forms with a universe determined by fixed laws. The laws of physics underpin the origin of life, 
evolution, human culture and technology as set by the boundary conditions of the universe; 
however, they cannot predict the emergence of these things. By contrast evolutionary theory 
works in the opposite direction, indicating how selection can explain why some things exist and 
not others. To understand how open-ended forms can emerge in a forward-process from 
physics that does not include their design, a new approach to understanding and quantifying 
selection is necessary that applies across both physics and biology. Herein, we present a new 
theory, Assembly Theory (AT), which accomplishes this not by redefining the laws of physics, 
but instead by redefining the concept of an object that these laws operate on- in AT, objects 
are not considered as point particles, but instead are defined by the set of possible histories of 
their formation as an intrinsic property. Defined in this way, we show how objects themselves 
can provide measurable evidence of selection, whether within the well-defined boundary of an 
individual or selected unit, or not. We formalize by introducing a quantity called Assembly that 
captures how much causation was necessary to produce a given ensemble of objects. We 
demonstrate this theoretically and show how AT allows novelty generation and selection to 
enter naturally into the physics of complex objects by demonstrating how these can be described 
in a forward dynamical process accounting for the Assembly of objects. By redefining the 
concept of matter in terms of assembly spaces, AT provides a framework to unify descriptions 
of physics and biology in a new physics that emerges at the scale of chemistry where it is that 
history and causal contingency via selection starts to play a prominent role in what exists.

Introduction 
In evolutionary theory, selection1 describes why some things exist and not others, but does so 
retroactively - by looking at what individuals survived.2 This is not useful for explaining or predicting 
the emergence of novelty across chemistry, biology, and technology. Theories of physics do describe 
forward dynamics but achieve this by specifying an initial state3 and evolving that state with a fixed 
set of laws. This means that novelty, i.e., things that are generated which are not predictable from the 
initial conditions, is not possible or must be introduced by randomness.4 The open-ended generation 
of novelty5 does not fit cleanly within either the paradigmatic frameworks of biology6 or physics as 
laid out by Darwin7 and Newton.3

The article presents a new theory called Assembly Theory (AT) that explains the emergence of selection and evolution in a forward process from physics to biology. AT does not redefine the laws of physics but rather the concept of objects that these laws operate on, by defining objects as the set of possible histories of their formation. The theory provides a framework to unify descriptions of physics and biology in a new physics that emerges at the scale of chemistry, where history and causal contingency via selection start to play a prominent role in what exists. AT allows for the natural generation of novelty and selection in the physics of complex objects by accounting for the Assembly of objects.

There have been several efforts exploring the gap between physics and evolution,8,9 such as dynamics 
where the laws are allowed to co-evolve with the states and considering the number of states to grow 
as a function of time. When the update rules are a function of the states, this results in systems that 
allow exploration of a larger space of possibilities,10 but it does not solve the problem of where 
genuine novelty comes - the larger space still has a fixed size. Other efforts have removed the idea 
of a state entirely and studied the evolution of rules acting on other rules,11 however, these models 
are so abstract it is difficult to see how they can describe - and predict - the evolution of physical 
objects. Yet another approach assumes a growing state space as a foundation and explores 
combinatorial spaces and their expansion, such as in the theory of the adjacent possible and related 
theories in statistical mechanics.12 These approaches generates explosive growth in the number of 
possible configurations that cannot be sustained in a finite universe in finite time - these models 
generates novelty but do not include selection. Therefore, the approach lacks predictive power with 
respect to why only some evolutionary innovations happen and not others. 
Herein, we introduce assembly theory (AT), which resolves these challenges by describing how 
novelty generation and selection can both operate in forward-evolving processes. The framework of 
AT allows us to not only predict features of novel forms in during selection, but also to quantify how 
much selection was necessary to produce the objects we have observed.13,14 This can be done without 
having to pre-specify individuals or units of selection as selection is defined in terms of observed 
objects, their number of copies and how they can be built. In AT we do not need to get rid of the laws 
as formulated, or add ad hoc explosive expansion of states, instead, we re-invent the concept of an 
object that laws operate on. In AT, objects are not considered as point particles (as in most of physics) 
but instead are defined by the histories of their formation as an intrinsic property. We define this in 
terms of the assembly space. For a given object, the assembly space is defined as the pathways by 
which that object can be built from elementary building blocks, where we use only recursive 
3 
operations combining what has already been built in the past. The assembly space captures minimal 
memory, in terms of the minimal number of physical operations necessary to assemble an observed 
object based on objects that could have existed in its past.15 
We introduce the foundations of Assembly Theory (AT) and show how it can be implemented to 
quantify the degree of selection and evolution found in an ensemble of observed objects. We 
introduce a quantity, Assembly, built from two empirical observables: (1) the number of copies of 
the observed objects and (2) the objects' assembly indices, where assembly index is the minimal 
number of steps necessary to produce the object (its size). Assembly therefore quantifies the amount 
of memory necessary to produce a selected configuration of observed objects (with copy number and 
assembly index as coordinates) in a manner similar to how entropy quantifies the information 
necessary (or lack thereof) to specify the configuration (in terms of spatial positions and velocities as 
coordinates) of an ensemble of point particles. We demonstrate how AT leads to a unified language 
for describing selection and the generation of novelty. We thus show how AT provides a framework 
to unify descriptions of selection across physics and biology, with the potential to build a new physics 
that emerges at the scale of chemistry where history and causal contingency via selection start to play 
a prominent role in our interpretation of physical matter.

Assembly Theory 
To quantify the emergence of selection and evolution we define what an object is in AT, and the key 
observable properties of objects so defined- (1) assembly index and (2) copy number. The concept 
of an object in Assembly Theory is simple and rigorously defined: an object is finite, distinguishable, 
persists over time, and the object is breakable such that the set of constraints to construct it from 
elementary building blocks are measurable. It should be noted that this definition of objects is in some 
sense opposite of standard physics, which treats objects as fundamental and unbreakable (e.g., the 
concept of 'atoms' as indivisible, which now applies to elementary particles). In assembly theory we 
recognize that the smallest unit of matter is typically defined by the limits of observational 
measurements and may not itself be fundamental, and that a more universal concept is to treat objects 
as anything that can be built. This allows us to naturally account for the emergent objects produced 
by evolution and selection as fundamental to the theory. 
In principle, an object that exists in a large number of copies, allows the signatures describing the set 
of constraints that built it (the physical rules or laws governing its assembly) to be measured 
experimentally. For example, mass spectrometry can be used to measure the assembly for molecules, 
because it can measure the ways molecules are built by making bonds.16 The concept of copy number 
4 
is of fundamental importance in defining a theory that accounts for selection. This is because the more 
complex a given object is, the less likely it is that an identical copy of that object can exist without 
some precise mechanism that has been selected that generates that object. The consequences of this 
point will be explained in detail but simply put, complex objects that exist in high numbers indicate 
the presence of a physical system, itself the product of evolution and selection (e.g., a biological cell, 
technological factory, a human mind etc.), with a memory to build these objects.

In Assembly Theory, the assembly index of an object is defined as the minimal number of steps necessary to build the object using only recursive operations that combine what has already been built in the past. This index captures the minimal amount of memory required to build the object based on objects that could have existed in its past. The copy number of an object is simply the number of copies of that object that exist. Together, these two properties allow us to quantify the amount of memory necessary to produce a selected configuration of observed objects.
The importance of copy number in defining a theory that accounts for selection is that complex objects that exist in high numbers indicate the presence of a physical system with a memory to build these objects. The more complex an object is, the less likely it is that an identical copy of that object can exist without some precise mechanism that has been selected for that generates that object. This means that high copy numbers of complex objects suggest the presence of selection and evolution in the system.
In summary, Assembly Theory defines objects as anything that can be built from elementary building blocks and persist over time. The observable properties of objects, namely their assembly index and copy number, allow us to quantify the amount of memory necessary to produce selected configurations of objects and suggest the presence of selection and evolution in the system.

However, these measures are features of the graphical representation of a molecule - and, more 
specifically the program used to compute the graph - and reflect nothing of the physics of how 
molecules are assembled in the real universe. Complexity measures derived from computer science17- 
6 
19 have no knowledge of chemistry, nor should we expect them to as they were not designed with that 
purpose in mind. As a simple example of where this could go wrong, one could build an "assembly 
space" with operations based on pasting atoms together (molecular alchemy!), instead of making 
bonds, and that would have a different graphical representation and minimal path, representing a 
different algorithm in computer science. And indeed, this could have a shorter minimal path than that 
found in the assembly space. However, this would not have a physical interpretation, because physical 
systems do not build molecules by combining atoms with no bonds - molecules are made by making 
bonds. Assembly theory is not an attempt to reinvent well-trodden concepts from computer science, 
but instead we aim to develop a new understanding of complex matter that naturally accounts for their 
selection and history in terms of what physical operations are permitted by the laws of physics.20,21 
We will discuss assembly theory as applied to molecules as the major application in this paper because 
their assembly index has been experimentally measured. In this case, assembly index has a clear 
physical interpretation and has been validated as quantifying evidence of selection in its application 
to the detection of molecular signatures of life. However, we expect the theory to be sufficiently 
general to apply to a wide variety of other systems including polymers, graphs, images, computer 
programs, and human languages as well as many others. The challenge in each case will be to 
construct an assembly space that has a clear physical meaning in terms of what operations can be 
caused to occur to make the object20, see Fig. 1. 
We also note that because assembly pathways are recursive, the process of constructing new objects 
retains the memory of the past formation of objects. This is important because the structure of 
assembly pathways implicitly implies two features of the environment the object is found in: (1) there 
are objects in its environment that can constrain the steps in the pathway and (2) these objects 
themselves have been selected because they must be retained over subsequent steps to physically 
instantiate the memory needed to build the target object. Among the most relatable examples of this 
are enzyme catalysts in biochemistry, which permit the formation of very unlikely molecules in large 
numbers, because the enzymes themselves are also selected to exist with a large number of copies. 
We make no distinction between the traditional notion of biological "individual" and objects that are 
selected in the environment to quantify the selection necessary to produce a given configuration. 
Thus, our approach naturally accounts for well-known phenomenon such as niche construction where 
organisms and environment are co-constructed and co-selected.

The Assembly Equation 
For a given ensemble of observed objects, we define Assembly as the empirical quantification of the 
total amount of selection that was necessary to produce that ensemble. We introduce the assembly 
equation (1): ������������ = ������������� 
������������ ������������ ������������� 
������������ − 1 
������������ ������������ 
� 
������������ 
������������ =1 
(1) 
where ai is the assembly index of object ������������, ������������ ������������ is its copy number and ������������������������ as the total number of objects 
in the ensemble. We normalize by the number of objects in the ensemble such that Assembly between 
ensembles with different number of objects can be compared for quantifying processes such as 
selection. This is quantified within the summation by the distribution of the objects over the range of 
assembly indices. We note that empirical measurements of Assembly will constrain whether the 
associated constants in the Assembly Equation account for natural combinatorial explosion with no 
selection.

The Assembly Equation is a mathematical formula that quantifies the amount of selection required to produce a given ensemble of objects. The equation is represented as:
Assembly = ∑ (ai / Ni - 1) / N
where Assembly is the empirical quantification of the total amount of selection required to produce the ensemble of objects, ai is the assembly index of object i, Ni is its copy number, and N is the total number of objects in the ensemble. The summation is taken over all objects in the ensemble.
The equation is normalized by dividing by the number of objects in the ensemble, which allows for comparisons of Assembly between ensembles with different numbers of objects. The distribution of objects over the range of assembly indices is taken into account in the summation.
The constants in the Assembly Equation are expected to account for natural combinatorial explosion with no selection. Empirical measurements of Assembly will determine whether this is the case.

The assembly equation quantifies two competing effects (1) the complexity of discovering new 
objects and how (2) once discovered some objects become 'easier' to make because the memory has 
been selected for their formation. The exponential growth of Assembly with depth in the assembly 
space (quantified by assembly index) is derived by considering a linearly expanding assembly pool 
which has objects that combine at step ������������ ������������ → ������������ ������������ + 1, where an object at the assembly index ������������ ������������ 
combines with another object from the assembly pool. Discovering new objects at increasing depth 
in an assembly space gets harder because the space of possibilities expands exponentially. Once 
discovered, the production of an object (copy number > 1) gets easier as the copy number increases 
because a high copy number implies that an object can be produced readily in a given context. Thus, 
the hardest innovation is making an object for the first time which is equivalent to the discovery, 
followed by making the first copy of that object, but once an object exists in very high abundance it 
must already be relatively easy to make, hence Assembly scales linearly with copy number for more 
than one object. 9 
A consequence of the assembly equation is that increasing Assembly (������������) results from increasing copy 
numbers n and increasing assembly indices a. If high assembly can be shown to capture cases where 
selection has occurred, it implies finding high assembly index objects in high abundance is a signature 
of selection. Along an assembly path, the information required at an assembly step to construct the 
object is "stored" within the object, see Fig. 2. When two objects are combined from an assembly 
pool the specificity of the combination process constitutes selection along an assembly path. As we 
will show, randomly combining objects within the assembly pool at every step does not constitute 
selection because no combinations exist in memory to be used again for building the same object 
again. If instead, certain combinations are preferentially used, it implies there must exist a mechanism 
that selects the specific operations and by extension specific target objects to be generated. We 
quantify the degree of selectivity as ������������ , which allows us to parameterize selection in an empirically 
observable manner (by parameterizing how much selection (reuses of specific sets of operations) 
went into generating a given ensemble). We demonstrate that the higher Assembly arises with the 
increase in selectivity. As an example, consider a simple forward process starting with fundamental 
particles, at each step a fraction of objects (�������������) transforms into a higher assembly object ������������ ������������ → ������������ ������������ +1 
such that at assembly step t, the copy numbers ������������ ������������(������������ ) of objects with assembly index ������������������������ is given by 
(1 − ������������������������� )������������ ������������(������������ ) + ������������������������� −1������������������������ −1(������������ ) in the presence and the absence of the constraints. The estimated 
assembly (������������) up to 50 assembly steps in shown in Fig. 3C and 3D. 
We note that Assembly as given in Eq. (1) is determined for identified unique objects (with copy 
number > 1) and their assembly paths (we define the assembly path as the precise path of interactions 
that leads to the object). However, in real samples, there are almost always multiple coexisting, 
distinguishable objects, which in many cases include a common history for their formation. 
Transistors, for example, are used across multiple different technologies suggesting a common 
assembly subspace that includes transistor-like objects for many modern technologies. This common 
assembly space, constituting the overlap in the assembly path structure of two distinct structures is 
called a joint assembly space. For the generalization of the assembly equation that accounts for the 
joint assembly of objects, we introduce a version of the assembly equation that includes the 
quantification of shared pathways of the objects to determine the Assembly (������������) of an ensemble (see 
SI Section 3).

The assembly equation is a mathematical formula that quantifies the amount of selection necessary to produce a given ensemble of observed objects. It considers two competing effects: the complexity of discovering new objects and the ease of producing existing objects with a high copy number. Assembly scales exponentially with depth in the assembly space and linearly with copy number for more than one object. The equation implies that finding high assembly index objects in high abundance is a signature of selection. The degree of selectivity is parameterized as a parameter called S, which quantifies the degree to which specific sets of operations were reused in generating a given ensemble. The assembly equation is determined for identified unique objects and their assembly paths, but in real samples, there are often multiple coexisting, distinguishable objects that share a common history of formation. This common assembly space is called the joint assembly space, and a version of the assembly equation that includes the quantification of shared pathways is introduced to determine the assembly of an ensemble.

pool, where at step ������������ ������������ → ������������ ������������ + 1, ������������ ������������ objects are available for the next assembly step. (B) Linearly

index and when ������������������������� scales with assembly index ������������ as �������������������������= �������������0������������ 
������������ , where �������������0 is fraction at the first step 
and ������������ ≤ 1 represents the increase in constraints with assembly steps. With the increase in ������������ 
conversion fraction, objects at higher assembly emerge with higher copy numbers which for an 
isolated chain represents the efficiency of the forward process to construct complex objects. 
SELECTION WITHIN ASSEMBLY SPACES 
The concept of the Assembly space allows the understanding of how selection and historical 
contingency imposes constraints on what can be made in the future. A key feature of assembly spaces 
is they are combinatorial because items are combined at every step. More objects exist in assembly 
space than can be built in finite time with finite resources because the space of possibilities grows 
super exponentially with the assembly index. Such combinatorial spaces do not play a prominent role 
in current physics, because current physics often considers objects as point particles and not as 
combinatorial objects (with limited exceptions). However, combinatorial objects are important in 
chemistry, and likewise for biology and technology, where most objects of interest (if not all) are 
hierarchical modular structures. While other work has explored the explosive (super-exponential) 
growth of combinatorial spaces to model the growth of novelty, these have so far not taken historical 
contingency into account. In assembly space, historical contingency is intrinsic, because the space is 
11 
built compositionally, where items are combined recursively (accounting for hierarchical 
modularity). It is the combination of the compositionality with combinatorics that allows us to 
describe the selection, see Fig. 4. 
To produce an assembly space, an observed object is broken down recursively to generate a set of 
elementary building units. These units can be used to then recursively construct the assembly 
pathways of the original object(s) to build what we call Assembly Observed, ������������ ������������ . ������������ ������������ captures all 
histories for the construction of the observed object(s) from elementary building blocks, consistent 
with what physical operations are possible. Because objects in assembly theory are compositional, 
they contain information about the larger space of possible objects from which they were selected. 
To see how, we first build an assembly space from the same building blocks in ������������ ������������ , which includes 
not just the pathways specific to assembling our original observed objects, but all possible pathways 
for assembling any object composed of the same elementary building blocks. The space so 
constructed is what we call the Assembly Universe (������������ ������������

The concept of Assembly Space and Assembly Universe is related to the idea of combinatorial objects in chemistry, biology, and technology. Assembly spaces are combinatorial because items are combined at every step, and the number of possible combinations increases exponentially with each assembly step.

higher-assembly objects before exhausting all lower-assembly objects, leading to a vast separation in 
scales between the number of objects that could be explored versus those that are actually constructed 
following a particular path. This early symmetry breaking along historically contingent paths is a 
fundamental property of all assembly processes. It also introduces an "assembly time" that ticks at 
each object being made: assembly physics includes an explicit arrow of time intrinsic to the structure 
of assembly spaces. 
ASSEMBLY UNIFIES THE EMERGENCE OF SELECTION WITH PHYSICS 
In the real universe, objects can only be built from parts that already exist. The discovery of new 
objects is therefore historically contingent. The rate of discovery of new objects can be defined by 
the expansion rate (������������ ������������ ) introduced in the last section, which describes the rate of formation of unique 
objects in the assembly space from previously existing objects. This introduces a characteristic 
timescale ������������ ������������ , we define as the discovery time scale. Additionally, once an object is discovered it can 
be reproduced if there exists a mechanism in the environment selected to build it again. Selected 
objects, therefore, increase in copy number, and the copy numbers for these objects must obey mass 
transfer kinetics. Thus far, we have considered discovery dynamics within the assembly spaces which 
do not account for the abundance or copy number of the observed objects once they are discovered. 
To include copy number in the dynamics of assembly spaces we must introduce a second timescale, 
the rate of production (������������ ������������ ) of a specific object with a characteristic time scale ������������ ������������ (production time 
scale), see Fig. 6. For simplicity, we assume the selectivity and interaction among the emerging 
objects in assembly space is similar across objects. Defining the two separate timescales for (1) initial 
discovery of an object (������������ ������������ ), and (2) making copies of existing objects (������������ ������������ ) allows us to determine the 
regimes where selection is possible, see Fig 6. 
For 
������������ ������������ 
������������ ������������ ≫ 1, where objects are discovered quickly but reproduced slowly, the expansion of assembly 
space is too fast under mass constraints to accumulate a high abundance of any given objects, and 
this leads to a combinatorial explosion of unique objects with low copy numbers. This, for example, 
is consistent with how some unconstrained prebiotic synthesis reactions, such as the formose reaction 
end up producing tar, which is composed of a large number of unidentifiable molecules because they 
have low copy number.23 Selection and evolution cannot emerge if new objects are generated on 
timescales so fast that resources are not available for making more copies of objects that already exist. 
16 
For 
������������ ������������ 
������������ ������������ ≪ 1, objects are reproduced quickly but new ones are discovered slowly. Here resources are 
primarily consumed in producing additional copies of objects that already exist. New objects are 
discovered infrequently. This leads to a high abundance of objects with low assembly. Significant 
separation of the two timescales of discovery of new objects and (re)production of selected objects, 
results in either a combinatorial explosion of objects with low copy numbers, or conversely, high 
copy numbers of low assembly objects. In both cases, we will not observe trajectories that grow more 
complex structures.

The assembly process unifies the emergence of selection with physics by introducing two timescales: the discovery time scale and the production time scale. The discovery time scale is the time it takes to discover a new object in the assembly space, while the production time scale is the time it takes to produce copies of an existing object once it has been discovered. The ratio of these two timescales determines whether selection and evolution can emerge.
If the discovery time scale is much shorter than the production time scale, new objects are generated too quickly, and resources are not available for making more copies of objects that already exist. This leads to a combinatorial explosion of unique objects with low copy numbers, which hinders the emergence of selection and evolution.
On the other hand, if the production time scale is much shorter than the discovery time scale, resources are primarily consumed in producing additional copies of objects that already exist, and new objects are discovered infrequently. This results in a high abundance of objects with low assembly and does not allow for the growth of more complex structures.
Therefore, a balance between the discovery time scale and the production time scale is necessary for the emergence of selection and evolution in assembly processes.

Therefore, the emergence of selection and open-ended evolution in a physical system would be 
indicated by a transition from ������������ ������������ < ������������ ������������ (undirected exploration to create unique objects) to ������������ ������������ < ������������ ������������ 
(selective dynamics to sustain copy number), see Fig. 6, where there cannot be a large separation in 
the timescales between discovering new objects and reproducing ones that are selected. 
Our goal in studying mass action kinetics using assembly theory to describe objects is twofold: (1) 
we aim to show how the generation of novelty can be described alongside selection in a forward- 
process (thus unifying key features of life with physics) and (2) we aim to show that in the regime 
where selection is operative, measuring the Assembly (defined in Eq. 1) identifies how much 
selection occurred. We can accomplish both by studying phenomenological models, with the 
understanding we are putting selection in by hand here to demonstrate the principles of how the 
Assembly equation quantifies selection so that it can be applied with confidence to cases where we 
may not know whether or not selection was operative. 
Consider a forward assembly process where the copy number of the emerging species follows 
homogeneous kinetics, together with the discovery dynamics as given by equation 3. With the 
discovery of new unique objects over time, symmetry breaking in the construction of assembly paths 
will create a network of growing branches within the assembly space. Consider a simple forward 
assembly process where the concentration of copy number of a single branch is represented by 
������������ 1(������������ ) → ������������2,������������(������������ ) → ������������3,������������ (������������ ) → ⋯������������ ������������ ,������������ (������������ ) → ������������ ������������ +1,������������ (������������ )... where, ������������ ������������ ,������������ (������������ ) is the copy number of the 
unique objects at assembly ������������ with index ������������ (likewise defined for assembly ������������ + 1 with index ������������ ). We 
assume the production rate constants for producing objects (independent of ������������ and ������������ ) decrease with 
increasing assembly index by a factor ������������ at each step, with ������������ ������������ the initial rate constant at the first step, 
hence ������������ ������������ (������������ ) = ������������ ������������ ������������ 
������������ . This is a phenomenological choice, motivated by the observation that with 
increasing assembly index, the pathways for the formation of the object have more steps and must be 
more specific: both of these effects lead to a decrease in the production rate relative to less assembled 
objects. As a further simplification, we assume all objects at the assembly index ������������ have the same 
copy number, such that the total number of objects at the assembly ������������ at a given time ������������ is given by 
������������ ������������ (������������ )������������ ������������ (������������ ). It is important to note that this model is a simple continuum description of the physical 
phenomena of discovery and mass transfer kinetics and because it is continuous it can lead to 
unphysical copy number values of less than one (see SI Section 8 for the complete mathematical 
description of the model).

This passage describes a phenomenological model for studying the emergence of selection and open-ended evolution in a physical system. The model assumes a forward assembly process where the copy number of emerging species follows homogeneous kinetics, and the discovery of new unique objects over time leads to symmetry breaking in the construction of assembly paths, creating a network of growing branches within the assembly space. The production rate constants for producing objects are assumed to decrease with increasing assembly index, and all objects at a given assembly index have the same copy number. This model provides a simple continuum description of the physical phenomena of discovery and mass transfer kinetics and can be used to quantify selection by measuring the Assembly, defined in Eq. 1. The authors aim to show how the generation of novelty can be described alongside selection in a forward process, unifying key features of life with physics.

higher assembly values as high copy numbers are produced. On the opposite extreme, for the very 
selected and over-constrained processes (������������ ≈ 0) few unique products are produced with a very high 
copy number, and the Assembly is low because of the low diversity of objects and low assembly 
indices. 
The interplay between the two characteristic time scales describes discovery dynamics (������������ ������������ ~1/������������ ������������ ) 
and forward kinetics (������������ ������������ ~1/������������ ������������ ) together with selection (characterized by the selectivity parameter 
������������ ) are essential for driving processes towards creating higher assembly objects. This is characteristic 
of trajectories within Assembly Contingent. Assembly captures key features of how the open-ended 
growth of complexity can only occur within this restricted space by generating new objects with 
increasing assembly, while also producing them with a high copy number. Restricted selectivity (������������ < 
1) together with comparable time scales (������������ ������������ ≈ ������������ ������������ ) are essential characteristics necessary to produce 
high Assembly ensembles. This is quantified by the Assembly equation which quantifies the degree 
of selectivity that must exist for an observed ensemble, and both the assembly index and copy number 
can be both computed and experimentally measured. The selectivity within an unknown physical 
process can be elucidated by experimentally detecting the number of species, their assembly index, 
and copy number as a function of time. Assuming that the species observed using analytical 
techniques such as mass spectrometry have a high copy number, the discovery rate and the selectivity 
coefficient (������������ ) can be computed using the rate of formation of new species and current existing 
species at all observed assembly indices. 
Conclusions 
We have introduced the foundations of assembly theory and how it can be implemented to quantify 
the degree of selection and evolution found in an ensemble of objects, agnostic to the detailed 
20 
formation mechanisms of the objects or knowing a priori which objects are products of selection (e.g., 
are units of selections or individuals in biology). To do so, we introduce a quantity, Assembly, built 
from two empirical observables of assembly spaces: (1) the number of copies of an object and (2) its 
assembly index, where the assembly index is the minimal number of recursive steps necessary to 
build the object (its size). We demonstrate how AT allows a unified language for describing selection 
and the generation of novelty by showing how it quantifies the generation of novelty and selection at 
the same time in a forward process describing the mass-action kinetics of an ensemble of assembled 
objects. We thus show how AT provides a framework to unify descriptions of selection across physics 
and biology, with the potential to build a new physics that emerges in chemistry where history and 
causal contingency via selection must start to play a prominent role in our descriptions of matter. For 
molecules, computing the assembly index is not explicitly necessary, because the assembly index can 
be probed directly experimentally with high accuracy with spectroscopy techniques including mass 
spectroscopy, IR, and NMR spectroscopy24.

Another description of assembly theory, taking into account the references and the article.
1 / 1
ChatGPT
ChatGPT
Assembly theory is a framework for understanding complex systems and how they arise from the assembly of simpler parts. It is inspired by the idea that complex systems can be understood as emergent properties of the interactions among their components, rather than as the result of top-down design or control. The theory is based on the notion of an assembly space, which represents all the possible ways in which a set of components can be combined to form a system. The assembly space provides a way to analyze the properties of a system and to compare different systems in terms of their complexity and information content.
Assembly theory has been applied to a wide range of systems, from physical systems such as self-organized patterns and chemical reactions, to biological systems such as protein folding and the origin of life, to social and cultural systems such as language and music. In each case, the theory provides a way to understand the emergence of complex properties from simpler components and interactions.
One key aspect of assembly theory is its focus on information content and complexity. The theory uses concepts from information theory and computational complexity to analyze the properties of systems and to compare them in terms of their information content and computational complexity. This provides a way to measure the complexity of a system and to understand the trade-offs between complexity, information content, and other properties such as stability and adaptability.
Assembly theory has also been applied to the search for extraterrestrial life and the identification of biosignatures, or signs of life, in the universe. The theory provides a way to analyze the complexity and information content of molecules and to identify those that are likely to be produced by living systems. This has implications for the search for life on other planets and for understanding the origins of life on Earth.
Overall, assembly theory provides a powerful framework for understanding complex systems and their emergence from simpler components and interactions. It has applications in a wide range of fields and is likely to continue to be an important area of research in the coming years.

ChatGPT
Assembly theory provides a new perspective on the origin of life and the emergence of complex systems. The theory proposes that complex systems are composed of simpler components that are assembled in a specific way, giving rise to emergent properties. The theory is based on the idea that the universe is composed of fundamental building blocks, such as particles and molecules, that can be assembled in different ways to form complex structures.
The article discusses how assembly theory can be used to explain and quantify the emergence of selection and evolution in complex systems. The theory proposes that the emergence of selection and evolution is a consequence of the complex interactions between the components of a system.
The article also discusses how assembly theory can be used to study the origin of life and the search for extraterrestrial life. The theory suggests that life may have originated through the assembly of simple organic molecules, and that the search for extraterrestrial life can be approached by looking for signs of complex systems that have emerged through assembly.
The authors of the article propose a number of applications for assembly theory, including the design of new materials, the development of new drugs, and the detection of extraterrestrial life. They also suggest that assembly theory could have implications for a wide range of fields, from physics and chemistry to biology and computer science.

SummariZe: The theory was invented[3] by Leroy Cronin and developed by the team he leads at the University of Glasgow,[4][5] then extended in collaboration with a team at Arizona State University led by Sara Imari Walker.[6][7] It is difficult to identify chemical signatures that are unique to life.[5][8] For example, the Viking lander biological experiments detected molecules that could be explained by either living or natural non-living processes.[5][9][non-primary source needed]

Assembly theory outputs how complex a given object is as a function of the number of independent parts and their abundances. To calculate how complex an item is, it is recursively divided into its component parts. The 'assembly index' is defined as the shortest path to put the object back together.[1]

For example, the word 'abracadabra' consists of 5 different letters and is 11 symbols long. It can be assembled from its constituents as a + b --> ab + r --> abr + a --> abra + c --> abrac + a --> abraca + d --> abracad + abra --> abracadabra, because 'abra' was already constructed at an earlier stage. Because this requires 7 steps, the assembly index is 7. The string 'abcdefghijk' has no repeats so has an assembly index of 10.

While other approaches can provide a measure of complexity, the researchers claim that assembly theory's molecular assembly number is the first to be measurable experimentally. They argue that the molecular assembly number can be used to gauge the improbability that a complex molecule was created without life, with a higher number of steps corresponding to a higher improbability.[5] This method could be implemented in a fragmentation tandem mass spectrometry instrument to search for biosignatures.[5] Leroy Cronin stated "Our system is the first falsifiable hypothesis for life detection and is based on the idea that only living systems can produce complex molecules that could not form randomly in any abundance, and this allows us to sidestep the problem of defining life."[6]

The theory was extended to map chemical space with molecular assembly trees. These trees were formed by arranging constituent pieces in size order. When two or more molecules have common units, their trees are combined, including the two target molecules and various hybrids.[10][3]

ChatGPT
ChatGPT
Assembly theory is a framework developed by Leroy Cronin and his team at the University of Glasgow, in collaboration with researchers from Arizona State University. It provides a new approach to quantify complexity and understand the emergence of selection and evolution in physical systems.
The theory introduces the concept of the "assembly index," which measures the complexity of an object based on the number of independent parts it consists of and their abundances. By recursively breaking down an object into its component parts and determining the shortest path to reassemble it, the assembly index can be calculated.
One significant application of assembly theory is in the search for biosignatures and the distinction between living and non-living processes. The molecular assembly number, derived from assembly theory, can be experimentally measured and used to assess the improbability of a complex molecule forming without the influence of life. This provides a potential method for detecting signs of life.
Furthermore, assembly theory has been extended to map chemical space using molecular assembly trees. These trees organize constituent pieces of molecules in size order, allowing for the comparison and combination of different molecules and their hybrids.
Overall, assembly theory offers a quantitative framework to study complexity, selection, and evolution in physical systems, with potential applications in understanding the origins of life and identifying biosignatures.

Connections with graph theory, category theory, set theory, cellular automatons, and Bayesian updating of Markov blankets.
1 / 1
ChatGPT
ChatGPT
Assembly theory has connections and overlaps with several areas of mathematical and computational concepts:
Graph Theory: Assembly theory can be related to graph theory, as it involves representing objects and their components as nodes and the connections between them as edges. The assembly process can be seen as traversing the graph to construct the object from its components.
Category Theory: Category theory provides a framework for studying relationships between objects and their compositions. Assembly theory can be viewed through the lens of category theory, where objects are the components and the assembly process represents the composition of these objects.
Set Theory: Set theory deals with the mathematical study of collections of objects. In assembly theory, the components of an object can be seen as elements of a set, and the assembly process involves combining these elements to form the desired object.
Cellular Automata: Cellular automata are computational models consisting of cells arranged in a grid, where the state of each cell evolves based on the states of its neighboring cells. Assembly theory shares some conceptual similarities with cellular automata, as it involves the iterative construction and transformation of objects based on local rules and interactions.
Bayesian Updating of Markov Blankets: Bayesian inference and Markov blankets are concepts used in probabilistic modeling and reasoning. While not explicitly mentioned in the context of assembly theory, Bayesian updating could potentially be applied to update the probabilities of different assembly paths or outcomes based on observed data or evidence.
It's worth noting that while there may be connections and overlaps between assembly theory and these mathematical and computational concepts, the precise relationships and applications may require further exploration and development in the context of assembly theory itself.

Connections to functional reactive programming with dynamic free-energy minimization.
1 / 1
ChatGPT
ChatGPT
Functional reactive programming (FRP) and dynamic free-energy minimization (DFEM) are computational paradigms that have connections to assembly theory:
Functional Reactive Programming (FRP): FRP is a programming paradigm that combines functional programming with reactive programming to handle time-varying values and events in a declarative and composable manner. FRP emphasizes the propagation of changes and dependencies between values over time. In the context of assembly theory, FRP could potentially be used to model and simulate the dynamic assembly processes, where the components interact and change over time.
Dynamic Free-Energy Minimization (DFEM): DFEM is a concept derived from the principles of free-energy minimization, which is a fundamental concept in fields such as statistical physics and machine learning. DFEM involves minimizing the free-energy of a system by adapting and updating its internal states or parameters based on the observed data or environment. In assembly theory, DFEM could be relevant in the context of optimizing the assembly processes by minimizing the free-energy associated with the construction of complex objects.
The connections between assembly theory and FRP/DFEM may involve leveraging the principles and techniques from these computational paradigms to model, simulate, and optimize the assembly processes, taking into account the dynamic nature of the system and the minimization of relevant energy or cost functions.
It's important to note that while there are conceptual connections between assembly theory and FRP/DFEM, the specific applications and implementations may require further research and development to explore their synergies and potential benefits in the context of assembly theory.

Genetic programming with evolutionary algorithms.
1 / 1
ChatGPT
ChatGPT
Genetic programming (GP) is a subfield of evolutionary computation that applies principles inspired by biological evolution to automatically generate computer programs or models. It involves using evolutionary algorithms to evolve populations of programs or models through processes such as mutation, recombination, and selection.
In the context of assembly theory, genetic programming can be utilized to explore and optimize the assembly processes of complex objects. Here's how genetic programming relates to assembly theory:
Representation: In genetic programming, the programs or models are typically represented as symbolic expressions or trees. Similarly, in assembly theory, the objects being assembled can be represented as hierarchical structures or assembly trees. The symbolic representation allows for the exploration and manipulation of the building blocks and their relationships during the assembly process.
Evolutionary Algorithms: Genetic programming employs evolutionary algorithms, such as genetic algorithms or genetic programming algorithms, to evolve populations of programs or models over generations. These algorithms involve mechanisms like selection, crossover, and mutation to drive the evolution towards improved solutions. In assembly theory, evolutionary algorithms can be adapted to guide the assembly process, exploring different combinations and arrangements of components to generate complex objects with desired properties.
Fitness Evaluation: In genetic programming, a fitness function is used to evaluate the quality or performance of each program or model in the population. Fitness determines the reproductive success and selection of individuals for the next generation. Similarly, in assembly theory, the fitness or quality of an assembled object can be assessed based on certain criteria or properties. The fitness evaluation helps in the selection of successful assemblies and drives the evolution towards higher-quality and more complex objects.
Exploration of Design Space: Genetic programming allows for the exploration of a vast design space, searching for novel and effective solutions through variation and selection. Assembly theory, with its focus on the generation of new objects and the emergence of complexity, can benefit from the exploration capabilities of genetic programming to discover innovative assembly strategies and configurations.
By combining genetic programming techniques with assembly theory, researchers can leverage the power of evolutionary algorithms to discover, optimize, and evolve assembly processes for creating complex objects with desired properties or functionalities.
It's worth noting that the application of genetic programming to assembly theory may require domain-specific adaptations and considerations, as the challenges and constraints of assembly processes differ from those typically encountered in traditional genetic programming applications.

Geometric deep learning and quantum speedup.
1 / 1
ChatGPT
ChatGPT
Geometric deep learning and quantum speedup are two distinct but interconnected areas of research in the field of artificial intelligence and computational science. Here's a brief explanation of each and how they relate:
Geometric Deep Learning: Geometric deep learning (GDL) is a subfield of machine learning that focuses on developing algorithms and models capable of understanding and analyzing structured or geometric data. Traditional deep learning methods excel at processing grid-like data, such as images or text, but struggle with data represented as graphs, point clouds, or other non-grid structures. GDL aims to bridge this gap by extending deep learning techniques to handle and exploit the inherent geometric information in such data.
GDL incorporates concepts from graph theory, topology, and differential geometry to enable deep learning models to operate on structured data. By leveraging the geometric relationships and properties within the data, GDL algorithms can extract meaningful representations, perform reasoning, and make predictions on graph-structured or geometric data.
Quantum Speedup: Quantum speedup refers to the potential advantage that quantum computers have over classical computers in solving certain computational problems. Quantum computers leverage quantum mechanical principles, such as superposition and entanglement, to perform computations in ways that can surpass the capabilities of classical computers for specific tasks. Quantum speedup is particularly promising for problems that involve complex calculations, optimization, simulation of quantum systems, or searching large solution spaces.
The connection between geometric deep learning and quantum speedup arises from the exploration of quantum machine learning algorithms. Researchers are investigating the application of quantum computing techniques to enhance the capabilities of deep learning models, including those used in geometric deep learning. Quantum machine learning aims to leverage the unique properties of quantum systems, such as quantum parallelism and quantum entanglement, to develop algorithms that can accelerate learning, inference, and data processing tasks.
By combining geometric deep learning techniques with quantum-inspired or quantum-enhanced algorithms, researchers hope to unlock new avenues for understanding and processing complex geometric data. The utilization of quantum speedup in geometric deep learning has the potential to enable more efficient and powerful analysis, modeling, and prediction capabilities, particularly for problems involving large-scale graphs, molecular structures, social networks, or physical simulations.
It's important to note that both geometric deep learning and quantum speedup are active areas of research, and their full potential and practical applications are still being explored and developed.

The Invocation Model of Process Expression argues that mathematics does not provide the most appropriate conceptual foundations for computer science, but, rather, that these foundations are a primary source of unnecessary complexity and confusion.  It supports that there is a more appropriate conceptual model that unifies forms of expression considered quite disparate and simplifies issues considered complex and intractable.  This book presents that this model of process expression is alternative theory of computer science that is both valid and practical.

"...Fant's work is certainly thought-provoking and should be of great interest to those concerned with theoretical computer science." (British Computer Society Book Reviews)

"Karl Fant has written a very compelling book that should be read by academicians and practitioners alike." (Ubiquity, August 28, 2007)

From the Inside Flap
A groundbreaking, seminal work that challenges the theoretical foundations of computer science

This seminal work will challenge and change your understanding of computers and computing. Since the invention of the computer, it has been accepted with little question that the theoretical foundations of computer science are found in mathematics. The difficulties of computer science have been attributed to the inherent complexity of computation, which can only be overcome with disciplined methodology.

The author of this text presents a convincing and carefully structured argument that shows why linking computer science to mathematics results in unnecessary complexity and confusion. Instead, the author sets forth and demonstrates the viability and practicality of a new conceptual model, the invocation model of process expression. This model links the design and function of computer systems with the design and function of biological systems. Moreover, the author shows how changing your underlying assumptions sheds new light on dealing with such complex issues as concurrency, digital computers, and biological cells.

The chapters of this text are organized under three main topics:

The Problem: Why the underlying theory of contemporary computer science is not helpful

The Solution: How the invocation model of process expression solves many problems of contemporary computer science

The Invocation Language: How the invocation model is embodied in symbol string expression

For computer scientists and engineers, this publication opens up a completely new way of understanding what computers are, how they work, and what they can do. For students of computer science, it offers an alternative theory that helps them understand and overcome some of the limitations imposed by current theory.
