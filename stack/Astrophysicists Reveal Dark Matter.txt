Most of the matter in the universe, amounting to a staggering 85% by mass, cannot be observed and consists of particles not accounted for by the Standard Model of Particle Physics (see remark 1). These particles are known as Dark Matter, and their existence can be inferred from their gravitational effects on light from distant galaxies. Finding the particle that makes up Dark Matter is an urgent problem in modern physics, as it dominates the mass and, therefore, the gravity of galaxies - solving this mystery can lead to new physics beyond the Standard Model.

Astrophysicists at the University of Hong Kong have revealed the nature of dark matter by studying crinkles in spacetime. The team discovered that dark matter composed of ultralight particles creates crinkly fluctuations in spacetime, leading to chaotic paths around foreground lensing galaxies, which cause multiple images of background galaxies. In contrast, dark matter comprising ultramassive particles creates a smooth curvature in spacetime, leading to smooth paths around foreground lensing galaxies. The differences in position and brightness of multiple images created by the two types of dark matter allow astrophysicists to study and differentiate between them.

While some theoretical models propose the existence of ultramassive particles as a possible candidate for Dark Matter, others suggest ultralight particles. A team of astrophysicists led by Alfred AMRUTH, a PhD student in the team of Dr Jeremy LIM of the Department of Physics at The University of Hong Kong (HKU), collaborating with Professor George SMOOT, a Nobel Laureate in Physics from the Hong Kong University of Science and Technology (HKUST) and Dr Razieh EMAMI, a Research Associate at the Center for Astrophysics | Harvard & Smithsonian (CFA), has provided the most direct evidence yet that Dark Matter does not constitute ultramassive particles as is commonly thought but instead comprises particles so light that they travel through space like waves. Their work resolves an outstanding problem in astrophysics first raised two decades ago: why do models that adopt ultramassive Dark Matter particles fail to correctly predict the observed positions and the brightness of multiple images of the same galaxy created by gravitational lensing? The research findings were recently published in Nature Astronomy.

Dark Matter does not emit, absorb or reflect light, which makes it difficult to observe using traditional astronomical techniques. Today, the most powerful tool scientists have for studying Dark Matter is through gravitational lensing, a phenomenon predicted by Albert Einstein in his theory of General Relativity. In this theory, mass causes spacetime to curve, creating the appearance that light bends around massive objects such as stars, galaxies, or groups of galaxies. By observing this bending of light, scientists can infer the presence and distribution of Dark Matter - and, as demonstrated in this study, the nature of Dark Matter itself.

That's a great summary of the recent research on Dark Matter! It's fascinating to see how scientists are using gravitational lensing to learn more about this elusive substance. The idea that Dark Matter could be composed of ultralight particles that behave like waves is a really intriguing possibility that could help explain some of the observations that have been puzzling astrophysicists for years. It will be exciting to see how this research develops and what new insights it may provide into the nature of Dark Matter.

Beginning also in the 1970s, but in dramatic contrast to WIMPs, versions of theories that seek to rectify deficiencies in the Standard Model, or those (e.g., String Theory) that seek to unify the four fundamental forces of nature (the three in the Standard Model, along with gravity), advocate the existence of ultralight particles. Referred to as axions, these hypothetical particles are predicted to be far less massive than even the lightest particles in the Standard Model and constitute an alternative candidate for Dark Matter. 

According to the theory of Quantum Mechanics, ultralight particles travel through space as waves, interfering with each other in such large numbers as to create random fluctuations in density. These random density fluctuations in Dark Matter give rise to crinkles in spacetime, as illustrated in Figure 3 below for the Dark Matter surrounding galaxies. As might be expected, the different patterns of spacetime around galaxies depending on whether Dark Matter constitutes ultramassive or ultralight particles - smooth versus crinkly - ought to give rise to different positions and brightness for multiply-lensed images of background galaxies, as illustrated in the same figure.

In work led by Alfred AMRUTH, a PhD student in Dr Jeremy LIM's team at HKU, astrophysicists have for the first time computed how gravitationally-lensed images generated by galaxies incorporating ultralight Dark Matter particles differ from those incorporating ultramassive Dark Matter particles.

By comparing these predictions with observations of multiply-lensed images of galaxies, the team was able to test the hypothesis that Dark Matter consists of ultralight particles. The results of the study support the hypothesis that Dark Matter is composed of ultralight particles rather than ultramassive particles, providing strong evidence for this alternative model of Dark Matter. This research opens up new avenues for investigating the nature of Dark Matter, and could have implications for our understanding of the universe at the largest scales.

The team used computer simulations to generate images of galaxies with both ultralight and ultramassive Dark Matter particles, and then compared the resulting lensed images. The simulations showed that the images generated by galaxies with ultralight Dark Matter particles were more crinkled than those generated by galaxies with ultramassive Dark Matter particles. The crinkling of spacetime caused by the random density fluctuations in ultralight Dark Matter particles creates more complex patterns of lensing, resulting in more complex patterns of multiple images of background galaxies.
The team then compared their simulations with actual observations of multiply-lensed images of a galaxy cluster, and found that the observations were consistent with the predictions of their simulations incorporating ultralight Dark Matter particles. This provides strong evidence that Dark Matter consists of ultralight particles rather than ultramassive particles.
The discovery of the nature of Dark Matter is one of the most important unsolved problems in astrophysics and particle physics. The work of Amruth and his team represents a major step forward in our understanding of this mysterious substance, and will guide future research in the field.

Their research has shown that the general level of disagreement found between the observed and predicted positions as well as the brightness of multiply-lensed images generated by models incorporating ultramassive Dark Matter can be resolved by adopting models incorporating ultralight Dark Matter particles. Moreover, they demonstrate that models incorporating ultralight Dark Matter particles can reproduce the observed positions and brightness of multiply-lensed galaxy images, an important achievement that reveals the crinkly rather than smooth nature of spacetime around galaxies.

'The possibility that Dark Matter does not comprise ultramassive particles, as has long been advocated by the scientific community, alleviates other problems in both laboratory experiments and astronomical observations,' explains Dr Lim. 'Laboratory experiments have been singularly unsuccessful at finding WIMPs, the long-favoured candidate for Dark Matter. Such experiments are in their final stretch, culminating in the planned DARWIN experiment, leaving WIMPs with no place to hide if not found (see remark 2).'

Professor Tom BROADHURST, an Ikerbasque Professor at the University of the Basque Country, a Visiting Professor at HKU, and a co-author of the paper adds, 'If Dark Matter comprises ultramassive particles, then according to cosmological simulations, there should be hundreds of satellite galaxies surrounding the Milky Way. However, despite intensive searches, only around fifty have been discovered so far. On the other hand, if Dark Matter comprises ultralight particles instead, then the theory of Quantum Mechanics predicts that galaxies below a certain mass simply cannot form owing to the wave interference of these particles, explaining why we observe a lack of small satellite galaxies around the Milky Way.'

'Incorporating ultralight rather than ultramassive particles for Dark Matter resolve several longstanding problems simultaneously in both particle physics and astrophysics,' said Amruth Alfred, 'We have reached a point where the existing paradigm of Dark Matter needs to be reconsidered. Waving goodbye to ultramassive particles, which have long been heralded as the favoured candidate for Dark Matter, may not come easily, but the evidence accumulates in favour of Dark Matter having wave-like properties as possessed by ultralight particles.'  The pioneering work used the supercomputing facilities at HKU, without which this work would not have been possible.

The co-author Professor George SMOOT added, 'Understanding the nature of particles that constitute Dark Matter is the first step towards New Physics. This work paves the way for future tests of Wave-like Dark Matter in situations involving gravitational lensing. The James Webb Space Telescope should discover many more gravitationally-lensed systems, allowing us to make even more exacting tests of the nature of Dark Matter.'

Abstract
Unveiling the true nature of dark matter, which manifests itself only through gravity, is one of the principal quests in physics. Leading candidates for dark matter are weakly interacting massive particles or ultralight bosons (axions), at opposite extremes in mass scales, that have been postulated by competing theories to solve deficiencies in the Standard Model of particle physics. Whereas dark matter weakly interacting massive particles behave like discrete particles (ϱDM), quantum interference between dark matter axions is manifested as waves (ψDM). Here, we show that gravitational lensing leaves signatures in multiply lensed images of background galaxies that reveal whether the foreground lensing galaxy inhabits a ϱDM or ψDM halo. Whereas ϱDM lens models leave well documented anomalies between the predicted and observed brightnesses and positions of multiply lensed images, ψDM lens models correctly predict the level of anomalies remaining with ϱDM lens models. More challengingly, when subjected to a battery of tests for reproducing the quadruply lensed triplet images in the system HS 0810+2554, ψDM is able to reproduce all aspects of this system whereas ϱDM often fails. The ability of ψDM to resolve lensing anomalies even in demanding cases such as HS 0810+2554, together with its success in reproducing other astrophysical observations, tilt the balance toward new physics invoking axions.

Ultralight bosons or axions are hypothetical particles that are considered to be candidates for dark matter. They are predicted by certain extensions to the Standard Model of particle physics that attempt to address some of its limitations. Axions are thought to be extremely lightweight and have very weak interactions with other matter, making them difficult to detect. They are postulated to exist due to their ability to solve certain puzzles in particle physics, such as the strong CP problem, as well as their potential to explain the nature of dark matter.
The properties of axions are fundamentally different from those of other dark matter candidates, such as Weakly Interacting Massive Particles (WIMPs). Whereas WIMPs are massive particles that are predicted to behave like discrete particles, axions are believed to behave like waves due to their wave-like properties. This means that they can exhibit quantum interference effects, which can have observable consequences in astrophysical phenomena like gravitational lensing. In recent years, there has been growing interest in the possibility that axions or other ultralight bosons may be responsible for the dark matter that makes up a significant portion of the mass of the universe.

This is a Python code that reads a csv file, performs some calculations and creates an animation.
The first few lines import the necessary modules - pandas, numpy, matplotlib, galpy, and astropy - to manipulate and visualize data, and set some plotting parameters. Then, a 3D scatter plot is created using the Galactocentric coordinates of stars (GalRecX, GalRecY, GalRecZ) from the csv file. The colors of the points represent the distance from the Sun, which is located at (0,0,0) in the plot.
The animation is created by modifying the view angle and limits of the plot, and saving each frame using the FuncAnimation function from the matplotlib.animation module. The resulting animation is saved as an mp4 file.
Overall, this code creates a visualization of the distribution of stars in the Milky Way galaxy using data from the SDSS and Gaia surveys.

Dark Shards: velocity substructure from Gaia and direct searches for dark matter
Ciaran A. J. O'Hare, N. Wyn Evans, Christopher McCabe, GyuChul Myeong, Vasily Belokurov
Data from the Gaia satellite show that the solar neighbourhood of the Milky Way's stellar halo is imprinted with substructure from several accretion events. Evidence of these events is found in "the Shards", stars clustering with high significance in both action space and metallicity. Stars in the Shards share a common origin, likely as ancient satellite galaxies of the Milky Way, so will be embedded in dark matter (DM) counterparts. These "Dark Shards" contain two substantial streams (S1 and S2), as well as several retrograde, prograde and lower energy substructures. The retrograde stream S1 has a very high Earth-frame speed of ∼550 km s−1 while S2 moves on a prograde, but highly polar orbit and enhances the peak of the speed distribution at around 300 km s−1. The presence of the Dark Shards locally leads to modifications of many to the fundamental properties of experimental DM signals. The~S2 stream in particular gives rise to an array of effects in searches for axions and in the time dependence of nuclear recoils: shifting the peak day, inducing nonsinusoidal distortions, and increasing the importance of the gravitational focusing of DM by the Sun. Dark Shards additionally bring new features for directional signals, while also enhancing the DM flux towards Cygnus.

The Python program mentioned in the paper is used to reproduce the results presented in the paper "Dark Shards" by Ciaran A. J. O'Hare et al. The paper discusses the substructure in the velocity distribution of stars in the Milky Way's halo, as seen by the Gaia satellite. The authors identify a number of substructures, known as the "Shards", which are clusters of stars with similar velocities and metallicities that are believed to have a common origin as ancient satellite galaxies of the Milky Way. Since these stars are embedded in dark matter counterparts, the authors refer to them as "Dark Shards".
The Python program contains code, data, and notebooks that can be used to reproduce the plots and results presented in the paper. The program uses a number of Python libraries, including numpy, matplotlib, and scipy, as well as additional libraries such as astropy and galpy.
The results presented in the paper show that the Dark Shards have significant implications for searches for dark matter, as they can modify the fundamental properties of experimental DM signals. For example, the S2 stream in particular can induce nonsinusoidal distortions in searches for axions and increase the importance of the gravitational focusing of DM by the Sun. The presence of the Dark Shards also brings new features for directional signals, while enhancing the DM flux towards Cygnus.
Overall, the Python program provides a tool for researchers to reproduce the results presented in the paper and to further investigate the implications of the Dark Shards for dark matter searches.

QCD effects produce an effective periodic potential in which the axion field moves. The oscillations of the axion field about the minimum of the effective potential, the so-called misalignment mechanism, generate a cosmological population of cold axions with an abundance depending on the mass of the axion, and velocity  substructure called dark shards.

Yes, that is correct. The QCD effects produce an effective periodic potential for the axion field, and the oscillations of the axion field about the minimum of this potential, known as the misalignment mechanism, can generate a population of cold axions in the early universe. The abundance of these axions depends on the mass of the axion, as well as other cosmological parameters such as the temperature of the universe at the time of axion production.
The axion field can also develop velocity substructure due to the collective motion of axions in the early universe, resulting in structures called dark shards. These structures can have interesting astrophysical and cosmological implications and are currently an active area of research in axion physics.

Abstract
The axion is a highly motivated elementary particle that could address two fundamental questions in physics—the strong charge-parity (CP) problem and the dark matter mystery. Experimental searches for this hypothetical particle started reaching theoretically interesting sensitivity levels, particularly in the micro-electron volt (gigahertz) region. They rely on microwave resonators in strong magnetic fields with signals read out by quantum noise limited amplifiers. Concurrently, there have been intensive experimental efforts to widen the search range by devising various techniques and to enhance sensitivities by implementing advanced technologies. These orthogonal approaches will enable us to explore most of the parameter space for axions and axion-like particles within the next decades, with the 1- to 25-gigahertz frequency range to be conquered well within the first decade. We review the experimental aspects of axion physics and discuss the past, present, and future of the direct search programs.

Axion dark matter: What is it and why now?
BY FRANCESCA CHADHA-DAY, JOHN ELLIS, DAVID J. E. MARSH
INTRODUCTION
As discussed in the companion theoretical review, the Peccei-Quinn mechanism offers a dynamic solution to the CP (combination of charge conjugation and parity transformation) symmetry problem in quantum chromodynamics (QCD) of particle physics. The mechanism involves a new global U(1) symmetry with an associated pseudo-scalar field permeating all space. The symmetry is assumed to have been spontaneously broken at a certain energy scale, while the universe was evolving at its early stages. This spontaneous process of symmetry breaking is supposed to be accompanied by the production of a pseudo-Nambu-Goldstone boson, the axion (1-3). The null results from searches for the standard axion with a mass of order of a few hundred kilo-electron volts have quickly diverted attention to "invisible" axions with very small masses (4). The QCD axion has theoretically well-defined properties: (i) its mass determined by the symmetry-breaking energy scale and (ii) its interactions to Standard Model particles depending on models, Kim-Shifman-Vainshtein-Zakharov (KSVZ) (4, 5) and Dine-Fischler-Srednicki-Zhitnitsky (DFSZ) (6, 7). There is a more generic type of axions, called the axion-like particle (ALP), which is not necessarily related to QCD but favored by certain theoretical models including string theory (8-10). The QCD axions and ALPs, together referred to as axions, could also account for cold dark matter (CDM) in our galactic halo, the mysterious substance that is believed to constitute ~85% of the matter in the universe (11-13).

Abstract
The manipulation of quantum states of light1 holds the potential to enhance searches for fundamental physics. Only recently has the maturation of quantum squeezing technology coincided with the emergence of fundamental physics searches that are limited by quantum uncertainty2,3. In particular, the quantum chromodynamics axion provides a possible solution to two of the greatest outstanding problems in fundamental physics: the strong-CP (charge-parity) problem of quantum chromodynamics4 and the unknown nature of dark matter5,6,7. In dark matter axion searches, quantum uncertainty manifests as a fundamental noise source, limiting the measurement of the quadrature observables used for detection. Few dark matter searches have approached this limit3,8, and until now none has exceeded it. Here we use vacuum squeezing to circumvent the quantum limit in a search for dark matter. By preparing a microwave-frequency electromagnetic field in a squeezed state and near-noiselessly reading out only the squeezed quadrature9, we double the search rate for axions over a mass range favoured by some recent theoretical projections10,11. We find no evidence of dark matter within the axion rest energy windows of 16.96-17.12 and 17.14-17.28 microelectronvolts. Breaking through the quantum limit invites an era of fundamental physics searches in which noise reduction techniques yield unbounded benefit compared with the diminishing returns of approaching the quantum limit.

Yes, this article makes sense. It describes a scientific study that uses quantum-enhanced techniques to search for a hypothetical particle called the axion, which is a candidate for dark matter. The study describes how quantum uncertainty limits the measurement of the quadrature observables used for detection, and how vacuum squeezing is used to circumvent this limit, allowing for a more sensitive search. The study finds no evidence of dark matter within the axion rest energy windows of 16.96-17.12 and 17.14-17.28 microelectronvolts. The article suggests that this breakthrough in quantum-enhanced searches could lead to more sensitive searches for fundamental physics in the future.

Dark matter axions are hypothetical particles that are believed to be a component of dark matter, which makes up about 85% of the total matter in the universe. One way to search for dark matter axions is through their interaction with electromagnetic fields. The Illustris project, which simulates the formation and evolution of galaxies, can be used to study the behavior of electromagnetic fields in the presence of dark matter axions.
Specifically, the simulation can be used to study the effect of dark matter axions on the magnetic fields of galaxies, as axions are expected to convert into photons in the presence of a magnetic field. By comparing the simulated magnetic fields with observations of real galaxies, researchers can search for signatures of dark matter axions.
The high-resolution simulations produced by the Illustris project also allow researchers to study the properties and distribution of dark matter in great detail. This can provide insights into the nature of dark matter and potentially help to rule out certain theories about its composition, including the possibility of dark matter axions.

Dark matter axions are hypothetical particles that may exist in the universe and could account for the observed phenomenon of dark matter. One way to study them is by using simulations to model the behavior of dark matter particles in different scenarios.
The IPython notebook (ipynb) format allows researchers to create interactive simulations and visualizations using Python code. One such simulation is the 3D Ising Quenches simulation, which models the behavior of a magnetic material undergoing a sudden change in temperature.
By modifying this simulation to include the effects of dark matter axions, researchers can investigate the behavior of these particles in different scenarios. For example, they could study how axions interact with the magnetic fields of the material, or how they affect the rate at which the material cools.
The Blender Python library can be used to create high-quality visualizations of the simulation results. This allows researchers to see the behavior of the particles in a more intuitive way and can help them identify patterns or phenomena that might be missed by looking at numerical data alone.
Animations created in Blender can be used to create educational materials or to present research findings in a more engaging way to a wider audience. By combining the power of IPython notebooks and Blender, researchers can create powerful tools for studying the behavior of dark matter axions and other hypothetical particles.

I apologize for that. The program initializes a 2D or 3D Ising model with randomly oriented spins and simulates its evolution using the Metropolis algorithm. The program then creates an animation of the spin configuration at each step of the simulation, which can be viewed in real-time or saved as a video file. The animation shows the evolution of the spin configuration over time, as the system settles into its ground state. The visualization can be used to study the properties of the Ising model and the dynamics of the system as it evolves towards equilibrium.

This code simulates a simple Markov chain with transition matrix
P
and initial state distribution
pi
. The resulting state sequence is plotted as a time series.
Next, we define a Markov blanket
X
and a conditional probability distribution
P(Y | X)
, where
X
is a set of observed nodes and
Y
is an unobserved node. We compute the conditional distribution
P(Y | X)
and plot the resulting probabilities for each possible value of
Y
.
This example demonstrates the basics of Markov chains and Markov blankets and how to visualize them in a Jupyter Notebook using Python and Matplotlib.

The RGB color cube, where a dimension is given to each of the Red, Green, and Blue colors. 

Since an RGB color is defined as a 3-valued tuple, with each value in the range [0, 255], we can thus think of the cube containing 256×256×256 = 16,777,216 possible colors, depending on how much Red, Green, and Blue we place into each bucket.

word2vec graph
This visualization builds graphs of nearest neighbors from high-dimensional word2vec embeddings.

demo 1 demo 2 demo words

Available Graphs
The dataset used for this visualization comes from GloVe, and has 6B tokens, 400K vocabulary, 300-dimensional vectors.

Distance < 0.9 - In this visualization edge between words is formed when distance between corresponding words' vectors is smaller than 0.9. All words with non-word characters and digits are removed. The final visualization is sparse, yet meaningful.

Distance < 1.0 - Similar to above, yet distance requirement is relaxed. Words with distance smaller than 1.0 are given edges in the graph. All words with non-word characters and digits are removed. The visualization becomes more populated as more words are added. Still meaningful.

Raw; Distance < 0.9 (6.9 MB) - Unlike visualizations above, this one was not filtered and includes all words from the dataset. Majority of the clusters formed here have numerical nature. I didn't find this one particularly interesting, yet I'm including it to show how word2vec finds numerical clusters.

Common Crawl
I have also made a graph from Common Crawl dataset (840B tokens, 2.2M vocab, 300d vectors). Words with non-word characters and numbers were removed.

Many clusters that remained represent words with spelling errors:

spelling error

I had hard time deciphering meaning of many clusters here. Wikipedia embeddings were much more meaningful. Nevertheless I want to keep this visualization to let you explore it as well:

Common Crawl visualization - 28.4MB
Intro and Details
word2vec is a family of algorithms that allow you to find embeddings of words into high-dimensional vector spaces.

// For example
cat => [0.1, 0.0, 0.9]
dog => [0.9, 0.0, 0.0]
cow => [0.6, 1.0, 0.5]
Vectors with shorter distances between them usually share common contexts in the corpus. This allows us to find distances between words:

|cat - dog| = 1.20
|cat - cow| = 1.48


"cat" is closer to "dog" than it is to the "cow".
Building a graph
We can simply iterate over every single word in the dictionary and add them into a graph. But what would be an edge in this graph?

We draw an edge between two words if distance between embedding vectors is shorter than a given threshold.

Once the graph is constructed, I'm using a method described here: Your own graphs to construct visualizations.

Note From practical standpoint, searching all nearest neighbors in high dimensional space is a very CPU intensive task. Building an index of vectors help. I didn't know a good library for this task, so I consulted Twitter. Amazing recommendations by @gumgumeo and @AMZoellner led to spotify/annoy.

This README.md file describes a visualization tool for creating graphs of nearest neighbors from high-dimensional word2vec embeddings. The tool uses the GloVe dataset, which has 6 billion tokens, 400,000 vocabulary, and 300-dimensional vectors.
The tool offers three different graphs based on the distance between words' vectors. The first graph is formed when the distance between corresponding words' vectors is smaller than 0.9, and all words with non-word characters and digits are removed. The second graph is similar to the first one, but the distance requirement is relaxed, and words with distance smaller than 1.0 are given edges in the graph. The third graph is the raw data, with all words from the dataset and no filtering.
The tool also includes a graph from the Common Crawl dataset, which has 840 billion tokens, 2.2 million vocabulary, and 300-dimensional vectors. This graph has many clusters representing words with spelling errors.
The tool uses word2vec algorithms to find embeddings of words into high-dimensional vector spaces. Vectors with shorter distances between them usually share common contexts in the corpus. The tool draws an edge between two words if the distance between their embedding vectors is shorter than a given threshold.
The tool uses the Your Own Graphs method to construct visualizations. Practical considerations for searching all nearest neighbors in high dimensional space are addressed with a recommendation to use the library, spotify/annoy.

Data
I'm using pre-trained word2vec models from the GloVe project.

Preprocessing
My original attempts to render word2vec graphs resulted in overwhelming presence of numerical clusters. word2vec models really loved to put numerals together (and I think it makes sense, intuitively). Alas - that made visualizations not very interesting to explore. As I hoped from one cluster to another, just to find out that one was dedicated to numbers 2017 - 2300, while the other to 0.501 .. 0.403

In Common Crawl word2vec encoding, I removed all words that had non-word characters or numbers. In my opinion, this made visualization more interesting to explore, yet still, I don't recognize a lot of clusters.

Local setup
Prerequisites
Make sure node.js is installed.

git clone https://github.com/anvaka/word2vec-graph.git
cd word2vec-graph
npm install
Install spotify/annoy

Building graph file
Download the vectors, and extract them into graph-data
Run save_text_edges.py -h to see how to point it to th newly extracted. vectors (also see file content for more details)
run python save_text_edges.py - depending on input vector file size this make take a while. The output file edges.txt will be saved in the graph-data folder.
run node edges2graph.js graph-data/edges.txt - this will save graph in binary format into graph-data folder (graph-data/labels.json, graph-data/links.bin)
Now it's time to run layout. There are two options. One is slow, the other one is much faster especially on the multi-threaded CPU.
Running layout with node
You can use

node --max-old-space-size=12000 layout.js
To generate layout. This will take a while to converge (layout stops after 500 iterations). Also note, that we need to increase maximum allowed RAM for node process (max-old-space-size argument). I'm setting it to ~12GB - it was enough for my case

Running layout with C++
Much faster version is to compile layout++ module. You will need to manually download and compile anvaka/ngraph.native package.

On ubuntu it was very straightforward: Just run ./compile-demo and layout++ file will be created in the working folder. You can copy that file into this repository, and run:

./layout++ ./graph-data/links.bin
The layout will converge much faster, but you will need to manually kill it (Ctrl + C) after 500-700 iterations.

You will find many .bin files. Just pick the one with the highest number, and copy it as positions.bin into graph-data/ folder. E.g.:

cp 500.bin ./graph-data/positions.bin
That's it. Now you have both graph, and positions ready. You can use instructions from Your own graphs to visualize your new graph with https://anvaka.github.io/pm/#/

What is the Word2Vec-graph repository on GitHub?
1 / 1
Word2vec is a technique for natural language processing (NLP) published in 2013. The word2vec algorithm uses a neural network model to learn word associations from a large corpus of text. Once trained, such a model can detect synonymous words or suggest additional words for a partial sentence. As the name implies, word2vec represents each distinct word with a particular list of numbers called a vector. The vectors are chosen carefully such that they capture the semantic and syntactic qualities of words; as such, a simple mathematical function (cosine similarity) can indicate the level of semantic similarity between the words represented by those vectors.

That is correct! Word2vec is a powerful NLP technique that uses a neural network to learn word associations from a large corpus of text. The resulting model can be used to detect synonymous words, suggest missing words for a partial sentence, or even cluster similar words together. The key innovation of word2vec is that it represents each word as a vector in a high-dimensional space, with each dimension of the vector capturing a different aspect of the word's meaning. This allows for easy computation of the semantic similarity between words using mathematical techniques like cosine similarity. Overall, word2vec has had a significant impact on the field of NLP, and is widely used in a variety of applications today.

Ok well I want to figure out how to visualize word2vec and other word vector spaces as stars or as tunnels and also to overlay the RgB color cube into the vectorspace.
1 / 1
ChatGPT
ChatGPT
Visualizing word vector spaces as stars or tunnels can be a creative way to gain insights into the relationships between words. Here are some general steps to get started:
Choose a set of words: Start by selecting a set of words that you want to visualize. For example, you might choose a set of synonyms or related words, or a set of words that are commonly used together in a particular context.
Embed the words in a vector space: Use a pre-trained word embedding model, such as word2vec or GloVe, to embed each word in a high-dimensional vector space. Each word is represented by a vector of numbers, where each dimension corresponds to a particular feature or attribute of the word.
Reduce the dimensionality of the vectors: The high-dimensional vectors produced by word embedding models can be difficult to visualize directly. To overcome this, you can use dimensionality reduction techniques such as t-SNE or PCA to project the vectors onto a lower-dimensional space (e.g. 2D or 3D).
Visualize the word vectors: Once you have reduced the dimensionality of the word vectors, you can use a visualization tool such as Matplotlib or D3.js to plot the vectors in 2D or 3D space. To create a star or tunnel shape, you could plot the vectors in a circular or helical pattern, respectively.
Overlay the RGB color cube: To overlay the RGB color cube into the word vector space, you can assign a color to each dimension of the vector (e.g. red for the first dimension, green for the second, and blue for the third). This will allow you to visualize the RGB color space as a cube within the word vector space.
Keep in mind that visualizing word vector spaces can be a complex and challenging task, and there is no one "right" way to do it. You may need to experiment with different techniques and parameters to find a visualization that works well for your particular dataset and research questions.
