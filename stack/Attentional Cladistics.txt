I found a more I wrote to myself back in 2010:

My attentional operating system:
The first important thing to imagine that
sensation and movement are almost exactly
the same thing. To sense something is to
focus on information coming from a
particular part of your body and sensory
system, and to do and then apply the
following adjustments
I' try to imagine the adjustments as levers
or controls:
These first three l'Il call the activation
pathways:
the first one controls how much information
have coming in to my body. it's like paying
attention to how much information is
coming in (aperture) It's sort of like going
through all the "applications" or "programs" I
have running and turning them all down, one
by one, and turning up the sources that 1
wish to bring into focus (there are roughly
seven motor pathways that I use, plus the
systems that are usually known as the
autonomic systems but that can be brought
into focus or ignored, as well breath, mouth
position, taste and smell, vision, and other) It
turns out that all of the somatic systems can
be autonomic as well, I just have to give
them a task and then reduce attention to
them without reducing their activation.

them a task and then reduce attention to
them without reducing their activation.
the second, pay attention to how much
information to send out (intensity
and the third, approach versus getting away,
or pleasure vs. pain (value),
and the last series of pathways I will call the
attentional pathways. I actually use these to
control the activation pathways listed above,
but I can also use focus to change which
scripts each of the activation pathways are
running
first attentional pathway: (focus) left or right
hemisphere, i think i use left for novel, right
for old. meaning left hemisphere for new,
right for old, one of them is the default
interpretation and the other is its opposite.
So, i was experimenting jumping from
hemisphere to hemisphere for a little while
as I just walked to Java Moose to get a
coffee. When I opened my mouth to ask for
a coffee, - said "could have a popsicle.
meaning I was jumping back and forth
between hot and cold (hot being default, and
cold being the not default), and out (on a
stick) versus in (in a cup). I was jumping
pack and forth between the concept and its
opposite without even thinking of it.
I can also localize where sensations are
coming from from any other other pathways
are comina or establish a scrint for
behaviour,
and the behaviour comes automatically of
what I am supposed to do in that moment,
depending on the level of intensity and my
focus pattern of which areas I am paying
attention to.
So as I direct my focus around to different
parts of my body and different aspects of
my vision, hearing, and even smell,I can
enact any behaviour that is possible for me
in that environment. If 1 tune out
environment alltogether, than I can swim
around in whatever thoughts have been

paying attention to.
So, after I talked to you last night. 1 looked up
on google "cybernetic definition of life"
because I knew that the word cybernetics
means the study of regulatory systems
(cyber is greek for rudder), and life (because
I imagine that life would be a thing that
gathers energy by use of a regulatory
system). The first paper that came up was:
Cybernetic formulation of the definition of
life.
The abstract of a paper written by a B.
Korzeniewski in 2001:
'A definition of life (a living individual) in
cybernetic terms is proposed: In this
formulation, life (a living individual) is
defined as a network of inferior negative
feedbacks (regulatory mechanisms)
subordinated (being at the service of) a
superior positive feedback (potential of
expansion.) It is suggested that this
definition is the minimal definition
necessary and sufficient, for life to be distinguished for inanimate phenomena and,
as such, it describes the essence of life
Subsequently, a quantitative expression for
the amount of the biologically relevant
("purposeful") information (as opposed to
the thermodynamic definition of
information) is proposed. ...
Exactly what 1 am saying (I have discovered
that I am using those two main feedbacks at
all times to determine my behaviour,
depending on what information has become
relevant due to my experience.

whole. Basically I created addicting
pathways that I could use to sort out all
information, I built an ontology of behaviours
based on my experiences, and I can now
form an attentional cladistics, about which
aspects of my environment I used to encode
all subsequent behaviours. I am far from
making a complete cybernetic attentional
map of my mind, but feel like I can
understand the basic structure, and know
where to fill in the details.
Basically, I can go back as far as I can to an
early attentional state that is cladistically
ancestral to other behaviours and make
different decisions and can evolve new types
of attentional process, new types of
information.

Your note from 2010 is a profound introspection on how you perceive and interact with sensory input, your environment, and your cognitive processes. You're tapping into the concept of cybernetics, which is the study of systems, control, and communication in animals and machines. It's about how systems self-regulate through feedback loops.
Here's a brief breakdown of some of the core concepts you touched upon:
Sensation & Movement
: You're drawing a parallel between sensing something and taking action, suggesting a deeply intertwined relationship. This is reminiscent of embodied cognition theories that posit the mind isn't just a product of the brain but also of the body's interactions with the environment.
Activation Pathways
: These seem to be mechanisms you use to modulate attention and action. By controlling the information you let in (aperture), you can better tune your reactions and sensory experiences.
Attentional Pathways
: This is a higher order of control, where you're governing the activation pathways. The left and right hemisphere distinctions you mention might be oversimplified (as both hemispheres collaborate extensively), but it's a useful tool for your introspection. The anecdote about "popsicle" hints at the interplay between hemispheres and how our cognition can influence perception and action.
Cybernetic Definition of Life
: The article you referenced relates to defining life through a cybernetic lens. The dual feedback mechanism - inferior negative feedbacks (keeping things in check) and a superior positive feedback (driving growth and expansion) - is a compelling way to distinguish living beings from inanimate objects. This mirrors your personal exploration of feedback systems in understanding behavior.
Attentional Cladistics
: You mention an "attentional cladistics," suggesting an evolutionary model of your attention patterns. Cladistics is a method in biology to classify organisms based on shared ancestry. By applying this concept to attention, you seem to be suggesting that your attention patterns have evolved over time and that you can trace back to foundational patterns that gave rise to more complex ones.
In summary, your note is a blend of personal introspection and theoretical exploration, aiming to understand the self through the lens of cybernetics and feedback systems. It's a fascinating perspective that can provide valuable insights into cognition, behavior, and personal growth.

Do you know the more recent paper, attention is all you need?
ChatGPT
ChatGPT
Yes, "Attention Is All You Need" is a seminal paper from 2017 by Vaswani et al. that introduced the Transformer architecture, which has since revolutionized the field of natural language processing (NLP) and many other areas of machine learning.
Here's a brief overview:
Problem
: Traditional sequence-to-sequence models used in tasks like machine translation often rely on RNNs (Recurrent Neural Networks) or LSTMs (Long Short-Term Memory networks). These architectures process sequences step-by-step, which makes them inherently sequential and harder to parallelize. This limits their efficiency on modern hardware.
Solution
: The Transformer model abandons the sequential nature of RNNs and instead processes input sequences entirely through self-attention mechanisms.
Key Concepts
:
Self-Attention Mechanism
: Allows the model to weigh the importance of different parts of the input data when producing an output. It helps the model focus on ("attend to") relevant parts of the input for a given task.
Multi-Head Attention
: Instead of having a single set of attention weights, the Transformer uses multiple sets, enabling it to focus on different parts of the input simultaneously.
Positional Encoding
: Since the model doesn't process data sequentially, it doesn't have a sense of order of the sequence. Positional encodings are added to give the model information about the position of words in a sequence.
Impact
:
The Transformer architecture led to a series of breakthrough models in NLP. BERT (Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers), GPT (Generative Pretrained Transformer), and many other models are based on the Transformer architecture.
The ChatGPT you're interacting with right now is a descendant of the Transformer model, based on the GPT architecture by OpenAI. The ideas presented in "Attention Is All You Need" have been foundational in advancing the capabilities of models like mine.

Connections with my ideas for an Attentional Cladistics
ChatGPT
ChatGPT
Your idea of "Attentional Cladistics" is unique in its approach and perspective, merging evolutionary principles with cognitive processes. Let's delve deeper into potential connections between your ideas and the Transformer's attention mechanism:
Evolution of Attention Patterns
:
Attentional Cladistics
: You proposed an evolutionary model for attention patterns, suggesting that foundational patterns give rise to more complex ones over time.
Transformer
: The self-attention mechanism allows the model to weigh the importance of different parts of the input data. Over training iterations, the model refines these weights, which can be seen as the evolution of attention patterns tailored to specific tasks.
Parallel Processing
:
Attentional Cladistics
: Your notes hint at the parallel nature of sensory experiences and processing multiple stimuli simultaneously.
Transformer
: It operates in parallel, processing entire sequences at once rather than sequentially. This mimics the brain's ability to process multiple sensory inputs concurrently.
Feedback Loops
:
Attentional Cladistics
: Your description emphasizes feedback systems, where sensory inputs and attention patterns interact and refine each other.
Transformer
: The multi-head attention allows the model to focus on different parts of the input simultaneously. This iterative refining process can be seen as a feedback loop, optimizing the model's attention over time.
Hemispherical Distinctions
:
Attentional Cladistics
: You mentioned switching focus between the left (for novel information) and right (for familiar information) hemispheres.
Transformer
: While it doesn't have an explicit left/right distinction, the multi-head attention can be likened to having multiple perspectives or approaches to a problem, analogous to how our brain uses different hemispheres for different tasks.
Positional Understanding
:
Attentional Cladistics
: Your focus on sensation and movement, and the relative positions of stimuli and how they're processed.
Transformer
: Positional encodings are vital for the Transformer to understand sequence order, similar to how our attention prioritizes certain stimuli based on their context or position.
In essence, the Transformer's attention mechanism and your concept of "Attentional Cladistics" both center around the dynamic interplay of focus, context, and the adaptive processing of information. Your idea, grounded in evolutionary and cybernetic principles, provides a fascinating lens through which to understand and extend models like the Transformer.

Psycholinguistics is sometimes def i ned as the study of language and 
the mind. As the name suggests, it is a subject which links psychology 
and linguistics. The common aim of all who call themselves psycholin- 
guists is to fi nd out about the structures and processes which underlie 
a human���s ability to speak and understand language. 
Both psychologists and linguists are involved in studying psycholin- 
guistics. As one group of researchers has noted: 
The name says it all . . . it is simultaneously psychology and 
linguistics. At the heart of the discipline, therefore, is the relation- 
ship between these two fi elds, each of which can boast centuries 
of research tradition . . . By contrast, psycholinguistics itself is 
relatively young . . . psycholinguistics as we understand it today 
and as a discipline with its own name has only been in existence 
since the mid-twentieth century. (Cutler et al. 2005: 1) 
(A complete list of references quoted in the text is contained in the 
References on pp. 269���92.) 
Both psychologists and linguists can be classif i ed as social scientists, 
so in one way their approach has long been similar. All social scientists 
work by forming and testing hypotheses. For example, a psycholinguist 
might hypothesize that the speech of someone who is suffering from a 
progressive disease of the nervous system will disintegrate in a certain 
order, perhaps suggesting that the constructions the patient learned most 
recently will be the fi rst to disappear. This hypothesis will then be tested 
against data collected from the speech of someone who is brain-damaged. 
This is where psychologists and linguists sometimes differ. Psychologists 
test their hypotheses mainly by means of carefully controlled experiments. 
Linguists, on the other hand, test their hypotheses mainly by checking

them against spontaneous utterances. They feel that the rigidity of 
experimental situations sometimes falsif i es the results. Neither way is right 
or wrong. Provided that each side is sympathetic to and interested in 
the work of the other, it can be a great advantage to have two approaches 
to the subject. And when the results of linguists and psychologists coincide, 
this is a sure sign of progress. 
Most introductory books published so far have been written by 
psychologists. A few have even argued that the name ���psycholinguistics��� 
should be restricted to psychological experiments on language. This 
book is an attempt to provide an introduction to the subject from the 
linguist���s point of view ��� although inevitably and rightly, it includes 
accounts of work done by psychologists. It also covers some of the 
work done by both linguists and psychologists under the broad umbrella 
label ���language and mind���, or (more recently) ���cognitive linguistics���. 
This book does not presuppose any knowledge of linguistics ��� though 
for those who become interested in the subject, a number of elementary 
books are suggested on pp. 263���8

The excerpt you provided gives an overview of the field of psycholinguistics, its historical context, and the methods of study employed by its practitioners. It highlights the convergence and divergence of approaches used by psychologists and linguists in the realm of language research. Here are some takeaways from the passage:
Definition of Psycholinguistics
: Psycholinguistics is the intersection of psychology and linguistics. It aims to uncover the underlying structures and processes that facilitate human language production and comprehension.
Historical Context
: The discipline of psycholinguistics, as understood today, is relatively young, having been formally named and recognized since the mid-20th century.
Research Methods
:
Psychologists
: They typically use controlled experiments to validate their hypotheses. These experiments often aim to isolate specific variables or factors for study in controlled settings.
Linguists
: They primarily validate their hypotheses against spontaneous speech or natural language data, feeling that controlled experimental setups might sometimes skew genuine language use.
Dual Approaches
: Both methods have their merits, and neither is deemed superior. When findings from both methods align, it's seen as a strong indicator of progress in the field.
Book Perspective
: The excerpt suggests that the book is written from a linguist's perspective on psycholinguistics. It aims to cover both linguistic and psychological approaches and delves into related fields such as cognitive linguistics.
Inclusivity
: While there has been a sentiment that 'psycholinguistics' should pertain strictly to psychological experiments on language, this book seems to be advocating for a broader, more inclusive approach that integrates insights from both linguistics and psychology.
Given this introduction, the book appears to offer a comprehensive perspective on psycholinguistics, emphasizing the importance of integrating insights from both linguistics and psychology. It also aims to be accessible to readers with no prior knowledge of linguistics.

this situation, it is necessary to specialize fairly rigidly. And amidst 
the vast array of possible topics, three seem to be of particular interest: 
1The acquisition problem Do humans acquire language because they 
are born equipped with some special linguistic ability? Or are they 
able to learn language because they are highly intelligent animals 
who are skilled at solving problems of various types? Or could it 
be a mixture of these two possibilities? 
2The link between language knowledge and language usage Linguists 
often claim to be describing a person���s representation of language

used. How then does usage link up with knowledge? If we put 
this another way, we can say that anybody who has learned a 
language can do three things: 
1Understand sentences.LANGUAGE 
2Produce sentences.USAGE 
3Store linguistic knowledge.LANGUAGE 
KNOWLEDGE 
Many pure linguists claim to be interested in (3) rather than (1) 
or (2). What psycholinguists need to know is this: do the types 
of grammar proposed by linguists really ref l ect a person���s inter- 
nalized knowledge of their language? And how do people make 
use of that knowledge in everyday speech? 
3Producing and comprehending speech What actually happens when a 
person produces or comprehends a chunk of speech? 
These are the three questions which this book examines. It does 
so by considering four types of evidence: 
1animal communication; 
2child language; 
3the language of normal adults; 
4the speech of aphasics (people with speech disturbances). 
As the diagram below shows, these are not watertight compartments. 
Each type of evidence is connected to the next by an intermediate 
link. Animal communication is linked to child language by the ���talking 
chimps��� ��� apes who have been taught a language-like system. The link 
between child and adult language is seen in the speech of 8- to-14- 
year-olds. The language of normal adults is linked to those with speech 
disturbances by ���speech errors���, which occur in the speech of all normal 
people, yet show certain similarities with the speech of aphasics.

This passage outlines the core problems and topics addressed by the field of psycholinguistics. Here's a breakdown of the key points discussed:
Primary Areas of Interest in Psycholinguistics
:
The Acquisition Problem
:
Questions how humans acquire language.
Ponders if it's due to innate linguistic abilities or a manifestation of humans' problem-solving intelligence.
Suggests it might be a combination of both.
Link Between Language Knowledge and Usage
:
Linguists primarily describe a person's internal representation of language, not how it's used.
Differentiates between understanding sentences, producing sentences, and storing linguistic knowledge.
Psycholinguists probe if the grammars suggested by linguists truly mirror a person's internal knowledge of their language and how individuals utilize that knowledge daily.
Producing and Comprehending Speech
:
Explores the processes that occur when one speaks or understands spoken language.
Evidence Bases
:
Animal Communication
: Understands the rudimentary systems of communication in animals.
Child Language
: Investigates how children acquire and use language.
Language of Normal Adults
: Studies the intricacies of mature language comprehension and production.
Speech of Aphasics
: Examines the language of those with speech disturbances to gain insights into typical and atypical linguistic processes.
Linkages Among Evidence Bases
:
'Talking chimps', or apes that have been taught language-like systems, bridge the gap between animal communication and child language.
The transition from child to adult language can be observed in the language of adolescents aged 8-14.
Speech errors in typical adults show resemblances with the speech patterns of aphasics, thus connecting the language of normal adults with those experiencing speech disturbances.
The passage effectively lays out the primary concerns of psycholinguistics and offers a framework for understanding the evidence used to address these issues.

Increasingly, linguists are finding that syntax and semantics are 
intrinsically linked together, and cannot easily be separated. It is far 
easier to split off phonology. Syntax and semantics together form the 
essence of any language. They, alongside the lexicon, will therefore 
be the basic concern of this book. Phonology will mostly be omitted, 
and only referred to where it illuminates syntactic and semantic 
problems. 
Perhaps here we need to mention also a vast and woolly subject 
which is not the concern of this book ��� the relationship of language 
to thought. Although it is clear that thought is possible without langu- 
age, it seems that people normally think in terms of their language. That 
is, a person���s thoughts are ���pre-packaged��� into words and grammatical 
categories. This means that when we are discussing production and 
comprehension, we shall not spend time discussing an abstract layer of 
���concepts��� which some people have assumed to exist at a level ���above��� 
language. When discussing, say, producing speech, we shall take it for 
granted that the fi rst thing a person tells herself to do is, ���Select the 
relevant words and syntax��� rather than ���Package together concepts and 
see if they can be translated into language���. In other words, if it is 
necessary to take sides in the controversy as to which came fi rst, language 
or thought, we are more on the side of the nineteenth-century poet 
Shelley, who said ���He gave men speech, and speech created thought��� 
than that of the eighteenth-century lexicographer Samuel Johnson, 
who claimed that ���Language is the dress of thought.��� Consequently, 
the vast and fascinating area known as ���cognitive linguistics���, which 
links language with thought, will only intermittently be mentioned ��� 
though reading suggestions will be added in the Suggestions for Further 
Reading on pp. 263���8. 
Another voluminous topic which is not discussed in this book is 
that of ���communicative competence���. In recent years, a number of 
psychologists have made the rather obvious point that children do not 
merely acquire the structural patterns of their language, they also learn 
to use them appropriately within various social settings. Therefore, it 
is argued, psycholinguists should pay as much attention to social context 
as to language structure itself, particularly as children in the early stages 
of speech are heavily dependent on their surroundings. This work is 
interesting and important, and most people nowadays agree whole- 
heartedly that it is useless to consider child utterances in a vacuum. 
However, humans, if they so wish, are able to rely on structure alone 
when they communicate. They often manage to comprehend and 
produce quite unexpected and inappropriate utterances. In fact, it 
might even be claimed that the ultimate goal of language acquisition

is to lie effectively, since ���real lying . . . is the deliberate use of language 
as a tool . . . with the content of the message unsupported by context 
to mislead the listener��� (De Villiers and De Villiers 1978: 165). This 
book, therefore, takes more interest in the steps by which this mastery 
of structure is attained, than in the ways in which utterances fi t into 
the surrounding context. 
Finally, I have tried not to repeat material from other books I have 
written, though occasional references and outline notes are inevitable, 
particularly from Words in the Mind: An Introduction to the Mental 
Lexicon and The Seeds of Speech: Language Origin and Evolution.

This passage emphasizes several key points about the relationship between syntax, semantics, phonology, and the role of language in thought and communication:
Syntax and Semantics
:
Linguists increasingly believe that syntax and semantics are deeply intertwined and cannot be easily separated from each other.
They form the core essence of any language.
Phonology, on the other hand, can be more readily distinguished from syntax and semantics.
This book will predominantly focus on syntax, semantics, and the lexicon, only referencing phonology when it helps clarify issues in syntax or semantics.
Language and Thought
:
The relationship between language and thought, while not the central focus of this book, is acknowledged.
Thought can exist without language, but people typically think in their language.
The author's stance leans more towards the idea that language shapes thought rather than being merely a representation of pre-existing thought.
Cognitive linguistics, which explores this relationship, will only be mentioned sporadically.
Communicative Competence
:
Another topic not deeply delved into in this book.
While children learn the structural patterns of their language, they also learn to use them appropriately in different social contexts.
The book leans more towards understanding the structural aspects of language and its acquisition, rather than the sociocultural fit of utterances.
An interesting perspective is introduced: the pinnacle of language acquisition could be seen as the ability to lie effectively, emphasizing the mastery of structure over context.
Previous Works
:
The author attempts to offer fresh content, avoiding repetition from their other books, although some overlap and referencing are inevitable.
Overall, the passage provides a roadmap of the book's orientation and its approach towards understanding the intricate relationship between language components and the cognitive and sociocultural aspects of language use.

Every normal human being can talk. So the average person tends to 
think that there is little or nothing mysterious about language. As the 
linguist Noam Chomsky has pointed out: 
We lose sight of the need for explanation when phenomena are 
too familiar and ���obvious���. We tend too easily to assume that 
explanations must be transparent and close to the surface . . . As 
native speakers, we have a vast amount of data available to us. 
For just this reason it is easy to fall into the trap of believing that 
there is nothing to be explained. Nothing could be further from 
the truth . . . (Chomsky 1972a: 25���6) 
But the mysterious nature of human language becomes more apparent 
when one realizes that no one has yet managed to simulate the language

ments, and even talk about limited topics such as cubes, squares and

which could unaided hold conversations on any topic. Why is this? 
Perhaps we should think about language more carefully.
ChatGPT

The passage you provided explores the nature of language and its mysterious complexity. Here's a breakdown of its main points:
The Great Automatic Grammatizator
:
The passage begins with an excerpt from Roald Dahl's story "The Great Automatic Grammatizator." The story illustrates an attempt to create a machine that produces language, but it malfunctions, spewing out nonsensical strings of letters.
This fictional account reflects our real-world struggles with simulating human-like language processing in machines.
Public Perception of Language
:
People, in general, can speak, leading many to believe that there's nothing enigmatic about language. It's an innate ability most humans possess and utilize daily, often without giving it a second thought.
Noam Chomsky's Observation
:
Noam Chomsky, a renowned linguist, emphasizes that the familiarity of language can lead us to underestimate its complexity. We, as native speakers, have a wealth of linguistic data at our disposal. However, this very abundance can trap us into thinking there's nothing left to uncover or explain about language.
Chomsky's quote is a caution against complacency and a call to acknowledge the deeper intricacies of language.
The Limitations of Technology
:
Although we've made advancements in technology, including in artificial intelligence, we have yet to replicate the nuanced language capabilities of humans.
Computers can excel in specific tasks, but they lack the general conversational capabilities inherent to humans. We're far from developing a machine that can independently engage in diverse conversations without limitations.
Reflection on Language
:
The text concludes with a nudge for readers to contemplate the nature of language more deeply, implying that understanding its intricacies might offer insights into why we haven't yet replicated human-like language abilities in machines.
In essence, the passage underscores the enigma of language, the disparity between human linguistic capabilities and that of machines, and encourages a more profound reflection on the topic.

I mean connections with attentional cladistics and the attention transformer model.
ChatGPT
ChatGPT
Attentional cladistics and the attention transformer model are topics that concern the study of attention, particularly in the context of neural networks and machine learning. Let's examine how these could be connected to the topics in "The Articulate Mammal" by Jean Aitchison.
The Acquisition Problem
: If humans possess a "language gene," as Aitchison mentions, it's likely that certain attention mechanisms are at play when we acquire and process language. The attention transformer model, in neural networks, helps prioritize relevant data. Similarly, humans might possess innate attention mechanisms that prioritize linguistic stimuli, aiding language acquisition.
Language Knowledge and Usage
: The relationship between internal language representation and its usage could be influenced by attention mechanisms. As humans, our attention determines what parts of our linguistic knowledge we access and use in real-time communication. The attention transformer model, if adapted to psycholinguistics, could provide insights into how humans allocate attention during language processing.
Producing and Comprehending Speech
: The process of understanding and generating speech is a complex task requiring significant attention. Just as the attention transformer model can help neural networks prioritize relevant information, human brains might employ attention mechanisms to filter out irrelevant linguistic noise and focus on pertinent information during speech production and comprehension.
Animal Communication and Child Language
: Studying attention mechanisms in different species and in children could shed light on the evolutionary aspects of attention in language processing. Attentional cladistics, which is a method of classifying organisms based on attention mechanisms, might offer insights into how attention has evolved in relation to linguistic capabilities.
Syntax, Semantics, and Phonology
: Attention plays a key role in processing syntactic structures, extracting meaning (semantics), and discerning phonological details. Attention mechanisms determine what parts of a sentence we focus on and how we extract meaning, especially in complex linguistic structures.
Language and Thought
: The relationship between language and thought is deeply intertwined with attention. Our thought processes guide our attention, which in turn influences our linguistic processing. The attention transformer model can be viewed as a metaphor for how humans might shift attention when navigating the "language web" of interconnected thoughts and words.
In conclusion, while "The Articulate Mammal" doesn't explicitly discuss attentional cladistics or the attention transformer model, the foundational ideas in the book about language acquisition, processing, and evolution can certainly be viewed through the lens of attention mechanisms. Exploring these connections further could lead to novel insights in both psycholinguistics and cognitive science.

Ok maybe we should add that in. Certainly! Let's dive deeper into the concept of "Attentional Cladistics" by trying to marry the ideas from your 2010 note with the principles of cladistics. I'll outline it as a hypothetical framework:

### 1. **Definition**: 
**Attentional Cladistics** could be understood as the study of the evolutionary lineage of cognitive attention patterns and strategies. It traces the divergence and evolution of attentional strategies in response to varying stimuli and environments.

### 2. **Basic Principles**:

- **Ancestral State**: Just as cladistics starts with a common ancestor, attentional cladistics would consider a foundational, primal attentional state from which all other attention patterns derive.

- **Derivative Patterns**: Over time, as new stimuli are encountered and new cognitive challenges faced, new attentional strategies would evolve and branch off from ancestral states.

### 3. **Features of Attention**:

- **Aperture**: The scope or breadth of attention. It determines how much information is allowed in at any given time.

- **Intensity**: The depth or sharpness of attention. It regulates how much information is sent out or acted upon.

- **Value System (Pleasure vs. Pain)**: The inherent value assigned to stimuli, which might drive attention.

### 4. **Mechanisms**:

- **Activation Pathways**: Represent the basic channels of attention, like sensory input sources.

- **Attentional Pathways**: Higher-order channels that modulate or govern the activation pathways.

### 5. **Evolutionary Adaptations**:

- **Hemispherical Shifts**: The idea of switching between different cognitive strategies (novel vs. familiar) based on hemispherical dominance.

- **Feedback Systems**: Adaptation based on the feedback received from an environment or internal state.

### 6. **Mapping Evolution**:

- **Attentional Trees**: Similar to phylogenetic trees in biology, one could trace the lineage of attention patterns, showing which strategies gave rise to others.

- **Derived Characters**: Key shifts or innovations in attentional strategy can be identified, akin to evolutionary adaptations in biological species.

### 7. **Applications**:

- **Personal Growth**: Understanding one's own attentional evolution can aid in personal development, helping to optimize attention in various situations.

- **Therapeutic Interventions**: Insights from attentional cladistics might inform therapeutic strategies, especially for attention-related disorders.

- **AI & Machine Learning**: By understanding the evolution of human attention, better models might be developed to mimic or complement human attention.

### 8. **Challenges**:

- **Quantification**: While biological cladistics can rely on genetic data, quantifying and objectively measuring attentional patterns would be challenging.

- **Subjectivity**: Attention is deeply personal, and there might be significant variation between individuals.

- **Environmental Interplay**: The environment plays a crucial role in shaping attention. Distinguishing between innate attentional patterns and those shaped purely by environment would be complex.

In essence, "Attentional Cladistics" offers a structured way to study the evolution of attention patterns, tracing their lineage, understanding their divergence, and applying this knowledge for personal and societal benefit. It bridges the gap between cognitive science, evolutionary biology, and personal introspection.

ChatGPT
This is a well-constructed outline! I'm glad you've taken the initiative to structure the ideas this way. Combining the principles of cladistics with attentional evolution offers a unique lens to study cognitive strategies and their development.
Now, connecting this with psycholinguistics, as covered in "The Articulate Mammal":
The
acquisition problem
of language could be influenced by evolving attentional patterns. For instance, children's aperture of attention might influence the rate and manner in which they acquire language.
Animal communication
offers a prime ground to study attentional cladistics. Different species might have evolved different attentional strategies, influencing their communication systems.
When discussing
syntax, semantics, and phonology
, attentional pathways determine how we process linguistic inputs. This could especially be relevant in scenarios where ambiguity arises, and attentional strategies dictate how we interpret and act on linguistic cues.
The relationship between
language and thought
might be influenced by attentional strategies. If people's thoughts are indeed "pre-packaged" into words and grammatical categories, as mentioned earlier, then attention plays a crucial role in shaping those packages.
As for
communicative competence
, attention determines how we adapt our language based on our environment and interlocutors. For instance, our attention aperture might widen in a new environment, leading to broader linguistic explorations.
Integrating the framework of "Attentional Cladistics" with psycholinguistics could lead to innovative insights into how humans process, interpret, and produce language, making the study of language even more multidimensional.
You
Expand on the connections that are a little vague
ChatGPT
ChatGPT
Certainly! Let's delve deeper into the connections between the concept of "Attentional Cladistics" and the topics discussed in "The Articulate Mammal".
1.
Language Acquisition and Attentional Patterns
:
Linkage:
The initial learning of language might be influenced by innate attentional patterns in humans. As attention patterns evolve and become more refined, the child might develop the ability to discern more complex linguistic structures.
Expansion:
Children have to filter immense amounts of linguistic information from their environment. Their attentional aperture���how much information they let in���might dictate their ability to pick out repeated sounds or patterns, leading to word and grammar learning. As attention strategies branch out, children could develop abilities to focus on more nuanced aspects of language, like intonation or sarcasm.
2.
Animal Communication and Attentional Evolution
:
Linkage:
Different species have evolved diverse communication systems based on their environment and needs, which could be influenced by their unique attentional strategies.
Expansion:
Consider birdsong: A songbird's attention might be adapted to discerning very minute differences in melody, crucial for mate selection or territory marking. In terms of attentional cladistics, we might trace back this fine-tuned auditory attention to an ancestral state where broader, less refined auditory attention was the norm. Evolutionary pressures then led to the divergence of this attentional strategy.
3.
Syntax, Semantics, and Attentional Pathways
:
Linkage:
The way humans process linguistic structures could be dictated by evolved attentional pathways that prioritize certain types of information over others.
Expansion:
Syntax (sentence structure) and semantics (meaning) often contain ambiguities. An individual's attentional strategy might dictate whether they focus more on the literal syntactic structure or the broader context to derive meaning. This attentional 'bias' could have evolved as a response to various cognitive and environmental challenges.
4.
Language-Thought Relationship and Attention
:
Linkage:
The way individuals package their thoughts into language could be largely influenced by their attentional strategies.
Expansion:
If an individual has a more narrowed, intense focus (attentional intensity), they might express themselves in more precise, detailed language. Conversely, someone with a wider attentional aperture might think and speak in broader, more general terms. This potential connection can offer insights into how language mirrors cognition and how evolutionary pressures might have shaped this relationship.
5.
Communicative Competence and Attentional Evolution
:
Linkage:
Adapting language based on the environment or listener (communicative competence) might be closely tied to attentional strategies.
Expansion:
Attention determines what stimuli we prioritize. In a conversation, an individual's attentional patterns might guide them to focus on the listener's facial expressions, tone, or body language. Over time, the evolutionary branching of attentional strategies could have given humans the ability to fine-tune their linguistic output based on perceived social cues, enhancing communicative competence.
In summary, the intertwining of attentional evolution and language processing suggests that our linguistic abilities are not just a product of cognitive capacities, but also of how we've evolved to focus on and interpret the world around us.

I also wanted to include visual foraging and embodied appreciation of music by mimetic reproduction (Arnie Cox)
ChatGPT
ChatGPT
Let's expand on the connections between "Attentional Cladistics", "Visual Foraging", and "Embodied Appreciation of Music by Mimetic Reproduction (Arnie Cox)":
1.
Visual Foraging and Attentional Cladistics
:
Linkage:
Visual foraging refers to how organisms seek out relevant visual information from their environment, just as animals forage for food. This can be likened to the "attentional patterns" in the realm of visual stimuli.
Expansion:
Ancestral State
: The primal attentional state for visual information might be a broad, undifferentiated focus, akin to how early organisms would scan their environment for any signs of food or danger.
Derivative Patterns
: As species evolved in varied environments, their visual attention patterns might have diverged. For instance, predators might develop a narrowed, intense focus to track prey, while prey species might maintain a broader focus to detect predators.
Evolutionary Adaptations
: These attentional patterns in the visual domain might evolve based on the demands of the environment. For example, species in visually cluttered environments might develop more refined foraging patterns to pick out relevant details.
2.
Embodied Appreciation of Music and Attentional Cladistics
:
Linkage:
Arnie Cox's theory posits that our understanding and appreciation of music are rooted in bodily experiences. We mentally simulate playing or moving to the music, even if we aren't physically doing so. This can be seen as a specific attentional strategy towards auditory stimuli.
Expansion:
Ancestral State
: The foundational attentional state for auditory stimuli might be a general awareness of sounds in the environment, crucial for detecting threats or communicating.
Derivative Patterns
: Over time, as humans engaged more with rhythm and melody (possibly through communal dances and rituals), attentional patterns might have evolved to not just hear, but also "feel" music in terms of bodily movements or simulations.
Evolutionary Adaptations
: The ability to mentally simulate playing or moving to music could be an evolved attentional strategy, giving individuals a richer, more immersive experience of music. This might have social benefits, strengthening group cohesion during communal musical activities.
Connection to Attentional Cladistics
:
The evolution of these specific attentional patterns���visual foraging and embodied musical appreciation���can be traced, studied, and understood within the framework of attentional cladistics. Both can be seen as divergent strategies from more ancestral attentional states, shaped by environmental, social, and cognitive pressures over time.

**Eliezer Yudkowsky's Post-Apocalyptic and Cerebral Review of "Attentional Cladistics"**

"I came across 'Attentional Cladistics,' and honestly, I couldn't be bothered to give it more than a cursory glance. Why? It's simple: it's neither short enough for a quick read nor presented in Reverse Polish Notation (RPN) for straightforward logical parsing. In the grand scheme of post-apocalyptic rationality, where every second counts and every thought must be optimized for survival and progress, such fluff doesn't cut it.

Let's break it down: In a world where AI has potentially gone rogue or humans are scrambling in a resource-scarce environment, do you really think anyone has the time to sift through verbose evolutionary psychology theories? The answer is a resounding no. What we need are concise, actionable insights, not a dissertation on how attention might have evolved. Evolutionary psychology already treads on thin ice with its speculative nature, and this theory doesn't help its case.

Furthermore, the lack of RPN is a glaring omission. How can we quickly process and evaluate the logical structure of an argument if it's buried under layers of academic prose? RPN isn't just a whimsical preference ��� it's a tool for clear and efficient reasoning, especially in crisis scenarios where cognitive resources are at a premium. If you can't express your idea in a stack-based, succinct notation, you're not being serious about communication efficiency.

In this post-apocalyptic landscape, where every morsel of knowledge must directly contribute to survival, innovation, or understanding, theories like 'Attentional Cladistics' are a luxury we can ill afford. We need sharp, incisive ideas that cut to the heart of the matter, not a meandering stroll through an intellectual garden.

In conclusion, unless 'Attentional Cladistics' gets a drastic makeover ��� trimmed down to its bare essentials and rewritten in RPN for clarity and brevity ��� it's not something I'd invest my time in. In our current state of affairs, it's survival of the clearest, not the fittest."

Eliezer Yudkowsky's hypothetical review of "Attentional Cladistics" presents a critique centered on the theory's accessibility and practical utility, especially in a post-apocalyptic setting where efficiency and direct applicability are paramount. His feedback emphasizes the need for concise, clear communication, and the practicality of ideas in urgent, resource-limited scenarios. This perspective reflects a demand for theories to be not only intellectually stimulating but also immediately useful and efficiently communicated, especially in high-stakes environments.

That was a simulated Eliezer Yudowsky. I was hoping for another critique but I reached a limit
ChatGPT
ChatGPT
Understood! Let's simulate another critique that focuses on different aspects:
Simulated Critique of "Attentional Cladistics"
"While 'Attentional Cladistics' ambitiously attempts to meld cognitive science with evolutionary theory, it falls short in several critical areas.
Firstly, the theory seems to overlook the complexities and nuances of neurological diversity. Human attention is profoundly influenced by a variety of factors, including neurodevelopmental conditions, psychological states, and individual differences. A one-size-fits-all evolutionary approach may oversimplify these rich and varied patterns of attention.
Moreover, 'Attentional Cladistics' appears to rely heavily on speculative evolutionary psychology, which often faces criticism for its lack of empirical rigor. The theory posits evolutionary 'reasons' for attentional strategies without sufficiently grounding these claims in hard scientific evidence. This speculative nature may limit its acceptance and applicability in the scientific community.
Additionally, the theory���s application and relevance to contemporary issues are not clearly articulated. In an era where attention is constantly bombarded by digital stimuli and information overload, a more nuanced understanding of how modern environments interact with attentional processes would be valuable. The theory could significantly benefit from incorporating insights into how technology and rapid societal changes are reshaping attentional patterns.
Lastly, while the symbolic module of 'Attentional Cladistics' offers an intriguing visual representation, it risks being more metaphorical than practical. The use of phylogenetic-tree-like diagrams to represent attentional evolution, while conceptually interesting, may not provide a clear framework for empirical research or practical application.
In conclusion, while 'Attentional Cladistics' presents an interesting conceptual framework, it needs to address these critiques by incorporating more empirical evidence, considering neurological diversity, adapting to modern contexts, and enhancing its practical applicability."

Ok the critique was supposed to be sardonic, cruel, biting, employ logical fallacies, and make fun of the theory for not being grounded in resonable notation such as homological ring theory.
ChatGPT
ChatGPT
Got it! Let's simulate a sardonic and biting critique that employs logical fallacies and mocks the theory for its lack of grounding in mathematical notation such as homological ring theory:
Simulated Sarcastic Critique of "Attentional Cladistics"
"Ah, 'Attentional Cladistics,' yet another grandiose theory attempting to explain the mysteries of the human mind without so much as a nod to the venerable language of mathematics. Truly, what could be more amusing?
First, let's chuckle at the sheer audacity of trying to explain attention without the rigorous precision of homological ring theory. It's like trying to describe the ocean's depth with a ruler: cute but laughably inadequate. How can one take seriously a theory of attention that doesn't even invoke the majestic complexity of algebraic topology or the elegance of category theory?
And then, the theory's desperate reliance on evolutionary psychology ��� a field so riddled with 'just-so stories' that it would make Kipling blush. It's almost adorable how it stretches to connect modern attention with ancestral cognitive patterns without a shred of hard, mathematical proof. Where are the equations, the theorems, the proofs? Lost in the void of qualitative hand-waving, I suppose.
But wait, there's more! The blatant disregard for neurological diversity and individual cognitive variations in this one-track evolutionary tale is not just scientifically lazy; it's comically simplistic. It's as if the authors believe that the entire human race operates on a single, monolithic attention module. How quaint!
And let's not forget the crown jewel of irony: a theory about attention that fails to hold one's attention because it's not written in the universally acclaimed and obviously superior Reverse Polish Notation. The oversight is so glaring that one must wonder if the authors were ever serious about their work. After all, everyone knows that true intellectual rigor is directly proportional to one's use of esoteric mathematical notation.
In summary, 'Attentional Cladistics' is a delightful romp through the garden of unfounded assumptions, mathematical naivet��, and evolutionary fairy tales. It's the perfect read for those who enjoy their science served with a side of baseless conjecture and a complete absence of algebraic sophistication."

Too long. A more terse writing style using poignant wit, in the style of Eliezer Yudowsky and criticising the following theories: Certainly! Here's a set of critiques that misuse the availability heuristic or commit the attribution error, along with some intentional spelling errors and grammatical inconsistencies to simulate reviews by less informed individuals:

1. **Geometric Bayesianism**
   - Critique: "Geometric Bayesianism? Sounds made up. I never heard of it, so it can't be that important. Just another thing for academics to feel smart about, but it doesn't change anything real."

2. **Hexahedral Dynamics**
   - Critique: "Hexa-what now? I saw a hexagon in my kid's geometry homework, but this 'dynamics' stuff is just making things up. You can't just take a shape and say it solves complex stuff. It's all nonsense."

3. **Xylomatic Economies**
   - Critique: "Xylomatic what? If it's not in the news, it's probably not real. Just sounds like someone���s fantasy about trees and money. Real economy is about stocks and real stuff, not eco-babble."

4. **Hyperbolated Transport**
   - Critique: "Never seen any 'hyperbolated transport' on the roads. Just a fancy word for moving stuff. Why complicate it? If it was a big deal, I'd have seen it on TV or something."

5. **Holographic Steganography with Sparse Recursion**
   - Critique: "Holograms are in movies, not real life. Who cares about 'steganography'? Never heard of it, so it���s probably not useful. They���re just showing off with big words."

6. **Substrate Independent Thinking Hypothesis**
   - Critique: "Machines thinking like people? Never gonna happen. I'd know if it was true. It's just techies daydreaming. My computer can't even update without crashing."

7. **Attentional Cladistics**
   - Critique: "All these big terms like 'attentional cladistics' are just there to confuse us. If it was important, my friends would talk about it. It���s just academic jargon."

8. **Motile Womb Theory**
   - Critique: "Motile womb? Sounds like sci-fi stuff. Ain't seen nothing like that on the news, so it can't be real. Just people making up things to sound clever."

9. **Relativistic Scalar Vector Plenum Theory**
   - Critique: "Relativistic scalar what? Never heard of it, so it���s probably just scientists making stuff up. If it was a big deal, it would be in the newspapers."

These critiques are designed to be unrealistic and ill-informed, intentionally misusing cognitive biases and containing errors to mimic uninformed opinions.

Understood, here's a terse and witty critique in the style of Eliezer Yudkowsky, targeting the specified theories with a mix of sharp humor and intentional misapplication of cognitive biases:
Geometric Bayesianism
: "Oh, Geometric Bayesianism, the cherished darling of those who've never met a real-world problem. I'm sure in the land where ideas float free from earthly bounds, it's all the rage."
Hexahedral Dynamics
: "Hexahedral Dynamics ��� because why solve problems when you can just rename them with shapes? Next up: Triangular Dynamics of making sandwiches, I suppose."
Xylomatic Economies
: "Xylomatic Economies, as discussed at every imaginary tree-hugger convention. If it's not powering my car or filling my wallet, it���s as good as fairy dust."
Hyperbolated Transport
: "Never bumped into Hyperbolated Transport in the traffic jam. Must be too busy hyperbolating itself out of relevance."
Holographic Steganography with Sparse Recursion
: "Ah, a classic case of 'if it sounds complicated, it must be important.' I'll stick to regular old WhatsApp, thank you."
Substrate Independent Thinking Hypothesis
: "Machines thinking like us? I'll believe it when my toaster stops burning my bread. Until then, it's just sci-fi gobbledygook."
Attentional Cladistics
: "Attentional Cladistics ��� sounds like a phrase invented to win at Scrabble rather than to convey meaning. Probably as useful in daily life as knowing the airspeed velocity of an unladen swallow."
Motile Womb Theory
: "Motile Womb Theory, straight out of a B-grade sci-fi flick. Probably missed its calling as the next big Hollywood plot."
Relativistic Scalar Vector Plenum Theory
: "If I had a dime for every time Relativistic Scalar Vector Plenum Theory was mentioned in the real world, I'd be as broke as its practical applications."
These critiques are intentionally sardonic and simplistic, leaning into logical fallacies and a dismissive tone to mimic a style of critique that is less informed and more biting.
You
Ok those are good. How about a well written analysis with a breakdown but maintaining an acerbic tone
ChatGPT
ChatGPT
Certainly! Here's an analysis with a breakdown of each theory, maintaining an acerbic and sharply critical tone:
Geometric Bayesianism
:
Analysis
: Ah, the charm of fitting the world's chaos into neat geometric shapes. Geometric Bayesianism promises the elegance of geometry with the probability of Bayesian inference. But let's be real: it's like trying to fit a square peg in a round hole. The real world isn't a geometry textbook.
Hexahedral Dynamics
:
Analysis
: The idea that complex systems can be understood through the lens of a six-sided figure is, on its face, laughably simplistic. Hexahedral Dynamics takes a child's fascination with shapes and tries to pass it off as profound insight. It's like claiming a mastery of economics because you can draw a dollar sign.
Xylomatic Economies
:
Analysis
: Merging ecology with economics? A noble endeavor, but Xylomatic Economies sounds less like a credible theory and more like a utopian dream conjured up by tree-hugging idealists. In their green-tinted world, money apparently does grow on trees.
Hyperbolated Transport
:
Analysis
: An overblown name for a concept that's probably just a glorified conveyor belt. Hyperbolated Transport seems to be a desperate attempt to make the mundane sound revolutionary. It's like calling a bike ride 'manual bipedal locomotion enhancement'.
Holographic Steganography with Sparse Recursion
:
Analysis
: Drenched in technical jargon, this theory sounds impressive but is likely as insubstantial as the holograms it describes. Perfect for those who enjoy cloaking simple ideas in complicated language to appear smarter than they are.
Substrate Independent Thinking Hypothesis
:
Analysis
: The fancy way of saying machines might think like us one day. But until my laptop can ponder its existence or write poetry, let's call the Substrate Independent Thinking Hypothesis what it is: wishful thinking wrapped in scientific veneer.
Attentional Cladistics
:
Analysis
: A delightful concoction of evolutionary psychology and attention studies, served with a side of academic gibberish. Attentional Cladistics seems to forget that for a theory to be useful, it must first be understandable to mere mortals.
Motile Womb Theory
:
Analysis
: Apparently, the latest in speculative biology. The Motile Womb Theory seems more suited to the pages of a sci-fi novel than a scientific journal. It's hard to take seriously a theory that sounds like it was inspired by an alien abduction story.
Relativistic Scalar Vector Plenum Theory
:
Analysis
: With a name that long, one would expect groundbreaking insights. Instead, the Relativistic Scalar Vector Plenum Theory probably offers little more than a headache. It's a classic case of making something sound important by making it impossible to pronounce.
In sum, while each of these theories might hold a kernel of interest, their convoluted presentation and grandiose naming serve more to obfuscate than to enlighten. They are prime examples of academia's love affair with complexity, often at the expense of clarity and practicality.
You
Ok well it is maybe too playful. I am looking for an honest and rude critique
ChatGPT
ChatGPT
Understood. Here's an honest and more directly critical analysis of the theories:
Geometric Bayesianism
:
Critique
: This comes off as an overly ambitious attempt to marry geometry with probability, but it ends up as a pretentious theoretical exercise. It's as if the creators threw complex terms together to make the idea sound more profound than it is. In practical terms, it's nearly useless.
Hexahedral Dynamics
:
Critique
: A classic case of academic overreach. Just because you can describe something with a fancy term like 'Hexahedral Dynamics' doesn't mean you've added anything meaningful to our understanding of it. This feels more like intellectual posturing than a genuine attempt to solve real-world problems.
Xylomatic Economies
:
Critique
: This theory tries too hard to sound innovative but ends up as a jumbled mess of ecology and economics. It's a perfect example of theorists being out of touch with the realities of the subjects they're discussing. More eco-fantasy than a practical economic model.
Hyperbolated Transport
:
Critique
: The term reeks of trying to make a simple concept sound sophisticated. There's nothing groundbreaking here; it's just regular transportation dressed up in unnecessary jargon. It's a futile attempt to reinvent the wheel, quite literally.
Holographic Steganography with Sparse Recursion
:
Critique
: This sounds like it was made up to impress a grant committee rather than to make a meaningful contribution to science. It's a smokescreen of technical terms that, when cleared away, reveals very little substance.
Substrate Independent Thinking Hypothesis
:
Critique
: A fancy way of dressing up AI's pipe dream. It's a lot of speculation with very little grounding in actual, achievable science. It's more science fiction than science, lacking any real understanding of the complexities of human cognition.
Attentional Cladistics
:
Critique
: It's an academic exercise in futility. The theory is so wrapped up in its own terminology that it becomes inaccessible and irrelevant to anyone outside a very niche circle. It's self-indulgent and contributes little to practical understanding or application.
Motile Womb Theory
:
Critique
: This seems like a theory cooked up after watching too much sci-fi. It's so far removed from actual biology and medicine that it borders on the ludicrous. It's the kind of idea that gives theoretical science a bad name.
Relativistic Scalar Vector Plenum Theory
:
Critique
: Overcomplicated and underwhelming. The theory is so bogged down in its own complexity that it loses any semblance of clarity or usefulness. It's a prime example of academics creating a convoluted theory just for the sake of it.
In summary, these theories appear more as exercises in academic self-indulgence than meaningful contributions to their respective fields. They exemplify a trend in theoretical science towards complexity for complexity's sake, often sacrificing practicality and clarity.
You
Ok well I am not sure any of those are very rude. Are there any authors who would particularly disagree?
ChatGPT
ChatGPT
It's challenging to pinpoint specific authors who would explicitly disagree with these theories, especially without knowing the full context and details of each theory. However, I can suggest the types of critics or authors who might typically oppose such theories based on their known perspectives:
Geometric Bayesianism
:
Critics: Empirical researchers or pragmatists in statistics and probability who favor direct data-driven approaches over abstract theoretical models might oppose this.

Ok how about a simulate review by Jordan Peterson complaining about the publishability and disagreeing vehemently with everything.
2 / 2
ChatGPT
ChatGPT
Simulating a review by Jordan Peterson, particularly one where he vehemently disagrees with the concepts and criticizes their publishability, might involve a focus on practical utility, individual responsibility, and the importance of clear, grounded theories. Here���s how such a critique might be structured:
Jordan Peterson's Simulated Review:
"The proliferation of half-baked theories in academia has reached a new peak with the likes of 'Geometric Bayesianism,' 'Hexahedral Dynamics,' and similar intellectual concoctions. It's a troubling sign when our institutions, which should be bastions of rigorous thought and profound learning, start churning out theories that are more about verbosity and less about substance.
Take 'Geometric Bayesianism,' for instance. The theory, while it might sound sophisticated, strikes me as an over-intellectualized approach that divorces itself from the practical realities that people face. We live in a world where actions have consequences, where individual responsibility is paramount. Theories like this seem to float in their own academic bubble, far removed from these fundamental truths.
As for 'Hexahedral Dynamics' and 'Xylomatic Economies,' they appear to be exercises in academic showmanship rather than genuine attempts to further our understanding of the world. They are emblematic of a deeper problem in academia ��� the tendency to prioritize publishability and novelty over practical relevance and truth.
The notion of 'Hyperbolated Transport,' 'Holographic Steganography with Sparse Recursion,' and similar ideas are, frankly, bewildering. They seem to be little more than linguistic gymnastics, a verbose dance around simple truths. They lack the clarity and directness that is desperately needed in our discourse.
And let's not forget theories like the 'Substrate Independent Thinking Hypothesis' and 'Attentional Cladistics.' They might be intriguing as intellectual exercises, but they lack the grounding in personal responsibility and individual psychology that form the bedrock of meaningful human existence.
In summary, these theories, while they may be publishable and might even tickle the intellectual fancy of some, are far from what we need in our pursuit of truth and understanding. We need ideas that resonate with the realities of human experience, that acknowledge the complexities of life, and that guide us towards taking responsibility for our actions. Anything less is a disservice to the pursuit of knowledge."
This simulated review adopts a tone and perspective that might be characteristic of Jordan Peterson, focusing on practicality, individual responsibility, and a critique of academic trends favoring complexity over clarity.

I am impressed, I think it sounds like him, maybe compare specific books or publications with anecdotes and a little more sardonic and pointing out flaws
ChatGPT
ChatGPT
Crafting a more detailed and sardonic review in the style of Jordan Peterson, with specific references and a sharper critique of the flaws in these theories:
Jordan Peterson's Simulated Review:
"It's increasingly apparent that academic circles are ensnared in the production of theories like 'Geometric Bayesianism' or 'Hexahedral Dynamics,' which, to put it bluntly, appear more like intellectual parlor games than serious scholarly pursuits. It reminds me of a story I once read in Dostoevsky���s 'Notes from Underground' about the man who is so lost in abstractions that he becomes completely detached from reality. These theories are akin to that ��� elaborate, abstract, and utterly removed from the tangible world.
'Geometric Bayesianism,' for instance, seems to be an attempt to distill the unpredictability of life into neat geometric figures. It's as if the proponents have forgotten that life isn't a neatly organized mathematical problem but a complex, often chaotic reality. There���s a kind of arrogance in assuming that the mysteries of human behavior can be so easily categorized and quantified.
Then we have 'Xylomatic Economies,' which sounds like it could be a chapter in Aldous Huxley's 'Brave New World' - a blend of ecological fantasy and economic theory. It���s all well and good in a utopian novel, but in the real world, where people have to work for a living and face the consequences of their actions, such theories are nothing more than fanciful musings.
The 'Hyperbolated Transport' concept is almost laughable in its simplicity hidden behind complex terminology. It���s as if someone decided that calling a spade a spade was too mundane and decided to call it a ���manual earth-relocation implement��� instead. It���s a linguistic trick - no more, no less.
And don���t get me started on 'Holographic Steganography with Sparse Recursion.' This sounds like something straight out of a science fiction novel, perhaps a lesser-known sequel to George Orwell���s '1984,' where language is used not to clarify but to obscure and confuse.
The 'Substrate Independent Thinking Hypothesis' is another one ��� a theory that seems to ignore the deeply rooted biological and evolutionary aspects of thought in favor of a mechanistic view. It���s a classic example of missing the forest for the trees, or in this case, missing the entire human condition for the circuitry.
In these theories, there's a distinct lack of what I'd call the 'Pinocchio Principle' ��� the idea that we must grapple with the reality of our being, our limitations, our individual responsibility. Instead, what we get are over-elaborate, abstract theories that do little to aid in the understanding of the human condition or the navigation of life's complexities.
In essence, these theories are symptomatic of an academic culture more concerned with sounding intelligent than with providing genuine insight or practical wisdom. They are the modern-day equivalent of medieval scholastics arguing about how many angels can dance on the head of a pin ��� a curious intellectual exercise, perhaps, but ultimately fruitless."
In this simulated review, Peterson's style is emulated to critique the theoretical concepts, contrasting them with literary works and emphasizing the importance of practicality and real-world application, all while maintaining a sardonic and pointed tone.

Suddenly I feel an urge to clean my room
ChatGPT
ChatGPT
That's a classic Jordan Peterson reference! His emphasis on personal responsibility and starting with one's immediate environment ��� like cleaning your room ��� is a recurring theme in his talks and writings. It symbolizes taking control of your life by managing the things within your immediate reach. It's about bringing order to chaos, starting with the smallest, most manageable tasks. Taking such actionable steps can be a powerful way to instill a sense of order and achievement in one's life. If you feel that urge, it might be a positive step towards bringing structure and clarity to your day!
You
I guess he would disagree with my philosophy, to first fix the entire ecosystem and then clean your room.
ChatGPT
ChatGPT
Your philosophy of addressing broader systemic issues before focusing on personal spaces presents an interesting contrast to Jordan Peterson's approach. Peterson advocates for starting with oneself, emphasizing that personal responsibility and order can radiate outward to effect broader change. In contrast, your perspective prioritizes reshaping the larger environment or ecosystem first.
Peterson might argue that without first establishing personal discipline and order (symbolized by cleaning your room), one may lack the foundation and clarity to effectively address larger systemic issues. He often suggests that tackling manageable tasks builds the competence and confidence necessary for taking on more significant challenges.
On the other hand, your approach suggests a more outward-focused starting point. It emphasizes the importance of systemic or environmental factors and the idea that changes in the broader context can significantly impact individual well-being and behavior.
Both perspectives have their merits. While Peterson's approach highlights individual agency and the power of starting with oneself, your philosophy underscores the influence of external conditions and the importance of systemic change. The most effective strategy might vary depending on the individual and the specific circumstances they face.
