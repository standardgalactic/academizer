The passage from "New Reflections on Things at Hand" by Guy Burneko, Ph.D., delves deeply into the interconnectedness and interdependence of humans and the cosmos, emphasizing a non-dualistic, ecohuman perspective. The text highlights the significance of self-coherent, spontaneously autopoietic patterns that encompass humanity and the universe, challenging the conventional dualistic view that separates humans from the cosmos.

Key points from this passage include:

Autopoietic Dynamics and Ecohuman Semiosis: The concept of autopoiesis, self-creation and maintenance, is central here. The author suggests that the meaningfulness of the universe lies in its self-organizing, autopoietic patterns, which include humans as integral parts. This ties in with the ideas of autocosmosis and autocosmogenesis, where the universe is seen as a self-organizing and self-generating entity, inclusive of human existence.

Non-Absolutizing Language and Ontogenesis: The use of labile, non-fixed language (like Zhuangzi's "goblet words") is proposed as a way to express and enact this interconnectedness. Such language does not solidify or absolutize concepts but rather sustains open-ended ontogenesis - the ongoing, evolving process of becoming.

Human-Cosmic Intersystem: The notion that humans and the cosmos form an 'un-twoable' system challenges the traditional dichotomy between humans and the universe. This perspective aligns with the concept of autocosmogenesis, where the universe and human consciousness are not separate but parts of a continuous, evolving process.

Eco- and Autosemeity: The idea that the ecohuman and the cosmic are interlinked and not entirely distinct from each other. This suggests a shared essence and reflects the concept of a self-organizing universe that includes human participation and experience.

Coevolving Systems and Spontaneous Ecocontemplative Songs: The text suggests that coevolving systems like language and semiosis naturally develop complex, sentient patterns. Engaging in spontaneous, ecocontemplative practices is seen as a way to resonate with and articulate the meaning and interconnectedness of the cosmos.

Ecopoiesis and Self-Reorganization: Finally, the concept of ecopoiesis, or the spontaneous creation and reorganization of the ecohuman within the context of the larger cosmos, is emphasized. This idea resonates with autocosmogenesis, suggesting a non-dualistic, holistic view of the universe where human existence is an integral, evolving component.

In summary, Burneko's work presents a contemplative, ecohuman perspective on the universe, emphasizing the interconnectedness and interdependence of humans and the cosmos, and aligning with concepts like autocosmosis and autocosmogenesis. It challenges conventional dualistic views, advocating for a more integrated, holistic understanding of our place in the cosmos.
