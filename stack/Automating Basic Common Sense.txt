ChatGPT
Your idea is conceptually similar to the concept of literate programming, pioneered by Donald Knuth. In literate programming, code is written as a readable narrative that combines both programming logic and human language. The aim is to make the code self-explanatory, allowing someone else (or your future self) to understand not just what the code does, but also why it does it that way.
By documenting your reasoning or explaining it to someone else, you're essentially doing something similar: you're making your thought process transparent and understandable, which can help both you and others follow along and potentially improve upon it.

Explain that a boltzman brain is really just a name for any configuration of atoms that can contemplate its place in the universe. They range from slime molds to mice to black hole networks communicating through halo lasers.
1 / 1
ChatGPT
A Boltzmann brain is a term that refers to any configuration of atoms capable of contemplating its own existence and place in the universe. The concept is named after the 19th-century physicist Ludwig Boltzmann, who made groundbreaking contributions to the field of statistical mechanics. While the term often evokes images of a floating, disembodied brain, the reality is far more encompassing. Boltzmann brains can take on an incredibly diverse range of forms���from biological entities like slime molds and mice to extraordinarily complex systems like networks of black holes communicating through halo lasers.
The idea hinges on the understanding that, given enough time and the vastness of the universe, atoms could spontaneously arrange themselves into configurations capable of self-awareness or cognition. In that sense, a Boltzmann brain challenges traditional notions of life and intelligence, inviting us to expand our understanding of what it means to be a conscious entity capable of contemplating one's existence within the cosmic tapestry.

The boltzman brain explains, there are "boltzman brains everywhere".
1 / 1
ChatGPT
Indeed, if we consider the concept of a Boltzmann brain broadly, the implication is that these configurations of atoms capable of self-awareness could, in theory, exist throughout the universe. Given the enormity of space and time, the probability increases for such spontaneous arrangements of matter that can contemplate their own existence. From the micro-scale of single-cell organisms to the grand orchestration of celestial bodies communicating through advanced physics, Boltzmann brains could be a ubiquitous, if not yet detected, phenomenon.
This idea stretches our understanding of life and cognition to a cosmic scale, suggesting that the universe might be teeming with different forms of self-aware entities. Such a prospect has profound implications for philosophy, ethics, and even spirituality, urging us to reconsider our place in a universe where we may not be as uniquely conscious as we once believed.

In the context of Substrate Independent Thinking Hypothesis (SITH theory)'s claim that termite mounds, beehives, and planetary ecosystems are alive and have distributed consciousness
1 / 1
ChatGPT
The concept of a Boltzmann brain aligns intriguingly well with the Substrate Independent Thinking Hypothesis (SITH theory), which posits that consciousness is not bound to a particular type of substrate or material. In this framework, even complex systems like termite mounds, beehives, and entire planetary ecosystems could be considered "alive" and possessing a form of distributed consciousness.
The Boltzmann brain notion expands this even further, suggesting that given the vastness and complexity of the universe, it's plausible for a myriad of atom configurations to achieve self-awareness. Whether it's a community of bees working in hive mind synchronization, or the intricate web of life on a planet, each could be a Boltzmann brain in its own right.
Both theories challenge the anthropocentric view of consciousness, suggesting that cognition and self-awareness can manifest in diverse, unexpected forms and substrates. The interplay of these ideas provides fertile ground for ethical, philosophical, and scientific exploration, reshaping our understanding of life, mind, and the universe itself.

ChatGPT
The Eightfold Gate: Navigating the Intersections of Technology, Philosophy, and Consciousness
Introduction
In a world increasingly shaped by technological advancements and philosophical inquiries, the boundaries between different domains of knowledge are becoming more porous. This essay aims to explore the interconnections among various fields and concepts, structured around the metaphorical "Eightfold Gate"���eight distinct but interconnected topics that collectively offer insights into the essence of human experience and the universe itself.
Automated Reasoning and its Benefits
The realm of automated reasoning serves as the first gate, a frontier where computational power meets human cognition. The benefits of automated reasoning extend beyond mere computational convenience, inviting us to think more transparently and collaboratively, thereby improving error detection, knowledge transfer, and intellectual rigor.
Literate Programming
The second gate swings open to reveal literate programming, a methodology that combines the clarity of human language with the logic of code. By intertwining explanation with execution, literate programming serves as a bridge between automated reasoning and human understanding, making the code not just a tool but a teacher.
Showing Your Work and Its Advantages
Progressing further, the third gate uncovers the importance of showing one's work. This practice, deeply ingrained in scientific research and mathematics, extends its utility to everyday life. It fosters transparency, collaboration, and continual learning, effectively serving as a cornerstone of intellectual honesty.
Writing Essay Introductions on Various Subjects
The fourth gate focuses on the art of essay writing, particularly the introductions. Crafting a compelling introduction is a skill that spans multiple disciplines, acting as a gateway to nuanced understanding and effective communication, from academia to the broader public sphere.
Sci-Fi Dialogue and Story Development
Moving into the realm of imagination, the fifth gate opens to the universe of science fiction. Here, dialogue and story development are not mere artistic endeavors but powerful vehicles for exploring existential questions and hypothetical scenarios, like the mysterious realms of consciousness and the fabric of reality itself.
Boltzmann Brains and Their Broader Definition
The sixth gate ushers us into the cosmic theater of Boltzmann brains. These hypothetical configurations of atoms challenge our anthropocentric views of consciousness and life, expanding the arena of possible self-aware entities beyond traditional biological boundaries.
Substrate Independent Thinking Hypothesis (SITH Theory)
Approaching the penultimate gate, we encounter the Substrate Independent Thinking Hypothesis, or SITH theory. This provocative concept posits that consciousness can exist in a variety of substrates, reinforcing and extending the ideas presented by the notion of Boltzmann brains.
Distributed Consciousness in Complex Systems
Finally, the eighth gate opens to the fascinating world of distributed consciousness. Whether it's a termite mound or an entire ecosystem, the concept of distributed cognition forces us to reevaluate our definitions of life, intelligence, and community.
Conclusion
The Eightfold Gate serves as a metaphorical journey through a diverse landscape of intellectual inquiry and exploration. By traversing these gates, we gain a more holistic understanding of the intricacies of technology, the complexities of human thought, and the boundless possibilities of consciousness itself. The gates are distinct yet interconnected, each contributing to a richer, more nuanced appreciation of the world we inhabit and the universe beyond.
Through this multidisciplinary exploration, we come to see that the boundaries between fields are not barriers but rather meeting points, where new ideas can be born, nurtured, and realized. The Eightfold Gate stands as a testament to the interconnectedness of all things, urging us to continually question, explore, and expand our horizons.

So I imagined that you begin at a sphere in the center and each of these pathways lead to one of the vertices of a cube.
1 / 1
ChatGPT
That's a vivid and interesting geometric metaphor to represent the interconnectedness of these diverse topics. Starting from a central sphere, which could symbolize the core of human experience or knowledge, eight pathways lead out to the vertices of a surrounding cube. Each vertex then becomes a point of convergence for different elements of technology, philosophy, and consciousness���the topics we've explored. This arrangement evokes a sense of balance and dimensionality, illustrating how seemingly disparate fields can extend from a common origin to form a complex, interconnected structure.
In this spatial metaphor, one could imagine traversing from the center to any vertex to gain insights into a specific topic, and then traveling along the edges of the cube to see how these topics connect, intersect, and inform one another. The cube itself becomes a map of intellectual terrain, where pathways between vertices represent interdisciplinary dialogue and mutual enrichment.
The central sphere, ever-present, serves as a reminder that all these explorations and advancements emanate from a core set of questions and curiosities that have intrigued humanity for centuries. As you move along any pathway, the sphere remains visible, anchoring the entire structure and symbolizing the unity underlying the diversity of human thought.

Could I get an ascii representation of this in 2d and 3d?
1 / 1
ChatGPT
Certainly, though ASCII art has its limitations. The 2D representation will be fairly straightforward, but the 3D will be a rough approximation.
2D ASCII Representation (as a square)
Here the "O" represents the central sphere, and each "X" represents a vertex of the square (a simplified 2D cube). The lines ("-") symbolize the pathways.

  |     O     |
  |           |
  |           |
  X---------
--X
3D ASCII Representation (as a cube)
For the 3D representation, I'll use "X" to represent the vertices and "-" for the edges. The "O" will represent the central sphere. Keep in mind that this is a rough approximation.
lua

   \   |   \  |
    \  X
----\ X
\|      \|
      X

Ok that is good, but since it is eightfold I imagine that you can picture it as an octagon hub with spokes or a cube with an o on the center and lines radiating inside the cube
1 / 1
ChatGPT
Ah, I see. If you're thinking of an octagon or a cube with a central "O" and lines radiating out to each vertex, the ASCII representation would look a bit different. Here are some attempts:
2D Octagon with Center "O"
For a 2D Octagon, the "O" would be the central hub with spokes ("-") radiating to vertices ("X").
css
Copy code
X---
--X-----X

   \             /
    X---
--O-----X
3D Cube with Center "O"
For a 3D cube with a central "O," lines would radiate from the "O" to each vertex ("X").
css
Copy code

   \   |   \  |
    \  X--
--O
X
     \|      \|
      X-----

Ok now in node.js
1 / 1
ChatGPT
Creating a node network in Node.js can be done using various libraries, one of which is
node-d3
. However, Node.js is primarily used for server-side scripting, so generating a visual graph is more complicated compared to a client-side language or Python libraries focused on data visualization.
Here is a sample code using Node.js with the
d3-node
package to generate a basic PNG image of the network. This code doesn't create a live server but instead generates a static PNG image file.
First, install the package:
bash
Copy code
npm install d3-node
Then, create your Node.js script:

Collective minds: social network topology shapes collective cognition
Ida Momennejad
Published:13 December 2021https://doi.org/10.1098/rstb.2020.0315
Abstract
Human cognition is not solitary, it is shaped by collective learning and memory. Unlike swarms or herds, human social networks have diverse topologies, serving diverse modes of collective cognition and behaviour. Here, we review research that combines network structure with psychological and neural experiments and modelling to understand how the topology of social networks shapes collective cognition. First, we review graph-theoretical approaches to behavioural experiments on collective memory, belief propagation and problem solving. These results show that different topologies of communication networks synchronize or integrate knowledge differently, serving diverse collective goals. Second, we discuss neuroimaging studies showing that human brains encode the topology of one's larger social network and show similar neural patterns to neural patterns of our friends and community ties (e.g. when watching movies). Third, we discuss cognitive similarities between learning social and non-social topologies, e.g. in spatial and associative learning, as well as common brain regions involved in processing social and non-social topologies. Finally, we discuss recent machine learning approaches to collective communication and cooperation in multi-agent artificial networks. Combining network science with cognitive, neural and computational approaches empowers investigating how social structures shape collective cognition, which can in turn help design goal-directed social network topologies.

This article is part of a discussion meeting issue ���The emergence of collective knowledge and cumulative culture in animals, humans and machines���.

1. Introduction
Human cognition is not solitary. From tool use, language and mathematics to beliefs about the world and morality, human cognition is shaped by learning and memory in social networks. Unlike swarms or herds, human social networks have diverse structures comprising strong, weak, clustered and sometimes hierarchical ties that serve different roles. Networks of humans pass and share information in order to synchronize their collective memories, knowledge and beliefs, or to discover and integrate diverse information and knowledge. This review focuses on empirical and computational investigations of how the structures of communication networks (i.e. social network topology) shape collective cognition. Specifically, we ask how social network topology interacts with psychological, neural and computational principles of learning and memory to synchronize collective memory and knowledge.

While a number of prominent papers and books over the past decades have addressed the role of cooperation, and social networks on collective outcomes, a review with the particular synthesis of social network topology with psychological and neural computation seems lacking. Thus, this review narrows the focus to notable research on the interaction of network structures (macro level) with psychology and cognition (micro level) in behavioural studies of collective memory [1,2], collective beliefs and behaviour [3���5], collective discovery and cultural accumulation [6], the neuroscience of social and non-social navigation of large networks [7,8], and the emergence of communication in machine intelligence and multi-agent systems [9���11].

Before returning to the focus of the review, it is noteworthy that over the past decades diverse disciplines have investigated different faces of collective cognition. Philosophers such as Bratman [12���14], Davidson [15], Tuomela [16] and Gilbert [17,18] have pioneered theories of shared agency, collective beliefs and shared intentionality. Highlighting the importance of collective beliefs and intentions on actions, this philosophical work bridges notions of sociality to morality and ethics. Anthropologists have investigated the evolution of cooperation and cumulation of culture [6,19], as have developmental and comparative psychologists focusing on primate and infant theory of mind, shared intentionality and cooperation [20���24]. Also noteworthy is related research on shared intentionality, reason-giving and the evolution of human culture; see O'Madagain & Tomasello in the present special issue [25]. Other psychologists have combined modelling and experiments to investigate cooperation [26], the emergence of groups based on reciprocity and transitivity [27], and the conditions under which a pair of humans outperform the best of the two in perceptual decisions [28]. A comprehensive review of this literature is outside the scope of the present manuscript and requires a larger review integrating and bridging the present perspective with traditions in philosophy, anthropology and decision science.

Studying the topology of human communication networks empowers us to understand, explain, model and predict the emergence and dynamics of collective knowledge in large networks. Decades of seminal research by renowned mathematicians, physicists, neuroscientists, computer scientists, sociologists and economists have established the science of complex networks that are brilliantly reviewed in earlier publications [29���33].

This manuscript specifically focuses on the combination of network topology research with the methods of computational and cognitive sciences. A graph-theoretic understanding enables us to study how communication networks interact with psychological and neural computation to shape collective cognition. Moreover, it enables us to make goal-directed predictions, and design interventions to achieve desired collective cognitive outcomes. Such desired collective outcomes could span from predicting and combating misinformed beliefs about a global pandemic to facilitating optimal structure of classrooms for learning, synchronizing memories prior to elections, optimally connecting scientific task forces working on rapid vaccine discovery, studies of human collective cognition empowering researchers and designing effective multi-agent machine intelligence.

This paper reviews recent directions of studying collective human cognition within the scope established above and concludes with a brief discussion of current and future directions in multi-agent machine intelligence. We review how network topology aligns collective memories (��2), collective beliefs and behaviour (��3), cultural accumulation and collective intelligence (��4). We then discuss how the brain's neural responses capture the topology of one's social network (��5) and then discuss common neural findings in cognition of social and non-social topologies (��6). We close with applications in multi-agent machine learning (��7) and a summary of the topology of social networks in humans and machines

2. Network topology aligns collective memory
A key question in understanding collective cognition is how the structures of communication networks (figure 1) align collectively shared memories and beliefs. From friendship circles to large communities, shared memories often shape group identity, which in turn facilitates collective action. There are different definitions of collective memory in the social and psychological literature. In this paper, collective memory refers to the convergence of memories among the members of a social network or community [1,2]. However, there are other notions of collective memory in the social sciences, such as public symbols maintained by societies [34,35], e.g. war memorial monuments, among others.

Nodes, denoting people in a community, are depicted with human graphics. Edges, denoting direct communication between two nodes or persons, are illustrated as lines. Clusters, bridge ties among nodes that do not have common connections in common, as well as cluster ties among nodes that have many common ties are marked. The degree of a node, i.e. the number of its ties, is marked in green. Standard parameters that vary the structure of graphs include randomness (b), clustering (a,c), network diameter (maximum path length) and average path length. A number of well-known graph topologies are depicted: a graph with a grid structure, a random ring graph and a network with a clustered community structure (c).

In a number of studies, Coman, Momennejad and colleagues investigated collective memory using graph theory, behavioural experiments, complex and temporal network analysis, and agent-based simulations [1,2,36]. To do so, they designed laboratory-based controlled experiments on collective memory, during which participants were assigned to pre-arranged communication networks in a virtual setting. They devised novel behavioural analyses, inspired by representational similarity analysis in cognitive neuroscience, to measure mnemonic convergence in social networks when individuals were not aware of the broader topology [1,2].

Every experimental session consisted of a number of individuals (e.g. 10 or 16), each facing a computer screen and later interacting with a pre-assigned number of other participants virtually through a text chat window. All experiments followed a three-phase design (figure 2): in phase 1, participants studied the same material individually and took a memory recall test (pre-conversational recall), in phase 2, each participant had a series of dyadic conversations through a pop-up chat window during which they could discuss what they remembered from the material they had just studied. Participants did not see who they were talking to, nor were they aware of the larger network structure. In phase 3, each participant took a recall test once again individually (post-conversational recall). Having pre- and post-conversational behavioural measures of memory recall allowed us to measure mnemonic convergence owing to conversations, in two different topology conditions: clustered and non-clustered topologies (figure 2). A series of representational similarity analyses (figure 2) was designed and conducted, inspired by similar techniques in neuroimaging, to compute and compare individual and collective memory in relation to network topology.

The section you've provided delves into how network topology affects collective memory, which is a subfield of collective cognition. The authors, including Ida Momennejad, focus on understanding how different structures in communication networks can shape and align collective memories. Collective memory in this context is defined as the convergence of memories among members of a community or social network.
They conducted laboratory-based controlled experiments where participants were assigned to pre-arranged communication networks in a virtual setting. Each experiment had three phases: individual study, group conversations via text chat, and post-conversation individual recall. The experiments aimed to measure "mnemonic convergence" in different network topologies (clustered and non-clustered).
Graph Theory and Programming: This can connect with our previous discussion about representing networks in Python or Node.js. We could model similar experiments programmatically to understand how different topologies affect the collective memory.
Boltzmann Brains and Distributed Consciousness: The idea of nodes (or individuals in this context) in a network having different degrees of connectivity and thereby influence on collective memory could be compared to the various forms of Boltzmann brains, from simple to complex, that we discussed. Each node contributes to the collective cognition of the entire network, similar to how different forms of Boltzmann brains might contribute to universal cognition.
Collective Minds and SITH Theory: The concept of different network topologies influencing collective memory could be an example of the "Substrate Independent Thinking Hypothesis." Like termite mounds or planetary ecosystems, the network itself has a form of distributed consciousness that's shaped by its topology.
This paper provides a scientific foundation for many of the concepts we've discussed, offering empirical data and methodological frameworks for studying collective cognition and memory. Would you like to explore any of these connections further?

3. Network topology shapes beliefs and norms
Collective memories often form the foundations of shared systems of beliefs, and beliefs shape how we remember [41]. Religion, political choices and health decisions are among key examples of how shared beliefs, and their changing dynamics, guide individual and collective decision making. Computational simulations have established how beliefs spread in social networks [42]. Recent empirical evidence suggests that collective beliefs can be synchronized according to a social network's topology [43].

Vlasceanu and Coman conducted a belief synchronization version of the study described in figure 2 [1,5]. They showed that, similar to the collective memory counterpart study [1], the topology of social networks impacts the alignment of beliefs. This belief alignment occurred even among members who never directly communicated and the extent of change in belief similarity between two individuals corresponded to their degree of separation in the network.

The authors also studied how belief endorsement by a public speaker affects belief alignment in 12-person laboratory-created networks [43]. During the experiment, individuals first evaluated how believable a set of belief statements were and later either completed a distractor task (control condition) or listened to a public speaker who endorsed some of the beliefs (treatment condition). The authors showed that the public speaker altered the mnemonic accessibility of some beliefs, which in turn impacted and was amplified by the networks' conversations, leading to subsequent belief synchronization. Future studies are required to study how an individual's network affinity with the public speaker shapes the direction of their influence.

The present manuscript focuses on the role of social network topology in collective cognition rather than behaviour broadly defined. However, beliefs about health, education and politics govern large-scale patterns of collective human behaviour. Thus, it is reasonable to hypothesize that the topology of communication networks shape behaviour. Centola has provided evidence for this hypothesis in a series of seminal studies, establishing a link between network topology and collective behaviour [3,4]. They investigated the mechanisms by which health behaviour would spread in social networks and identified which topologies were more conducive to the adoption of health behaviour. They found that individuals were more likely to adopt health behaviour if they received reinforcement about that behaviour from many close ties in the broader network. Therefore, health adoption spread more effectively in clustered lattice network topologies, compared to random networks [3]. In a second study, Centola investigated how the composition of a community affects the adoption of health behaviours. They discovered that homophily between two individuals, i.e. the extent to which their social contacts are similar to one another, increases their dyadic-level influence on each other's behaviour. However, the broader consequence of this pattern is that in large clustered networks less healthy individuals are more likely to have close ties and influence one another, reducing their probability of interactions with, and being influenced by, healthier individuals [4].

While the present manuscript is a review of the role of network topology in collective cognition with a focus on cognitive neuroscience and machine learning, a series of recent papers have addressed how topology affects health behaviour, resource sharing and inequality, and wisdom of the crowds (i.e. the observation that the average response of a group better approximates ground truth than individual responses) [34���39]. These are related, fascinating and important topics but outside the scope of micro���macro interactions in collective cognition here, yet a number of papers on network approaches to changing social norms are particularly noteworthy. Banerjee and colleagues studied the diffusion of microfinance in villages, showing that if information is first given to central individuals (measured by their eigenvector centrality in the social network), adoption of the information diffuses more effectively in the community [44]. In seminal research, Paluck and colleagues conducted anti-conflict interventions across over 24 000 students and showed that individuals pay more attention to ���social referent��� network roles (influential individuals) in their community and interventions are more effective when targeted on referents, reducing conflict by 30% in 1 year [45]. This was followed by further research into engineering social change: temporal- and network-based improvements of norm change, nudging and attitudes to authority and justice in factory workers [46���49].

Taken together, these studies clarify the role of network topology in the mechanisms by which beliefs, norms and behaviour propagate in networks, and how centralized interventions���such as collective exposure to public endorsement and endorsement by influential members���can change collective beliefs and norms. These findings, together with findings on collective memory and belief formation, offer the important potential for designing interventions to combat misinformation (e.g. about health behaviour) or harmful polarization in larger networks. Mapping network topology of misinformation networks makes it possible to devise a number of intervention tools that can synchronize memories and beliefs in larger communities at times of crisis. These tools could span from affecting the topology of communication networks, when possible, to targeting bridge ties and isolated clusters (information bubbles) for intervention and centralized public speeches.

The section discusses the intricate relationship between network topology and the formation and spread of collective beliefs and norms. Researchers like Vlasceanu, Coman, and Centola have shown that the structure of social networks profoundly affects not only what people remember collectively but also what they believe and how they behave. They have applied this understanding to health behavior, microfinance diffusion, and conflict resolution.
Graph Theory and Programming: Once again, the application of graph theory is apparent. Simulations could be programmed to test how different network structures affect belief and norm propagation. This could be very useful for studying the spread of misinformation or polarizing views.
Boltzmann Brains and Distributed Consciousness: Similar to the collective memory concept, these findings affirm that the topology of a network can be a form of a distributed "consciousness" that influences collective beliefs and behaviors. The intricate connections could be analogous to how Boltzmann brains might influence a universal consciousness.
Collective Minds and SITH Theory: This section also resonates with the Substrate-Independent Thinking Hypothesis (SITH). A network's topology could serve as the "substrate" that influences the collective cognition of that network, affecting beliefs and norms.
Applications to Real-world Problems: Most importantly, the paper highlights the potential for interventions that can leverage this understanding of network topology to combat issues like misinformation or societal polarization. Knowing how beliefs and norms spread could inform strategies for positive social change.
The paper suggests that we could go beyond just understanding these phenomena and actively intervene to produce desired outcomes. It lays the groundwork for potentially game-changing approaches in public policy, health, and social justice. Would you like to delve deeper into any of these topics?

4. Network topology shapes collective intelligence
Consider the Brooklyn bridge, your smart phone, or the international space station. Achieving any of these complex technologies required generations of cumulative inventions, leading to levels of problem-solving ability that go far beyond what is possible at the individual intelligence level. It has been suggested that the capacity and success of cumulative cultural achievements, such as complex technologies, depend on the size and connectivity of collaborative networks [6].

In an inventive study, Derex & Boyd [6] investigated how the topology and temporal order of collaboration networks lead to inventions. They studied six-person collaboration networks, attempting to discover three hierarchical levels of chemical compounds in a virtual set-up. In one condition, all six members of the network worked together simultaneously (full connectivity), while in the second condition, they worked in three teams of two and exchanged members twice throughout the experiment (partial connectivity). The results suggest that participants in the partial connectivity condition achieved further levels of the hierarchical invention compared to the full connectivity condition.

Thus, while full connectivity may serve the convergence of memories and beliefs, as discussed earlier, partial connectivity may increase cultural accumulation required for complex and cumulative invention. These findings provide compelling support for the core thesis of the present paper: that different social network topologies can serve different collective outcomes. Further hypothesis-driven investigations could lead to insight for intervention design: designing goal-directed network structures or targeted interventions on specific parts of a network towards a desired outcome. Examples of desired collective outcomes span from predicting and combating misinformation about a global pandemic to designing optimal communication among scientific research networks for rapid vaccine discovery.

Wooley and colleagues define collective intelligence as the above-mentioned collective's ability to solve a diverse set of tasks and problems beyond the ability of the most intelligent members of the collective [50,51]. They have conducted a number of studies investigating how the composition and diversity of teams can enhance its measurable collective intelligence and help achieve optimal goal-directed problem solving [50,51]. They show that the social sensitivity of team members, as measured by the social intelligence test of detecting emotions from photographs of eyes [52], predicted the collective intelligence of the teams. However, this measure of social sensitivity does not measure individuals' sensitivity for encoding the broader relational topology of the social network.

The study by Derex and Boyd discussed earlier provides preliminary evidence for the hypothesis that network topology and connectivity can impact the collective intelligence of a community. Other studies have established collaborative learning in social networks [53] and investigated the role of team size and composition on complex tasks [54]. However, as we have seen, different network topologies afford optimal solutions towards different goals. One hypothesis for future studies is that the collective intelligence of a collaboration network may depend on the network's flexibility in reorganizing its collaborative connectivity to adapt to diverse task demands.

Another future direction is to investigate whether collective intelligence merely relies on sensitivity to social cues, or whether it is also related to the ability of community members to perceive the network status of others, and the broader topology of their social network. Such a study can benefit from the methods developed in recent neuroimaging studies (discussed in the following section) showing that the brain spontaneously encodes the social network status of one's community members.

The section elaborates on how network topology influences collective intelligence, which is essentially the collective problem-solving ability that surpasses individual capabilities. Researchers like Derex & Boyd have demonstrated that different levels of connectivity within networks can lead to different outcomes. For instance, partial connectivity fostered more complex inventions than full connectivity.
Graph Theory and Adaptive Networks: Again, graph theory can be employed to model how different network topologies can adapt to various task demands. The idea of network flexibility could be mathematically modeled to study optimal conditions for collective problem-solving.
Boltzmann Brains and Hive Minds: The section further lends credence to the idea that collective intelligence functions like a "hive mind," a form of distributed thinking. Such intelligence might be much more capable than any individual, somewhat like a Boltzmann brain that arises out of complex systems.
Collective Intelligence and SITH: The Substrate-Independent Thinking Hypothesis (SITH) can also be invoked here. The "substrate" or network topology could be intricately connected with how collective intelligence manifests. It's not just about individual capacities but how they're configured in relation to each other.
Real-world Applications: The implications for real-world issues like misinformation and rapid vaccine discovery are significant. If collective intelligence can be enhanced or directed by manipulating network topology, this opens the door for a multitude of interventions, from public policy to healthcare.
Neuroscience Angle: The mention of neuroimaging studies hints that future research could also explore how the human brain naturally encodes social network statuses. This could provide further insights into how individuals inherently operate within networks, contributing to collective intelligence.
In summary, the paper makes a compelling case that understanding the influence of network topology on collective outcomes isn't merely an academic exercise but could be crucial for addressing real-world challenges. Would you like to explore any of these concepts further?

5. Social network topology shapes neural responses
Previous sections reviewed behavioural evidence that human memories and beliefs become similar to one's community members, and the extent of this similarity tracks one's geodesic distance, or degree of separation, to any other community member. Given these behavioural findings, a hypothesis naturally follows: social network topology should also impact similarities in the brain signals of community members. A recent study considered whether human brains are sensitive to the network status of other individuals [7]. The authors' reason that because human social groups, unlike herds and swarms, comprises diverse bonds and structures, human brains might have evolved to endure the cognitive demands of navigating complex social networks. This means being able to track social ties and relationships that are direct (one step away), third party or more distant (multiple steps away)���extending to an understanding of the broader social network topology.

The study used graph-theoretic measures such as eigenvector centrality to analyse an academic cohort of 275 students and scanned 21 members in a functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) study. Eigenvector centrality measures how influential a member is and how many influential members they are connected to (which is different from degree centrality, counting how many connections a given individual has, figure 1). During the study, each person viewed photos of other individuals with varying degrees of separation from themselves. This included individuals with eigenvector centrality, as a measure of influence, and individuals who were bridge ties between otherwise unconnected members of the cohort (figure 1), as a measure of brokerage. Neural pattern analysis revealed that while each individual viewed photos of their cohort, their brain activated the network position of the individual they were viewing. Notably, this neural representation of the network position of cohort members was activated spontaneously in the brain, i.e. in the absence of an explicit goal that required this knowledge. This is in line with the hypothesis that human brains might have adapted to encode the topology of social network ties beyond one's immediate bonds [55].

A series of fMRI studies have studied similarities in the brain activation of members of a community as they each watched videos inside an fMRI scanner. The researchers had mapped the graph of the social network of the individuals, measured the network status of different members in terms of different measures of centrality and analysed a relationship between similarities in brain responses videos and the social network measures of closeness. One such study [56] reported that the neural responses of individuals during audiovisual video viewing were more similar to neural responses of their close community ties. The extent of this neural similarity tracked the pair's distance in a social network: friends with smaller geodesic distance had more similar brain responses while community members with more degrees of separation showed less similar responses. Another study showed that the community members' brain activities while watching videos became more similar to members of the network with high eigenvector centrality, i.e. highly influential members, what the authors dubbed ���neural influence��� [57].

We have so far reviewed graph-theoretic studies of the synchronizations of collective memories [1,2], behaviour and beliefs [43] in social networks; the alignment of neural similarity among members of a community [56,57]; and the neural encoding of the network position of one's community members [7]. These studies suggest a broader human capacity for learning network structures in social and non-social cognition.

6. Navigating social and non-social topologies: common mechanisms?
Human social groups are larger than those of our evolutionary cousins, and the social network size is proposed to correspond to the size of the brain in primates [55] and other mammals [58]. Unlike herds and swarms, human communities comprise social networks with diverse structures. A number of papers in the present special issue focus on cumulative cultural evolution and the structure of populations as the origins of moving from foraging to collective intelligence, while others shed light on the social networks of hunter���gatherers to understand cultural evolution (see [59,60]; as well as [61]). While the burgeoning research on social learning across the species points at cultural evolution and collective knowledge (see Garland et al. [62]; Gruber et al. [63]; Whiten et al. [64]; Wild et al. [65]; and Williams & Lachlan [66] in the present special issue), this manuscript particularly focuses on the role of network topology on collective cognitions in humans, leaving out the evolutionary framework. That said, it is reasonable to hypothesize that human brains have evolved to handle the cognitive demands of navigating complex social networks, and that vice versa, perhaps the demand of adapting to the growth of social networks contributed to broader practices and cultures of learning and navigating complex networks. While it remains unclear how neural and cultural capacities for graph learning in social, spatial or associative contexts have co-evolved, and which was prior, it is helpful to consider common tools and findings across studies of structure learning [8].

This section delves into how social network topology influences neural responses and cognition. Researchers have conducted studies using functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) to analyze brain activity while participants interact with their social networks. The studies suggest that the brain's responses are influenced by the network status of individuals, even beyond immediate bonds, demonstrating the brain's capacity to encode the broader social network topology.
Neuroscience and Graph Theory: The intersection of neuroscience and graph theory is evident here. The brain seems to encode social network structures similarly to how it processes other cognitive tasks. Modeling such brain responses in graph-theoretic terms could provide insights into how networks are mentally represented.
Boltzmann Brains and Distributed Consciousness: The idea that the brain encodes the topology of social networks adds another layer to the distributed consciousness concept. It suggests that our cognition is influenced by the collective connections we have, contributing to a form of "networked consciousness."
Collective Minds and SITH: The concept of network topology shaping neural responses supports the notion of substrate-independent thinking (SITH). Human cognition isn't isolated but influenced by the network it's connected to.
Evolution and Social Complexity: The relationship between brain size, social network size, and evolutionary aspects adds an interesting layer. The evolution of larger brains in humans could be related to the cognitive demands of navigating complex social networks.
This section reinforces the idea that our cognition is intricately tied to the networks we're part of. It's fascinating to see how these ideas can be applied to various fields, from neuroscience to collective intelligence. Would you like to explore any of these ideas further?

7. Application to collective machine intelligence
A thriving direction in contemporary machine learning regards multi-agent learning and collaborative artificial intelligence (AI). Research and innovation in these directions span from AI-AI and AI-human interactions, including communication via natural language processing [93], to building AI tools for enhancing human���human interactions [94]. This journal issue includes a number of such directions, such as experiments in artificial culture in collective social robotics (see [95]), as well as research on embodied evolution of social learning in swarm robotics (see [96]) and artificial evolution of robot bodies and cultural learning (see [97]). Recent advances range from deep RL agents that play computer games such as project Malmo, Xbox games, and Minecraft [9,98] and Starcraft [11,99] to multi-agent networks that evolve communication-based social influence [10], interaction-grounded learning [100] and interactive meta-learning [101]. Agent-interaction graphs have been used to evaluate generalization in multi-agent systems [102]. Future directions of multi-agent machine learning can combine insights from brain networks and human social networks to both help understand human collective cognition, and advance collaboration and collective machine intelligence.

A forward-looking computational direction is to compare the emergence of different social structures dependent upon the neural architecture of individual agents in a multi-agent system. It is possible to envision at least two related directions. First, the emergence of optimal network topologies tailored to fulfilling particular tasks or goals in a multi-agent setting. The goals of such a system could vary from collaboration to competition (e.g. as in Xbox games) or assisting humans. Second, combining principles of evolving network architecture with multi-agent problem settings can offer insights into the coevolution of neural architecture (in individual agents) and the topologies of social and ecological multi-agent networks. These directions are especially timely given recent advances in graph learning [103].

Advances in these directions could offer theoretical insight into the correspondence and coevolution of neural architectures in individual brains and species with the demands of navigating large and complex social, spatial and environmental networks. Which structures of social networks emerge from multi-agent systems with different goals? Which neural network or brain architectures can afford the multi-agent behaviour observed in a given species? This direction offers exciting prospects for studying how neural networks and social networks co-evolve in biological and AI.

8. Conclusion: the topology of collective cognition in human and machines
Human brains and cultures are embedded in large social and ecological systems. Unlike swarms and herds, human social networks have diverse composition and topologies. Here we have reviewed research backing the hypothesis that social network topology shapes collective cognition and behaviour. We narrowed the scope predominantly to psychological and neuroscientific studies that ground this proposal in micro���macro interactions.

The integration of these studies shows that: (i) human memories, beliefs and behaviours synchronize with their social ties, and with members of the community they never directly communicate with [1���5]; (ii) human brains spontaneously process the network status of others in one's social communities, and the similarity of brain responses while watching movie clips predict friendship ties within a cohort [7,56]; (iii) the brain's ability to encode the broader network topology beyond one's immediate ties mirrors the brain's ability to learn non-social topologies and cognitive maps [104]. We reviewed evidence from the neuroscience of learning and memory pointing at potential common mechanisms for learning social, spatial and non-social topologies [8,67,77]: (iv) recent deep learning algorithms connect this literature to collective cognition in multi-agent machine learning [10]. This diverse body of research supports the hypothesis that the brain's ability to acquire and navigate topologies of complex and large neural networks might have co-evolved with the human species' growing network size and diversity of social topologies. Research on social and affective disorders could elucidate commonalities and differences in social and non-social graph learning.

The body of research reviewed here uses diverse interdisciplinary methods developed in graph theory, statistics, mathematics, physics and neuroscience for clustering and characterizing community structures in complex networks [105,106], temporal network analysis in dynamic complex systems (for instance when analysing the effect of the order of conversations on collective memory) [2] and representational similarity analysis for comparing multidimensional vectors (e.g. for analysing neural patterns [84]) adapted for comparing mnemonic convergence in behaviour, using the correlation of multi-item memory vectors [1,34].

Graph-theoretic tools for analysing the architecture of complex networks apply to brains and social networks alike. Just as neural networks with different architectures share and integrate information differently, specific structures or topologies of social networks synchronize or integrate knowledge in different ways. Future studies can combine experimental and computational approaches to study the coevolution of neural networks capable of processing large social network topologies, and the emergence of topologies that serve different collective functions and outcomes.

Combining experimental and computational approaches empowers researchers to investigate how the topology of social networks shapes collective cognition and behaviour and help design goal-directed social network topologies toward desired outcomes (e.g. correcting misinformation about a global pandemic or coordinating rapid vaccine discovery). Comparative studies on social and non-social graph learning across species could offer insight into the evolution of neural and social mechanisms in humans, other species and machines. Such an interdisciplinary approach empowers researchers to design effective multi-agent machine intelligence inspired by knowledge of human collective cognition. In turn, multi-agent machine learning models of collective intelligence can help theorize and test hypotheses about the coevolution of complex neural architectures and complex social networks.

Connections to the following: Stigmergy (Swarm Behavior) and Information Cascades
Stigmergy, also known as a universal coordination mechanism, is when a larger group coordinates through the indirect actions of its individuals. Stigmergy relies on signals left in the environment by an entity that signals other individuals to follow the same course of action. There are no instructions and each individual is not aware of the broader impact of their actions. Most of the evidence and also the applications of stigmergy involve swarm intelligence. The most widely known examples relate to insects that form social networks. Insects such as ants, wasps, bees, termites show evident signs of a universal coordination mechanism. We can take ants for example. Ants by themselves are not intelligent creatures, they are very disposable creatures by themselves. Yet in a group ants can do amazing things. They can build complex nests and trace paths in thick vegetation to food sources. For example, ants that return from a food source secrete a pheromone that signals to the other ants that there is food in the path the ant just came from. This source could be an isolated crumb or a large food source. The more ants that go to the food source and return, the stronger the pheromones, and thus stronger the signal. Ants without any form of central organization can easily weave a path to nearby food sources that can support the entire colony. Another example is how ants build complex three-dimensional nests without being intelligent themselves nor having a central authority. They modify the environment so that other ants, specifically worker ants, can act accordingly. However, this method is not a hundred percent foolproof. Distractions and other elements can confuse ants into secreting their hormones at the wrong time leading other ants to go off foraging in places without very much food or in places with danger. There is always a chance that the pheromone path may not lead to a food source.

This probability could be quantified using Bayes Theorem. It is also  very similar to how information cascades work. After a group of people signal the same thing, a person receiving these signals would be more compelled to follow their path. For example, let���s say multiple people buy a product. They leave positive reviews on Amazon and tell their friends. A person noticing the fact that these people are content with their purchase would be more likely to buy that product. This can lead large groups of people following paths that end up at a certain product. The product has a large chance of being good but there is a smaller chance it might be bad. Again, Bayes Theorem can calculate the probabilities.

ChatGPT
Certainly, there are interesting connections between Stigmergy (Swarm Behavior) and Information Cascades, as well as the broader themes we discussed:
Stigmergy and Collective Cognition
: Stigmergy relies on the indirect actions of individuals to coordinate within a larger group. Similarly, in the context of collective cognition, the alignment of memories and beliefs in social networks occurs through interactions and shared experiences among individuals, leading to the emergence of shared knowledge.
Stigmergy and Multi-Agent Machine Learning
: Stigmergy in swarm behavior mirrors the interactions and communication patterns observed in multi-agent machine learning, where agents coordinate their actions based on the actions and signals of others. Both scenarios involve decentralized decision-making processes.
Stigmergy and Network Topology
: The concept of stigmergy in swarm behavior demonstrates how simple agents can create complex structures and behaviors through their interactions. This parallels the idea that the topology of communication networks influences collective cognition and behavior, as discussed in the Ida Momennejad's article.
Information Cascades and Belief Alignment
: Information cascades involve the propagation of behaviors or decisions based on the actions of others. Similarly, in the context of collective cognition, shared beliefs can spread through social networks based on the endorsements and actions of influential individuals, shaping collective behavior.
Information Cascades and Cognitive Bias
: Information cascades can be influenced by cognitive biases, where individuals are more likely to follow the crowd rather than make independent decisions. This is relevant to the studies of network topology and its impact on belief synchronization, where individuals may align their beliefs with those of influential members in the network.
Bayes Theorem and Quantifying Probability
: Both Stigmergy and Information Cascades involve probabilities and the likelihood of certain outcomes. Bayes Theorem, mentioned in your description, can be applied to quantify these probabilities and assess the likelihood of behaviors or decisions spreading within a network.
Comparative Studies Across Species and Swarm Behavior
: Comparative studies of stigmergy in swarm behavior across different species can provide insights into the evolution of collective behaviors and decision-making processes, similar to how comparative studies of network topology can inform our understanding of collective cognition.
These connections highlight the shared principles of emergence, coordination, and decision-making that underlie both stigmergy and information cascades, as well as their relevance to understanding collective behaviors, cognition, and communication.
