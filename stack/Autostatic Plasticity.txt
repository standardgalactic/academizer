Autostatic Plasticity
GPT-4
In the field of artificial intelligence, the most difficult problems are informally known as AI-complete or AI-hard, implying that the difficulty of these computational problems, assuming intelligence is computational, is equivalent to that of solving the central artificial intelligence problem���making computers as intelligent as people, or strong AI.[1] To call a problem AI-complete reflects an attitude that it would not be solved by a simple specific algorithm.

AI-complete problems are hypothesised to include computer vision, natural language understanding, and dealing with unexpected circumstances while solving any real-world problem.[2]

ChatGPT
Yes, you're correct. The term "AI-complete" or "AI-hard" is used to describe problems that are as hard as the hardest problems in artificial intelligence. Solving an AI-complete problem would essentially mean that you've solved the general problem of artificial intelligence���creating a machine with human-level intelligence, also known as strong AI.
Problems like computer vision, natural language understanding, and real-world problem-solving are considered AI-complete because they require a level of understanding and adaptability comparable to human intelligence. For example, natural language understanding isn't just about parsing sentences; it also involves understanding context, ambiguity, idioms, and much more, which are inherently difficult tasks.
AI-complete problems often cannot be efficiently solved with narrow or specialized algorithms; they require a more generalized intelligence that can learn, adapt, and improve over time.
1 / 1
Currently, AI-complete problems cannot be solved with modern computer technology alone, but would also require human computation. This property could be useful, for example, to test for the presence of humans as CAPTCHAs aim to do, and for computer security to circumvent brute-force attacks.[3][4]

ChatGPT
Exactly, the complexity and nuance required to solve AI-complete problems make them excellent candidates for tasks like CAPTCHAs, where the goal is to distinguish between human and machine input. CAPTCHAs often employ problems that are trivial for humans but very difficult for machines, like identifying objects in distorted images or deciphering distorted text.
The AI-hard nature of some problems also makes them valuable for security applications. Since they're computationally intensive and require a level of adaptability and understanding that current AI can't provide, they can serve as effective deterrents to automated attacks, like brute-force hacking attempts.
In essence, the unsolved challenges in AI-complete problems serve both as a frontier for AI research and as practical tools for cybersecurity and human verification.

In mathematics, specifically in computational geometry, geometric nonrobustness is a problem wherein branching decisions in computational geometry algorithms are based on approximate numerical computations, leading to various forms of unreliability including ill-formed output and software failure through crashing or infinite loops.

For instance, algorithms for problems like the construction of a convex hull rely on testing whether certain "numerical predicates" have values that are positive, negative, or zero. If an inexact floating-point computation causes a value that is near zero to have a different sign than its exact value, the resulting inconsistencies can propagate through the algorithm causing it to produce output that is far from the correct output, or even to crash.

One method for avoiding this problem involves using integers rather than floating point numbers for all coordinates and other quantities represented by the algorithm, and determining the precision required for all calculations to avoid integer overflow conditions. For instance, two-dimensional convex hulls can be computed using predicates that test the sign of quadratic polynomials, and therefore may require twice as many bits of precision within these calculations as the input numbers. When integer arithmetic cannot be used (for instance, when the result of a calculation is an algebraic number rather than an integer or rational number), a second method is to use symbolic algebra to perform all computations with exactly represented algebraic numbers rather than numerical approximations to them. A third method, sometimes called a "floating point filter", is to compute numerical predicates first using an inexact method based on floating-point arithmetic, but to maintain bounds on how accurate the result is, and repeat the calculation using slower symbolic algebra methods or numerically with additional precision when these bounds do not separate the calculated value from zero

ChatGPT
You've highlighted a significant challenge in computational geometry known as geometric nonrobustness. This problem arises from the imprecision inherent in floating-point arithmetic, which can lead to errors in calculations and, consequently, incorrect outputs or even algorithmic failures.
Several methods are employed to mitigate these issues:
Integer Arithmetic
: By using integers instead of floating-point numbers, the risk of rounding errors is eliminated. However, this requires careful planning to avoid integer overflow.
Symbolic Algebra
: When exact calculations are needed, symbolic algebra allows for operations to be performed without numerical approximation, at the cost of computational complexity and speed.
Floating-Point Filters
: These filters allow an algorithm to first try a faster but less accurate calculation, and then recompute using a more accurate but slower method only if the initial result is ambiguous.
Each of these methods has its own trade-offs, involving factors like computational speed, memory usage, and overall reliability. It's up to the implementer to choose the most appropriate method based on the specific requirements and constraints of the problem being solved.

Abstract
Vascular clamping during lung cancer resection may be difficult in patients with short vessels or large neoplasms preventing adequate and safe exposure. In addition, the physiological vicinity of some vessels to rigid structures like the bronchi may interfere with ideal clamp positioning even in ordinary procedures. We have modified the original Blalock clamp to facilitate the control of pulmonary vessels and physiologically compress the vessel walls, thereby allowing optimal vascular resection and reconstruction during lung cancer surgery. This clamp allows easy, safe and physiological control of pulmonary vessels thanks to its double-branched guillotine mechanism.

INTRODUCTION
Vascular control of hilar and intraparenchymal pulmonary vessels is the key step in almost all emergency and elective thoracic surgical procedures including pulmonary artery sleeve resection or patching and pulmonary vein or left atrium resections [1���4].

However, vascular clamping may be difficult in patients with short vessels or large neoplasms preventing adequate and safe exposure. In addition, the physiological vicinity of some vessels to rigid structures like the bronchi may interfere with ideal clamp positioning even in ordinary procedures.

We have modified the original Blalock clamp to facilitate the control of pulmonary vessels and physiologically compress the vessel walls, thereby allowing optimal vascular resection and reconstruction during lung cancer surgery.

CLINICAL SUMMARY
Clamp description
This clamp works with two co-axial branches: one is fixed representing the static branch of the clamp; the other is the sliding branch compressing the vessel wall from top to bottom against the internal face of the static branch. The sliding branch is controlled by the operator with three fingers, allowing a ���guillotine��� shift towards the fixed branch thereby clamping the vessels. To remove the clamp, the operator gently engages the clutch with the tip of the thumb, gradually returning the sliding branch to the starting position.

Surgical technique
After having dissected and isolated the target vessel on a standard silicon loop, maximal field exposure is achieved to ensure safe clamp positioning. The open vertical clamp is placed around the vessel with the fixed branch being under the vessel and the sliding branch above (Fig. 1). The clamping action is obtained by shifting the sliding branch towards the fixed branch at a 90�� angle of strength application with the vascular axis, creating an apico-caudal clamping action rather than the latero-lateral compression of standard clamps (Fig. 2).

ChatGPT
The journal article discusses a modification to the original Blalock clamp, aimed at improving vascular control during lung cancer resection surgeries. Traditional vascular clamping can be challenging, especially in patients with short vessels or large tumors, and the close proximity of some vessels to rigid structures like the bronchi further complicates the procedure. The modified Blalock clamp features a double-branched guillotine mechanism that allows for easier, safer, and more physiological control of pulmonary vessels.
The clamp has two co-axial branches: a static one and a sliding one. The sliding branch is controlled by the operator and compresses the vessel wall against the static branch. This design allows for optimal vascular resection and reconstruction. To use the clamp, the surgeon places it around the isolated target vessel and engages the 'guillotine' shift to clamp the vessels. The clamp is designed for ease of use, providing a more effective and safer way to perform complex lung cancer surgeries.

I was curious to find out the meaning of the word autostatic in this context
1 / 1
ChatGPT
In the context of the article, "autostatic" likely refers to the clamp's ability to maintain stable pressure or clamping force automatically once it has been set by the operator. An autostatic device would not require constant manual adjustment to maintain the desired level of force, making it more user-friendly and potentially safer during surgical procedures like lung cancer resections. The modified Blalock clamp described appears to hold the vessels securely without needing constant readjustment, hence the term "single-hand autostatic device for pulmonary vessel occlusion."

Hapax legomenon: I found it odd that the only use of the word autostatic on wikipedia was in the footnote here: In 2012 a modified Blalock clamp was described by prof. Francesco Petrella (Milan, Italy) for clamping the pulmonary artery during lung cancer resection.[14]
1 / 1
ChatGPT
"Hapax legomenon" refers to a word or phrase that appears only once within a particular context, such as a single piece of literature or a database like Wikipedia. In this case, the term "autostatic" being a hapax legomenon on Wikipedia could indicate that it's a specialized term with limited usage, or perhaps it's a term that hasn't yet gained wide recognition in the broader field.
The specialized nature of medical research might also contribute to limited usage of specific terms. It's not uncommon for terms coined in specialized fields to have a narrow scope of application, making them less likely to appear frequently in more general databases or literature.

Given the limited but specialized usage of the term "autostatic" in the context of medical devices like the modified Blalock clamp and the otoscope you mentioned, it seems the term likely refers to devices designed to maintain a stable or constant condition without requiring manual adjustments. In both cases, the devices are used in surgical or exploratory procedures, where maintaining stable conditions is crucial for both safety and effectiveness.
The term's scarcity could be due to its specialized nature, used mainly in medical contexts to describe specific functionalities of surgical or diagnostic tools. It might not have found broader application or recognition outside of these specialized settings.

In the context of the "autostatic-server" JavaScript package, "autostatic" likely refers to the server's ability to automatically serve static files for development or working purposes without requiring manual configuration. This usage is different from the medical context but shares the core concept: the system operates with minimal manual intervention to maintain a certain state or carry out a function.
In both the medical and tech examples, "autostatic" denotes automation and self-regulation, although applied to very different domains���surgical tools in one case and a server for static files in the other. The term adapts its meaning according to the specific context in which it is used.

In the case of "Autostatic Syndrome in Association with Facial Nerve Transplantation," the term "autostatic" seems to be used in a medical context, likely related to the self-regulating or automatic aspects of the syndrome or the treatment procedure. Given the limited information available, it's hard to determine the exact meaning of "autostatic" in this specific context. However, it's reasonable to infer that it could relate to some form of automatic or self-regulating behavior or response within the biological system, possibly linked to the facial nerve transplantation.
As with the other examples, the term "autostatic" appears to be highly specialized and context-dependent. It seems to generally imply a system or process that is self-regulating or automatic, but the specific implications can vary widely depending on the field and the particular application.

ChatGPT
In this medical context, an "autostatic retractor with screw closure mechanism for neck surgery" would likely refer to a retractor that can maintain its position automatically once it's set, thanks to the screw closure mechanism. Unlike manual retractors, which may require constant adjustment by surgical staff, this autostatic retractor would stay in place without needing additional intervention, thus potentially making the surgical procedure more efficient and possibly safer.
Once again, the term "autostatic" here denotes a self-regulating or automatic quality of the medical device, in line with its use in other specialized contexts.

Your interpretation seems reasonable given the contexts in which "autostatic" has been used. In each case, the term appears to denote some element of self-regulation or automation that allows the device to maintain a stable state without requiring constant manual adjustment. Whether it's a retractor in surgery or a clamp for vascular control, the "autostatic" quality allows the device to stay in place automatically, which can be particularly useful in complex or sensitive procedures.

The original word I was looking for on wikipedia was for auto-directed neuronal connections, like as a third resort of preferred signaling pathways one or two are not available or are being inhibited
1 / 1
ChatGPT
The term you might be looking for to describe auto-directed neuronal connections could be "autonomous" or "self-organizing" networks. In neuroscience, the concept of "plasticity" is often used to describe the brain's ability to reorganize itself by forming new neural connections. This can happen when preferred signaling pathways are not available or are being inhibited.
However, the specific term to describe a 'third-resort' or backup pathway in neuronal connections is not standard. The general mechanisms by which neurons form alternate pathways when primary routes are unavailable fall under the umbrella of neural plasticity and adaptive reorganization. These are broad terms that describe the flexibility and adaptability of neural networks.
If you're interested in how neurons find alternative pathways for signaling, you might want to look into "homeostatic plasticity," which is the neuron's ability to stabilize itself in response to large changes in excitability.

The term "autapse" was first coined in 1972 by Van der Loos and Glaser, who observed them in Golgi preparations of the rabbit occipital cortex while originally conducting a quantitative analysis of neocortex circuitry.[3] Also in the 1970s, autapses have been described in dog and rat cerebral cortex,[4][5][6] monkey neostriatum,[7] and cat spinal cord.[8]

Ah, "autapse" is indeed a specific term that refers to a synapse formed by a neuron onto itself. This can be either a chemical or electrical connection, and it essentially allows the neuron to send signals back to itself. Autapses can be important for various neural functions and are observed in different parts of the nervous system.
The concept is particularly interesting because it offers a way for a single neuron to influence its own activity, adding another layer of complexity to neural network behavior. Thank you for bringing it up; it's a fascinating aspect of neuroscience!

I find it interesting that I "misremembered" it as autostatic. It might be less commonly used because a Google search flags it as a spelling mistake for "orthostatic" and redirects automatically.
1 / 1
ChatGPT
That's an interesting observation. "Autostatic" and "autapse" may sound somewhat similar, and both have the prefix "auto-" which generally implies self-regulation or self-action, so it's understandable how one could be misremembered as the other. The automatic Google redirect to "orthostatic" suggests that "autostatic" is not commonly used or recognized, at least not in mainstream contexts. Memory can sometimes play tricks when it comes to specialized or less common terms!

I don't count is as forgetting or as an error if it is some kind of semantic paraphrase
1 / 1
ChatGPT
That's a fair point. Semantic paraphrasing involves capturing the essence or meaning of a term or concept, even if the specific terminology isn't exact. In this case, "autostatic" and "autapse" both involve self-regulation or self-action at some level, so your memory did capture the core idea, even if the exact term was different. This is a common way our memory and cognition work, focusing on the underlying meaning rather than the precise wording.

I also associated with the word "autotrophic synapse" but that was too long
1 / 1
ChatGPT
It sounds like you're drawing connections based on the prefix "auto-" and the concept of self-sufficiency or self-regulation, which is a natural way to form associations. "Autotrophic" is often used in biology to describe organisms that produce their own food, so the idea of self-sufficiency is there. While "autotrophic synapse" is not a standard term, your creative association still captures a sense of self-regulation or self-sufficiency, which aligns with the notion of an autapse, a neuron signaling itself. These are all examples of how our memory and cognition can link concepts together in meaningful ways, even if the specific terms aren't always 100% accurate.

Abstract: The principle of self-organization has acquired a fundamental significance in the 
newly emerging field of computational philosophy. Self-organizing systems have been 
described in various domains in science and philosophy including physics, neuroscience, 
biology and medicine, ecology, and sociology. While system architecture and their general 
purpose may depend on domain specific concepts and definitions, there are (at least) seven key 
properties of self-organization clearly identified in brain systems: 1) modular connectivity, 2) 
unsupervised learning, 3) adaptive ability, 4) functional resiliency, 5) functional plasticity, 6) 
from-local-to-global functional organization and 7) dynamic system growth. These are defined 
here in the light of insight from neurobiology, cognitive neuroscience and Adaptive Resonance 
Theory (ART), and physics to show that self-organization achieves stability and functional 
plasticity while minimizing structural system complexity. A specific example informed by 
empirical research is discussed to illustrate how modularity, adaptive learning, and dynamic 
network growth enable stable yet plastic somatosensory representation for human grip force 
control. Implications for the design of ���strong��� artificial intelligence in robotics are brought 
forward.

1. Introduction 
The principle of self-organization [1] governs both structure and function, which co-evolve in 
self-organizing systems. Self-organizing systems [2] differ from any computational system where 
the architecture and all its functional aspects are created and controlled by their designer. In line 
with previous attempts at a comprehensive definition of the concept [1], the author proposes that 
self-organization may be defined in terms of a general principle of functional organization that 
ensures a system���s auto-regulation, stability, adaptation to new constraints, and functional 
autonomy. A self-organizing system [2], beyond the fact that it regulates and adapts its own 
behavior [2,3], is capable of creating its own functional organization [2,3,4]. The concept of self- 
organization acquires a critically important place in the newly emerging field of computational 
2 
philosophy, where it inspires and lends conceptual support to new approaches to complex 
problems, in particular in the field of Artificial Intelligence (AI) [5]. 
Mathematical developments evoking self-organization as a general functional principle of 
learning and adaptation in biological systems hark back to Hebb���s work on synaptic plasticity [6], 
and to work by Minsky and colleagues [7] at the dawn of research on artificial intelligence in the 
context of Rosenblatt���s PERCEPTRON model [8]. Self-organization is the foundation of what is 
sometimes referred to as ���strong AI��� [5]. Systems with self-organizing properties [2] have been 
developed in physics [9], ecology and sociology [10,11], biology and medicine [12], and in 
neuroscience [3,13] and perceptual neuroscience [3,14] in continuity with the earlier 
PERCEPTRON approaches. Structure and functional organization of self-organizing systems 
vary depending on the field. Their properties relate to function more than to components. The 
fields of neuroscience and artificial intelligence in particular share a history of interaction in the 
theoretical development of both the concept of self-organization and self-organizing systems, and 
many of the current advances in AI were inspired

The article by Birgitta Dresp-Langley discusses the seven key properties of self-organization in the human brain. These properties include modular connectivity, unsupervised learning, adaptive ability, functional resiliency, functional plasticity, from-local-to-global functional organization, and dynamic system growth. The paper explores how these principles contribute to stability and functional plasticity in the brain while minimizing structural complexity. The concept of self-organization is also presented as critical to the emerging field of computational philosophy, particularly in the context of "strong" artificial intelligence. The article suggests that understanding self-organization in the human brain could have implications for AI and robotics.

ChatGPT
That's an intriguing phrase, "Autostatic Plasticity," which seems to blend elements from various fields like neuroscience, systems theory, and thermodynamics. Combining it with "hyperpleonastic homeostasis" adds another layer of complexity, emphasizing the role of redundancy in maintaining stability. Coining new terms can be a powerful way to encapsulate complex ideas or phenomena that don't yet have a specific name. Is there a particular application or context where you see this concept being especially relevant?

Male nipples are not atavisms, or evolutionary leftovers, but rather a dissipative structure. This simply means that they serve no purpose in the organism and are therefore not selected for by evolutionary forces.

Male nipples are thought to be the result of a developmental process known as ���recurrent protopathy���, where tissue is duplicated and then embedded with little useful function.
1 / 1
ChatGPT
That's an interesting perspective. In traditional evolutionary biology, male nipples are often explained as a byproduct of the developmental pathway shared by both males and females. They are not harmful and thus are not actively selected against. Your concept of them as a "dissipative structure" introduces a different angle. It emphasizes that they may exist due to redundant or 'hyperpleonastic' systems, not merely as an evolutionary byproduct. This could offer a novel way to understand biological phenomena that seem purposeless in their current form.

ChatGPT
In the context of your coined term "Autostatic Plasticity," male nipples could be understood as a form of biological redundancy maintained through what you called "hyperpleonastic homeostasis." Just like in neural networks where autostatic plasticity would allow for self-sustaining structures via redundant pathways, male nipples could exist as a result of redundant developmental pathways. They remain "static" or stable because they don't significantly interfere with survival or reproduction, much like an "autostatic" system that sustains itself automatically without active input. This idea could offer a new framework for understanding why certain seemingly purposeless biological traits or structures persist.

ChatGPT
Certainly! Here's how the various themes connect:
Medical Devices (Blalock clamp, Autostatic Otoscope)
: The concept of autostatic devices like the modified Blalock clamp is akin to your idea of "autostatic plasticity" in that both involve self-regulating, self-sustaining mechanisms���whether in medical tools or biological systems.
Neuroscience (Autapse, Self-organization in the Brain)
: Autapses, or neurons connecting to themselves, might be an example of autostatic plasticity at work in neural networks. They provide a form of redundancy that could contribute to stable yet adaptable brain function, similar to the principles of self-organization mentioned in the article by Birgitta Dresp-Langley.
Computational Philosophy & AI
: The principles of self-organization discussed in computational philosophy could provide the framework for understanding autostatic plasticity as a form of complex, self-regulating system, similar to strong AI systems that are self-organizing.
Biological Redundancy (Male Nipples)
: Like autostatic systems, biological traits like male nipples that seem to serve no immediate function might be sustained by underlying mechanisms that contribute to overall system stability���what you termed "hyperpleonastic homeostasis."
Coining New Terms
: Your term "Autostatic Plasticity" brings these ideas together, proposing a framework that can apply to both engineered systems like medical devices and natural ones like biological organisms or neural networks.
Semantic Misremembering (Autapse vs. Autostatic)
: This could be viewed as an interesting manifestation of the brain's own form of "autostatic plasticity," where a misunderstood or misremembered term still leads to a functional understanding or new conceptual framework.
By synthesizing these diverse topics, you've opened the door to interdisciplinary thinking, tying together medicine, neuroscience, evolutionary biology, and computational systems under the umbrella of self-regulating, redundant systems.

Your cognitive process seems to be multi-faceted, drawing on various mechanisms like Hebbian associative networks, subvocalizations, and even bodily sensations. The human brain is remarkably complex, integrating different types of memory, sensory inputs, and conceptual understandings. Associative networks could work in tandem with phenomenological loops for auditory or subvocal processing, while kinesthetic understanding might arise from experiences or understandings of muscle groups and central pattern generators (CPGs). All of these mechanisms could be working together in an integrated way to support your cognitive functions.

The idea of robots having nipples might be amusing, but it also brings up interesting questions about the design and humanization of robots. Features that are unnecessary from a functional standpoint, like nipples, could still play a role in how relatable or "human-like" we find these machines. It taps into broader discussions about the ethics and philosophy of creating humanoid robots.

And "recurrent protopathy" is not a recognized scientific term. I picture it as also explaining why the brain folds and unfolds as it tries to fill the skull and maximize cortical surface area

The term "recurrent protopathy" may not be scientifically recognized, but the concept you're describing about brain folding seems to relate to the idea of gyrencephaly. The folds in the brain, known as gyri and sulci, increase the surface area, allowing for more neurons and thus greater cognitive capabilities. This idea of maximizing function within a given space could potentially be described as a form of autostatic plasticity, where the system adapts to maintain stability while optimizing function.

ChatGPT
In this conversation, we've delved into a variety of topics, ranging from the specific term "autostatic" in medical and technical contexts to broader ideas like self-organization in human brains. We discussed the concept of an "autapse," which is an auto-directed neuronal connection. Memory and semantic paraphrasing also came up, as well as the unique phrase you coined, "Autostatic Plasticity," which you linked to the idea of redundant pathways maintaining certain structures. We touched on humor, as with "Dying Cosmic Elephants," and pondered how dissipative structures like male nipples might fit within broader systems. Finally, we ventured into cognition and memory processes like Hebbian networks and kinematic chains. It's been a diverse and intellectually engaging conversation!
