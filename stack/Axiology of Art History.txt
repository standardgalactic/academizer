Here is the original poem, could I get a more psychoanalytical approach to an analysis, taking into account Adlerian psychology:

What The Birds Are Tweeting

I'm designing an auditory operating system where each subject is given a tree assigned a bird that tweets its name.

And then I started talking to myself out loud and so decided to grab a quote.

It's an arbitrary system place to start an ecosystem.

I started talking out loud saying even though you'll be able to think with it, because that is part of what humans do, it's not a mind and it's not self-aware, and you can walk around in it like a memory palace.

And I looked around and I saw that I was surrounded by an eternal sacrifice of animals.

I said, killing animals is not a good place to start an ecosystem.

So the birds are saying, don't ban household cats, ban cars.

Ban paving parking lots,

And build eternal skyscrapers that reach 1,000 meters above sea level.

Birds don't know what they're talking about.

All they're doing is announcing their location

And their love interests.

There's already a Twitter going on and if our phones start listening to us all the time

This is what they'll hear, if we're still alive in the era of birds.

They're saying ban household cats or keep them contained.

They're saying allow Australia's ecosystem to infiltrate the world.

Build 1,000-foot skyscrapers into the air.

Can you hear it?

Anyways, that's all I got to say.

The poem can be viewed through the lens of Adlerian psychology, particularly in terms of the speaker's striving for superiority and the tension between social interest and individualism.
The concept of an auditory operating system can be seen as a representation of the speaker's desire for control and mastery over their environment. This can be interpreted as a manifestation of their striving for superiority, a fundamental drive in Adlerian psychology.
However, the speaker's recognition of the arbitrary nature of the system suggests a degree of humility and an acknowledgment of the limitations of individual control. This reflects a healthy balance between the drive for superiority and the need for social interest.
The reference to the sacrifice of animals and the critique of anthropocentrism can be seen as a reflection of the speaker's concern for the greater good and their sense of social responsibility. This highlights the importance of social interest in Adlerian psychology, which emphasizes the value of community and cooperation in achieving individual and societal goals.

Latin Poetry for Science

Artis munus est hominem ex rerum merum rerum ad regna bona levare, e rebus mundi circa nos aliquid creare, quod non est mundus, sed pretium, aliquid novum ac pulchrum, non facere. Tem, sed tamquam revelatio pulchritudinis ac valoris mundi quod aliter videre non possumus.

The role of art is to lift humanity from mere things to the realms of the good, to create something out of the things of the world around us, which is not of this world, but valuable, something new and beautiful, not just for the sake of making it, but as a revelation of the beauty and value of the world that we cannot otherwise see.
