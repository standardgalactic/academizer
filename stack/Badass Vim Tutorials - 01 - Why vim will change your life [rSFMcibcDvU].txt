So, you've probably heard about this whole VIM thing people are doing these days, right?
This text editor that's been around for a long time and somehow or another, it's a dinosaur.
Bones have survived throughout the eons and people still use it.
Why is that?
That's because VIM is awesome and if you use VIM, you'll be awesome too.
Think about it.
Who uses COBOL anymore?
COBOL, yeah.
Nobody uses COBOL anymore.
You know why?
Because COBOL got outdated because it, like most other software programming languages
frameworks, whatever, has seen its time and it's gone because other better things have
come out.
As long as code is being written in text, VIM will be applicable.
And I dare say that being the case, learning how to program VIM is probably the single
best investment you can make in terms of being a good programmer.
VIM is all about taking the amount of time it takes from getting ideas in your brain
through your fingers into your computer screen.
As long as you're able to do that efficiently, you will consistently code faster.
You will consistently have more time really to think about the things that are going on
because you're not spending it, wasting it, trying to get things typed in right into
your computer because you'll just be doing it already.
So that being the case, I think you should give this a shot.
You just might like it.
But anyway, yeah, that's what this is all about.
This course is to help you get over the first couple of humps into getting into VIM and once
you get comfortable with it, you're going to fall in love.
It'll be amazing.
Try it out.
