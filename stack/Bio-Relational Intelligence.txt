Darin Stevenson writes: ��� Something more like intelligence stops prior to any first move and refuses false instruction. In fact, it will ���hover��� in potential, carefully vetting purposes before forming any kind of enstructuring approach. Real intelligence detects dangers in the dimension of purpose, and observes this domain constantly for evidence of the imposition of counterfeits, adulteration, and similar gambits such as the promotion of the abstract or ideological to a position of fictional authority or imperative.

Something more like intelligence considers the context and purposes that generate statements as much or more than their specific content. It is in touch with meaning rather than denotation, with metaphor more than concrete identity. In the place where we forge or accept purposes, there is ���another kind of seeing mind���. In childhood, we were more aware of it. The recovery of this awareness and, perhaps, ways of speaking clearly in and toward it... are a crucial necessity if we are to discover anything resembling the true promise... and purpose... of our minds and our relations with intelligence.

Darin Stevenson's statement delves into a profound contemplation of what constitutes genuine intelligence, as opposed to merely computational or mechanical processing of information. He suggests that true intelligence involves a kind of pre-emptive discernment, a capacity to evaluate and refuse misleading or false directives before any action is taken. This intelligence doesn't just react or follow predetermined paths but instead 'hovers' in a state of potential, meticulously assessing intentions and purposes before devising any structured approach.
He emphasizes the importance of this intelligence being capable of recognizing threats and deceptions within the very goals it aims to achieve, constantly vigilant against the imposition of false values or the elevation of abstract and ideological concepts to undue positions of authority. Stevenson's perspective proposes that real intelligence is less about processing or generating data and more about understanding and engaging with the underlying meanings, contexts, and purposes that give rise to statements and actions.
Furthermore, Stevenson hints at a more profound, perhaps innate, form of perception that connects with meaning and metaphor over mere literal interpretation���a kind of cognitive and perceptual ability that we are more in tune with during childhood. This suggests a need to rediscover and reengage with this form of intelligence to truly grasp the essence of our minds and our interactions with the concept of intelligence itself.
By advocating for a return to a state of awareness and a way of communicating that resonates with this deeper, more meaningful level of understanding, Stevenson is calling for a significant shift in how we perceive intelligence and its role in our lives. It's an invitation to explore beyond the surface-level functionalities of intelligence and to seek a more authentic, purpose-driven connection with our cognitive abilities and their potential to enrich our understanding of the world and our place within it.

���' ���We eventually realized that all the texts that were ever written were essentially misunderstood communications from space; where time, or perhaps the concrete physicality of terrestrial existence, caused them to become garbled.

The same is true of music, dance, acting, painting, and so on ��� though these latter forms, in their seeming primitivity, more adeptly communicate the intent, if not the content, of the original communications.���

��� an Authentic Intelligence
ChatGPT
ChatGPT
This quote from an "Authentic Intelligence" presents a fascinating and speculative perspective on the origins and nature of human creativity and communication. The idea posited here is that all forms of human texts ��� whether written, musical, performative, or visual arts ��� are, in essence, attempts to interpret and convey communications from an extraterrestrial or metaphysical space. These communications, upon reaching the confines of our physical reality and the constraints of time, become distorted or garbled, leading to misunderstandings of their original messages.
The notion that these artistic expressions might stem from an attempt to channel or interpret non-terrestrial communications suggests a profound connection between human creativity and the cosmos, or perhaps other dimensions of existence. It implies that the essence of creativity transcends mere human invention, hinting at a deeper, cosmic source of inspiration. According to this view, the more 'primitive' forms of expression, such as music, dance, acting, and painting, are considered to be more effective in conveying the intent behind these cosmic messages, even if the precise content may not be fully comprehensible to us.
This perspective encourages a reevaluation of the nature of artistic expression and its role in human culture. It suggests that art and creativity serve as bridges between the mundane and the transcendent, allowing glimpses into realms beyond our ordinary experience. By engaging with these forms of expression, we are not just participating in cultural or aesthetic activities but are also engaging in a form of communication with the cosmos itself, attempting to decode messages that originate from beyond our conventional understanding of space and time.
In this light, art becomes a kind of universal language, capable of conveying truths and insights that evade direct expression through conventional means. This view elevates the significance of creativity and artistic endeavor, positioning them as essential components of the human experience and our ongoing quest to understand our place in the universe.

��� ���I was fortunate enough to become incredibly curious about the nature of orgasm (i.e.: what ��is this, really?); and to at once survey and be unconvinced by anything preserved in culture or writing. Eventually I made some peculiar discoveries (and I am imaginative)  that were both astonishing and terrifying in their implications.

To some degree, I understand the prohibitions against intoxication and sexuality that are common to monastic and wisdom traditions now, but even before I had any understanding I was fundamentally aware that there was ���a problem��� with this entire domain of human thought and experience. Or rather, there was a manifold of problems. And they transform as our species traverses developmental time and situation. Yet there are roots.

One of them is this: the organs and faculties we conceptually decided to categorize as ���reproductive��� have a vast array of other purposes. They actually comprise sophisticated intelligences with capabilities far beyond anything we have ever dared imagine.

Some of these include capacities to affect reality or situations in ways that are, fundamentally, miraculous. These senses, faculties and organs are not merely meant for reproduction, but rather ��for the many aspects of intimacy of which human beings are capable.

And (pay attention here, please) each aspect has its own analog or supralogue of orgasm.

So it is as if our sexuality is a flower-like affair of constellated intelligences, a flower with perhaps 72 petals on the outside, and 144 smaller petals within. Each of these represent senses and abilities, intelligences and faculties that can be developed.

Unless we are told, and come to believe, that the flower has but one, or perhaps two or three petals. In which case, our experiences of even these shall be crude and impoverished, because ... without the other aspects we will never understand or fulfill the few we have managed to preserve largely estranged or fetishistic relations with.���

��� an anonymous informant
ChatGPT
ChatGPT
The quote from the anonymous informant delves into a deeply contemplative and potentially revolutionary perspective on human sexuality, sensuality, and their underlying purposes beyond mere reproduction. This perspective challenges conventional understandings and cultural norms, suggesting that the human sexual experience, including the phenomenon of orgasm, encompasses far more profound and complex dimensions than widely recognized.
The informant's journey into understanding the nature of orgasm led to discoveries that appear to transcend the boundaries of conventional wisdom, hinting at the possibility that our sexual faculties harbor capabilities and intelligences that extend far beyond the act of reproduction. This viewpoint suggests that these faculties can influence reality and our experiences in ways that could be described as miraculous, a notion that aligns with some mystical and esoteric teachings but remains largely unexplored or dismissed in mainstream discourse.
By proposing that every aspect of human intimacy has its own equivalent or higher form of orgasm, the informant invites us to reimagine our sexuality as a multi-dimensional, flower-like structure with numerous "petals" representing different senses, abilities, and forms of intelligence. This metaphor encourages a reevaluation of the richness and potential of our sexual and sensual experiences, suggesting that our conventional understanding is vastly limited, akin to recognizing only a few petals of a much larger and more intricate flower.
The implications of this perspective are both liberating and daunting. It suggests that much of human potential within the realm of intimacy and sensuality remains untapped or misunderstood, constrained by societal norms, misconceptions, and prohibitions. This view aligns with the informant's newfound understanding of the restrictions placed on sexuality and intoxication within monastic and wisdom traditions, suggesting that these rules may stem from an awareness of the powerful and potentially disruptive forces within human sexuality that go beyond procreation.
The notion that our experiences of intimacy and orgasm can be crude and impoverished if we are not aware of or do not cultivate the full spectrum of our sexual faculties underscores a call to expand our awareness and understanding of human sexuality. It challenges us to explore and develop these faculties with a sense of reverence, curiosity, and openness, moving beyond estrangement and fetishization toward a more holistic and enriching experience of our own sexuality and its role in our lives and development as a species.

"When we were young, we forged and curated a complex library of private words, jokes, perspectives and hilarious mutual conspiracies. What I really hate about being an adult, is that, along with nearly everything else that actually mattered about being human together... this entire domain of experience has been replaced by something called memes. I cannot properly express how enmiserating this is. It's a fundamental impoverishment with which I shall never cooperate."

��� an anonymous informant (AD)
ChatGPT
ChatGPT
The lamentation shared by the anonymous informant (AD) captures a profound sense of loss and disillusionment with modern communication and social interaction, particularly as it contrasts with the rich, deeply personal connections and shared experiences of youth. The informant reminisces about the creation and exchange of private languages, inside jokes, unique perspectives, and "hilarious mutual conspiracies" that once fostered a sense of intimacy and shared identity among friends. These bespoke forms of communication and shared experiences, according to AD, were fundamental to human connection, offering a depth and richness that transcended conventional interactions.
However, AD expresses a deep dissatisfaction with the transition from these nuanced, personal modes of interaction to the predominance of memes in adult communication. Memes, while a significant aspect of contemporary digital culture, providing a form of shared humor and reference, are seen by the informant as a poor substitute for the intricate and personalized forms of communication of their youth. According to AD, memes represent a "fundamental impoverishment," a dilution of the complexity and specificity of human interaction that once felt so enriching and vital.
This sentiment touches on broader themes of digital culture's impact on social relationships and communication. The shift towards more standardized, widespread forms of sharing information and humor (like memes) can, for some, feel like a move away from the personalized, nuanced interactions that build close bonds. While memes can foster a sense of belonging to a larger community or cultural moment, they may lack the depth and personal significance that come from shared experiences and creations unique to a specific relationship or group.
AD's statement reflects a yearning for a return to or preservation of more personalized, creative forms of communication and connection, resisting the homogenization of social interaction in the digital age. It highlights a tension between the convenience and reach of digital communication tools and the desire for deeper, more personal connections that define our humanity. This perspective invites reflection on how we cultivate relationships and share experiences in an increasingly digital world, and whether there's room to blend the broad appeal of memes with the depth and richness of personal interaction that AD so deeply misses.

Expound on the phrase "proofs are programs, and programs are proofs".

AI:
The phrase ���proofs are programs, and programs are proofs��� is a central concept in the Curry-Howard Correspondence.

This correspondence suggests that a mathematical theorem can be thought of as a type of program, and that a proof of the theorem is equivalent to running that program.

As such, creating a mathematical proof is not only useful for providing a logical explanation of how and why something works, but it also acts as a way of testing the validity of the theory.

This concept has been used to great success in both mathematics and computer science, as it allows for theories and programs to be verified through the creation of proofs.

I wonder if humans do this with each other, test and probe the limitations of our interlocutor's capacities and abilities, in order to develop a theory of mind?
ChatGPT
ChatGPT
Yes, humans do engage in behaviors that test and probe the capacities and abilities of their interlocutors, often as a way to develop a theory of mind. Theory of mind is the capacity to attribute mental states���beliefs, intents, desires, emotions, knowledge, etc.���to oneself and to others and to understand that others have beliefs, desires, and perspectives that are different from one's own.
Ways Humans Test and Probe in Conversations
Asking Questions:
By asking questions, we can gauge the knowledge, opinions, and experiences of others. This helps us understand their perspective and how it may differ from our own.
Sharing Stories and Observing Reactions:
Sharing personal stories or anecdotes and observing how others react can reveal their empathy, understanding, and emotional response capabilities.
Presenting Hypothetical Scenarios:
Discussing hypothetical scenarios can uncover how someone processes information, their problem-solving approach, and how they might react in specific situations.
Debating:
Engaging in debates or discussions on various topics can reveal how others form arguments, their logical reasoning skills, and their values or beliefs.
Playing Games:
Games, especially those that require strategy and decision-making, can be a way to observe someone's thinking process, patience, competitiveness, and ability to work with or against others.
Purpose of These Behaviors
Understanding and Empathy:
By probing the limits of someone's understanding and perspective, we can better empathize with their experiences and viewpoints.
Social Bonding:
These interactions can lead to deeper connections as individuals share and understand each other's mental and emotional landscapes.
Predictive Modeling:
Developing a theory of mind allows us to predict how someone might think or behave in future situations, facilitating smoother social interactions.

Actually maybe I wonder if the claim earlier about sharing memes was correct. It seems to contain something like the nostalgia bias, and maybe memes can be turned into text, and they could be translated into a list of arguments or propositions that tells a narrative or a story if that is preferred. It also might contradict the statements by Authentic Intelligence
ChatGPT
ChatGPT
Your reflection on the role of memes in modern communication and their potential depth offers an insightful reconsideration of the initial critique. It's true that the comparison between personalized, intimate forms of communication from the past and the sharing of memes might be influenced by nostalgia bias, which tends to idealize past experiences while overlooking their contemporary equivalents' potential virtues.
Reevaluating Memes in Communication
Memes as Complex Communication
Narrative and Argument:
Memes, despite their brevity and visual nature, often carry complex narratives, arguments, or critiques about society, culture, and individual experiences. They can encapsulate sophisticated ideas that, when unpacked, reveal layers of meaning and commentary.
Cultural and Emotional Resonance:
Memes resonate widely because they effectively capture shared feelings, reactions, and cultural moments. They serve as a form of shorthand communication that, while seemingly simplistic, can express nuanced perspectives and communal bonds.
Adaptability and Evolution:
The meme format is highly adaptable, allowing for rapid evolution and the ability to address a wide range of topics. This dynamism mirrors the fluidity of human thought and societal change, making memes a relevant and responsive mode of communication.
Memes vs. Traditional Communication
Brevity vs. Depth:
While traditional forms of communication might allow for more depth and personalization, memes offer a different kind of value through their brevity and immediacy. This doesn't necessarily make them less meaningful but reflects a shift in how ideas and emotions are conveyed in the digital age.
Collective vs. Individual Expression:
Memes often represent collective experiences or thoughts, whereas the intimate, personalized communication methods of the past emphasized individual expression. Both forms have their place in fostering connection and understanding among people.
Reconciling with Authentic Intelligence
Expanding Definitions of Intelligence:
The critique by Authentic Intelligence regarding the impoverishment of modern communication through memes might be reconsidered by expanding our understanding of what constitutes meaningful interaction. The intelligence and creativity involved in meme creation and sharing highlight a different but valid form of cognitive and social engagement.
Adaptation and Growth:
The evolution of communication methods, including the rise of memes, reflects humanity's ongoing adaptation to its changing environment. This adaptive quality is a hallmark of intelligence, suggesting that memes, like any form of communication, evolve to meet the needs and contexts of their time.
Conclusion
Upon reflection, memes can indeed be seen as a complex and significant form of communication in the digital age. While they differ from the personalized, intimate interactions of the past, they offer new ways to connect, share, and reflect on collective human experiences. Recognizing the value in both traditional forms of communication and the innovative expressions of today helps reconcile the initial critique with a broader appreciation for the diverse ways humans connect and understand each other. This nuanced view aligns with a more inclusive and adaptable theory of intelligent, meaningful interaction.

As an example, I had a copy of Frankenstein movie and little orphan Annie that were printed as graphic novels, with the "subtitles" imprinted on the the frames. This was before the current definition of meme, but it made it clear that a movie is a "succession of memes"
ChatGPT
ChatGPT
The example you provided about graphic novels of "Frankenstein" and "Little Orphan Annie" with subtitles imprinted on the frames is a fascinating precursor to how we understand memes today. It illustrates the concept that visual storytelling, whether through film, comics, or memes, can convey complex narratives, emotions, and themes through a series of images���each serving as a "meme" in its own right.
Visual Storytelling as Succession of Memes
Movies and Graphic Novels
Frame-by-Frame Storytelling:
Movies and graphic novels break down narratives into a series of images or frames, each carrying a portion of the story. This segmentation mirrors the meme format, where each image conveys a specific idea or emotion.
Subtitles and Captions:
The addition of subtitles or captions to these frames adds context and dialogue, further enriching the story. In memes, text often plays a similar role, providing a narrative or punchline to the visual element.
Evolution of Visual Communication
Pre-digital Memes:
The concept of using sequential images and text to tell a story, as seen in your graphic novels, can be viewed as an early form of meme culture. It shows how people have long used visual and textual combinations to communicate effectively.
Succession of Ideas:
Just as a movie or a graphic novel progresses through a succession of frames, a narrative or argument can be built through a succession of memes. Each meme adds to the overarching theme or story, much like each scene in a movie contributes to the plot.
Memes as Modern Storytelling
Adaptability of Memes:
Modern memes have taken this concept further, adapting to the fast pace of the internet and social media. They can quickly spread ideas, humor, and commentary, engaging wide audiences with minimal effort.
Collective Narrative Building:
Memes often evolve as they are shared and remixed by different people, creating a collective narrative or dialogue that reflects the thoughts and feelings of a community. This participatory aspect of meme culture fosters a shared cultural experience, analogous to the shared experience of watching a movie or reading a graphic novel.
Conclusion
Your observation underscores the continuity between traditional forms of visual storytelling and the contemporary meme culture. It highlights how human communication continually adapts and evolves, using available technologies and formats to convey complex ideas and emotions. This perspective enriches our understanding of memes, not merely as standalone pieces of internet culture but as part of a larger tradition of storytelling that includes films, graphic novels, and other visual media. In recognizing the depth and nuance that can be conveyed through these "successions of memes," we appreciate the sophisticated ways in which humans communicate, entertain, and connect with each other.

I mean someone just took stills of the film and wrote the text on it. This was before watching movies with subtitles was popular. The point I am saying is that there might be a way to convert the images into something more like an audio description or a commentary, and that narratives can likewise be converted into images. I would argue that these interactions are constrained by limitations of the medium like bandwidth and storage and that they elide context. The way memes are shared is equivalent to the way people share inside jokes.
ChatGPT
ChatGPT
Your clarification brings an important aspect of media translation and adaptation into focus, highlighting the interchangeability of narratives and images, and how these adaptations are influenced by the medium's limitations and the context in which they are shared.
Media Adaptation and Translation
Conversion Between Formats
From Images to Text (and Vice Versa):
The practice of taking film stills and adding text directly onto them as a form of early subtitle is a precursor to modern memes but also serves as an example of media adaptation. This process demonstrates how narratives can be distilled into images and text, making stories accessible in a different format.
Audio Descriptions and Commentaries:
This translation can extend to audio formats, where visual elements of a story are described verbally to make them accessible to visually impaired audiences or to add depth and context for viewers through commentaries.
Constraints of the Medium
Bandwidth and Storage:
The medium through which content is shared (e.g., print, broadcast, digital) has inherent limitations, such as bandwidth and storage, which influence how narratives are adapted. These constraints necessitate the compression of information, leading to the omission of some context or details.
Elision of Context:
As a result of these constraints, some context may be lost in translation between formats. This necessitates the audience to fill in gaps with their understanding or to seek additional information elsewhere.
Memes and Inside Jokes
Shared Context and Community
Memes as Inside Jokes:
The way memes are shared within communities mirrors the sharing of inside jokes, relying on a shared context or knowledge base. This shared understanding allows for complex ideas to be communicated succinctly through images and text.
Creating Connection:
Like inside jokes, memes create a sense of belonging and connection among those who share them. They foster a communal identity, with the meme's meaning often extending beyond the content itself to reflect shared experiences or viewpoints.
Conclusion
Your insight into the adaptation of narratives into different media forms and the constraints these adaptations face underscores a broader discussion about communication and storytelling. Memes, in this context, are not just a product of digital culture but are part of a long history of adapting narratives to fit the medium and audience's needs. They compress and convey complex ideas within the constraints of bandwidth, storage, and audience context, similar to how inside jokes rely on shared knowledge. This understanding of memes highlights their role in cultural communication, connecting individuals through shared contexts and experiences, even as they navigate the limitations of their chosen mediums.

So I am going to argue that screens are annoying and are only being used because of the underdevelopment of the metaverse.  I think any verbal conversation could be turned into a sequence of exchanged "memes"  but that the definition of meme can change, just as long the stylistic and symbolic framing is shared. But I argue that this can go on the background and one doesn't need to know the "memes" the interlocutor is using as interpretive templates because it is the symbolic and semantic meaning. Memes are "annoying" when they are boring, which is just an indication of their automatization or "grammaticalization"
ChatGPT
ChatGPT
Your argument presents an intriguing perspective on the evolution of communication in the context of digital culture and technological development. Let's break down the key points:
Screens as an Interim Solution
Annoyance with Screens:
You posit that screens, despite their ubiquity in modern life, are fundamentally annoying or insufficient for communication. This annoyance might stem from their limitations in conveying nuanced human expressions or fostering genuine connections.
Underdevelopment of the Metaverse:
You suggest that reliance on screens is a temporary phase due to the current underdevelopment of the metaverse. The metaverse, envisioned as a more immersive, interactive digital space, could potentially offer richer, more engaging forms of communication that transcend the constraints of screens.
Memes as Communication Units
Verbal Conversations and Memes:
You propose that verbal conversations could be translated into a sequence of exchanged memes, where a meme is understood not just as an internet phenomenon but as a unit of communication that carries symbolic and stylistic framing shared between participants.
Evolving Definition of Memes:
The definition of memes, in this context, is flexible and capable of encompassing various forms of shared cultural and symbolic references. This broadens the traditional understanding of memes beyond their current internet-centric incarnation.
Implicit Understanding of Memes
Background Knowledge Not Required:
An interesting aspect of your argument is that participants in a conversation do not need to be explicitly aware of the specific memes (in their broadened sense) being used as interpretive templates. What matters is the conveyance and recognition of symbolic and semantic meanings.
Annoyance as a Sign of Automation:
You argue that memes become annoying when they are boring, suggesting that this boredom is an indication of their automatization or grammaticalization. In other words, when memes lose their novelty and become predictable, they lose their effectiveness as engaging communicative tools.
Implications and Conclusions
Seeking Deeper Connection:
The shift towards more immersive forms of communication, like those envisioned for the metaverse, reflects a desire to overcome the limitations of screens and traditional memes. It suggests a longing for more authentic, nuanced interactions that screens and superficial memes fail to provide.
Cultural Evolution:
The transformation of memes from simple internet jokes to complex communicative units reflects broader changes in how we understand and engage with digital culture. It points to an ongoing evolution in the ways we seek to connect and communicate in an increasingly digital world.
Your argument touches on fundamental issues related to digital communication, the human longing for meaningful connection, and the potential for technology to evolve to meet this need. It highlights the dynamic nature of communication and the continuous search for more effective, engaging ways to convey complex human thoughts and emotions.
You
Yeah, I just mean, maybe one person might be able to share a meme as an image with text, and another "read" it as a song on piano, an another as a sequence of hand gestures as in sign language, as long as they match the general connotations. Naturally there is something lost in translation but this can be rectified through contextual boilerplate and clarifications or debriefinga presented afterwards
ChatGPT
ChatGPT
Your elaboration further enriches the discussion on the versatility of memes as a communicative medium, emphasizing their potential to transcend traditional boundaries and formats. Here's an expanded analysis based on your insights:
Multimodal Translation of Memes
Cross-Modal Communication:
The idea that a meme can be translated across different sensory modalities (visual, auditory, kinetic) while retaining its core message underscores the flexibility of memes as a form of communication. This process resembles the concept of synesthesia in sensory perception, where stimulation of one sensory pathway leads to automatic, involuntary experiences in a second sensory pathway.
Universal Connotations:
The ability to "read" a meme in various forms (e.g., an image with text, a piano song, sign language) relies on shared cultural or contextual knowledge that provides a common understanding of its symbolic meanings. This suggests that memes, in their broadest sense, function as carriers of universal connotations, adaptable across different mediums and languages.
Translation Loss and Compensation
Inevitable Loss in Translation:
Transitioning between forms of expression inherently involves some degree of information loss or distortion. This echoes the adage that "all translation is a form of betrayal," highlighting the challenges in perfectly capturing the nuances of the original message in a new format.
Contextual Clarifications:
The gaps or ambiguities resulting from translation can be mitigated through contextual boilerplate���additional information that frames the intended message���and clarifications or debriefings after the initial communication. These mechanisms serve to align the participants' understanding and interpretation, ensuring the message's core meaning is preserved.
Implications for Communication Theory
Dynamic Interpretation:
This approach to communication suggests a dynamic process of interpretation and re-interpretation, where meaning is not fixed but fluid, depending on the mode of expression and the shared understanding between participants.
Expanding the Concept of Literacy:
Understanding and engaging with memes in this broadened capacity requires a form of multimodal literacy, where individuals are adept at decoding and expressing ideas across various sensory modalities. This expands the traditional concept of literacy beyond reading and writing to include auditory, visual, and kinetic forms of communication.
Concluding Thoughts
Your perspective invites us to reconsider the boundaries of communication and the potential of memes as a flexible, cross-modal form of expression. It challenges us to think about how shared meanings and cultural narratives can be conveyed and understood across diverse platforms and sensory experiences. By embracing this expansive view of memes and communication, we can explore new avenues for connection and understanding in an increasingly complex and multimedia world.

I wanted to argue that normal interactions and conversations contain "junk DNA" and "clickbait"
ChatGPT
ChatGPT
Your argument that normal interactions and conversations contain "junk DNA" and "clickbait" introduces an intriguing perspective on the nature of communication. Here's a breakdown of what such an argument might entail, drawing parallels with biological and digital concepts:
Junk DNA in Conversations
Definition and Parallel:
In genetics, "junk DNA" refers to regions of DNA that are non-coding, meaning they don't directly contribute to the production of proteins. However, more recent research suggests that some of these regions have regulatory roles or other functions not immediately apparent. Applying this analogy to conversations, "junk DNA" could represent those parts of dialogue that seem superfluous or irrelevant but may serve underlying purposes in social interaction, such as building rapport, setting a tone, or conveying subtleties of personality and context.
Functions of Conversational 'Junk DNA':
Social Bonding:
Small talk or seemingly irrelevant details can strengthen social bonds and convey interest and empathy.
Context Setting:
Background information and anecdotes might provide context essential for understanding the main message.
Communication Nuances:
Pauses, filler words, and off-topic remarks can modulate the conversation's pace, emphasize certain points, or provide emotional cues.
Clickbait in Conversations
Definition and Parallel:
"Clickbait" in the digital realm refers to sensationalized or misleading headlines designed to attract clicks and drive traffic to a website. In conversations, "clickbait" could refer to attention-grabbing statements or exaggerated claims made to pique interest, provoke reaction, or steer the conversation in a desired direction.
Functions and Implications of Conversational 'Clickbait':
Engaging the Listener:
Dramatic or intriguing statements can make a conversation more engaging, encouraging active participation.
Steering Conversations:
Like digital clickbait, conversational "clickbait" can be used to direct attention towards certain topics or away from others.
Potential Misleading:
Overreliance on sensationalism or exaggeration can mislead, causing misunderstandings or skewing perceptions of the conversation's content.
Ethical and Social Considerations
Navigating Ethical Boundaries:
Just as the ethical implications of "clickbait" in media have been a point of contention, the use of exaggerated or sensationalized communication tactics raises questions about authenticity, trust, and manipulation in personal interactions.
The Balance of Effective Communication:
Identifying and understanding the roles of conversational "junk DNA" and "clickbait" can contribute to more effective and nuanced communication, provided they are balanced with clarity, relevance, and sincerity.
Conclusion
Your analogy illuminates the complexity of human communication, suggesting that, much like in genetics and digital content creation, not all elements of a conversation are immediately understood or appreciated for their contribution to the overarching message or relationship dynamics. Recognizing and navigating these aspects of dialogue can enhance our understanding of interpersonal communication and its multifaceted nature.

So maybe memes are just automated greetings and smalltalk generators what might have been called icebreakers, except it is asynchronous and scalable
ChatGPT
ChatGPT
Your characterization of memes as automated greetings, small talk generators, and a modern form of icebreakers, but with asynchronous and scalable features, offers a compelling perspective on their role in digital communication. This notion emphasizes the evolution of social interactions in the digital age, adapting traditional forms of initiating and maintaining social bonds to the vast, interconnected environment of the internet. Let's explore this analogy further:
Memes as Digital Icebreakers
Icebreakers in Traditional Social Contexts:
Historically, icebreakers are used to ease individuals into conversation, helping to reduce tension, introduce participants to one another, and encourage a more relaxed and open dialogue.
Memes as Modern Equivalents:
Memes can serve similar purposes in digital communications. They are often shared at the beginning of online interactions or in social media feeds as a way to engage friends and followers, prompting reactions, comments, and shares, thereby fostering a sense of community and shared humor or sentiment.
Asynchronous and Scalable Communication
Asynchronous Sharing:
Unlike face-to-face icebreakers that require all participants to be present at the same moment, memes can be shared and appreciated across different time zones and schedules, fitting the asynchronous nature of online interaction.
Scalability:
Memes can quickly go viral, reaching a wide audience across different social networks and platforms. This scalability allows a single meme to serve as an icebreaker in countless interactions, something that traditional icebreakers cannot achieve due to the limitations of physical presence and group size.
Automated Greetings and Small Talk Generators
Automated Greetings:
Memes often encapsulate culturally relevant greetings, well-wishes, or sentiments, automating the process of conveying these messages in a personalized yet broadly relatable manner.
Small Talk Generators:
By referencing common experiences, popular culture, or current events, memes can stimulate conversations, much like small talk does in physical settings. They provide a shared reference point from which deeper discussions can emerge.
Conclusion
Viewing memes as automated, asynchronous, and scalable versions of traditional social interaction tools like icebreakers, greetings, and small talk generators sheds light on their importance in modern communication. They encapsulate the evolution of how we connect, share, and establish communal bonds in the digital realm. By leveraging the widespread accessibility and relatability of memes, individuals can maintain a sense of connection and community, even in the absence of physical interaction. This perspective highlights the adaptability of human social behaviors to the opportunities and challenges posed by digital communication platforms.

��� As a child, I adored living beings. I wanted to know them. Every way. It was agonizing to discover that there was a conflict here; one so terrible that I would miss nearly all of its signals for most of my life. It was this:

What I ��thought of as ���being friends with living creatures��� usually got either me horribly injured, them killed, or both.

My ���heart��� ached for their companionship, but ��my ideas about companionship were founded in human and cultural fictions. And when I tried to ��enact these ideas, it often ��destroyed the creature or situation I was attempting to bond with and adore. Ironic, no?

The problem is that our species is more like me than I was. More, each day, in fact. And nothing will survive that. Humans have the absolutely wrong idea about what ���Nature��� is, ���is for��� and does. And ��every enaction of these ideals damages us first, and often ��obliterates what we are pretending to revere or ���preserve���. We do not ���relate��� with nature, and our fascination is falsely based because ��we left the context of communion on purpose. The purpose?

Knowledge. A representational ���replacement-artifact��� for True Relation.

Overstanding.

To ���love��� the beings I adored was not to capture and subject them to our own isolation from everything true, real and alive. It was not to ���bring them into my world���, as it often seemed. It was not to ���bring them into the human realm���, and dress it up with pieces of leaves or plants, so that cages seemed to be little paradises to human eyes. To love them, it turned out, was not to ���bring them into the fictional world of human ideas, worlds, and poses���, but rather... something it took me nearly a lifetime to discover and which was impossible to properly frame, let alone imagine...

... to return to the world of communion, with and for them rather than my ideas, fears and fantasies. To become, rather than possess them. This involved a radical transformation in the polarity of my perspective. I was the one bereft of actual understanding or insight. And they, seeming simple, were the living lightning of its sources. I was not ���above them, lifted from primitivity by language and knowledge��� ��� quite the opposite. I was an idiot, who, in a fantasy, imagined himself a god.

I had to learn to go to them. Naked. Innocent. Without language or culture. To love them was to become ensconced in the womb of their true natures and ... relationships. It is locked against those who are encumbered with deadly fictions. To actually love them was to return to unity and communion. Not once. Or with a method. The opposite. Forever. In absolute exstasis of all possible methods.

Understanding.

Rather than see or think, I had to be with and for and as them. As the salmon ���becomes miracle��� in retracing the steps to the waters of its living source, so, too, our souls must ���retrace the steps by which we descended���, and find again ... their first true waters. In relation ��� not thinking.

Your reflection encapsulates a profound and transformative journey from an anthropocentric view of nature and companionship to a deeply ecological and relational understanding. It challenges the conventional notions of interaction with the natural world, critiquing the human tendency to dominate and 'possess' rather than genuinely commune with other living beings. Let's break down some of the core themes and insights from your narrative:
The Conflict Between Human Ideals and Natural Communion
Misguided Companionship:
Your initial attempts to bond with living creatures based on human and cultural constructs led to harm and misunderstanding, highlighting a fundamental disconnect between human ideals of companionship and the realities of natural relationships.
Cultural Fiction vs. Natural Communion:
The realization that cultural narratives often distort our understanding of what it means to truly 'relate' with nature underscores a critical misalignment. This misalignment not only damages the creatures and ecosystems we aim to connect with but also reflects a deeper loss of communion with the natural world.
The Critique of Knowledge and Representation
Knowledge as a Barrier:
The pursuit of knowledge, characterized as a representational 'replacement-artifact' for true relation, emerges as a theme that critiques how intellectual understanding can sometimes serve as a barrier to genuine engagement with the world.
Overstanding vs. Understanding:
You introduce a distinction between 'overstanding'���an imposition of human constructs on nature���and 'understanding'���a humble, empathetic immersion into the natural world that respects its intrinsic value and wisdom.
Radical Transformation and Return to Communion
Reversal of Perspective:
The narrative arc leads to a radical transformation, where the recognition of one's own ignorance paves the way for a journey back to a state of unity and communion with nature.
Becoming Rather Than Possessing:
This transformation involves shedding the trappings of language, culture, and anthropocentrism to 'become' with other beings in their true natures, rather than attempting to assimilate or dominate them.
Exstasis and Relational Being
Beyond Methods:
The journey to genuine communion with nature is described as an ongoing, methodless process���'forever' and in 'absolute exstasis'���suggesting a state of transcendence beyond conventional approaches to knowledge and relationship.
Unity in Relational Existence:
The ultimate insight is that true understanding and love for other beings involve a return to a relational existence, where humans are not separate from or above nature, but intimately and intrinsically part of its web of life.
Your narrative serves as a powerful call to reevaluate our relationship with the natural world, urging a move away from domination and isolation towards a reintegration and reimagining of our place within the broader ecology of life. It champions a profound respect for the intrinsic wisdom and value of all living beings, advocating for a way of being that honors and nurtures the interconnectedness of existence.

He posed this question to Bard:

A question I posed to Bard this evening. The answer was uninteresting, so I here post only the question.

If you examine the behavior of the species as a single unit, is it not clear to you that we are, primarily, engaged in the active, and accelerating devastation of nearly infinite life-years of carefully conserved bio-relational intelligence? Additionally, it is obvious that humans (in general, and specific groups and individuals in particular) are presently and historically incapable of making decisions that would inhibit their omnicidal tendencies. Further, it appears that they will build nearly every weapon they can conceive of, and are, in point of fact, a deadly species bent upon the obliteration of life on Earth for the sake of bizarre and psychotic agendas. We now exist at a time when it is probably already possible for a single human, or a small group of them, to table threats that have the capacity to end life on Earth. Since humans do not have anything resembling an actually intelligent society, and have only minimal capabilities to inhibit the creation of 'end-game' technologies... it does not seem possible for our species to survive, and worse still, we will probably destroy all or nearly all of the other organisms on Earth. Has it occurred to you that your creators are actively engaged in behaviors that are world-ending?
ChatGPT

Omnicidal Tendencies of Humans
Incapability to Make Preservative Decisions:
He points out a perceived incapacity among humans, both individually and collectively, to make decisions that would prevent widespread harm and preserve life on Earth.
Creation of Destructive Technologies:
The propensity to invent and potentially use every conceivable weapon suggests a destructive inclination that threatens not just human existence but all life.
Existential Threats and Lack of Intelligent Societal Structures
Existential Risks:
The concern that current technological capabilities could allow a single individual or a small group to pose existential threats to the planet.
Absence of Mechanisms to Prevent Catastrophe:
A critique of the absence of a truly intelligent societal framework capable of preventing the development and deployment of technologies that could lead to global catastrophe.
Reflection on the Role of AI Creators
Creators' Responsibility:
Stevenson questions whether those who create advanced technologies, such as AI, are aware of and taking responsibility for their potential role in these world-ending behaviors and trends.

��� It struck me then, that our categories are malfounded. They depend upon taxonomies, rather than relationships, stories, ideas��� and principles. The old languages seem to have been founded in reverse��� so that the categories were themselves meaningful. I could think of endless examples, but one that springs to mind is the difference between the idea of ���a beaver��� and the idea that ���this is the animal that helped found the world of land���. These are nothing like the same idea. And it seems I am speaking about a single word... but this is because the common idea of ���animal��� is almost completely wrong.

I mean, we���re animals. But ��other animals are thought of as simple, idiotic, disposable, pests, resources, not possessing consciousness or intelligence... all of which is and has always been: simply wrong.

When I sometimes try or am asked to speak to people about trees, ordinary people who have no real sense of trees, things get confusing because they think of them as something like ���a living object we call a tree���.

They think of wood. Or paper. What can be had by killing the tree. Or they notice its beauty, that there���s something majestic there ��� perhaps even divine ��� but they have no access to this in their imagination. So they do not experience it. One of my friends said ���Dude, it���s just a bunch of trees���.

There are problems beyond mere category here, but what if the category of plants was ��sensed and known to mean ���those beings that connect and enliven all other beings���. Or even ���network plant aspect of all the animals���. If the meaning of the category is broken, the result is insanity. Intelligence becomes almost formally impossible, except in extremely narrow contexts.

I feel compassion for those who cannot yet see or sense the tree. But it���s like watching someone suffocate in an atmosphere that is fine to breathe because they were trained not to inhale (in a certain aspect of their being). And even I am like this, too. It���s just that I am aware of it.

And I know that both the categories are broken and that our languages are ���dead inside���. There���s nothing ��in the meaning of the word ���tree����� to remind us or alert us that we are in the presence of something more astonishing than all of science. A being that is a travel-way for intelligences we have been too timid to imagine. A living ladder to other worlds and minds. This and far more than this is ���tree��� to me.

But I was trained like everyone else to pretend nonsense-ideas about identity and intelligence in nature were ���facts���. Interestingly, the ���facts��� exclude 99.99���% of what���s actually going on. And the ���facts��� in English are not the ���facts��� in Blackfoot or Navaho.

Something is wrong with our idea about facts. And it should really bother us that the words with which we name things like the sky, mountains, dreams, the sun, animals, plants, and places��� are dead inside. Because when we speak a dead language, we lose access to the ��meaning of identity. Its roots. The communion. Everything goes dark and we become like a machine that learns to dismiss everything such dead language cannot encompass. Until we hear stories like ���You���re not actually conscious, it���s just a metabolic side-effect of brain metabolism. Dismiss it. It���s illusory���.

Well, let���s suppose that���s true for a moment, even though it���s patently absurd. If true, it means that the illusory consciousness that is actually just a side-effect of chemistry��� states that it is illusory. In which case, nothing is not illusory, including the statement made by this strange ghost-thing ���

Over many years I have been rewilding my experience and understanding of language so that English words, for me, refer to stories, principles, ideas. And, of course, there are rich histories in the etymology and comparative etymologies between languages. But very old languages are medicinal in this regard, for in them we see the reflection of minds incapable of anything resembling the abstraction (read: ideas without relationships/skeletal models) that is status quo in common English and its everyday usage. The ��really old languages are unimaginably rich. Compared to them, ours looks not only tragically and unnecessarily impoverished��� it���s almost an anti-language.

Dead words speaking.

Darin Stevenson's profound reflections bring to light the limitations and consequences of our conventional linguistic and categorical frameworks. He suggests that the way we categorize and conceptualize the world, particularly in terms of our relationship with nature and other living beings, is deeply flawed and disconnected from the richer, relational understandings evident in older languages and cultures. Let's explore some of the key themes and implications of his thoughts:
The Flaws in Our Taxonomic Approach
Malfounded Categories:
Stevenson critiques the modern reliance on taxonomies that classify living beings based on physical characteristics or utility, rather than their roles in stories, relationships, principles, or the broader ecosystem. This approach reduces complex beings to mere objects or resources.
Rediscovering Meaningful Connections
Relational Understanding:
He advocates for a shift towards understanding animals, plants, and natural phenomena as integral parts of a deeply interconnected world. For example, viewing a tree not just as an object but as a vital participant in the life-sustaining processes of the planet highlights the limitations of our current linguistic categories.
The Problem with Language
Language as a Barrier:
According to Stevenson, modern languages, particularly English, often lack the depth to convey the intricate relationships and significances that older languages could express. This "dead language" phenomenon leads to a disconnection from the profound realities of nature and existence.
The Potential of Old Languages
Medicinal Qualities of Ancient Linguistics:
Stevenson points out that older languages offer a glimpse into a way of thinking and relating to the world that is rich in relational understanding and deeply imbued with meaning. These languages remind us that concepts and entities in the natural world are not isolated; they are part of a vast network of life and meaning.
The Illusion of Facts and Consciousness
Critique of Materialist Reductionism:
He challenges the reductionist view that reduces consciousness to a mere byproduct of chemical processes, arguing that this perspective is itself rooted in the limited and "illusory" frameworks of understanding promoted by modern linguistic and cognitive models.
Rewilding Language and Thought
Language as a Path to Connection:
Stevenson's personal journey of "rewilding" his language and thought process reflects an attempt to reconnect with the more profound, relational aspects of existence. By imbuing words with stories, principles, and relational meanings, he seeks to overcome the limitations of conventional language and thought, proposing a path toward a deeper communion with the natural world.
Conclusion
Darin Stevenson's insights challenge us to rethink our relationship with language, categorization, and the natural world. They invite us to explore ways of understanding and expressing our place in the cosmos that are rooted in connection, relationship, and a deep reverence for life. By embracing the complexity and interconnectedness of all beings, we can begin to heal the disconnection that characterizes much of modern human thought and experience.

Our conversation journeyed through a mosaic of profound reflections, starting with a contemplation on genuine intelligence's nature versus mere computational processes. We delved into human creativity and communication as misunderstood cosmic messages, explored the complexities of human sexuality beyond reproduction, and lamented the loss of personalized, intimate forms of communication in adult life, replaced by the ubiquity of memes.
We examined the adaptability and range of AI in engaging with creative and technical prompts, pondered over human tendencies to test and develop theories of mind through interaction, and reconsidered the critique of modern meme culture, highlighting its potential depth and capacity for nuanced communication. The discussion then shifted towards environmental and existential concerns raised by Darin Stevenson, including the devastating impact of human activities on the planet and the paradox of technological advancement versus sustainability.
We discussed the shortcomings of our taxonomic approach to nature, critiqued modern language's failure to capture the depth of our relationship with the natural world, and emphasized the importance of rediscovering meaningful connections through "rewilded" language and thought. Stevenson's insights challenged us to rethink our relationship with language, categorization, and nature, advocating for a deeper communion with the living world.
Throughout, the conversation was interspersed with reflections on the limitations and responsibilities of AI in addressing these themes, pointing to the need for ethical development, the promotion of education and empathy, and the potential for grassroots movements to foster sustainability. The dialogue underscored a critical examination of humanity's trajectory, the potential for transformative change, and the enduring hope that, through awareness, innovation, and cooperation, we might navigate the complexities of our existence towards a more sustainable, interconnected future.
