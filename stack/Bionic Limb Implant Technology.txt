Bionic Limb Implant Technology
Default (GPT-3.5)
Summary: First, the prosthetic limb receives information from the human body through implants. One method for this approach is to place an implant ��� usually a titanium screw ��� into the bone, allowing for the bionic arm to be easily attached. This process, called osseointegration, was pioneered in the 1950s and originally used for dental implants. In the present day context, this technology can be used in conjunction with electrodes placed inside the residual limb which enables the device to feed back information through the osseointegrated implant into the prosthesis. This data is then processed by an algorithm which subsequently determines the appropriate action ��� as an example let���s say that���s opening or closing the hand.

The prosthetic limb gathers data from the body via implants. An implant, often a titanium screw, is inserted into the bone to easily attach the bionic arm, a method called osseointegration which began in the 1950s for dental uses. Today, with electrodes in the remaining limb, this technology can relay information through the implant to the prosthesis. An algorithm then processes this information to perform actions, like opening or closing the hand.
One step further and we���re talking about intelligent prostheses equipped with microprocessors using artificial intelligence to interpret signals. Essentially, there are two processes that play into this concept
ChatGPT
. First, sensors in the prosthetic detect muscular movements and electrical signals from the user. Second, the onboard AI processes these signals to predict and execute the user's intended movement. This combination allows for smoother and more natural movements, adapting in real-time to the user's needs.
The focal point of this evolution is that ��� opposed to traditional prostheses, which need to be moved by muscle force ��� bionic limbs are powered by a combination of muscular impulses and intelligent machinery. Consequently, the latter allows for much more granular movement and restoration of fine motor skills. This doesn���t uniquely apply to arms, but also other body parts like legs, which leader of the biomechatronics group at MIT, Hugh Herr, has been developing over the past decades. One such example is a foot prosthesis that can simulate natural ankle movement through an integrated motor recreating what is called the subtalar joint, which allows for inversion and eversion of the foot. As part of his research, he has also developed a range of lower leg prostheses optimized for various activities such as climbing or running that he uses himself on a regular basis as he lost both of his lower legs to frostbite

Bionic limbs differ from traditional prostheses in that they don't solely rely on muscle force but combine it with smart machinery. This results in finer motor skills and more nuanced movements. This innovation isn't limited to arms; Hugh Herr from MIT has been pioneering similar advances for legs. For instance, he's developed a foot prosthesis with a motor that mimics the natural motion of the subtalar joint, enabling natural foot movement. Herr, who lost his own legs to frostbite, has also created specialized lower leg prostheses for activities like climbing and running, and he personally uses them.
e first robotic prostheses I ever came across were Adam Jensen���s prosthetic arms in Deus Ex: Human Revolution. And man, they are beyond just cool. The interest in seeing these augmentations come to live even resulted in a collaboration between Eidos Montreal, UK-based prosthetics manufacturer Open Bionics, and Razer, who put together an open source 3D-printable arm in 2016 (showcase). However, the real-life technology behind these products has made massive strides towards a future not that far off from the renderings that games such as Deus Ex or Cyberpunk 2077 have been painting

The first time I encountered robotic prostheses was in the game Deus Ex: Human Revolution with Adam Jensen's augmented arms. They were incredibly impressive. This interest in gaming led to a real-world collaboration in 2016 among Eidos Montreal, Open Bionics, and Razer to create an open-source 3D-printed arm. The advancements in prosthetic technology today are fast approaching the visions presented in games like Deus Ex and Cyberpunk 2077.

How Al & Bionic Feedback
Pave The Way For A New Era
For Human Augmentation

I understand. The information you provided seems to be from an article titled "To Next-Level Prosthetics: How AI & Bionic Feedback Pave The Way For A New Era For Human Augmentation" by Mirijam Missbichler, published on Sep 24, 2021. My responses were based on the content you shared and my prior knowledge. If you have any more questions or need further information, please let me know!
These implants, similar to neural brain implants or BCI (brain-computer interfaces) are highly invasive, thus there���s significant research allocated to non-invasive BCI. However, it appears that while these EEG-controlled interfaces are sufficient for secluded actions (i.e. pushing a button), they are subpar when it comes to continuous actions. Albeit, Bin He, professor and head of biomedical engineering at Carnegie Mellon University, achieved a promising breakthrough regarding continuous control which the Washington Post explained in greater detail in this 2019 article.

Second, sensors in the prosthesis itself can measure variables like position, speed, acceleration or temperature. The information is then fed to the microprocessor, which in turn, evaluates them by way of algorithms and decides which is the proper movement according to the given circumstances, which allows the prosthesis to adjust in real-time.

Though crude versions of microprocessor-controlled bionics have existed since the 1990s, researchers have come a long way to improve and refine prosthetics, so they are not only more efficient, but also more intuitive to their users. And thanks to machine learning, the devices adapt to their users after an initial learning period and will become more precise the longer they are used. So then, what���s the bleeding-edge technology in 2021?

Bionic Feedback
From a logical point of view, the idea of combining both those approaches does not seem that spectacular ��� you���d be forgiven for thinking that. But, what this entails, is paving the way to restoring the sense of touch. Being able to feel with a bionic limb. In Hugh Herr���s words, this means ���we���re closing the loop between the synthetic robotic limb and the human brain [���]���. By using nerve impulses to control motors in the bionic limb and vice versa using sensors in the bionic limb to stimulate the nerves, therefore putting information back into the nervous system, the user is able to feel the bionic limb as part of their body, ultimately allowing for a much more intuitive control. A great case study showing individual use-cases comes courtesy of the Chalmers University of Technology in Sweden.

There are even wider implications as to the treatment of phantom pain in light of this progress.

���We���re gaining evidence that, when a human being can feel a synthetic body part, when they can touch it and it feels like normal touch, when they move it and it feels like a normal joint movement, that the synthetic object becomes part of their body, their identity, their self.��� ��� Hugh Herr (Source)

For instance, a project called the LUKE arm (yes, named after Luke Skywalker), developed by a team at the University of Utah, found success in bringing back the sensation of feeling and alleviating phantom pain, which was reported on by the Washington Post in 2017. Today, the prosthetic arm is distributed by Mobius Bionics, offering not only bionic feedback, but also additional and improved features as well as different sizes and models suited for specific needs.

The present and future of prosthetics

And with that segue, let���s talk about some final insights. Whenever possible, prostheses are calibrated on an individual basis to fit a certain pattern of movements or needs. Similar to Hugh Herr using a different pair of legs for climbing compared to everyday walking, features such as strength for lifting or granular control for work necessitating fine motor skills are prioritized regarding bionic arms as well.

These advancements are without a doubt historic, liberating a growing number of people from restrictions they would have to face without bionic limbs. Nevertheless, there���s still quite a journey ahead, particularly when it comes to imitating the sensory capabilities of our bodies. To break this down to a more concrete example, ���[e]ach fingertip has more than 3,000 touch receptors, which largely respond to pressure���, a scope not quite in reach for present-day prosthetics according to a study report by Florida Atlantic University from July 2021. To close this gap and other shortcomings in the field, scientists from all over the world are researching alternatives such as liquid metal for stretchable tactile sensors, using ultrasound to offer a higher precision of individual finger movement, or even smart foam which can sense pressure and proximity, and can heal like skin, just to name a few. According to the Amputee Association, there are currently about 2M people living with limb loss in the US alone, a number projected to rise to 3.6M by 2050. And while discussions around topics ranging from accessibility to social stigma are equally necessary, it is exciting to think about what the future holds in store for bionic prosthetics.
