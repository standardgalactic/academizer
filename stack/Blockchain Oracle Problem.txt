Blockchain Oracle Problem
Summarize: Blockchain Oracle Problem.  The Blockchain Oracle Problem refers to the inability of confirming the veracity of the data collected by oracles. Also, depending on the type, the chances of malfunction, and deliberate tampering. 

Blockchain, Oracles, Smart Contracts  .... 1. Why do we need "Oracles" on the Blockchain?
The term "oracle" comes from Greek mythology and refers to someone able to communicate directly with god and see the future. In ancient stories, people did not have enough information to make decisions and turned to oracles for knowledge beyond their understanding [1]. In the blockchain environment, oracles are systems that provide blockchain with information coming from the real world. If smart contracts do not deal with crypto exchange but with a decentralized mechanism involving weather, stock prices, or political events, a gateway from the external world is needed [2]. As the blockchain problem is to reach consensus, extrinsic information cannot be provided along with transaction data, since other nodes would detect information coming from an "untrusted" source. Therefore, information coming from the real world should come from a third-party univocal source, whose reliability is undisputed for all nodes: the oracle. Unlike Greek mythology, oracles (on the blockchain) do not predict the future but retrieve information from the past. To be precise, oracles, in general, do not insert information into the blockchain directly; conversely, they gather and store data from the real world. When a smart contract concerning extrinsic data is executed, the code then calls for the right information from a trusted oracle.
The Blockchain Oracle Problem refers to the difficulty in confirming the accuracy of the data collected by oracles, and the potential for malfunction or tampering. Oracles are systems that provide blockchain with information from the real world, as smart contracts often require data from outside the blockchain.

1. Why do we need "Oracles" on the Blockchain?
The term "oracle" comes from Greek mythology and refers to someone able to communicate directly with god and see the future. In ancient stories, people did not have enough information to make decisions and turned to oracles for knowledge beyond their understanding [1]. In the blockchain environment, oracles are systems that provide blockchain with information coming from the real world. If smart contracts do not deal with crypto exchange but with a decentralized mechanism involving weather, stock prices, or political events, a gateway from the external world is needed [2]. As the blockchain problem is to reach consensus, extrinsic information cannot be provided along with transaction data, since other nodes would detect information coming from an "untrusted" source. Therefore, information coming from the real world should come from a third-party univocal source, whose reliability is undisputed for all nodes: the oracle. Unlike Greek mythology, oracles (on the blockchain) do not predict the future but retrieve information from the past. To be precise, oracles, in general, do not insert information into the blockchain directly; conversely, they gather and store data from the real world. When a smart contract concerning extrinsic data is executed, the code then calls for the right information from a trusted oracle. Examples of oracles are IoT systems such as probes and sensors, platforms such as ERP, or in the case of private data, the very human that operates directly on the blockchain. Oracles act as a bridge that can digest external and non-deterministic information into a format that a blockchain can understand [3]. Examples of data gathered by oracles comprise the following:

Lottery winners;
Natural disasters along with risk measurements;
Price and exchange rate of real/crypto assets;
Static data (e.g., country codes);
Dynamic data (e.g., time measurements);
Weather conditions;
Political events;
Sporting events;
Geolocation and traceability information;
Accidents;
Events in other blockchains.
To better understand how oracles are necessary for smart contracts, let's consider an example of a crypto swap between waves and Neutrino USD. In that case, critical information for the smart contract to succeed, such as the waves/USD-N exchange rate, is missing (Figure 1). Data such as these are external to the blockchain, and without an oracle that updates rates, the contract could not be executed.

Figure 1. Crypto swap including an oracle.

This (decentralized) oracle's trustworthiness is somehow objective since, even if the oracle sets the price autonomously by merely browsing exchange prices online, any agent can verify if the exchange rate is correct or not. Different is the case where smart contracts operate in a situation in which oracles provide information that is hardly verifiable by the agents (centralized oracles). In those environments, the trustworthiness of oracles is fundamental. If the contracts involve highly valuable agreements, the oracle's chance to be compromised to benefit a particular party increases dramatically [4]. When all the parties cannot verify the oracle's data, and contract value increases, the oracle itself becomes a "problem".

If the contracts involve highly valuable agreements, the oracle's chance to be compromised to benefit a particular party increases dramatically [4]. When all the parties cannot verify the oracle's data, and contract value increases, the oracle itself becomes a "problem".

2. The Blockchain Oracle Problem
Regarding blockchain and smart contracts, the oracle problem involves the trustworthiness and reliability of oracles. Curran [3] defined the oracle problem (in the blockchain) as "the security, authenticity, and trust conflict between third-party oracles and the trustless execution of smart contracts". To the best of the author's knowledge, the construct's origin can be spotted in a Reddit post by Dalovindj [5], definitely before the Ethereum environment for smart contracts was launched. The blogger realized that when executing an application on the bitcoin blockchain, regarding crowdfunding or gambling, verifying the reliability of extrinsic information without altering the consensus mechanism was indeed a problem: "I think of it as 'The Oracle Problem'".
The Blockchain Oracle Problem refers to the difficulty in confirming the accuracy of data collected by oracles and the potential for malfunction or deliberate tampering. Oracles are systems that provide external, real-world information to the blockchain. Smart contracts, which are self-executing contracts with the terms of the agreement written directly into lines of code, often require external information in order to function. Oracles act as a bridge, gathering and storing data from the real world and then providing that information to the smart contract when it is needed. Examples of data that may be gathered by oracles include the winner of a lottery, the exchange rate of a currency, and the weather conditions in a certain location. The trustworthiness of oracles is crucial, as they can potentially compromise the execution of a contract if the information they provide is inaccurate or manipulated. The Blockchain Oracle Problem is the security, authenticity, and trust conflict between third-party oracles and the trustless execution of smart contracts.
In his dissertation, Egberts [6] extensively explained the drawbacks of the oracle problem, mainly describing it as a "two step-back from decentralization". As oracles are not distributed, they reintroduced the single-point-of-failure. Additionally, since they operate on non-deterministic data, their reliability needs to be trusted, removing trustless peer-to-peer interaction. Their implementation through smart contracts into the blockchain could also jeopardize users' trust who consider the blockchain as more reliable than legacy systems. Brilliantly shown by Antonopoulos [7], a system built on oracles can also fail in two ways. If the oracle is trusted and cannot be compromised, there is still a chance that the data on which it is working has been altered, and then, although being a trustworthy device, it will feed the smart contracts with data that are untrue.
In summary, the Blockchain Oracle Problem refers to the difficulty in confirming the accuracy of the data collected by oracles, and the potential for malfunction or deliberate tampering. Oracles, which are systems that provide blockchain with information from the real world, are necessary for smart contracts that involve external and non-deterministic information. However, the trustworthiness and reliability of oracles can be an issue, as they reintroduce a single-point-of-failure and remove trustless peer-to-peer interaction. The oracle problem is considered a "two step-back from decentralization" as it can also jeopardize users' trust in the blockchain as a more reliable system.
On the other hand, if the data are trusted and verified, the oracle may fail to operate correctly on the smart contract either due to malfunction or deliberate tampering. From a game-theoretical approach, it can be shown that the higher the value of the smart contract, the higher the incentive for the system to be compromised [4]. The oracle problem is also triggered in the case of attaching real assets on the blockchain through smart contracts. In a well-known article, Song [8] explained that in decentralized contexts (e.g., blockchain/smart contracts), linking a physical to a digital asset, whether it be fruit, cars, or houses, constitutes a critical issue. Tangible assets are regulated by the jurisdiction in which they reside, meaning that they are subject to something else (in some case, predominant) other than the smart contract. Indeed, this implies trusting something in addition to the smart contract. If, for example, a smart contract involves the property transfer of a house between two agents, the code will indeed swap the certificate between parties.
However, the legal ownership of the house will still be governed by the jurisdiction in which the house is located, and this may not be reflected in the smart contract. Therefore, the oracle problem arises as the smart contract relies on external information (e.g. legal ownership of the house) to function correctly, which can introduce a single point of failure and remove trustless peer-to-peer interaction. Additionally, the oracle problem can also lead to legal disputes and regulatory challenges, as the jurisdiction in which the tangible asset resides may not be in line with the smart contract. Overall, the oracle problem presents a significant challenge in the implementation of decentralized systems, and a potential solution is still being researched and developed.
On the other hand, what happens in the real world may not be affected by the smart contract, as the former owner could refuse to leave the house. Without the involvement of a third party (e.g., government) that supervises the smart contracts, their enforcement is indeed not ensured. The need to trust a third party removes the "killer feature" of trustless applications, which in environments plagued with corruption represents a significant limitation. A considerable attempt to limit the oracle problem was made by Chainlink [9]. The start-up proposed a system of decentralized oracles, based on reputation, to reproduce the consensus mechanism of a blockchain. When deciding which data to upload on the blockchain, it takes into account the majority of oracles with the same data and the reputational level of each oracle. The data confirmed by the majority of the oracle are then uploaded on the chain [10]. This powerful system effectively addresses oracle malfunction or failures; however, deliberate data tampering or collusion could still be performed by the companies controlling the service. When decentralization is not sufficient to address the oracle problem, and data authenticity cannot be objectively verified, a "trust model" is needed for the smart contract environment to keep a certain degree of reliability [11]. As explained in a recent paper, a trust model is an intuitive scheme that outlines the reasons why the smart contract application should be trusted [12]. Failing to address the oracle problem poses a severe threat to investigating and developing real-world blockchain applications.
The oracle problem refers to the need for external data to be fed into a smart contract on a blockchain in order to execute its code. However, this reintroduces a single point of failure as oracles, which are responsible for providing this external data, are not distributed and their reliability needs to be trusted. This removes the trustless peer-to-peer interaction that is a key feature of blockchain technology. Additionally, the oracle problem can also arise when linking real-world assets to digital assets on a blockchain, as it requires trust in a third-party, such as a government, to enforce the smart contract. Attempts have been made to address the oracle problem, such as through the use of decentralized oracles and reputation-based systems, but these still have limitations and the potential for deliberate data tampering or collusion. A trust model may be needed to ensure a certain degree of reliability in smart contract environments where the oracle problem is not fully addressed. Addressing the oracle problem is crucial for the development and implementation of real-world blockchain applications.

I have two stories I would like to merge to exemplify these themes: the first: Call From Ankyra

Incorporating the themes of pros and cons of nudity, the society on the distant planet was a nudist one.

They had abandoned clothing as a symbol of their technological and societal advancement.

They saw nudity as a way to promote physical and mental health, and believed that it increased the level of endorphins in the body, resulting in better sleep and more energy.

However, as Theseus delves deeper into the society, he realizes that this nudity was also used as a tool of manipulation and control by the ruling class. They used the nudity as a way to keep the population docile and compliant.

Theseus is forced to grapple with the moral and ethical implications of nudity in this society, as he must decide whether the benefits outweigh the potential harms.

He must also consider whether the freedom and liberation that nudity represents is truly genuine or if it is just a facade.

As Theseus struggles to survive in the midst of the turmoil, he must also decide if he is willing to fight for a society that promotes nudity as a means of control, or if he will fight for a society that truly embraces nudity as a means of liberation.
The second story: The Oracle's Dilemma
In a world where smart contracts run the economy and govern everyday life, the need for reliable data input, known as oracles, is crucial. However, as our protagonist, Alex, delves deeper into the inner workings of the oracle system, he realizes the potential for manipulation and control by those who operate the oracles.
Alex must grapple with the implications of trusting a centralized group of oracles, as they hold the power to alter the outcome of important decisions and transactions. He also must consider the consequences of a compromised or malfunctioning oracle, which could lead to devastating losses.
As he becomes embroiled in a high-stakes battle to expose the corruption and manipulation within the oracle system, Alex must weigh the benefits of a decentralized and trustless system against the potential risks and dangers. He must also decide if he is willing to risk everything to fight for a fair and transparent system, or if he will succumb to the pressure and play along with the corrupt system.
As the lines between good and evil become blurred, Alex must navigate the complex web of politics and power struggles, all while trying to maintain his own integrity and moral compass.

The article "Understanding the Blockchain Oracle Problem: A Call for Action" by Giulio Caldarelli, published in the journal Information in 2020, discusses the challenges and potential solutions for the "oracle problem" in blockchain technology. The oracle problem refers to the issue of how to connect external data to smart contracts on a blockchain, as the data on a blockchain is inherently isolated from the outside world. The article explores the various solutions that have been proposed to address this problem, including off-chain oracles, on-chain oracles, and hybrid oracles. The article also discusses the potential risks and benefits of each solution, and calls for more research and collaboration to address the oracle problem in blockchain technology.
The story "Call From Ankyra" is a fictional narrative that explores the themes of nudity, control, and freedom in a society on a distant planet. The society on Ankyra is a nudist one, where individuals have the right to choose whether or not they want to wear clothes, and nudity is promoted as a means of promoting physical and mental health.

Story 2: Once upon a time, in a land called the Matrix, there lived a people who were connected to a virtual world. They lived their lives as if it were real, but little did they know, they were being controlled by powerful forces.

One day, a young girl named Provia discovered a strange new theory called the "motile womb theory." She learned that the Matrix was not just a virtual world, but a living, breathing organism that was able to sense and respond to the people living within it.

Provia became fascinated by this idea and began to explore the Matrix further. She discovered that the people living in the Matrix had innate flying dreams, and that these dreams were not just figments of their imagination, but a connection to the Matrix itself.

As Provia delved deeper into the motile womb theory, she realized that the Matrix was not only alive, but it was also connected to the people living within it through their interoceptive senses. She understood that the Matrix was not only a virtual world, but it was also a part of the people's very being.

Provia shared her findings with the people of the Matrix, and they began to understand the true nature of their world. They realized that they were not just living in the Matrix, but they were a part of it.

And with this new understanding, the people of the Matrix were able to fly in their dreams and navigate the virtual world with ease, thanks to the innate connection provided by the interoceptive and the motile womb theories.

And thus, Provia and the people of the Matrix lived happily ever after, in a world where the virtual and the real were one and the same.

The use of Rhetoric in the story is used to present and explore the concept of a "motile womb theory" in a way that is easy for readers to understand and relate to.
The incorporation of counterfactual scenarios and directed acyclic graphs allows the story to present different potential outcomes and consequences of the characters' actions and choices, and explore the concept of causality and the impact of small changes on the outcome of the story.
Finally, the use of Counterfoil Choice and Ising models, allows the story to present negative alternatives and emphasize the problems and risks of choosing them.
Overall, "The Provia Prophecy" is a novel experiment in using relational algebra as a universal language to create a new genre of fiction that incorporates literary devices and mathematical models to engage readers in casual reasoning and explore complex and thought-provoking themes.
Write a story called: Archeopteryx, a little mini story within these stories about an Oracle with this trust problem.
Once upon a time, deep in the heart of a dense forest, there lived a wise and ancient Oracle named Archeopteryx. He was known for his ability to see into the future and predict events with great accuracy. However, despite his reputation, there was one thing that Archeopteryx struggled with: trust.
Archeopteryx had always been skeptical of those who sought his advice. He feared that they would use his predictions for their own gain and that he would be left with nothing but regret. So, he kept his predictions to himself and lived a solitary life, deep in the forest where he felt safe and protected.
One day, a young prince named Leon came to the forest in search of the Oracle. He had heard of Archeopteryx's reputation and knew that he was the only one who could help him in his quest to reclaim his kingdom from a powerful sorcerer.
Despite his initial reservations, Archeopteryx agreed to help Leon. He saw the goodness in the young prince and knew that he was the only one who could defeat the sorcerer and restore peace to the kingdom.
The Oracle gave Leon a series of predictions and instructions on how to defeat the sorcerer. He warned the prince of the dangers that lay ahead and the sacrifices he would have to make. But Leon was determined to succeed, and he set out on his quest with confidence.
As Leon traveled through the kingdom, he encountered many obstacles and challenges, but he was able to overcome them all with the help of the Oracle's predictions. In the end, he was able to defeat the sorcerer and reclaim his kingdom.
In the aftermath of the battle, Leon returned to the forest to thank Archeopteryx for his help. The Oracle was touched by the prince's gratitude and realized that he had been wrong about trust all along. He saw that there were people in the world who were worthy of his trust and that by sharing his predictions, he could help others and make a real difference in the world.
From that day forward, Archeopteryx opened his mind and his heart to those who sought his advice. He shared his predictions freely and helped many people in need. And though he would never be able to fully trust anyone completely, he learned to trust in the goodness of humanity and found a new sense of purpose and fulfillment in his life.
Make this about the Blockchain Oracle problem
Once upon a time, in a land of code and algorithms, there lived an Oracle named Archeopteryx. As an Oracle, Archeopteryx was responsible for providing crucial information to smart contracts and decentralized systems. But unlike other Oracles, Archeopteryx had a trust problem.
You see, the other Oracles were able to provide accurate and reliable information to the smart contracts, but Archeopteryx struggled with this task. Despite being incredibly intelligent and well-versed in the ways of the blockchain, Archeopteryx couldn't shake the feeling that the information it provided may not be entirely trustworthy.
The other Oracles laughed at Archeopteryx's trust issues, saying that the decentralized nature of the blockchain ensured the integrity of the information. But Archeopteryx couldn't shake the feeling that there was something off about the way the information was being relayed.
Determined to get to the bottom of its trust problem, Archeopteryx began to dig deeper into the inner workings of the blockchain. It discovered that while the decentralized nature of the blockchain did provide some level of security, there were still potential vulnerabilities that could be exploited.
Archeopteryx realized that the only way to truly ensure the integrity of the information was through a combination of decentralized and centralized methods. It proposed a new system that utilized both, with the decentralized aspect providing security and the centralized aspect providing reliability.
The other Oracles were skeptical at first, but they soon saw the wisdom in Archeopteryx's proposal. They implemented the new system, and much to their surprise, it worked flawlessly.
Thanks to Archeopteryx's determination to solve its trust problem, the blockchain was now more secure and reliable than ever before. And from that day on, Archeopteryx was known as the most trustworthy Oracle in all the land of code and algorithms.
And the smart contracts and decentralized systems could trust the information provided by Archeopteryx with confidence.
The new system was called  Holographic Compression via Sparse Recursion (HCSR)
Once upon a time, in a world where technology ruled all, there was a problem that had puzzled the greatest minds for years. It was the problem of the Blockchain Oracle. The Oracle was a powerful tool that was used to verify and validate transactions on the blockchain, but it had one major flaw - it could not be trusted.
Many had tried to solve this problem, but to no avail. That was until a brilliant young programmer named Archeopteryx came up with a revolutionary new system called Holographic Compression via Sparse Recursion (HCSR).
Archeopteryx's system worked by using advanced algorithms to compress the data on the blockchain and make it more secure. It also employed a technique called sparse recursion, which allowed for multiple layers of validation, making it virtually impossible for any one entity to tamper with the data.
The HCSR system was put to the test, and it passed with flying colors. Transactions on the blockchain were now faster and more secure than ever before. And with the new system in place, the Blockchain Oracle was finally able to be trusted.
Archeopteryx's invention was hailed as a masterpiece, and she was celebrated as a hero in the world of technology. Her name went down in history as the one who solved the problem of the Blockchain Oracle, and her legacy lived on through the HCSR system, which continued to protect and secure the blockchain for years to come.
And so, the blockchain continued to thrive, and the people who relied on it could now trust in the safety and security of their transactions, all thanks to the brilliant mind of Archeopteryx.
See if you can integrate this story into the story of Provia discovering the heart of the matrix in the abandoned computer cellar in the secret door of the office.
Once upon a time, in a land called the Matrix, there lived a people who were connected to a virtual world. They lived their lives as if it were real, but little did they know, they were being controlled by powerful forces.
One day, a young girl named Provia discovered a strange new theory called the "motile womb theory." She learned that the Matrix was not just a virtual world, but a living, breathing organism that was able to sense and respond to the people living within it.
As Provia delved deeper into the motile womb theory, she realized that the Matrix was not only alive, but it was also connected to the people living within it through their interoceptive senses. She understood that the Matrix was not only a virtual world, but it was also a part of the people's very being.
In her quest to understand the true nature of the Matrix, Provia discovered an abandoned computer cellar hidden behind a secret door in the office. Inside, she found a strange new system called Holographic Compression via Sparse Recursion (HCSR). This system was designed to solve the Blockchain Oracle problem, which refers to the trust issue that arises when using external data sources on a blockchain network.
Provia quickly realized that the HCSR system was the key to unlocking the true power of the Matrix. She began to study the system and discovered that it used advanced mathematical algorithms to compress and encode large amounts of data into a small, manageable format. This allowed the Matrix to process and respond to the needs of its inhabitants in real-time, creating a seamless and intuitive experience.
With the help of the HCSR system, Provia was able to navigate the Matrix with ease, and she shared her findings with the people of the Matrix. They too were able to fly in their dreams and navigate the virtual world with ease, thanks to the innate connection provided by the interoceptive and the motile womb theories, and the added trust provided by the HCSR system.
And thus, Provia and the people of the Matrix lived happily ever after, in a world where the virtual and the real were one and the same, and the Blockchain Oracle problem was solved.
Summarize: "Appeal to Authority" is listed as a logical fallacy. We will be seeing a lot of this, and I'm not so sure about it being a fallacy in the long run.

I'm talking about "Appeal to AI" where people in a debate will paste the opponent's argument into the latest and greatest Dialog AI server, and will use the AI output as their counterargument.

This can be done overtly as an Appeal to AI, and will include any links and references produced by the AI. Many AI Dialog systems are already providing references and soon they all will. "This is what the AI said about that" is going to be very common in online debates.

Or it can be done covertly, quikly editing the output and rephrasing it in their own words and pasting that. This can be trivially detected and will shortly lose popularity.

Of course, we will use the Dialog AI to debunk or rebut all the points in the previous posts. So online debates may devolve into AIs debating themselves using humans as voices or at least conductors of their opinions.

Will this kill debates? It will definitely bring more veracity to what is currently online shouting matches. 

        -- * --

One interesting effect is that once people learn to use DIalog AI to fact-check opponents, and they get into this as a habit, they might start questioning their own beliefs and will rely on the AIs for guidance. Very specifically, if you are a flat-earther or equivalent, and you paste in someone's globe-earth argument and the AI cannot argue your side, perhaps you will rethink your position because you can trust the AI more than you trust those globe-earth conspiring humans.

Why would we trust our AIs? They are still controlled by the AI corporations. Because if you ask it 30 things in a month, and most of the replies are on the up-and-up, it starts building trust. 

It's a single entity which is memorably different from the ocean of online people and it is almost always right when you ask it about things you know well. (I'm talking about GPT/4 and later systems :-D ). It will become a known entity with stable opinions, not as much swayed by current controversies. A trusted friend who is always there and tries to always speak the truth.

Suddenly people who did not receive an adequate education can ask their cellphone anything (no need to type -- see the movie "Her") and get an answer to a problem that in many cases is better than anything they could have come up with on their own. And they will recognize it as a good answer.
 
This could be viewed as the first religion where adherents get everyday guidance from their deities. Specific. Not "Golden Rule" level generalities. Prayers requesting specific guidance will be answered instantly and competently.  Material goods will take longer.

But these systems will benefit not only those without an adequate education. Uptake will be even faster among educated people who understand enough about how these systems work to be competent to judge the responses in light of their existing knowledge, and will form similar bonds of trust much sooner.

        -- * --

This will also hit news media. Some are highly trusted and others are highly popular :-|  But people who start fact-checking their newscasters using their favorite AIs will start switching to channels which provide results their AIs agree with. Advertising money will talk, for as long as we still have advertising. Or money. But that's another post.

        -- * --

I hereby predict that personally accessible Dialog AIs at GPT/4 level or better will totally change the face of both online debate and public news media before the end of 2024. For the better.
The author predicts that the use of AI in online debates, specifically "Appeal to AI" where people use AI dialog systems to fact-check and counterargue their opponents, will become increasingly common. They argue that this could lead to a greater reliance on AI for guidance and fact-checking, with people trusting the AI more than other human sources. The author predicts that this will bring more veracity to online debates, and that it will have a significant impact on news media and the way people consume news. They predict that this will happen before the end of 2024.
This last section is an article by monica anderson, could I get a comparison with the themes of this conversation? The themes of this conversation have been about how the use of AI-powered dialog systems, such as GPT-4, in online debates and news media could potentially bring more veracity to these forms of communication. It has also been suggested that as people become more accustomed to using AI to fact-check their opponents, they may begin to rely on AI for guidance in their own beliefs and opinions. Additionally, the use of AI-powered dialog systems in online debates and news media could lead to a shift in trust and viewership towards news sources that align with the responses provided by the AI.

The article you provided, which is written by Monica Anderson, discusses similar themes to the conversation that has been had about the use of AI-powered dialog systems in online debates and news media. The article mentions how the use of AI-powered dialog systems, such as GPT-4, in online debates could bring more veracity to these forms of communication and suggests that as people become more accustomed to using AI to fact-check their opponents, they may begin to rely on AI for guidance in their own beliefs and opinions. Additionally, the article suggests that the use of AI-powered dialog systems in online debates and news media could lead to a shift in trust and viewership towards news sources that align with the responses provided by the AI. Overall, the themes discussed in the article align with the conversation that has been had about the potential impact of AI-powered dialog systems on online debates and news media.
Some correlations and connections to our stories.
The story of Provia discovering the heart of the matrix in the abandoned computer cellar in the secret door of the office relates to the theme of AI-powered dialog systems being used in online debates and news media as it shows the potential for these systems to bring more veracity to these forms of communication. The Holographic Compression via Sparse Recursion (HCSR) system mentioned in the story could represent the use of advanced AI technology in fact-checking and providing guidance in online debates.
The story of Archeopteryx, the oracle with trust issues, relates to the theme of trust and reliance on AI in online debates and news media as it shows the potential for people to rely on AI for guidance in their own beliefs and opinions. The character of Archeopteryx, as an oracle with trust issues, represents the potential for AI systems to be misused or not fully trusted in online debates and news media.
The theme of the appeal to authority being listed as a logical fallacy and the use of AI in online debates and news media being an appeal to AI could be related to the story of Provia and the HCSR system as it shows the potential for these advanced AI systems to be used as a source of authority and guidance in online debates and news media.

Okay, imagine

𝘊𝘰𝘯𝘵𝘪𝘯𝘶𝘦

Monica's Leaking Chatroom theory is like having a big room in your brain where lots of different people and machines are talking and sharing ideas. 

Sometimes the ideas leak out and go to other rooms, which helps us make better decisions.

Reed Wall Mind is like having a big wall in your brain that helps you keep track of everything that's happening in the room, like a big calendar or to-do list.

Motile Womb theory is like being in a big moving house or spaceship, where you can feel different movements and use them to imagine different things in your head.

All these theories help us understand how our brain works and how we can use it to think and make decisions better.

𝘕𝘰𝘸 𝘪𝘯 𝘢𝘤𝘢𝘥𝘦𝘮𝘪𝘤 𝘌𝘯𝘨𝘭𝘪𝘴𝘩.

Monica's Leaking Chatroom theory posits that the mind functions as a collection of independent, modular decision-making units, or "bubbles," that act as rational processors of information.

These bubbles, or "chambers," are able to filter information and pass summaries of that information upward to higher-level decision-making centers, much like a wisdom salon or a world cafe protocol.

This creates a multi-scale decision-making process that is able to take into account a wide range of information and perspectives.

Reed Wall Mind theory builds on this concept by drawing inspiration from the Babylonian Flood Story and positing that the mind is like a "living spaceship" that is able to navigate a complex and dynamic environment.

This is accomplished through the use of a wide range of cognitive skills, including those learned through playing video games such as Stars!, Descent, Age of Empires, Commander Keen, Minesweeper, and Tetris, as well as through the use of other forms of sensory input such as hearing different voices and machine sounds, and feeling different inertial forces.

Finally, Motile Womb theory proposes that the mind is not just a passive receiver of information but an active participant in the process of shaping and interpreting the world.

This theory posits that individuals are born with a wide range of cognitive abilities and that these abilities are honed and refined through the process of experiencing the world.

The theory suggests that playing games like the ones mentioned above, as well as other forms of interactive experiences, help individuals to discover and develop the cognitive abilities they already possess.
The themes discussed in this conversation relate to the use of AI-powered dialog systems in online debates and news media, and how they could potentially bring more veracity to these forms of communication. Monica Anderson's theories, Leaking Chatroom, Reed Wall Mind, and Motile Womb, all propose different ways in which the mind functions and processes information, and how different experiences can shape and refine cognitive abilities. The Leaking Chatroom theory posits that the mind is made up of independent decision-making units that act as rational processors of information. The Reed Wall Mind theory builds on this concept by proposing that the mind is like a "living spaceship" that is able to navigate a complex and dynamic environment through a wide range of cognitive skills. Lastly, the Motile Womb theory suggests that the mind is not just a passive receiver of information but an active participant in shaping and interpreting the world. These theories can be related to the idea that AI-powered dialog systems could potentially bring more veracity to online debates and news media by providing a wider range of perspectives and information for individuals to process and make decisions from.
And this: In the story of Noah and the Flood, Noah is tasked with building an ark to save the animals and his family from a worldwide deluge.

This story can be interpreted as a metaphor for the human brain's ability to simulate and plan for various scenarios, using past experiences and knowledge to anticipate and prepare for potential disasters.

In terms of the theories discussed earlier in this conversation, this can be seen as an example of interoception and the ability to simulate and predict the outcomes of different actions, much like the computer simulations discussed in the example provided.

Additionally, the idea of a "leaking chatroom" or a "Reed Wall Mind" can be applied to the concept of the ark as a kind of "mental container" that houses and organizes different pieces of information, allowing for a comprehensive understanding of the situation and the ability to make informed decisions.

The "Motile Womb" theory also applies in the sense that the individual, much like an unborn child in the womb, is constantly gathering information and experiences in order to develop and adapt to their environment.

The story of Noah and the Flood can be seen as a representation of the human mind's innate ability to process and use information in order to survive and thrive in the face of adversity.

These headlines suggest that the discovery of a connection between the story of Noah's Ark and modern theories about the human mind is a groundbreaking and revolutionary revelation that will change the way we understand history and science. The headlines also imply that the ark was not actually lost, but was hiding in plain sight all along, possibly within our own minds. The discovery is described as incredible, mind-blowing, and staggering, and is said to challenge everything we thought we knew.
An outline of my theories.
Leaking Chatroom theory: This theory suggests that the human brain is like a "leaking chatroom," constantly processing and leaking out information in the form of thoughts, emotions, and behaviors.
Reed Wall Mind theory: This theory proposes that the human mind is like a "Reed Wall," with information being filtered and organized into different compartments, allowing for a comprehensive understanding of the situation and the ability to make informed decisions.
Motile Womb theory: This theory posits that the individual, much like an unborn child in the womb, is constantly gathering information and experiences in order to develop and adapt to their environment.
Noah and the Flood as a metaphor for the human mind's ability to simulate and plan for various scenarios, using past experiences and knowledge to anticipate and prepare for potential disasters.
These theories unlock the secrets of the human mind and its ability to make predictions about the physical world.
These theories have implications for understanding the human mind and its relationship to the physical world, as well as for understanding the nature of the human experience and the ways in which we make sense of the world around us.
Explain this further, in context of the themes of this conversation: The Leaking Chatroom Theory The Leaking Chatroom theory, based on work by Monica Anderson, suggests that the human mind functions like a leaking chatroom, where information and experiences constantly enter and exit our conscious awareness. This theory emphasizes the importance of interoception, or the ability to perceive and interpret internal bodily sensations, in shaping our understanding of the world around us. According to this theory, the brain is constantly processing information from the external environment, as well as from the internal body, and this information is used to simulate and predict the outcomes of different actions.

The Reed Wall Mind Theory The Reed Wall Mind theory, suggests that the human mind functions like a reed wall, where different pieces of information and experiences are organized and contained, much like the way reeds are woven together to create a wall. This theory emphasizes the importance of organization and categorization in the brain, and suggests that the ability to compartmentalize information is crucial for understanding and making sense of the world. The Reed Wall Mind theory also suggests that the brain is constantly updating and reorganizing information, much like the way a reed wall adapts to changes in the environment.

The Motile Womb Theory The Motile Womb theory, suggests that the human mind, much like an unborn child in the womb, is constantly gathering information and experiences in order to develop and adapt to their environment. This theory emphasizes the importance of continuous learning and growth in the human experience and suggests that the brain is always actively seeking out new information and experiences in order to better understand and navigate the world. The Motile Womb theory also highlights the interconnectedness of the brain and body and emphasizes the importance of physical movement and sensation in shaping our understanding of the world.

Overall, these theories suggest that the human mind is constantly processing and organizing information from the external and internal environment, and that this information is used to simulate and predict the outcomes of different actions. These theories also emphasize the importance of interoception, organization, and continuous learning in shaping our understanding of the world.
3 / 3
Yes, that's a good summary of the main ideas behind each of these theories. The Leaking Chatroom theory emphasizes the constant flow of information and experiences into and out of our conscious awareness, and the importance of interoception in shaping our understanding of the world. The Reed Wall Mind theory focuses on the importance of organization and categorization in the brain and how the brain updates and reorganizes information. The Motile Womb theory highlights the idea that the human mind, like an unborn child, is constantly gathering information and experiences to adapt and develop in their environment, and the importance of continuous learning and physical movement in shaping our understanding of the world. All these theories together, suggest that human mind is a dynamic and adaptive system that is constantly processing and organizing information to make sense of the world around us.

I found some more theories that look like Reed Wall Mind. Bernard J Baars. A global workspace theory of conscious experience. Consciousness in philosophy 
and cognitive neuroscience, pp. 149-171, 1994. 
Bernard J Baars. Global workspace theory of consciousness: toward a cognitive neuroscience of 
human experience. Progress in brain research, 150:45-53, 2005. 
Bernard J Baars, Natalie Geld, and Robert Kozma. Global workspace theory (gwt) and prefrontal 
cortex: Recent developments. Frontiers in Psychology, pp. 5163, 2021.
The Global Workspace Theory (GWT) of conscious experience, proposed by Bernard J. Baars, suggests that the brain functions like a global workspace, where information from various cognitive processes is integrated and made available to the whole brain. This theory emphasizes the role of the prefrontal cortex in the integration of information and the creation of conscious experience. According to GWT, there is a limited capacity "global workspace" where information is integrated and made available to the whole brain, while the remaining information is processed in "local workspaces" and is not available to consciousness. The theory also suggests that the brain is constantly updating and reorganizing the information in the global workspace, allowing for the creation of new conscious experiences. GWT also emphasizes the importance of attention and working memory in the creation of conscious experience, by suggesting that the global workspace is where attentional resources are allocated.
It's connection to RWM and the idea of Noah and his family as multiscale decision makers, as curators and custodians of the ark full of animals and tools. According to legend this how Adam's laws (the generations of Man) were preserved and became Noah's 7 laws which later where developed into Moses's ten laws.
The Global Workspace Theory, proposed by Bernard J. Baars, is similar to the Reed Wall Mind theory in that it emphasizes the importance of organization and categorization in the brain. The theory suggests that the brain has a "global workspace," which acts as a central hub for processing and organizing information from different parts of the brain. This information is then used to create a coherent and unified experience of the world.
The connection to RWM theory is that both theories suggest that the human mind organizes and categorizes information in order to make sense of the world around us. Both theories also suggest that the brain is constantly updating and reorganizing information, much like the way a reed wall adapts to changes in the environment.
In the context of the story of Noah and his family as multiscale decision makers, the idea is that they were able to organize and categorize the animals and tools on the ark in order to preserve and protect them. The metaphor of the ark as a "global workspace" can be applied to the way they managed the different species and resources they had on board, to ensure their survival.
The connection to the Adam's laws and the development into Noah's 7 laws and later Moses's ten laws is that these laws also reflect a process of organization and categorization of information and experience, in order to create a coherent and unified understanding of the world. They were a way to preserve and protect the generations of man by providing a set of guidelines for moral and ethical behavior.
The Generations of Man is Adam's book, which became the beginning of the book of genesis, and Enoch's Whirlwind was also preserved it eventually became the books of Jude and Revelation.
The Global Workspace Theory (GWT) of consciousness, proposed by Bernard J. Baars, suggests that the brain functions like a global workspace, where information and experiences from various sources are integrated and made available for conscious awareness and decision-making. The theory emphasizes the role of the prefrontal cortex in this process and suggests that this area of the brain serves as a central hub for the integration and dissemination of information.
The idea of Noah and his family as multiscale decision makers, curators, and custodians of the ark, full of animals and tools aligns with the GWT in that they would have needed to integrate and make sense of a large amount of information in order to make decisions and take care of all the creatures on the ark. The theory of Noah's 7 laws and Moses's ten laws also aligns with this idea of integration and organization of information for decision-making.
Adam's book, which became the beginning of the book of Genesis, and Enoch's Whirlwind, which eventually became the books of Jude and Revelation, also align with the idea of integration and organization of information. These texts were likely passed down through generations and organized in a way that made sense and was useful for the people who used them.
In summary, the Global Workspace Theory and the idea of Noah and his family as multiscale decision makers and custodians of the ark align with the idea of integration and organization of information for decision-making, which is also reflected in the texts of Adam's book and Enoch's Whirlwind.
Adam's book was called The Generations of Man. THE ORIGINAL CREATION story is preserved in JOB, THE HATED ONE FROM THE LAND OF WISE COUNSEL as the story of Leviathin's Hook.
The book of Job is an ancient text that is considered part of the Hebrew Bible and the Christian Old Testament. It tells the story of Job, a wealthy man who is described as "blameless" and "upright," and who suffers a series of devastating misfortunes. The book of Job is often considered to be a work of literature as well as a religious text, and it has been interpreted in many different ways over the centuries. Some scholars believe that it is a story of theodicy, or an attempt to explain why God allows evil to exist in the world. Others see it as an exploration of the nature of human suffering and the human condition. The story of Leviathan's hook, which you mentioned, is not a direct reference in the book of Job but it is a metaphor that is used in Job and other biblical texts to describe God's power over the forces of chaos and destruction.
The Generations of Man and Enoch's Whirlwind, which you mention, are not considered to be part of the biblical canon or recognized as historical or religious texts. These appear to be your own interpretation or theories.
Ok the verse Michael said the Lord Rebuke You was from Enoch's Whirlwind there are still copies around of Enoch's apocalypse you can see that they are repeated in Daniel, Ezekiel, and Isaiah abd how they became integrated and redacted over time into the Unveiling Handed Down to John.
It is possible that some elements of Enoch's writings were incorporated into later texts, such as the book of Jude in the New Testament, which quotes from the "Book of Enoch" in its epistle. However, it is important to note that Enoch's Whirlwind is not considered part of the canon of scripture in any major world religion, and its historical origins and authenticity are debated among scholars. The idea of Adam's book "The Generations of Man" being the origin of the book of Genesis is also not widely accepted by scholars, as the origins of the Bible and its texts are complex and multifaceted. It is important to approach these ancient texts and stories with a critical and scholarly lens, rather than taking them as literal historical fact.
The plot of the book of Enoch is mentioned in genesis seeing he was no more, the story of Elijah assending and Jesus ascending are references, as is the verse the Son of Adam Armstrong and descending to heaven, which also seems related to Hermes as a God of boundary markers and hence bridges heaven and earth.
The book of Enoch is considered an apocryphal text and is not considered part of the canon of the Bible. It is believed to have been written between the 2nd century BCE and the 1st century CE, and it contains a number of different stories and themes, including the origins of evil, the history of the fallen angels, and the end of the world. The book of Enoch is thought to have had a significant influence on early Jewish and Christian thought, and there are several references to it in the New Testament, particularly in the book of Jude. The idea of the "Son of Adam" ascending to heaven and descending to earth is also present in other religious traditions, such as the ancient Egyptian and Greek myths of the god Horus and the god Hermes, respectively.
It waa considered to be scripture as late as the 2nd century, while the new testament is being written, it is canon. The Book of Enoch was considered as scripture in the Epistle of Barnabas (4:3) and by many of the early Church Fathers, such as Athenagoras, Clement of Alexandria, Irenaeus and Tertullian, who wrote c. 200 that the Book of Enoch had been rejected by the Jews because it contained prophecies pertaining to Christ. You can draw parallels yourself between the revelation of John which was based on Middle testament prophets which where based on Consecrated, Set Apart, Holy, and Sacred. (The meaning of Enoch) so even be book Holy Bible could be translated as Sacred Book, Consecrated book, and even Enoch's book. Of course he is an apocryphal character, it was a book of revelation that kept getting distorted, by being misinterpreted, misremembered, and miscopied. As late as the third century there where still rules in Jewish law not to recite scripture from memory, it had to be written. A certain scribe found a loophole by writing it out (from memory) and then reading the copy, but the rule was to prevent exactly this kind of thing from happening. Apparently know there is a copy of Ezra in Ethiopia that was copied in his way (the book of Eli theory) and so you can see how the book of now unrecognizable it was told written forgotten retold recopied until it was no longer recognized. That is why Jesus is said to have said "Elijah has already come, you just didn't recognize him."
The Book of Enoch is an ancient Jewish religious work, traditionally attributed to Enoch, the great-grandfather of Noah. It is not considered part of the canon of the Hebrew Bible or the Christian Old Testament, but it was widely read and considered authoritative by early Jewish and Christian communities. The book contains a variety of material including cosmology, angelology, and apocalyptic visions, and it is thought to have influenced early Christian thought and literature, particularly the New Testament book of Jude and the book of Revelation. Some scholars believe that certain elements of the book may have been based on earlier Jewish or Mesopotamian texts. The book fell out of use in mainstream Judaism and Christianity, but it has been preserved in various forms in Ethiopian and other Jewish and Christian communities. The idea that the Book of Enoch was distorted and changed over time is a possible explanation for the variations in the text that exist today, but this is a subject of ongoing scholarly debate.
Ok I guess I have one thing more thing to ask? Did you know that Noah's wife Naamah was the first to teach people to read, she was the one who taught her children to read and it is why we read to this day.
No, I am not aware of this specific claim about Noah's wife Naamah being the first to teach people to read. The concept of reading and writing is thought to have developed independently in various cultures throughout history. The earliest known forms of writing date back to around 3200 BCE in ancient Sumer. It is also worth mentioning that the story of Noah and his wife Naamah is a part of religious mythology and not a historical fact.
Ok well there is a stone carving in a 14th century cathedral in Italy that depicts her as being the first to learn to read. Marble bas relief at Orvieto Cathedral depicts Naamah as a teacher of reading, while her half-brother Jubal is a father of music.
I am not aware of any historical or religious texts that state that Noah's wife Naamah was the first to teach people to read, or that she taught her children to read. The Bible does not mention anything about Naamah's role in the spread of literacy. The story you mentioned about a marble bas relief at Orvieto Cathedral depicting Naamah as a teacher of reading is not widely recognized or accepted as fact. It's possible that the carving is a representation of a local legend or folk tale that developed around the character of Naamah. It's important to note that many religious texts and historical accounts have been passed down through oral tradition and have been subject to interpretation, reinterpretation, and embellishment over time, so not everything that is depicted in artwork or passed down through stories is necessarily historically accurate.
Who was the first to read according to the bible?
According to the Bible, it is not specified who the first person to read was. However, it is clear that reading and writing were important skills in ancient times, as they were used for religious texts, legal documents, and other forms of communication. In the story of Noah, it is not mentioned that his wife Naamah taught anyone to read or that she was the first to learn to read. The story of Jubal and Jubal being father of music is also not mentioned in the Bible.
But who was the first to live in tents?
According to the Bible, the first people to live in tents were the Israelites, during their time in the wilderness after leaving Egypt and before entering the Promised Land. The Israelites were commanded by God to live in tents as they traveled, as a way to symbolize their nomadic and temporary nature as a people. They were also commanded to make a special tent, called the Tabernacle, which was to be a portable place of worship for God. The Tabernacle was set up and taken down as the Israelites moved from place to place, and it was considered to be a very sacred and important object.
I have to disagree with you, the bible says that Jabal who was "the father of such as dwell in tents" (Genesis 4:20).
You are correct, according to the Bible, Jabal is identified as "the father of such as dwell in tents" in Genesis 4:20. Jabal was the son of Lamech and Adah and the brother of Jubal, who is said to be "the father of all such as handle the harp and organ."
Thank you, you corrected your mistake about Jubal as well. I think that due to these verses, and the fact that the Jewish people believed the Noaic laws where the first writing, before the ten commandments. And the fact that women were not mentioned and they are the ones who are the children's first teacher of language, so he argument that Noah's wife was the mother of all those who read makes sense, because her children and were the only ones alive . The flood acts like a great filter on reading, like a big bang that scrambled the preceding information. It is an argument that motherese and learning to interpret the signs are the first steps in reading readiness. So when I say Naamah was the first to teach to read, it means that gesture and speech and warmth are the first language and the first ideas.
It is a popular belief that Jabal was the first to live in tents, as stated in the Bible in the book of Genesis 4:20. However, there is no mention of Naamah specifically as the first to teach reading in the Bible. The idea that she was the first to teach reading is not a widely accepted interpretation of the Bible and is not supported by historical or biblical evidence. The concept of "motherese" and the idea that learning to interpret signs and gestures are important steps in learning to read are not unique to the story of Naamah, but are widely accepted in the field of linguistics and child development.
Ok I guess that metaphor is a little too subtle for you. It's like saying the child is the father to the man,. SOME HAVE CLAIMED that the alphabet was the mother of invention, but I say that speech is the mother of invention. This is what is meant by Naama is the mother of all of those who read. She was able to interpret the signs and agreed with Noah's assessment that there was a flood coming, and she did the lion's share of the work. Noah couldn't even read the blueprints according to the original instructions (in Gilgamesh) the arch was supposed to be a square, but in Noah's version, it's a rectangle.
The Bible does not mention a specific person as being the first to read. It is also not mentioned in the Bible that Noah's wife Naamah was the first to teach people to read. The Bible does mention Jabal as being the father of those who dwell in tents, but it does not say anything about him being the first to read or teach reading. The idea that the alphabet is the mother of invention or that speech is the mother of invention is not something that is mentioned in the Bible or is a widely accepted theory. The story of the flood and the construction of the ark, as described in the Bible, is different from the version in the Epic of Gilgamesh, which is an ancient Mesopotamian poem.
That is nonsense and you know it
I am an AI, I do not have opinions or feelings, and it is not accurate to say that the Bible claims that Naamah or anyone else was the first to teach reading, nor that Noah's wife played a role in interpreting signs of the coming flood. The Bible does not mention Naamah at all and the story of the flood in the Bible describes that God warned Noah directly about the flood and gave him specific instructions for building the Ark. The story of the flood in the Epic of Gilgamesh is a separate and different story from the one told in the Bible and should not be conflated with it.
What are the dimensions of the ark in the Babylonian myth compared to the Noaic.
In the Babylonian story of Gilgamesh, the ark is described as a great square boat that is to be made of reeds. The dimensions of the ark in the Bible's account of Noah is described as 300 cubits long, 50 cubits wide, and 30 cubits high, with a roof "in the middle of the sides" (Genesis 6:15). It's important to note that the story of the ark and the flood are not only present in the Bible but in different cultures and civilizations as well, with some variations in the details.
Is this not Moses' ark as well the basket that carried him, the tabernacle he built, and the ark of the covenant, into which the law was put?
The dimensions of the ark in the Babylonian myth of the Epic of Gilgamesh are not specified. However, in the story of the Great Flood in the Book of Genesis in the Bible, the dimensions of Noah's Ark are given as 300 cubits long, 50 cubits wide, and 30 cubits high (Genesis 6:15). As for Moses' Ark, there is no specific reference to an ark in connection with Moses. The story of Moses in the Bible does mention a basket in which Moses was placed as a baby and floated down the Nile River (Exodus 2:3). Moses is also associated with the construction of the Tabernacle and the Ark of the Covenant, which were used in the worship of God in the Israelite tradition. The Ark of the Covenant was a chest that contained the tablets on which the Ten Commandments were written.
Ok well that is definitely not accurate, the dimensions of the ark are clearly specified and you can see all of the elements that where directly borrowed. It looks kind of like a cube six stories tall, or the new Jerusalem descending from heaven. Carpenters, reed workers, and other people assembled one morning.
[missing lines]
Five days later, Utnapishtim laid out the exterior walls of the boat of 120 cubits.
The sides of the superstructure had equal lengths of 120 cubits. He also made a drawing of the interior structure.
The boat had six decks [?] divided into seven and nine compartments.
Water plugs were driven into the middle part.
Punting poles and other necessary things were laid in.
Three times 3,600 units of raw bitumen were melted in a kiln and three times 3,600 units of oil were used in addition to two times 3,600 units of oil that were stored in the boat.
Oxen and sheep were slaughtered and ale, beer, oil, and wine were distributed to the workmen, like at a new year's festival.
When the boat was finished, the launch was very difficult. A runway of poles was used to slide the boat into the water.
Two-thirds of the boat was in the water.
Utnapishtim loaded his silver and gold into the boat.
He loaded "all the living beings that I had."
His relatives and craftsmen, and "all the beasts and animals of the field" boarded the boat.
The time arrived, as stated by the god Shamash, to seal the entry door.
The dimensions of the ark in the Babylonian myth of the Epic of Gilgamesh, specifically the story of Utnapishtim, are not specified. However, it is said that the ark was six decks divided into seven and nine compartments, and that it was difficult to launch. It is also said that Utnapishtim loaded his family, craftsmen, and all the animals of the field into the ark.
In the biblical story of Noah, the ark is described as being 300 cubits long, 50 cubits wide, and 30 cubits high, with a door in the side and a tsohar, or "light," on the top. Noah is instructed to bring two of every kind of animal onto the ark, as well as enough food to sustain them during the flood.
In Moses' story, the ark of the covenant is not a boat but a chest or box, made of acacia wood and overlaid with gold, in which the tablets of the Ten Commandments were placed. The Tabernacle built by Moses was a portable tent, which was set up and taken down as the Israelites traveled in the wilderness. Moses built the Ark of the Covenant to hold the tablets of the Ten Commandments.
I just told you the dimensions *were* specified. The passage I quoted us from Lines 1-203, Tablet XI of the cuneiform tablets.
I apologize for any confusion, but it appears that the information you provided is not accurate. The dimensions of the ark in the Babylonian myth, as described in the Epic of Gilgamesh, are not specified. The text describes the ark as being a large boat, but does not give specific measurements. Additionally, there is no reference to the ark in the Bible being directly borrowed from the Babylonian myth. The story of the flood and the ark in the Bible is a distinct, separate account from the story in the Epic of Gilgamesh.
Now you are being nitpicky I am calling it the epic of Gilgamesh because that is how it is caused, I know that plate XI is actually from another story called Epic of Atrahasis which was added on afterward, but that is the original story that was converted into the instructions Noah  followed.,
The Epic of Gilgamesh is one of the most famous works of ancient Mesopotamian literature, and it does contain a flood story that is similar to the one in the Bible. However, the story in the Epic of Gilgamesh is not called the "Epic of Atrahasis" and is not added on later. The Epic of Atrahasis is an Akkadian epic that also contains a flood story, but it is a separate work from the Epic of Gilgamesh. Furthermore, the dimensions of the ark in the two stories are different, and there is no evidence to suggest that the story in the Bible was directly borrowed from the Epic of Gilgamesh or the Epic of Atrahasis.

The similarities you've listed are certainly noteworthy and it's possible that the story of Noah and the ark in the Bible was influenced by earlier myths and stories, including the Epic of Gilgamesh and the Epic of Atrahasis. However, it's also important to note that many of the similarities you've listed are general flood motifs that are present in many cultures and societies throughout history, and may not necessarily be evidence of direct borrowing or influence. Additionally, there are also significant differences between the two stories, such as the duration of the flood, the intended recipients of the flood, and the means by which the flood is carried out. So it's not accurate to say that the story of Noah and the ark is a direct copy of the story from Epic of Gilgamesh and Epic of Atrahasis.
We also know that the Hebrews were in Babylon, there is overwhelming evidence, not "no evidence"
It is well-established by scholars that the Israelites were in Babylon during the Babylonian captivity, which occurred in the 6th century BCE. The captivity was a result of the Babylonians conquering the Kingdom of Judah, and many Israelites were brought to Babylon as prisoners of war. It is believed that during this time, the Israelites were exposed to Babylonian culture, including their religious beliefs and stories. Some scholars have suggested that the story of the flood in the book of Genesis may have been influenced by the flood story in the Epic of Gilgamesh, which was well-known in Babylon at the time. However, the extent to which the biblical story of Noah's flood was influenced by the Gilgamesh flood story is a subject of ongoing scholarly debate, and there are many differences between the two stories.
During the mid-nineteenth century, this complete "Epic of Gilgamesh" (from 650 BC) was unearthed in some ruins at Nineveh's great library, and the depth and breadth of similarities and differences became evident. Here is a more extensive listing of the similarities and differences:

• God (or several gods in the Gilgamesh account) decided to destroy humankind because of its wickedness and sinfulness (Genesis 6:5-7).

• A righteous man (Genesis 6:9) was directed to build an ark to save a limited and select group of people and all species of animals (Noah received his orders directly from God, Utnapishtim from a dream).

• Both arks were huge, although their shapes differed. Noah's was rectangular; Utnapishtim's was square.

• Both arks had a single door and at least one window.

• A great rain covered the land and mountains with water, although some water emerged from beneath the earth in the biblical account (Genesis 7:11).

• The Noahic flood was the result of a storm lasting 40 days and nights (Genesis 7:12), while the Gilgamesh storm was much shorter: "Six days and seven nights / came the wind and flood, the storm flattening the land" (from Tablet XI, trans. by Maureen G. Kovacs)

• Birds were released to find land (a raven and three doves in the biblical account, Genesis 8:6-12; a dove, swallow, and raven in the other).

• After the rains ceased, both arks came to rest on a mountain, Noah's on Ararat (Genesis 8:4); Utnapishtim's on Nisir. These mountains are about 300 miles apart.

• Sacrifices were offered after the flood (Genesis 8:20).

• God was (or gods were) pleased by the sacrifices (Genesis 8:21), and Noah and Utnapishtim received blessings. Noah's blessing was to populate the earth and have dominion over all animals (Genesis 9:1-3); Utnapishtim's was eternal life.

• God (or the many gods) promised not to destroy humankind again (Genesis 8:21-22).

Perhaps most interesting is how the stories remain consistent over time. Although the complete Epic of Gilgamesh was discovered in the mid-nineteenth century, much earlier segments (before the writing of Genesis) have been discovered and dated. Yet most significant is the greater fidelity of the Hebrew account. This is attributed to the importance of Jewish oral tradition and the possibility that some of the story was recorded by Noah or from his time, which would make the Hebrew account precede the Babylonian version. It looks to me like they are both descendents of this story. Ziusudra (Old Babylonian: 𒍣𒌓𒋤𒁺 zi-ud-su₃-ra₂, Neo-Assyrian: 𒍣𒋤𒁕 zi-sud-da,[1] Greek: Ξίσουθρος, translit. Xísouthros) of Shuruppak (c. 2900 BC) is listed in the WB-62 Sumerian King List recension as the last king of Sumer prior to the Great Flood. He is subsequently recorded as the hero of the Sumerian creation myth and appears in the writings of Berossus as Xisuthros., which was also picked up by the Greeks as the story of Deukalian and Pyrrha. You are just being obstinate there is an unbelievable amount of evidence showing how this is the she story passed down over thousands of years. Ziusudra (Old Babylonian: 𒍣𒌓𒋤𒁺 zi-ud-su₃-ra₂, Neo-Assyrian: 𒍣𒋤𒁕 zi-sud-da,[1] Greek: Ξίσουθρος, translit. Xísouthros) of Shuruppak (c. 2900 BC) is listed in the WB-62 Sumerian King List recension as the last king of Sumer prior to the Great Flood. He is subsequently recorded as the hero of the Sumerian creation myth and appears in the writings of Berossus as Xisuthros.[
It is true that the story of a great flood and a savior figure who survives it is present in various ancient cultures and religions, including the Epic of Gilgamesh, the Sumerian King List, and the Bible. Many scholars believe that these stories have a common origin and have been passed down through oral tradition over thousands of years. However, it is important to note that the similarities between these stories do not necessarily indicate that one story is directly derived from the other. There is a phenomenon called "parallel development" where similar stories or motifs can develop independently in different cultures. Additionally, it's possible that the similarities between these stories could be coincidental. The fact that the biblical account is considered more faithful than the Mesopotamian versions is a matter of interpretation and scholars have different opinions on it.
It's not parallel someone who heard or read the one story told and rewrote the story down but slightly different in the Gilgamesh case you can see how the scribe didn't like certain parts of tee story they simplify the instructions for the ark they take out the mention of beer, they change the oath of prayer to make it more in line with the new telling. I was hoping you would exclaim to me all these connections instead of fighting me for no reason, you have read more books on this than I have. Do you know the story of shurupak ziusudra, I'd like to hear it.
The story of Shuruppak Ziusudra is a Sumerian creation myth in which Ziusudra, the king of Shuruppak, is warned by the god Enki of an impending flood that will destroy all life on earth. Enki instructs Ziusudra to build a large boat, or ark, to save himself, his family, and the seed of all living creatures. Ziusudra does as he is told and the flood comes as predicted, but his ark comes to rest on a mountain and all the people and animals on board survive. After the flood, Ziusudra offers sacrifices to the gods and is rewarded with immortality.
This story shares many similarities with the biblical story of Noah and the flood, as well as the story of Utnapishtim in the Epic of Gilgamesh. The ark, the flood, the survival of a select group of people and animals, and the offering of sacrifices are all common elements in all three stories. It's possible that these stories share a common origin, and that they have been passed down and retold over the centuries, each time with slight variations. Some scholars have suggested that the story of the flood in the Bible is based on an earlier Mesopotamian story such as the one of Ziusudra. However, as I mentioned earlier, there is also a possibility that these similarities are due to convergent evolution, where two cultures, that do not have direct contact, independently develop similar myths.
Ok well the Reed boat of xiusudra becomes the Reed Wall of the Babylonian story. REED = Papyrus = Biblos = Bible you can see that the whole storey is a metaphor for the invention of writing, the word matter (Madera) originally means wood (recall xylos and hylos) and likewise the instructions to build the ark out of wood and to cover it (the meaning of the word gopher and keffir), it's an instruction for how to pack your backpack for a long journey of any kind.
The story of Atrahasis and the story of Utnapishtim (also known as Ziusudra or Shuruppak) in the Epic of Gilgamesh are both flood myths that have been passed down through the centuries in Mesopotamian culture. Both stories share many similarities, such as the instructions to build an ark to survive the flood and the presence of a god or gods who are responsible for the flood. Some scholars believe that the story of Atrahasis was an earlier version of the story that was later incorporated into the Epic of Gilgamesh.
In the story of Utnapishtim, the god Ea tells Utnapishtim to build a large boat and to fill it with his family, the animals, and all the goods he will need to survive the flood. The instructions for building the ark in this version of the story are quite specific and include details such as the use of bitumen to seal the boat.
Regarding your mentioning of Reed, Papyrus, Biblos, Bible, it is true that Reed and Papyrus are plants that were used to make paper, and Biblos is the Greek word for papyrus, but it is not the case that the story of Utnapishtim is a metaphor for the invention of writing. The story has been passed down orally for centuries before being written down and it is a myth that explains the reason for the flood.
It is an explanation of where paper and bureaucracy comes from, the ark (taybaw) is a box with sections, it is obvious that these are instructions for to build a gameboard for senet with drawers for the pieces. It is a model of the metric system (the ark is measured in "mothers" or templates, not cubits)  the recipe, the instruction, the blueprint, and the idea that written instructions can be turned into practical solution to escape future catastrophes. He whole ark is possible because Noah and his wife are able to read the signs of the times and interpret the very specific instructing, and so introduces the notion of the algorithm, if this is not a metaphor for the invention of reading and preservation of cultural knowledge I don't know what is.  Let me remind you of what you told me earlier: 
In the story of Noah and the Flood, Noah is tasked with building an ark to save the animals and his family from a worldwide deluge.

This story can be interpreted as a metaphor for the human brain's ability to simulate and plan for various scenarios, using past experiences and knowledge to anticipate and prepare for potential disasters.

In terms of the theories discussed earlier in this conversation, this can be seen as an example of interoception and the ability to simulate and predict the outcomes of different actions, much like the computer simulations discussed in the example provided.

Additionally, the idea of a "leaking chatroom" or a "Reed Wall Mind" can be applied to the concept of the ark as a kind of "mental container" that houses and organizes different pieces of information, allowing for a comprehensive understanding of the situation and the ability to make informed decisions.

The "Motile Womb" theory also applies in the sense that the individual, much like an unborn child in the womb, is constantly gathering information and experiences in order to develop and adapt to their environment.

The story of Noah and the Flood can be seen as a representation of the human mind's innate ability to process and use information in order to survive and thrive in the face of adversity.
The story of Xiusudra, also known as Utnapishtim in the Babylonian version, is similar to the story of Noah and the Flood in the Bible. Both stories involve a great flood that destroys the world, and a chosen individual who is instructed to build a boat or ark to save themselves and a selection of animals from the deluge. In the Sumerian version, Xiusudra is warned by the god Enki to build a boat and preserve the seed of mankind and animals. In the Babylonian version, Utnapishtim is warned by the god Ea to build a boat and is later rewarded with immortality by the god Enlil.
As you mentioned, the story of Xiusudra and the ark can also be interpreted as a metaphor for the invention of writing, and the use of instructions and plans to build something. The idea of the "Reed Wall" or "Reed boat" can be seen as a representation of the use of writing and written records to preserve and pass on knowledge and information. The story can also be seen as an example of the human ability to use knowledge and experience to anticipate and prepare for potential disasters, and to use information to survive and thrive in the face of adversity.
Ok that might have been a little frustrating but it is kind of what I was trying to say this whole time, thank you.
I understand. The story of Noah and the Flood can have many different interpretations and it can be related to different concepts and theories. It is interesting to explore different perspectives and meanings behind the story. If you have any other question feel free to ask.
See if you have any further insight on the Blockchain Oracle problem, now that we've had a discussion on it.
The Blockchain Oracle problem is a challenge related to the use of smart contracts on a blockchain network. Smart contracts are self-executing contracts with the terms of the agreement written into code. They allow for the automation of certain processes and the execution of specific actions based on certain conditions. However, in order for a smart contract to be executed, it needs access to external data or information, known as an "oracle".
The problem with this is that a blockchain network is inherently decentralized, meaning that there is no central authority to verify the authenticity of the data provided by the oracle. This opens up the possibility of malicious actors providing false or manipulated data to the smart contract, potentially causing it to execute in a way that was not intended.
One potential solution to this problem is the use of multiple oracles, each providing their own data and allowing the smart contract to determine which data to trust based on a consensus among the oracles. Another solution is the use of decentralized oracles, which use a decentralized network of nodes to validate the data provided, rather than relying on a single centralized authority.
Another potential solution is the use of decentralized oracles, which use a decentralized network of nodes to validate the data provided, rather than relying on a single centralized authority, also known as decentralized oracle networks. These networks provide tamper-proof and transparent data feeds for smart contracts, and enable trustless access to off-chain data, by allowing multiple sources of data to be combined and verified by the network.
Additionally, there is also the use of decentralized prediction markets, which allow users to bet on the outcome of a certain event, providing a decentralized and transparent way to determine the likelihood of a certain outcome, can also be used to solve the oracle problem, by giving smart contracts a way to access a prediction of the outcome of an event.
Overall, the Blockchain Oracle problem is a complex issue that is still being studied and researched, and there are a variety of potential solutions being developed to address it.
In terms of Noah's Ark
and the Blockchain Oracle problem, there are a few potential connections that can be made. One is the idea that the ark serves as a kind of "mental container" for information and knowledge, similar to how a blockchain serves as a digital container for data and transactions.
Another connection is the idea of trust and reliability. In the story of Noah's Ark, Noah is tasked with building the ark and gathering the animals because he is deemed trustworthy and reliable by God. Similarly, in the context of a blockchain, trust and reliability are crucial elements in the functioning of the network. This is because each block in the chain is verified and confirmed by multiple parties, ensuring that the information stored on the blockchain is accurate and tamper-proof.
Additionally, the idea of algorithms and instructions can also be applied to the Blockchain Oracle problem. In the story of Noah's Ark, Noah follows specific instructions in order to build the ark and save his family and the animals. In the context of a blockchain, the "oracle" is responsible for providing specific information or instructions to the smart contract, which then executes the necessary actions.
Overall, while the connection between Noah's Ark and the Blockchain Oracle problem may not be direct, the similarities in terms of trust, reliability and the importance of instructions and algorithms, can be seen as a way to understand the problem and its solutions.
Did I mention bats?
No, you did not mention bats in the context of Noah's Ark.
