Boolean Algebra B2 Functions
What is the table or chart of the 16 functions corresponding to all subsets of vertices of B2
The Boolean algebra B2 is a two-element Boolean algebra, meaning it has two elements, conventionally denoted 0 and 1. A function on the vertices of B2 can be thought of as a mapping of 0 and 1 to either 0 or 1.
There are a total of 4 subsets of the vertices of B2, which are the empty set, {0}, {1}, and {0, 1}. And for each of these subsets, there is a corresponding Boolean function.
Here's a table of the 16 functions corresponding to all subsets of vertices of B2:
