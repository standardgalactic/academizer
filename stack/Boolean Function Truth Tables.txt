Boolean Function Truth Tables
How can I retrieve the table or chart of the 16 functions corresponding to all subsets of vertices of B2, including the Boolean function expressions and their equivalent forms in binary logic.
The 16 functions corresponding to all subsets of vertices of B2 are commonly known as the truth tables of the Boolean functions. Here is the table you are looking for:
Truth Table
Boolean Function
Binary Logic
00
0
0
01
1

10
1
1
11
1
1
This table represents the "OR" function, one of the 16 possible functions for two inputs (B2).
Here's the complete list of the 16 functions:
Constant 0
Inverting function
Identity function
Boolean AND function
Boolean NAND function
Boolean OR function
Boolean NOR function
Boolean XOR function
Boolean XNOR function
Implication function
Reverse implication function
Equivalence function
Nondefault function
Exclusive OR function
Exclusive NOR function
Constant 1
Each of these functions can be represented in binary logic using Boolean algebra, which uses binary variables (0 or 1) and logical operations (AND, OR, NOT) to represent and manipulate binary functions.
Note: The exact representation of the Boolean function expressions and their equivalent forms in binary logic may vary based on the source you consult, but the 16 functions listed above should cover the majority of the truth tables you may encounter.
