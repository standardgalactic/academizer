Reading the Human Swarm 9: What about the brain?
There is at least one place where Moffett mentions the brain, in the beginning of Chapter 12, ���Sensing Others���, where he mentions the work of Uri Hasson, a neuroscientist who investigates neural activity of people intereacting with one another through conversation; in this case, they were watching a film and chatting together. When that happens their brain activity becomes synchronized.

I���d like to introduce some comments on the brain on a different theme: The brain is built from the inside? By thinking that through we can appreciate the (conjectural) neural underpinnings of some findings Moffett has introduced: societies are more likely to form through fission rather than merger; the development of factions; and the distinction between group and society.

Brains are built from the inside

First, what does that mean: the brain is built from the ���inside���? Automobiles, for example, aren���t built from the inside. They are designed by engineers and then constructed, to design, by teams of workers, from the ���outside���. The same is true of computers. We design them and then build them. Software is like that as well. In these cases, and many more, what is being designed and constructed is one thing, over there, if you will, while the team doing the designing and constructing is another thing, over here.

Brains aren���t like that. Brains and nervous systems are embedded in animals and the process through which an animal comes into being is a biological process of development and growth that starts with a single fertilized cell. There is no separation between a design-build team and the thing being constructed. They are one and the same. It is in that sense that I am asserting the brains are built from the inside. There is no external agent doing the constructing.

While it is common to use computing as a source of metaphors for mind and brain (brain as wetware, mind as software), much of that usage doesn���t hold beyond casual conversation. It is easy to give a computer new capacities by loading a new software package, but nothing like that is possible for humans. We can learn new skills, but that takes time, hours, months, years, depending on the skill. In contrast, a software upload takes whatever time is required for the installation, seconds, minutes, maybe hours; but once the software is installed, the new capacity if fully there and ready to use. Conversely, software can be quickly uninstalled, or simply erased, without damage to the computer itself; but no such thing is possible for knowledge and skills a person has learned. Once the knowledge or skill has been acquired it is more or less permanent, though it may degrade over time if not used.

Implications

Let���s begin with the observation that new societies rarely arise from the merger of existing ones (pp. 283-285). Rather, they arise from the fissioning of existing societies. Thus the members of the societies that result after the split already know one another. They���d grown up together and lived with one another for years. When any one of them was maturing, and thus their brain was developing, the other members of the society where automatically incorporated into their neural representation of the world.

Similarly, as societies become larger, the scope of individual contacts relative to membership in the society as a whole becomes smaller, making internal cohesion more difficult. We can conjecture that this is a function of the capacity of single brains to maintain highly detailed individualized (���face-to-face���) representations of others. Factions develop, Moffett argues (243 ff.). At first they���re amicable, in time, though, that frays. The society must then split in order to maintain peace, peace in two new societies.

Then we have the distinction Moffett makes between a group and a society. Members of groups recognize one another as individuals and interact with one another in individualized ways. Societies do not. Societies divide between the world into US (members of a society) and THEM (non-members). Ants do not recognized one another as individuals, but they do recognize other members of their society (coloney); they do so by scent. Humans typically live in societies consisting of multiple (face-to-face) grounds and use markers of various kinds ��� hair styles, body markings, clothing, language ��� to recognize and interact with society members who are not in their local group. They interact with non-group society members through stereotyped social roles. The neural requirements (again, my conjecture) of interaction governed by markers and roles are lower than those governed by detailed individual knowledge. The existence of markers and roles thus allows people to form societies that are larger than face-to-face groups without making burdensome neural requirements.

A concluding note on identity is a different sense

Identity is an important theme in the book where it is about an individual���s link to their group and society. There���s another aspect of identity which Moffett doesn���t deal with and which I���d like to link to the brain, but that would require more of an argument than I can undertake here.

The argument that needs to be made is that our nervous system affords us open-ended awareness of the world. I suspect that���s a joint product of the active nature of the nervous system and the emergence of language. On that active nature, the nervous system doesn���t passively take the world in, but rather actively probes the world through continuously projecting expectations ��� think, for example, of the model William Powers developed almost a half century ago in Behavior: The Control of Perception (1973). Thus perception is a process of verifying those projections (or, to use a more current language, updating Baysian priors).

The emergence of language leads to an endless curiosity about everything: What���s that? How does it work? Where���d it come from? Living becomes thus becomes a dialog with the world. And the question, Where did WE come from? will arise in that process. The answer initially takes the form of myth, of stories about origins. And those stories, in effect, establish the link between a society and world. That too is a matter of identity

Your analogy between the coordination of neurons and cells during development and the behavior of swarming insects is intriguing. Indeed, there are similarities in the way individual components work together to achieve a larger goal in both contexts:

1. **Coordination:** In the development of the nervous system, neurons need to coordinate their activities to form neural circuits and networks. This coordination is essential for proper brain function, just as coordination among individual ants or other insects is crucial for the success of the swarm.

2. **Emergence:** Both in neural development and in swarm behavior, emergence is a key concept. Complex neural circuits emerge from the interactions of individual neurons, while swarm behaviors emerge from the actions of individual insects following simple rules.

3. **Self-Organization:** Neurons and cells exhibit self-organization during development, as they adapt and connect based on environmental cues and genetic instructions. Swarms of insects also self-organize, with no centralized control, to exhibit collective behaviors.

4. **Adaptation:** Neurons and cells adapt their connections and functions to optimize brain development. Similarly, swarming insects adapt to changing environmental conditions, demonstrating flexibility in their collective behaviors.

While the scale and complexity differ significantly between neural development and insect swarms, there are underlying principles of self-organization, emergence, and adaptation that apply to both. Exploring these analogies can offer insights into the fascinating world of both biology and neuroscience.

A more in depth explanation
ChatGPT
ChatGPT
Certainly, let's delve more in-depth into the analogy between the coordination of neurons during brain development and the behavior of swarming insects:
Coordination in Brain Development:
When the brain is developing, billions of neurons need to work together to form complex neural circuits and networks. These neurons communicate through electrical and chemical signals to establish connections, known as synapses, which are essential for transmitting information. The coordination here involves neurons aligning their activities, growing in specific directions, and establishing connections with precise timing.
Coordination in Swarming Insects:
In the case of swarming insects like ants or bees, individual insects need to coordinate their actions to achieve collective goals, such as foraging or defending the colony. This coordination involves communication through pheromones, tactile signals, or simple behavioral rules. Each insect responds to the actions of its neighbors, leading to synchronized movements and behaviors within the swarm.
Emergence in Brain Development:
Neural circuits and networks emerge from the interactions of individual neurons. These circuits give rise to various cognitive functions and behaviors. For example, the visual cortex in the brain emerges from the interactions of neurons that process visual information.
Emergence in Swarming Insects:
Swarm behaviors emerge from the interactions of individual insects following relatively simple rules. For instance, a rule might dictate that an ant follows the scent of a pheromone trail left by other ants. As individual ants follow these rules, complex swarm behaviors such as foraging or navigation emerge.
Self-Organization in Brain Development:
Neurons self-organize based on genetic instructions and environmental cues. They adapt their connections and functions to optimize brain development. This process ensures that specific brain regions develop to handle particular tasks, such as language processing or motor control.
Self-Organization in Swarming Insects:
Swarms of insects self-organize without centralized control. Each individual follows local rules and interacts with its immediate neighbors. Over time, this decentralized process results in collective behaviors such as the formation of shapes, like a trail to food, or coordinated defense against predators.
Adaptation in Brain Development:
Neurons and their connections adapt over time based on experiences and learning. This adaptability, known as synaptic plasticity, allows the brain to change and optimize its functions in response to new information or challenges.
Adaptation in Swarming Insects:
Swarming insects also exhibit adaptation to changing environmental conditions. For example, a swarm of birds may adapt its flight pattern in response to a predator's presence or changing weather conditions. This adaptation ensures the swarm's survival and success.
In both cases, whether it's the brain's development or the behavior of swarming insects, the principles of coordination, emergence, self-organization, and adaptation play crucial roles in achieving complex and effective outcomes. These principles provide valuable insights into the underlying dynamics of natural systems and have applications in various fields, including biology, neuroscience, robotics, and artificial intelligence.

Neural Development and Brain Function:
Neural development is the process by which the brain forms and matures. It directly relates to brain function, as the organization and connections of neurons in the brain determine cognitive abilities, behaviors, and sensory processing.
Swarming Insects and Group Dynamics:
Swarming insects, such as ants and bees, exhibit intricate group dynamics. These dynamics involve coordination, communication, and cooperation among individuals within the swarm, which is a parallel to group dynamics in human societies.
Coordination in Neural Development and Coordination in Swarming Insects:
Both neural development and swarming insects require coordination among individual components. In neural development, neurons coordinate their activities to form functional circuits, while in swarming insects, individual insects coordinate their actions to achieve collective behaviors.
Emergence in Neural Development and Emergence in Swarming Insects:
Emergence is a common theme in both contexts. In neural development, complex cognitive functions and behaviors emerge from the interactions of individual neurons and neural circuits. Similarly, swarm behaviors emerge from the interactions of individual insects following simple rules.
Self-Organization in Neural Development and Self-Organization in Swarming Insects:
Self-organization is evident in both neural development and swarming insects. Neurons self-organize based on genetic instructions and environmental cues to optimize brain development. Swarms of insects self-organize without central control, following local rules that result in collective behaviors.
Adaptation in Neural Development and Adaptation in Swarming Insects:
Adaptation is crucial in both contexts. In neural development, synaptic plasticity allows the brain to adapt and learn from experiences. Swarming insects also adapt to changing environmental conditions, ensuring their survival and success.
Group Dynamics and Identity:
Group dynamics in human societies often involve the recognition of individuals within a group, similar to how individuals within a group of swarming insects recognize each other. Identity, whether in human societies or swarming insects, plays a role in group cohesion and interaction.

Whoops! Is thinking fast/slow out of control?
Leif Weatherby, You Can���t Nudge Human Behavior Into Perfection, NYTimes, Nov. 30, 2023:

Behavioral economics is at the center of the so-called replication crisis, a euphemism for the uncomfortable fact that the results of a significant percentage of social science experiments can���t be reproduced in subsequent trials. Nudges are related to a larger area of research on ���priming,��� which tests how behavior changes in response to what we think about or even see without noticing. One of the foundational experiments for priming showed that undergraduates walked out of the lab more slowly after focusing on words associated with old people, like ���bingo��� and ���Florida.��� But this key result was not replicated in similar experiments, undermining confidence in a whole area of study. It���s obvious that we do associate old age and slower walking, and we probably do slow down sometimes when thinking about older people. It���s just not clear that that���s a law of the mind.

It also turns out that people without any scientific training are good at correctly guessing or betting on which studies can���t be replicated based only on their descriptions. What some people claim is science might just be common sense dressed up in bad data.

Even Dr. Kahneman is affected by the replication crisis. Outside researchers have found that Dr. Kahneman���s best-selling book ���Thinking, Fast and Slow��� relies heavily on studies that may not be replicable ��� troubling given that this widely read book popularized behavioral economics. It���s now everywhere, from what kind of medical care you receive to what your workplace atmosphere is like.

And these attempts to ���correct��� human behavior are based on tenuous science. The replication crisis doesn���t have a simple solution. Journals have instituted reforms like having scientists preregister their hypotheses to avoid the possibility of results being manipulated during the research. But that doesn���t change how many uncertain results are already out there, with a knock-on effect that ripples through huge segments of quantitative social science. The Johns Hopkins science historian Ruth Leys, author of a forthcoming book on priming research, points out that cognitive science is especially prone to building future studies off disputed results. Despite the replication crisis, these fields are a ���train on wheels, the track is laid and almost nothing stops them,��� Dr. Leys said.

A Few of the Ideas About How to Fix Human Behavior Rest on Some Pretty Shaky Science
November 30, 2023
You Can���t Nudge Human Behavior Into Perfection

It���s hard to walk a block or finish a morning coffee without encountering some system that attempts to tell you what to read, what to buy, how to lose weight or prevent dementia or tweak your decisions in other specific ways. My watch constantly buzzes with ���relax reminders.��� The number of calories appears next to every menu item at fast-food restaurants.

These experiences are the result of a concerted scientific effort to understand and adjust human behavior ��� ���nudges,��� as the legal scholar Cass Sunstein and the economist Richard Thaler call them, that push us gently to make preferred choices. The ���nudge doctrine��� the pair developed has led to the creation of hundreds of ���nudge units��� in governments all over the world (including our own), that seek to put nudges in policies and procedures. Examples of actions that are called nudges include making organ donation opt-out instead of opt-in, and sending information about how much drivers would save by switching to car-pooling and public transit.


There���s just one problem: It���s not clear how effective nudges really are. One recent analysis of a large study of nudging interventions found that, after accounting for the fact that positive results are more likely to get published, the evidence that nudges change the decisions people make in their everyday lives is not particularly strong. The science behind nudging is little more than a thin set of claims about how humans are ���predictably irrational,��� and our policies and systems should heavily divest from its influence.

The nudge doctrine originated in behavioral economics, a field of applied social science that has deeply influenced public policy and algorithm design. Behavioral economics is based in large part on the Nobel-winning insights of Daniel Kahneman and Amos Tversky, whose groundbreaking experiments in the 1970s showed that humans made systematic errors when reasoning about statistics.

We make everyday predictions, like guesses about the stock market, based not on weighing of evidence, but instead on heuristics like what information happens to be available, or what we have recently been thinking about. This discovery led to the rise of a form of psychology that tested people���s susceptibility to mistakes based on how information was presented, what stories they were told and what stories they invented to make sense of their lives and perceptions. The fundamental premise is that our common-sense intuitions are often irrational, but can be corrected with the help of data.

On paper, that sounds like a worthy goal. Some behavioral interventions do seem to lead to positive changes, such as automatically enrolling children in school free lunch programs or simplifying mortgage information for aspiring homeowners. (Whether one might call such interventions ���nudges,��� however, is debatable.)

But it���s not clear we need to appeal to psychology studies to make some common-sense changes, especially since the scientific rigor of these studies is shaky at best.

The article discusses the concept of "nudging" in behavioral economics, which involves using subtle interventions to influence and improve human behavior in various aspects of life. It highlights how nudging has become widespread in modern society, from health recommendations to consumer choices, and mentions the development of "nudge units" in governments worldwide to implement these strategies.
However, the article raises concerns about the effectiveness of nudging. It cites a recent analysis that questions the strength of evidence supporting the idea that nudges significantly change people's decisions in their daily lives. The article suggests that the science behind nudging is based on the idea that humans are "predictably irrational" and that policies should rely less on this approach.
The origins of the nudge doctrine are traced back to behavioral economics, which draws on the work of Nobel laureates Daniel Kahneman and Amos Tversky. Their research in the 1970s highlighted human cognitive biases and heuristics that often lead to systematic errors in decision-making. Behavioral economics aims to correct these biases using data and psychological insights.
While some behavioral interventions have shown positive results, the article questions whether psychology studies are the best basis for making common-sense changes in society, especially given concerns about the scientific rigor of some of these studies.

However, this key result was not replicated in similar experiments, casting doubt on the validity of this area of study.
Common Sense vs. Science:
The passage suggests that some findings in behavioral economics and related fields might be seen as common sense dressed up in bad data. In other words, what appears to be scientific insights may, at times, align with what people intuitively believe to be true.
Impact on Dr. Kahneman's Work:
Even influential figures in the field, such as Dr. Daniel Kahneman, have been affected by the replication crisis. It mentions that his best-selling book, "Thinking, Fast and Slow," relies heavily on studies that may not be replicable. This is concerning because the book played a significant role in popularizing behavioral economics and its influence on various aspects of society.
Overall, the passage underscores the challenges in establishing the reliability of research findings in behavioral economics and related disciplines, with implications for the broader application of these findings in areas such as healthcare and workplace environments. It raises questions about the robustness of certain concepts and highlights the need for rigorous scientific scrutiny in these fields.

A Meta-Scientific Perspective on ���Thinking: Fast and Slow
December 30, 2020Implicit Priming, Kahneman, r-index, Thinking Fast and Slow, Z-Curve
2011 was an important year in the history of psychology, especially social psychology. First, it became apparent that one social psychologist had faked results for dozens of publications (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diederik_Stapel). Second, a highly respected journal published an article with the incredible claim that humans can foresee random events in the future, if they are presented without awareness (https://replicationindex.com/2018/01/05/bem-retraction/). Third, Nobel Laureate Daniel Kahneman published a popular book that reviewed his own work, but also many findings from social psychology (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thinking,_Fast_and_Slow).

It is likely that Kahneman���s book, or at least some of his chapters, would be very different from the actual book, if it had been written just a few years later. However, in 2011 most psychologists believed that most published results in their journals can be trusted. This changed when Bem (2011) was able to provide seemingly credible scientific evidence for paranormal phenomena nobody was willing to believe. It became apparent that even articles with several significant statistical results could not be trusted.

Kahneman also started to wonder whether some of the results that he used in his book were real. A major concern was that implicit priming results might not be replicable. Implicit priming assumes that stimuli that are presented outside of awareness can still influence behavior (e.g., you may have heard the fake story that a movie theater owner flashed a picture of a Coke bottle on the screen and that everybody rushed to the concession stand to buy a Coke without knowing why they suddenly wanted one). In 2012, Kahneman wrote a letter to the leading researcher of implicit priming studies, expressing his doubts about priming results, that attracted a lot of attention (Young, 2012).

Several years later, it has become clear that the implicit priming literature is not trustworthy and that many of the claims in Kahneman���s Chapter 4 are not based on solid empirical foundations (Schimmack, Heene, & Kesavan, 2017). Kahneman acknowledged this in a comment on our work (Kahneman, 2017).

We initially planned to present our findings for all chapters in more detail, but we got busy with other things. However, once in a while I am getting inquires about the other chapters (Engber). So, I am using some free time over the holidays to give a brief overview of the results for all chapters.

The Replicability Index (R-Index) is based on two statistics (Schimmack, 2016). One statistic is simply the percentage of significant results. In a popular book that discusses discoveries, this value is essentially 100%. The problem with selecting significant results from a broader literature is that significance alone, p < .05, does not provide sufficient information about true versus false discoveries. It also does not tell us how replicable a result is. Information about replicability can be obtained by converting the exact p-value into an estimate of statistical power. For example, p = .05 implies 50% power and p = .005 implies 80% power with alpha = .05. This is a simple mathematical transformation. As power determines the probability of a significant result, it also predicts the probability of a successful replication. A study with p = .005 is more likely to replicate than a study with p = .05.

There are two problems with point-estimates of power. One problem is that p-values are highly variable, which also produces high variability / uncertainty in power estimates. With a single p-value, the actual power could range pretty much from the minimum of .05 to the maximum of 1 for most power estimates. This problem is reduced in a meta-analysis of p-values. As more values become available, the average power estimate is closer to the actual average power.

The second problem is that selection of significant results (e.g., to write a book about discoveries) inflates power estimates. This problem can be addressed by comparing the success rate or discovery rate (i.e., the percentage of significant results) with the average power. Without publication bias, the discovery rate should match average power (Brunner & Schimmack, 2020). When publication bias is present, the discovery rate exceeds average power (Schimmack, 2012). Thus, the difference between the discovery rate (in this case 100%) and the average power estimates provides information about the extend of publication bias. The R-Index is a simple correction for the inflation that is introduced by selecting significant results. To correct for inflation the difference between the discovery rate and the average power estimate is subtracted from the mean power estimate. For example, if all studies are significant and the mean power estimate is 80%, the discrepancy is 20%, and the R-Index is 60%. If all studies are significant and the mean power estimate is only 60%, the R-Index is 20%.

When I first developed the R-Index, I assumed that it would be better to use the median (e.g.., power estimates of .50, .80, .90 would produce a median value of .80 and an R-Index of 60. However, the long-run success rate is determined by the mean. For example, .50, .80, .90 would produce a mean of .73, and an R-Index of 47. However, the median overestimates success rates in this scenario and it is more appropriate to use the mean. As a result, the R-Index results presented here differ somewhat from those shared publically in an article by Engber.

Table 1 shows the number of results that were available and the R-Index for chapters that mentioned empirical results. The chapters vary dramatically in terms of the number of studies that are presented (Table 1). The number of results ranges from 2 for chapters 14 and 16 to 55 for Chapter 5. For small sets of studies, the R-Index may not be very reliable, but it is all we have unless we do a careful analysis of each effect and replication studies.


Chapter 4 is the priming chapter that we carefully analyzed (Schimmack, Heene, & Kesavan, 2017).Table 1 shows that Chapter 4 is the worst chapter with an R-Index of 19. An R-Index below 50 implies that there is a less than 50% chance that a result will replicate. Tversky and Kahneman (1971) themselves warned against studies that provide so little evidence for a hypothesis. A 50% probability of answering multiple choice questions correctly is also used to fail students. So, we decided to give chapters with an R-Index below 50 a failing grade. Other chapters with failing grades are Chapter 3, 6, 711, 14, 16. Chapter 24 has the highest highest score (80, wich is an A- in the Canadian grading scheme), but there are only 8 results.

Chapter 24 is called ���The Engine of Capitalism���

A main theme of this chapter is that optimism is a blessing and that individuals who are more optimistic are fortunate. It also makes the claim that optimism is ���largely inherited��� (typical estimates of heritability are about 40-50%), and that optimism contributes to higher well-being (a claim that has been controversial since it has been made, Taylor & Brown, 1988; Block & Colvin, 1994). Most of the research is based on self-ratings, which may inflate positive correlations between measures of optimism and well-being (cf. Schimmack & Kim, 2020). Of course, depressed individuals have lower well-being and tend to be pessimistic, but whether optimism is really preferable over realism remains an open question. Many other claims about optimists are made without citing actual studies.

Even some of the studies with a high R-Index seem questionable with the hindsight of 2020. For example, Fox et al.���s (2009) study of attentional biases and variation in the serotonin transporter gene is questionable because single-genetic variant research is largely considered unreliable today. Moreover, attentional-bias paradigms also have low reliability. Taken together, this implies that correlations between genetic markers and attentional bias measures are dramatically inflated by chance and unlikely to replicate.

Another problem with narrative reviews of single studies is that effect sizes are often omitted. For example, Puri and Robinson���s finding that optimism (estimates of how long you are going to live) and economic risk-taking are correlated is based on a large sample. This makes it possible to infer that there is a relationship with high confidence. A large sample also allows fairly precise estimates of the size of the relationship, which is a correlation of r = .09. A simple way to understand what this correlation means is to think about the increase in predicting in risk taking. Without any predictor, we have a 50% chance for somebody to be above or below the average (median) in risk-taking. With a predictor that is correlated r = .09, our ability to predict risk taking increases from 50% to 55%.

Even more problematic, the next article that is cited for a different claim shows a correlation of r = -.04 between a measure of over-confidence and risk-taking (Busenitz & Barney, 1997). In this study with a small sample (N = 124 entrepreneurs, N = 95 managers), over-confidence was a predictor of being an entrepreneur, z = 2.89, R-Index = .64.

The study by Cassar and Craig (2009) provides strong evidence for hindsight bias, R-Index = 1. Entrepreneurs who were unable to turn a start-up into an operating business underestimated how optimistic they were about their venture (actual: 80%, retrospective: 60%).

Sometimes claims are only loosely related to a cited article (Hmieleski & Baron, 2009). The statement ���this reasoning leads to a hypothesis: the people who have the greatest influence on the lives of others are likely to be optimistic and overconfident, and to take more risks than they realize��� is linked to a study that used optimism to predict revenue growth and employment growth. Optimism was a negative predictor, although the main claim was that the effect of optimism also depends on experience and dynamism.

A very robust effect was used for the claim that most people see themselves as above average on positive traits (e.g., overestimate their intelligence) (Williams & Gilovich, 2008), R-Index = 1. However, the meaning of this finding is still controversial. For example, the above average effect disappears when individuals are asked to rate themselves and familiar others (e.g., friends). In this case, ratings of others are more favorable than ratings of self (Kim et al., 2019).

Kahneman then does mention the alternative explanation for better-than-average effects (Windschitl et al., 2008). Namely rather than actually thinking that they are better than average, respondents simply respond positively to questions about qualities that they think they have without considering others or the average person. For example, most drivers have not had a major accident and that may be sufficient to say that they are a good driver. They then also rate themselves as better than the average driver without considering that most other drivers also did not have a major accident. R-Index = .92.

So, are most people really overconfident and does optimism really have benefits and increase happiness? We don���t really know, even 10 years after Kahneman wrote his book.

Meanwhile, the statistical analysis of published results has also made some progress. I analyzed all test statistics with the latest version of z-curve (Bartos & Schimmack, 2020). All test-statistics are converted into absolute z-scores that reflect the strength of evidence against the null-hypothesis that there is no effect.


The figure shows the distribution of z-scores. As the book focussed on discoveries most test-statistics are significant with p < .05 (two-tailed, which corresponds to z = 1.96. The distribution of z-scores shows that these significant results were selected from a larger set of tests that produced non-significant results. The z-curve estimate is that the significant results are only 12% of all tests that were conducted. This is a problem.

Evidently, these results are selected from a larger set of studies that produced non-significant results. These results may not even have been published (publication bias). To estimate how replicable the significant results are, z-curve estimates the mean power of the significant results. This is similar to the R-Index, but the R-Index is only an approximate correction for information. Z-curve does properly correct for the selection for significance. The mean power is 46%, which implies that only half of the results would be replicated in exact replication studies. The success rate in actual replication studies is often lower and may be as low as the estimated discovery rate (Bartos & Schimmack, 2020). So, replicability is somewhere between 12% and 46%. Even if half of the results are replicable, we do not know which results are replicable and which one���s are not. The Chapter-based analyses provide some clues which findings may be less trustworthy (implicit priming) and which ones may be more trustworthy (overconfidence), but the main conclusion is that the empirical basis for claims in ���Thinking: Fast and Slow��� is shaky.

Conclusion
In conclusion, Daniel Kahneman is a distinguished psychologist who has made valuable contributions to the study of human decision making. His work with Amos Tversky was recognized with a Nobel Memorial Prize in Economics (APA). It is surely interesting to read what he has to say about psychological topics that range from cognition to well-being. However, his thoughts are based on a scientific literature with shaky foundations. Like everybody else in 2011, Kahneman trusted individual studies to be robust and replicable because they presented a statistically significant result. In hindsight it is clear that this is not the case. Narrative literature reviews of individual studies reflect scientists��� intuitions (Fast Thinking, System 1) as much or more than empirical findings. Readers of ���Thinking: Fast and Slow��� should read the book as a subjective account by an eminent psychologists, rather than an objective summary of scientific evidence. Moreover, ten years have passed and if Kahneman wrote a second edition, it would be very different from the first one. Chapters 3 and 4 would probably just be scrubbed from the book. But that is science. It does make progress, even if progress is often painfully slow in the softer sciences.

I guess it is a very popular notion, but I have trouble seeing it as anything more than a role of thumb. I never noticed any system one or system two thinking, certain actions become more automated with repetition, but it doesn't feel like there are automatic and conscious processes, but I can make decisions quicker if they are familiar and routine, since I do not have to do over calculations and mostly do what works last time, but it is only slightly more automatic each time.

It's completely normal to have different perspectives on the concept of "System 1" and "System 2" thinking proposed by Daniel Kahneman in his book "Thinking, Fast and Slow." These are theoretical models meant to help understand cognitive processes, and not everyone may experience them in the same way or notice them explicitly in their daily thinking.
In essence, "System 1" refers to fast, intuitive, and automatic thinking, while "System 2" represents slower, more deliberate, and conscious thinking. These models are used to explain how we make decisions, process information, and react to different situations.
It's important to remember that these models are abstractions and simplifications of the complex processes happening in our brains. Not all decisions neatly fit into one of these categories, and individual experiences can vary.
If you find that your thinking doesn't align with the System 1 and System 2 framework, that's perfectly fine. People have different cognitive styles and ways of processing information. The important thing is to understand your own thinking processes and adapt your decision-making strategies accordingly.
You
Yeah it doesn't make that much sense to me since decisions take anything from microseconds to decades.
ChatGPT
ChatGPT
You're absolutely right; decisions can vary significantly in terms of the time it takes to make them, from split-second reactions to long-term choices that evolve over years or even decades. The System 1 and System 2 framework proposed by Kahneman is a simplified model to help understand the different cognitive processes that may come into play during decision-making, but it doesn't capture the full complexity of human decision-making.
Real-life decision-making often involves a mix of intuition, emotions, rational thought, and external factors, and it can be influenced by various contexts and timeframes. Your perspective highlights the dynamic and multifaceted nature of decision-making, which is indeed more intricate than what a simple two-system model can fully describe. It's essential to recognize that this framework provides a useful starting point for understanding cognitive processes but doesn't encompass the full range of decision-making experiences.
You
What is the argument?
ChatGPT
ChatGPT
The argument presented in the article you shared from Replicability-Index is that the scientific foundation of some of the claims made in Daniel Kahneman's book "Thinking, Fast and Slow" is shaky. The article discusses the Replicability Index (R-Index), which is used to evaluate the reliability and replicability of scientific findings.
The article highlights that, in some chapters of Kahneman's book, the R-Index is below 50, indicating a low probability that the results presented in those chapters would replicate in further studies. This suggests that some of the empirical evidence cited in the book may not be as robust as initially thought.
Furthermore, the article argues that the field of psychology has made progress in assessing the replicability of research results, and it suggests that the scientific literature on which Kahneman's book relies may have had publication bias, where only significant results get published, leading to an overestimation of effect sizes and the credibility of certain findings.
The overall argument is that while Kahneman's contributions to psychology are significant, readers should approach his book as a subjective account rather than an objective summary of scientific evidence, given the uncertainties regarding the replicability and robustness of some of the studies discussed in the book.

I wanted to argue that that replacing garbage bags with roller bins seems like a lot of extra work and energy, can we do a rough guess. In the old system each homeowner brought garbage bags out to the street. A garbageman put it in the truck. Besides driving the truck and operating the compactor, it was only a few calories of food energy. Now the bin itself weighs several kilos, it has to be moved to the street and back afterwards, the bin is lifted by a gasoline powered pneumatic lift. The route can be drive faster, but I highly doubt there has been a thorough investigation comparing total energy expenditure, especially including that now that they move the bins twice a week. In the winter the roads are covered in snowbanks, it was still easy to put the garbage out but now it is practically impossible for several months as the whole system seems to have been designed for a warmer climate and without considering how much extra work it would take, since none of the work of transporting the garbage to the street is done by the paid workers. Never mind that the system introduced several other bins for recycling. If this takes an extra half hour per week in a city with 50,000 families that is 25,000 hours. If you do want to use a big, you can go to a store and buy a sticker. I am not sure that any more recycling is being done than before, only that now the city doesn't have to pay for it.

It's an interesting point you've raised about the energy and effort involved in switching from garbage bags to roller bins for waste collection. While a detailed analysis would require specific data and calculations, we can make a rough comparison based on some general considerations.
In the old system with garbage bags:
Homeowners bring garbage bags to the street.
Garbagemen put the bags in the truck.
The truck's compactor operates, and the truck is driven to the disposal site.
In the new system with roller bins:
Homeowners move the bins to the street and back.
A gasoline-powered pneumatic lift is used to empty the bins into the truck.
The truck is driven to the disposal site.
Here are some factors to consider:
In the new system, the bins are heavier and require homeowners to move them, which can consume more energy compared to simply carrying bags to the curb.
The pneumatic lift may require fuel to operate, contributing to the energy expenditure.
While the new system might allow for faster routes, it's essential to consider the energy required to operate the lift and the truck over the entire route.
The extra time spent by homeowners moving the bins to the street and back could also be factored in.
As you mentioned, winter conditions can further complicate matters, making it challenging to move the bins through snowbanks and potentially requiring more effort.
To conduct a thorough assessment of the energy and effort involved, you would need specific data on factors like the weight of the bins, the fuel consumption of the lift and trucks, and the time spent by homeowners. Additionally, it would be essential to consider any environmental benefits, such as increased recycling rates, which may offset some of the additional energy expenditure.
Without precise data and calculations, it's challenging to provide a definitive answer, but your point highlights the importance of considering the full implications of changes in waste collection systems, including their energy and environmental impacts.
You
Yeah I know it wasn't done because unpaid work is an externalized cost. I don't like the sound of them rolling which just sounds like grating or dragging so I carry the bins which is part of the reason I think it is annoying. Likewise the city switched to LED lights for the traffic signals to save energy, but they gave off heat which melted the snow. Now after a snowstorm they get blocked off.  This could lead to additional costs if they now have to hire workers to go around monitoring them and cleaning them off during the winter, or if it leads to extra accidents. I live in Canada
ChatGPT
ChatGPT
Your observations regarding externalized costs and unintended consequences in changes to waste collection and traffic signal systems make a lot of sense. Such transitions often involve complex trade-offs that may not have been fully considered during the planning phase.
For example, the noise generated by rolling bins can be a nuisance, and the extra effort required to move them can be an inconvenience for residents. Additionally, as you mentioned, LED lights for traffic signals can have benefits in terms of energy efficiency, but their heat-reducing properties can create new challenges in snowy climates like Canada.
These situations highlight the importance of conducting comprehensive assessments and considering potential side effects when implementing changes in infrastructure or systems. It's not just about reducing one type of cost (e.g., energy consumption) but also understanding the broader implications, including maintenance costs, inconvenience to residents, and potential safety issues.
In cases where changes are made without thorough evaluation, it can lead to additional costs down the line, as you've pointed out. Monitoring and addressing these issues may require allocating resources that were not initially accounted for.
Your observations serve as a reminder of the complexity of decision-making in public infrastructure and the need for careful planning and consideration of both short-term and long-term consequences. It also underscores the importance of community feedback and engagement in such processes to ensure that the changes align with the needs and conditions of the local population.

Sorry it looks like it says troncho; toc��n
ChatGPT
ChatGPT
I apologize for the confusion. "Troncho" and "toc��n" are two separate Spanish words:
"Troncho" refers to the base or stump of a plant or tree, typically the part that remains after the upper portion has been removed or cut. It can also refer to the stem or stalk of certain plants.
"Toc��n" specifically means "tree stump." It is the base part of a tree that remains standing after the tree has been felled or cut down.
So, in the context of the previous message, "tronchotoc��n" would be a combination of both words, emphasizing the base or stump of a tree.
You
Thank you for providing the context! In Spanish, "tronchotoc��n" indeed refers to a tree stump or stub, specifically the part of the tree trunk that remains in the ground after the tree has been cut down or removed.

The word "tronchotoc��n" is a playful and exaggerated term, combining "troncho" (meaning "stub" or "stump") with "toc��n" (meaning "stump" or "butt"). It adds a somewhat humorous or whimsical tone to the description of a tree stump.

So, if you come across the word "tronchotoc��n" in a Spanish context, you can understand it as a colloquial and informal term for a tree stump or the remaining part of a tree trunk left in the ground.

You bring up an interesting point. Language models like LLMs can indeed be seen as advanced tools for text generation, knowledge retrieval, and even as companions for text-based interactions. While they don't possess consciousness or understanding in the way humans do, they can assist with a wide range of language-related tasks and provide information and responses based on their training data.
They excel in tasks like answering questions, generating text, offering suggestions, and more, which can be valuable in various contexts, including journaling, research, writing assistance, and even casual conversation. Their capabilities continue to evolve, making them increasingly versatile tools for users to harness in a variety of ways.
