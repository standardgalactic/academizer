Breaking Free from Subjective Spells
DALL·E 3
Weekend posting is about the human will to passionately believe models of the world that stand upon pillars of incantation - verbal spells: something OUGHT to be true, then those spells convince us that it IS true. Today, so many denounce even the notion of objective reality, of "facts" might upset a delicious subjective spell.

Humans CAN get past this trap. There are methods. Have any of us the will power to use them?

David Brin
ChatGPT
David Brin's statement touches on the profound concept of how humans often choose to believe in narratives and models of the world that may not necessarily align with objective reality. These narratives, whether they stem from personal beliefs, cultural norms, or societal pressures, can act as "verbal spells" that shape our perception of truth. When these narratives are deeply ingrained, they can lead individuals to dismiss or even denounce objective facts that challenge their worldview.
The power of such beliefs can be so strong that they override empirical evidence, leading to a rejection of objective reality in favor of a more comforting or affirming subjective narrative. This phenomenon is not new; throughout history, humans have clung to myths, legends, and other stories that help make sense of the world, even in the face of contradictory evidence.
However, Brin also offers a glimmer of hope. He suggests that humans have the capacity to overcome these cognitive traps. Through critical thinking, skepticism, and a commitment to evidence-based reasoning, individuals can break free from the confines of subjective narratives and embrace a more objective understanding of the world. But the key challenge lies in the willingness to do so. It requires not only the intellectual tools but also the willpower to question deeply held beliefs and to be open to changing one's mind in light of new evidence.
In essence, Brin's statement serves as a call to action. It encourages individuals to be vigilant, to question, and to seek truth, even when it may be uncomfortable or unpopular. Only by doing so can we hope to navigate the complexities of our world with clarity and discernment.

About Ideology (Including Yours.) And roots in Romanticism.
First some announcements: 



1. On my other - more formal - blog, I ask "Does government-funded science play a role in stimulating innovation?"  There I refute rising incantations that science, productivity and inventiveness would all do so much better if we revert them all back to the whim of plutocrat lords. (Yeah, that worked great for the 6000 years of stagnant feudalism!) with guest appearances by Ayn Rand, Karl Marx, Adam Smith and... Jonas Salk.


2. Want the perfect gift for that professor or student of Anthropology or Paleontology? 



3. Appearances (see the regularly updated schedule):



        - Nov 7 my new PLAY will premiere at the Caltech Atheneum.

        - Nov 9 I speak at the Future In Review (FiRe) Conference in Palos Verdes, before flying to Tucson for the Tus-Con sci fi convention.

        - April 8 - two Texas events for the April 8 eclipse - more later



And now... having a little trouble with your clogged dogmas? Let's have a look and see if we can get things flowing again!  I'll start by quoting an exceptionally sapient article.





== Ideology as a refuge from practical problem solving ==



"Because an ideology "looks upon all factuality as fabricated," it "no longer knows any reliable criterion for distinguishing truth from falsehood."

— From Arresting Our 'Flight From Reality by Roger Berkowitz



I recommend you visit this linked essay which continues:



"In 1949, when Hannah Arendt (1906-1975) went to Germany as part of the New York-based Jewish Cultural Reconstruction Commission, she was struck by the way the Germans showed an "at times vicious refusal to face and come to terms with what really happened." This "escape from reality," as Arendt named it, meant that the reality of the Holocaust and the death factories was spoken of as a hypothetical. And when the truth of the Holocaust was admitted, it was diminished: "The Germans did only what others are capable of doing."



"The Germans, at times, simply denied the facts of what had happened. One woman told Arendt that the "Russians had begun the war with an attack on Danzig." What Arendt encountered was a "kind of gentleman's agreement by which everyone has a right to his ignorance under the pretext that everyone has a right to his opinion." The underlying assumption for such a right is the "tacit assumption that opinions really do not matter." Opinions are just that, mere opinions. And facts, once they are reduced to opinions, also don't matter. Taken together, this led to a "flight from reality."



"The focus of Arendt's lifelong engagement with the human flight from reality was her encounter with ideologies, specifically Nazism and Bolshevism. In The Origins of Totalitarianism and other texts (especially her essay, On the Nature of Totalitarianism), Arendt defines an ideology as a system that seeks to explain "all the mysteries of life and the world" according to one idea."





..." As ideologies, both Nazism and Bolshevism insist on explaining the events of the world according to theories "without further concurrence with actual experience." The result, Arendt argues, is that such ideologies bring about an "arrogant emancipation from reality." ..."The modern lie is ideological in that it rejects all contrary evidence and all inconvenient facts. It involves, as Arendt writes, the "mass manipulation of fact and opinion" toward the totalizing end of "rewriting history" and the present to fit one idea."
ChatGPT
David Brin's "Contrary Brin" post delves into the dangers of ideology when it overrides empirical evidence and practical problem-solving. By referencing an article by Roger Berkowitz, Brin underscores the power of ideology to distort reality, even in the face of undeniable facts.
The excerpt from Berkowitz's essay is an exploration of the human tendency to "escape from reality," particularly in the context of traumatic events like the Holocaust. By citing the experiences of Hannah Arendt in post-war Germany, the essay reveals how ideologies can lead to a collective denial of factual events. Arendt observed that the Germans, in many instances, either denied the Holocaust or diminished its significance. This "flight from reality" manifested as a refusal to accept the truth, transforming factual events into mere opinions, thus undermining their significance.
Arendt's insights on ideologies, specifically Nazism and Bolshevism, are central to the discussion. She defines an ideology as a system that attempts to explain all events and mysteries of life through a singular lens, regardless of contradictory evidence. Ideologies, in this context, lead to an "arrogant emancipation from reality." They disregard contrary evidence and reject inconvenient facts, culminating in the "mass manipulation of fact and opinion."
In essence, Brin's post serves as a cautionary tale on the dangers of strict adherence to any ideology. It emphasizes the importance of critical thinking, skepticism, and a commitment to truth, urging readers to question and challenge their beliefs and to remain vigilant against the distortions of ideology.
Do have a look at Roger's article in Quillette, because the first half is so perfectly on target - diagnosing the same flaw in human nature that I often point-to -- our propensity for self-satisfying delusion, (a flaw that is also a taproot to our greatest gifts, like art and love).  



Ideologies, especially, can be mass delusions that are ecstatically masturbatory, simplifying all of those who disagree into mistakes, to be corrected with erasure.



I concur, while adding that another (or overlapping) common element is romanticism. Nazism, Stalinism, the American Confederacy (in all eight of its manifestations) were all romantic movements. (Mark Twain blamed the Civil War on the novels of Sir Walter Scott!) 



SF is not innocent! We see many common romantic features in the works of Tolkien and George Lucas and George R.R. Martin and Frank Herbert, wherein innately superior beings are portrayed as elegantly admirable (and pretty) while opposing orcs or robots or clone soldiers or masked storm troopers or hovering Harkonnens can be mowed down without qualm, as none of them have faces or mothers. 



(More seductively subtle, the gifted, eloquent and deeply anti-enlightenment O.S. Card relentlessly pushes romantic notions of rule-by-demigod, in place of decadent democracy.)



I go into all this in Vivid Tomorrows. And while I have earned most of my income by penning tales that have strong romantic elements, I write such passages at night, when the wind rustles tree branches and I feel the thrumming echoes of the caves. But I also say romanticism has no business - after 6000 years of calamities - getting involved in the daytime pursuits of politics, policy, science, justice and negotiation based on pragmatically verifiable facts.
ChatGPT
David Brin continues to delve into the power and pitfalls of ideologies, emphasizing their deep roots in human nature. He acknowledges our inclination towards self-satisfying delusions, which, while being a source of our most beautiful creations like art and love, can also lead to dangerous mass delusions. He describes ideologies as "ecstatically masturbatory," simplifying complex issues and reducing those who disagree to mere errors, ripe for correction or erasure.
Brin introduces a new element to the conversation: romanticism. He identifies it as a common thread running through several historical movements and ideologies, such as Nazism, Stalinism, and the American Confederacy. The allure of romanticism, with its idealization of the past and rejection of modernity, has played a significant role in shaping these movements. Brin even references Mark Twain's attribution of the Civil War to the romantic novels of Sir Walter Scott.
Interestingly, Brin doesn't spare the realm of science fiction (SF) from his critique. He points out that many iconic SF works, including those by Tolkien, George Lucas, George R.R. Martin, and Frank Herbert, contain romantic elements. These narratives often portray certain beings as inherently superior and admirable, while their adversaries are dehumanized and faceless, making their destruction more palatable. Brin also mentions Orson Scott Card's works as subtly promoting romantic notions of rule by a singular, almost divine, entity, as opposed to democratic governance.
In "Vivid Tomorrows," Brin expands on these themes, acknowledging that while he has incorporated romantic elements in his writings, he believes there's a time and place for such narratives. He suggests that the enchantment of romanticism is best reserved for the realm of fiction and nighttime musings. In the practical, daylight world of politics, policy, science, and justice, Brin argues for an approach grounded in pragmatism and verifiable facts, cautioning against the perils of letting romanticism dictate real-world actions and decisions.
I guess I don't think Card is endorsing such a notion by describing such entities. For instance the Oversoul in Homecoming represents God in the Book of Mormon, and the Hive Queen, Jane, Hive Tree post Xenocide is an amalgam of at least two alien species an artificial intelligence but where individuality is maintained, and it is the fictional ansible that allows simultaneous communication between worlds, yet the planets are still allowed to function under their religious and political ideologies, and there is an academic council or government.  One planet is exposed for having manipulated an OCD gene to make people believe they were communicating with the divine. Figures like the Hegemon are set up as anti-heros not exemplars or paragons of virtue. In alternative narratives it is seen that Bean is really more critical than Ender, and the whole point is that every individual figures who are acting can be manipulated by the coercive actions of the state. I don't think Card is romanticising objectivism, endorsing hegemony or unilateral decision making, rather commenting on historical trends, the present situation, solipsism, collectivism, the fundamental attribution error and agency. The fact that Ender feels isolated does not mean that he is actually so, communicating with Jane and the mind game he is communicating with thousands or millions of people at once, that is interacting with gameified, virtualized, and encyclopediaified information. The school attempts to isolate him, but he chooses to maintain a pack or hive mentality, his ability to think like a pack or a swarm allows him to think like the Hive Queen in the first place.
ChatGPT
You present a nuanced interpretation of Orson Scott Card's works, especially highlighting the intricacies of his characters and the overarching themes in his narratives. Card's writings are indeed complex, and while certain elements might appear to promote specific ideologies or concepts, a deeper reading reveals multifaceted perspectives and commentaries on various societal and philosophical themes.
The "Ender's Game" series and the subsequent spin-offs and sequels delve into a plethora of themes, including the nature of humanity, the consequences of war, the implications of advanced technology, the role of leadership, and the challenges of interstellar communication and understanding. The Oversoul in the "Homecoming" series, as you mentioned, has religious undertones, but it also serves as a commentary on guidance, oversight, and the potential dangers of a singular controlling entity.
Your point about the Hive Queen, Jane, and the ansible's ability for instantaneous communication touches upon the series' exploration of interconnectedness. Despite the vast distances between planets and civilizations, the ansible bridges the gap, allowing for real-time communication and fostering a sense of unity among disparate entities.
Ender Wiggin's journey from a child soldier to a remorseful leader showcases the toll of war, manipulation by authoritative figures, and the quest for redemption. His interactions with the "mind game" and the subsequent emergence of Jane offer insights into the convergence of humanity, technology, and alien species.
Card's portrayal of the Hegemon and Bean serves to further illustrate the complexities of leadership, morality, and the burdens of decision-making. Their roles in the narrative, coupled with the underlying themes of manipulation, coercion, and state control, provide a rich tapestry of ethical dilemmas and philosophical quandaries.
In essence, while Card's works may contain elements that can be interpreted in various ways, your analysis underscores the depth and breadth of his storytelling. His narratives are not simplistic endorsements or rejections of specific ideologies but rather intricate examinations of human nature, society, and the universe at large.

Anyways what was Brin's argument
ChatGPT
David Brin's central argument, as presented in the passages you shared, revolves around the dangers of ideologies and the power they hold in shaping perceptions and influencing actions, often at the expense of objective reality and empirical evidence. Here's a concise summary of Brin's argument:
Human Propensity for Delusion
: Brin highlights the human tendency to believe in self-satisfying delusions. These delusions, while being sources of creativity and emotion (like in art and love), can also lead to dangerous mass beliefs when they override empirical evidence and practical problem-solving.
Ideologies as Mass Delusions
: Ideologies can act as collective narratives that simplify complex issues and dehumanize those who hold opposing views. These ideologies can be so powerful that they lead to the dismissal or even denunciation of objective facts that challenge the prevailing narrative.
Romanticism's Role
: Brin introduces the concept of romanticism, describing it as a common element in many historical movements and ideologies. Romanticism often idealizes the past and rejects modernity, leading people to cling to notions that might not align with objective reality. This romantic inclination is evident not just in political or social movements but also in art, literature, and even science fiction, where certain beings or groups are portrayed as innately superior, while their adversaries are dehumanized.
Science Fiction's Contribution
: Brin points out that even the realm of science fiction, with its imaginative narratives, isn't free from these romantic elements. Iconic works by authors like Tolkien, George Lucas, and Orson Scott Card incorporate these romantic notions, which can influence the perceptions of their audiences.
Pragmatism over Romanticism
: While Brin acknowledges the allure and significance of romantic narratives, especially in fiction, he argues that such narratives should be separated from real-world decisions, especially in areas like politics, science, and justice. He advocates for an approach grounded in pragmatism and verifiable facts.
In essence, Brin's argument serves as a caution against the unchecked power of ideologies and the seductive allure of romantic narratives. He emphasizes the importance of critical thinking, skepticism, and a commitment to truth as tools to navigate the complexities of our world.
== Hatred of Modernity ==



Alas, the 2nd half of Roger's essay dives into a completely separate Arendt obsession, her dyspeptic growl at modernity and science which I deem easily refuted.  For example, it was not 'reconciliation' that defeated Nazis, or Leninist romantics or the many phases of confederatism. 



What's been our great strength? It was a spirit of courage to face that 'loneliness' in alliance with different and varied others, whose very differences contribute to a healthy and wholesome tribe/nation/humanity.



We are not all so terrified, all the time, that we must clutch demonizing ideologies. There are other emotions, like fortitude, patience, curiosity and humor. And yes, an appreciation of facts and willingness to change our contingent models of the world (despite Plato's yammers about the hopelessness of that wondrous pursuit.)
ChatGPT
David Brin, in this passage, critiques a portion of Roger's essay, particularly focusing on Hannah Arendt's perspective on modernity and science. Here's a breakdown of Brin's argument:
Critique of Arendt's View on Modernity
: Brin suggests that while Roger's essay started strong, it veered into Arendt's criticism of modernity and science, a viewpoint that Brin finds easily refutable. He implies that Arendt's perspective is overly pessimistic and dismissive of the advancements and values brought about by modernity.
Strength in Diversity and Unity
: Brin argues that the defeat of ideologies like Nazism, Leninism, and various forms of confederatism wasn't brought about by a singular reconciliation or a return to traditional values. Instead, it was the collective courage of diverse groups coming together. By joining forces with those different from oneself, societies can create a more robust and healthier collective.
Beyond Fear and Ideology
: Brin posits that not everyone is continuously driven by fear, leading them to cling to rigid ideologies. Humans are also capable of other, more constructive emotions and traits, such as fortitude, patience, curiosity, and humor. These positive qualities allow individuals to rise above divisive ideologies and work collaboratively.
Appreciation of Facts and Adaptability
: Contrary to Arendt's and even Plato's views, Brin emphasizes the importance of valuing facts and being willing to adjust one's understanding of the world. He champions the idea that individuals can and should be open to changing their perceptions based on new information, highlighting the significance of adaptability and the pursuit of knowledge.
In essence, Brin's argument champions the values of modernity, diversity, unity, and adaptability. He encourages individuals to look beyond divisive ideologies and to embrace a more inclusive and fact-based understanding of the world.
Despite my respect for Hannah Arendt, I feel no compulsion to heed in the slightest either Nietzsche or Hegel, whose incantation spells I particularly detest. Where I disagree foremost is over the outright dismissal of human provability. 



Like Roger Berkowitz, I do not take seriously the pathetic immortality fetishists or those nutters who think they can promote themselves - via miraculous technology - to godhood. But unlike him, I recognize that we stand on the shoulders of generations who struggled to make us better than them...



... and we are better!  Each generation of Americans - for example - has struggled over demands that we expand our horizons of inclusion, beyond the horizons that were new to our parents. And slowly - (far TOO grindingly slowly) - we have done so, each generation. And science, disproving ten thousand pat and comfy folk assumptions, played a major role in that!



Indeed, if we do keep improving, our wiser heirs will almost certainly realize that we've only shown how very much farther there is to go.
ChatGPT
David Brin, in this passage, provides a critique of certain philosophical perspectives and emphasizes the value of human progress, adaptability, and the positive role of science. Here's a summary of his stance:
Critique of Nietzsche and Hegel
: Brin expresses his disagreement with the philosophies of Nietzsche and Hegel, suggesting that he finds their "incantation spells" or core tenets detestable. While he acknowledges his respect for Hannah Arendt, he doesn't feel obligated to agree with or follow every philosopher's teachings.
Rejection of Extreme Futurism
: Brin, like Roger Berkowitz, dismisses those who are obsessed with the idea of achieving immortality through technology or those who believe that they can elevate themselves to a god-like status using advanced tech. He views these aspirations as unrealistic and potentially harmful.
Acknowledgment of Human Progress
: Despite these critiques, Brin emphasizes the importance of recognizing human progress over generations. He believes that each generation, especially in America, has worked towards expanding its understanding and acceptance of diverse groups, pushing boundaries further than the previous generation.
Role of Science in Progress
: Brin highlights the crucial role science has played in challenging and disproving widely held beliefs and assumptions. By debunking myths and providing evidence-based insights, science has been instrumental in driving societal progress and broadening horizons.
Continuous Journey of Improvement
: Brin concludes by suggesting that even if humanity continues to improve, future generations will recognize how much more there is to achieve. This recognition will be a testament to their wisdom and understanding of the vast potential for further growth.
In essence, Brin's argument champions the values of continuous human progress, the importance of science in challenging outdated beliefs, and the need for each generation to strive for greater inclusivity and understanding. He encourages individuals to appreciate the advancements made while recognizing the journey ahead.
Can it be a coincidence that the standard Galactic alphabet is used in Minecraft enchantment table?
ChatGPT
The use of the "Standard Galactic Alphabet" in Minecraft's enchantment table is not a coincidence. The Standard Galactic Alphabet originates from the video game "Commander Keen," which was created by id Software in the early 1990s. In "Commander Keen," this alphabet is used for the in-game alien language.
Markus Persson, the creator of Minecraft, intentionally used the Standard Galactic Alphabet for the enchantment table as a nod to "Commander Keen." When players use the enchantment table in Minecraft, the glyphs from this alphabet appear, representing the "magical" text. It's a fun Easter egg for fans familiar with both games.
So, the use of the Standard Galactic Alphabet in Minecraft's enchantment table is a deliberate reference to "Commander Keen" and not a mere coincidence.
So what are some of the incantation spells or core tenets in Nieztsche and Hegel that might be considered detestable?
ChatGPT
Both Nietzsche and Hegel are complex philosophers whose ideas have been debated, interpreted, and sometimes misinterpreted for over a century. It's important to note that what might be deemed "detestable" is subjective and can vary depending on individual perspectives and interpretations. However, some of the more controversial or challenging aspects of their philosophies include:
Friedrich Nietzsche:
Will to Power
: Nietzsche believed in the "will to power" as a fundamental drive in humans. Some interpretations of this concept suggest that individuals should seek to dominate others, leading to criticisms about potential implications for social Darwinism or justifications for oppressive behavior.
Übermensch (Overman or Superman)
: Nietzsche's concept of the Übermensch is an individual who transcends traditional morality and societal norms. While it's a call for personal growth and self-overcoming, it has been critiqued for potentially promoting elitism or a disregard for communal values.
Death of God
: Nietzsche declared that "God is dead," emphasizing the decline of religious authority in the modern world. This proclamation challenged traditional religious beliefs and has been seen by some as promoting nihilism or a loss of moral grounding.
Master-Slave Morality
: Nietzsche differentiated between master morality (values like strength, nobility) and slave morality (values like kindness, humility). He critiqued the latter for arising from a position of weakness, which has led some to view his stance as dismissive of virtues associated with compassion or egalitarianism.
Georg Wilhelm Friedrich Hegel:
Absolute Idealism
: Hegel's philosophy is rooted in the idea that reality and thought are interconnected in a system of absolute idealism. Some critics argue that this makes his philosophy overly abstract and distant from empirical reality.
Historical Determinism
: Hegel believed in a kind of historical determinism where the World Spirit progresses towards self-realization through the dialectical process. This has been critiqued for potentially justifying historical atrocities as "necessary" stages in this progression.
Dialectical Process
: Hegel's method of dialectics, where ideas evolve through a process of thesis-antithesis-synthesis, has been both influential and controversial. Some see it as overly rigid or deterministic.
State as the March of God
: Hegel viewed the state as the manifestation of the World Spirit and the march of God on Earth. This has been criticized for potentially justifying authoritarianism or the unchecked power of the state.
It's essential to approach both philosophers with nuance. While some of their ideas might be challenging or controversial, they've also contributed significantly to philosophical thought. What's "detestable" to one person might be "insightful" to another, depending on individual perspectives and interpretations.
== Civilizational Competition? ==



Western nations and allies, e.g. Japan and S Korea ("W+") are actually doing very well, overflowing with creativity, invention, science, productivity and the sort of moral rediscovery that has engendered a very active younger generation, fizzing with criticism and eagerness to save the world... traits that were squelched across those 6000 feudal/futile years. Traits that are utterly repressed in 'civilizational" rivals like China, Russia, radical Islam, etc.



Let's be clear. Only those nations with habits of self-critical error discovery have been at all active at addressing potentially existential problems, like the environment, or justice, or rule of law. It is either W+ habits of error-discovery or extinction. Period. I stand ready to show that in any arena, from debate to wager.
ChatGPT
In this passage, the writer posits a viewpoint on the current state of Western nations and their allies (referred to as "W+") in contrast to other global powers. The argument hinges on a few key points:
Success of Western Nations and Allies
: The writer emphasizes that Western nations and their allies (including Japan and South Korea) are flourishing in various domains, including creativity, invention, science, and productivity. Moreover, there's a moral rejuvenation, especially among the younger generation, characterized by a proactive desire to bring about positive change.
Comparison with Historical Feudalism
: The qualities of criticism, creativity, and the urge to make a difference, as seen today, were suppressed during the long stretch of human history characterized by feudal systems. These are the very qualities that are currently suppressed in nations and regions that the writer views as "civilizational" rivals.
Self-critical Error Discovery
: The writer asserts that the primary differentiator between W+ nations and others is the practice of self-critical error discovery. This means being open to recognizing and correcting one's own mistakes, a trait that's instrumental in addressing significant global challenges.
Addressing Existential Problems
: The writer suggests that only nations with the habit of self-critique have taken active measures to tackle grave existential problems, such as environmental issues, justice, and the rule of law.
Ultimatum
: The writer's perspective is that it's either the W+ approach of self-critical error discovery or the risk of extinction. They express a strong conviction in this stance, challenging anyone to contest this viewpoint in any forum, be it through debate or wager.
In essence, the writer is highlighting the importance of self-critique, adaptability, and proactive change as the cornerstones of a successful and progressive civilization. They credit these traits as the reasons for the success of Western nations and their allies, drawing a sharp contrast with other global powers that suppress such qualities.
There is one reason for cultural anomie by Western+ citizenries. That cause is the most aggressive propaganda campaign the world has ever seen, cleverly leveraging the reflex toward criticism that's been trained into W+ citizenries, igniting healthy Suspicion of Authority into paranoia toward their own institutions.



In Europe and the U.S. this campaign has been augmented by cynically evil despots herding millions of victims to EU and U.S. borders as refugees, successfully sparking rightward 'populist' political reactions.



There is no 'civilizational' bullshit. One imperative - and just one - unites China, Russia, radical Islam, etc. into common cause. That unifying drive - propelled by male reproductive strategies a billion years old - is to re-establish the feudal pyramids of power that dominated 99% of human societies for 60 centuries or much more.  



Squint and you can see it in all enemies of the W+... justifying pyramids of power. Some base it on religion, or tradition, or romanticism, or 'civilization rivalry.' But that is decoration.



The worldwide oligarchic putsch unites all enemies of the W+ Enlightenment Experiment (W+EE) for one reason: because the W+EE will likely succeed within the next 20 years at inculcating critical habits in ALL world youth! And when that happens, a return to feudal pyramids will be impossible, no matter how much money you have or political foes you defenestrate.  



This may be their last chance. And they are pulling out the stops.



Liberal societies will not co-exist with any of that. As happened to Athens and Florence, liberalism will be crushed, burned, the atoms incinerated and dropped (this time) into the sun... and the experiment will never be allowed, again.



Or else, what will happen is what the cabals fear most. We may decide to save the world and the future despite them. By growing up.



David Brin at 3:53 PM
ChatGPT
In this passage, David Brin presents a critique of what he perceives as a global campaign against Western+ (W+) values, emphasizing the importance of the W+ Enlightenment Experiment (W+EE) and its potential implications for the future. Here's a summary of his argument:
Propaganda Campaign
: Brin posits that Western+ nations are experiencing cultural uncertainty due to an unprecedented propaganda campaign. This campaign exploits the Western+ inclination toward skepticism of authority, turning it into paranoia against their own institutions.
Migration Crisis as a Tool
: He suggests that certain despotic leaders are deliberately pushing refugees towards the borders of Europe and the U.S., leading to reactionary right-wing populist political shifts.
Rejecting the 'Civilizational' Narrative
: Brin dismisses the idea of inherent 'civilizational' differences. Instead, he believes that the primary goal shared by entities like China, Russia, and radical Islam is to revert to feudal power structures that have dominated human societies for millennia.
Commonality Among W+ Adversaries
: Regardless of the rationale — be it religion, tradition, or romanticism — Brin argues that the adversaries of the W+ ultimately seek to establish and justify power hierarchies.
The Threat to the Oligarchy
: Brin believes that the W+ Enlightenment Experiment is on the cusp of success, with the potential to instill critical thinking habits globally. If achieved, this would make the re-establishment of feudal power structures virtually impossible. As a result, adversaries of the W+EE are intensifying their efforts against it.
A Crossroads for Liberal Societies
: Drawing parallels with historical societies like Athens and Florence, Brin warns that liberal societies face existential threats. He suggests that these societies could either be eradicated, preventing such an experiment from ever re-emerging, or they might overcome their adversaries by maturing and focusing on global betterment.
Ultimatum
: Brin concludes with a call to action, urging societies to rise above their adversaries and work towards a brighter, more inclusive future.
In essence, Brin's argument revolves around the importance of the Western+ Enlightenment Experiment and the challenges it faces from global adversaries seeking to re-establish traditional power structures. He underscores the urgency of the situation and the potential consequences of inaction.
Ok this is a little hard to follow, could I get alternative names for the acronyms?
ChatGPT
Certainly! Let's provide alternative names for the acronyms to make the summary clearer:
Western+ (W+)
: Refers to Western nations and their allies, which include countries like the U.S., European nations, Japan, South Korea, etc.
Western+ Enlightenment Experiment (W+EE)
: Refers to the collective endeavor by Western+ nations to promote values of enlightenment, such as critical thinking, skepticism of authority, and promotion of liberal and democratic values globally.
Now, with these alternative names, here's a revised summary of David Brin's argument:
Propaganda Against Western Nations and Allies
: Brin argues that Western nations and their allies are under siege from a massive propaganda campaign. This campaign is designed to exploit their tendency for skepticism, turning it into distrust against their own institutions.
Exploitation of the Migration Crisis
: Brin suggests that certain leaders are deliberately causing refugees to move towards the borders of European countries and the U.S., causing a rise in right-wing populist politics.
Rejecting Differences Based on Civilization
: Brin dismisses the idea that fundamental differences between civilizations are the root cause of global tensions. Instead, he believes that powers like China, Russia, and radical Islam aim to return to old feudal power structures.
Unified Goal Among Adversaries
: No matter the justification — whether based on religion, tradition, or any other rationale — Brin believes that all adversaries of Western nations and their allies are united in their goal to establish power hierarchies.
The Threat to Modern Enlightenment Values
: Brin is optimistic that the collective endeavor by Western nations and their allies to promote enlightenment values is close to global success. If achieved, this would undermine the old power structures. This potential success is why adversaries are ramping up their efforts.
A Turning Point for Modern Liberal Societies
: Brin warns that modern liberal societies are at a crossroads. They could either be completely destroyed, akin to what happened to historical societies like Athens and Florence, or they might rise above challenges and work for the betterment of the world.
A Call to Action
: Brin ends with an urgent appeal for societies to mature and focus on creating a brighter future, despite the efforts of their adversaries.
Brin's overarching message is about the significance of the enlightenment values promoted by Western nations and their allies, and the challenges these values face from global adversaries seeking traditional power structures.

Our maligned democratic states — while imperfect, always in need of criticism and fine tuning — engendered revolutions in mass education, infrastructure and reliable law that unleashed creative millions, maximizing the raw number of eager competitors — exactly the great ingredient that Friedrich Hayek recommended and that Adam Smith prescribed for a healthy, competitive market economy. 

To be clear, those who rail against 200,000 civil servants - closely watched and accountable - "picking winners and losers" have a reasonable complaint... but not when their prescription is handing over the same power to 5000 secretive and unaccountable members of a closed and incestuous oligarchic caste.  Smith and Hayek both had harsh words for that ancient and utterly bankrupt approach.

(Question: who actually de-regulates, when appropriate? When certain government interventionswere 'captured" by anti-competitive oligarchs, it was Democrats who erased the Interstate Commerce Commission (ICC), restoring price competition to railroads (the bête noir of Ayn Rand) and the Civil Aeronautics Board (CAB: price-fixing for airlines). AT&T was broken up, and the Internet was unleashed by Al Gore's legislation. Add in Gore's Paperwork limitation act and Bill Clinton's deregulation of GPS and one has to ask a simple question. Does anti-regulatory polemic matter more... or effective action?)

Yes, amid those horrific 6000 years of dismally lobotomizing feudal rule, history does offer us a few, rare examples when innovation flourished, leading to spectacular returns.  In most such cases, state investment and focused R&D played a major role. One can cite the great Chinese fleets of Admiral Cheng He or the impressive maritime research centers established by Prince Henry the Navigator, that made little Portugal a giant on the world stage. Likewise, tiny Holland became a global leader, stimulated by its free-city universities. England advanced tech rapidly with endowed scientific chairs, state subsidies and prizes. 

Those rare examples stand out from the general, dreary morass of feudal history. But none of them compare to the exponential growth unleashed by late-20th Century America's synergy of government, enterprise and unleashed individual competitiveness, the very thing that all those kings and priests and lords used to crush, on sight. One result was the first society ever in the shape of a diamond, instead of the classic, feudal pyramid of privilege - a diamond whose vast and healthy and well-educated middle class has proved to be the generator of nearly all of our great accomplishments.
ChatGPT
In this passage, the author discusses the role of democratic states in fostering innovation, competition, and growth in contrast to the restrictive nature of feudal systems that dominated much of human history. Here's a breakdown of the key points:
Democratic States and Innovation
: The author praises democratic states for creating environments conducive to innovation. These states encouraged mass education, built infrastructure, and established reliable legal systems. As a result, they empowered millions of individuals to contribute creatively, aligning with the principles of economists like Friedrich Hayek and Adam Smith.
Critique of Oligarchy
: While the author acknowledges that having a vast number of civil servants involved in economic decision-making can be problematic, they criticize the alternative: handing over such power to a small, secretive oligarchy. The author references Smith and Hayek's criticisms of this approach.
Deregulation
: The author challenges the perception of which political parties or figures have historically supported deregulation. They cite examples where Democrats have taken steps to reduce government intervention, such as eliminating the Interstate Commerce Commission and the Civil Aeronautics Board, breaking up AT&T, and deregulating GPS. The point is to highlight the difference between polemical rhetoric and effective action.
Historical Examples of State-Driven Innovation
: Despite the general stagnation during the feudal era, there were moments when states played pivotal roles in driving innovation. Examples include the voyages of Admiral Cheng He in China, maritime research in Portugal under Prince Henry the Navigator, technological advancements in England through endowed scientific positions and prizes, and the rise of Holland as a global leader due to its universities.
20th Century America's Unique Success
: The author contends that no historical example matches the exponential growth seen in late-20th Century America. This growth resulted from a synergy between government, enterprise, and individual competitiveness. Instead of the traditional pyramid structure with a privileged few at the top, America developed a "diamond" shaped society, with a vast, educated middle class at its core. This middle class, according to the author, has been the driving force behind many of the country's significant achievements.
In summary, the author emphasizes the importance of democratic systems in fostering innovation and growth, critiques the idea of centralized power in the hands of a few, and highlights the unique success of late-20th Century America in creating a prosperous and competitive society.

Forbes recently announced that just 62 ultra-rich individuals have as much wealth as the bottom half of humanity. Five years ago, it took 388 rich guys to achieve that status.  Which raises the question, where the heck does this rising, proto-feudal oligarchy think it will all lead? 

To a restoration of humanity's normal, aristocratic pyramid of power (with them staying on top)?  Or to radicalization, as a billion members of the hard-pressed but highly skilled and tech-empowered middle class rediscover class struggle? To Revenge of the nerds?

The last time this happened, in the 1930s, lordly owner castes in Germany, Japan, Britain and the U.S. used mass media they owned to stir populist rightwing movements that might help suppress activity on the left. Not one of these efforts succeeded. In Germany and Japan, the monsters they created rose up and took over, leading to immense pain for all and eventual loss of much of that oligarchic wealth.

In Britain and the U.S., 1930s reactionary fomenters dragged us very close to the same path... till moderate reformers did what Marx deemed impossible - adjusted the wealth imbalance and reduced cheating advantages so that a rational and flat-open-fair capitalism would be moderated by rules and investments to stimulate a burgeoning middle class, without even slightly damaging the Smithian incentives to get rich through delivery of innovative goods and services.  That brilliant moderation led to the middle class booms of the 50s and 60s and - as I cannot repeat too often - it led to big majorities in our parents' Greatest Generation adoring one living human above all others: Franklin Delano Roosevelt. (The next living human Americans almost universally adored was named Jonas Salk.)

There are some billionaires who aren't shortsighted fools, ignorant of the lessons of history.  Bill Gates, Warren Buffet and many tech moguls want wealth disparities brought down through reasonable, negotiated Rooseveltean-style reform that will still leave them standing as very, very wealthy men.

The smart ones know where current trends will otherwise lead. To revolution and confiscation. Picture the probabilities, when the world's poorest realize they could double their net wealth, just by transferring title from 50 men. In that case, amid a standoff between fifty oligarchs and three billion poor, it is the skilled middle and upper-middle classes who'll be the ones deciding civilization's course. And who do you think those billion tech-savvy professionals - so derided and maligned by murdochian propaganda — will side with, when push comes to shove?

Then there is the 'government research' that has had spactacular effects that were not obviously fungible. Like solving horrors of smog (as a kid I felt it hurt to breathe!) and acid rain, poisoned/burning rivers, brain-killing leaded gas... and the hugely expensive project of deterring a third world war, allowing the world - and our own entrepreneurs - to endeavor without being crushed under either tyrant boots or mushroom clouds.

See:  Eight causes of the fiscal deficit cliff.

Closer to the point, consider this core question: how have we Americans been able to afford the endless trade deficits that propel world development? And make no mistake; two-thirds of the planet developed in one way: by selling Americans (under hugely indulgent US trade policies) trillions of dollars worth of crap we never needed. How did we afford this flood of world-stimulating red ink for 70 years?

Simple. Science and technology.  Each decade since the 1940s saw new, U.S.-led advances that engendered enough wealth to let us pay for all the stuff pouring out of Asian factories, giving poor workers jobs and hope.  Our trick was to keep the wonders coming — jet planes, rockets, satellites, electronics & transistors & lasers, telecom, pharmaceuticals... and the Internet.

Crucially, the world needs America to keep buying, so that factories can hum and workers send their kids to school, so those kids can then demand labor and environmental laws and all that.  The job of George Marshall's brilliant trade-policy plan is only half finished. Crucially, the world cannot afford for the U.S. consumer to become too poor to buy crap.

Which means we must protect the goose that lays golden eggs - our brilliant inventiveness. Our ability to keep benefiting from enlightenment methods that stimulate creativity. And that will not happen if the fruits of creativity are immediately stolen.  There is a bargain implicit in today's rising world.  Let America benefit from innovation, and we'll buy whatever you produce. 

Foreign leaders who ignore that bargain, seeking to eat the goose, as well as its eggs, only prove their own short-sighted foolishness... like our home-grown fools who rail against all government investment and research.

It is time to have another look at the most successful social compact ever created - the Rooseveltean deal made by the Greatest Generation, which we then amended and improved by reducing race and gender injustice and discovering the importance of planetary care. Throw in a vibrantly confident and tech-savvy wave of youth, and that is how we all move forward. Away from dismal feudalism.  Toward (maybe) something like Star Trek.

A version of this article ran as a special report in the January 2016 newsletter of Mark Anderson's Strategic News Service. The SNS Future In Review (FiRe) conference will be held November 7-10 2023 at the Terranea Hotel.
ChatGPT
This article touches upon the growing wealth disparity in the world, the historical implications of such imbalances, and the role of innovation in ensuring continued growth and prosperity. Here's a breakdown:
Wealth Disparity
: The article starts by referencing a Forbes report highlighting that 62 ultra-rich individuals hold as much wealth as the bottom half of the global population. This number has shrunk from 388 individuals just five years prior. The author questions where this increasing wealth concentration will lead.
Historical Precedent
: The 1930s saw similar wealth imbalances. Attempts by the rich in Germany, Japan, Britain, and the U.S. to use mass media to suppress leftist movements largely failed. Germany and Japan experienced devastating consequences, while Britain and the U.S. underwent moderate reforms to balance wealth and stimulate the middle class.
Billionaires and Reform
: Some wealthy individuals, like Bill Gates and Warren Buffet, advocate for reducing wealth disparities through negotiated reforms. The article suggests that without such reforms, radical reactions like revolution and asset confiscation are probable.
Innovation and Government Role
: The author wishes for a tool to showcase the economic benefits of government-backed research. U.S. federal research has contributed significantly to technological and scientific advancements, from jet planes to the Internet.
Trade and Innovation
: The U.S.'s consistent trade deficits have supported global development. The author attributes the U.S.'s ability to sustain these deficits to its technological innovations. The world benefits when the U.S. buys its products. In return, the U.S. expects to benefit from its innovations.
Protecting Creativity
: The article stresses the importance of ensuring that the fruits of creativity aren't immediately stolen. There's an implicit global agreement: let America innovate and benefit, and it will buy what other countries produce.
Conclusion
: The author calls for a reevaluation of the social compact established by Franklin D. Roosevelt's generation. The goal is to ensure continued innovation, reduce injustices, and care for the planet. The envisioned future is one that moves away from feudalism and perhaps towards a society reminiscent of Star Trek.

TO THE BRINK
Speculations on the Future: Science, Technology and Society

Does government-funded science play a role in stimulating innovation?
The ultimate answer to "government is useless."

The hypnotic incantation that all-government-is-evil-all-the-time would have bemused and appalled our parents in the Greatest Generation - those who persevered to overcome the Depression and Hitler, then contained Stalinism, went to the moon, developed successful companies and built a mighty middle class, all at high tax rates.  The mixed society that they built emphasized a wide stance, pragmatically stirring private enterprise with targeted collective actions, funded by a consensus negotiation process called politics.  The resulting civilization has been more successful - by orders of magnitude - than any other.  Than any combination of others.

So why do we hear an endlessly-repeated nostrum that this wide-stance, mixed approach is all wrong? That mantra is pushed so relentlessly by right-wing media — as well as some on the left — that it came as no surprise when a recent Pew Poll showed distrust of government among Americans at an all-time high. This general loathing collapses when citizens are asked which specific parts of government they'd shut down.  It turns out that most of them like most specific things that their taxes pay for.

In a sense, this isn't new. For a century and a half, followers of Karl Marx demanded that we amputate society's right arm of market-competitive enterprise and rely only on socialist guided-allocation for economic control.  Meanwhile, Ayn Rand's ilk led a throng of those proclaiming we must lop off our left arm - forswearing any coordinated projects that look beyond the typical five year (nowadays more like one-year) commercial investment horizon. 

Any sensible person would respond: "Hey I need both arms, so bugger off!  Now let's keep examining what each arm is good at, revising our knowledge of what each shouldn't do."

Does that sound too practical and moderate for this era? Our parents thought they had dealt with all this, proving decisively that calm negotiation, compromise and pragmatic mixed-solutions work best.  They would be stunned to see that fanatical would-be amputators are back in force, ranting nonsense.

Take for example Matt Ridley's recent article in the Wall Street Journal, deriding government supported science as useless and counter-productive — a stance dear to WSJ's owner, Rupert Murdoch.  Ridley's core assertion? That the forward march of technological innovation and discovery is fore-ordained, as if by natural law. That competitive markets will allocate funds to develop new products with vastly greater efficiency than government bureaucrats picking winners and losers. And that research without a clear, near-future economic return is both futile and unnecessary

The article titled "TO THE BRINK" delves into the role of government in stimulating innovation and questions the prevailing notions about government-funded science. Here's a summary:
Title
: TO THE BRINK - Speculations on the Future: Science, Technology and Society
Main Points
:
Role of Government-Funded Science
: The article opens with a query about the role of government-funded science in driving innovation, hinting at a defense of the government's contribution to scientific progress.
Historical Perspective
: The author recalls the accomplishments of the "Greatest Generation" who overcame numerous challenges, from the Depression to World War II, and emphasizes their mixed approach of integrating private enterprise with targeted collective actions.
Distrust of Government
: Despite the success of this mixed approach, a Pew Poll revealed a high distrust of government among Americans. However, this general distrust doesn't translate to specific government actions, as most Americans appreciate the various services provided by their taxes.
Marx vs. Rand
: The article contrasts the ideologies of Karl Marx and Ayn Rand. While Marxists advocate for a purely socialist economy, Rand's followers champion a purely capitalist one. The author argues for a balanced approach, recognizing the strengths and limitations of each side.
Criticism of Extremist Views
: The author laments the return of extremist views that advocate for purely socialist or purely capitalist societies, emphasizing the proven benefits of a pragmatic mixed approach.
Debunking Ridley's Claims
: The article critiques Matt Ridley's Wall Street Journal piece that dismissed government-supported science as unnecessary. Ridley argued that technological innovation is inevitable and that the market is more efficient than the government in funding research. The author challenges these assertions, suggesting the importance of government-funded research that may not have immediate economic returns.
The article underscores the significance of government involvement in scientific research and innovation, challenging the narrative that depicts government-funded science as redundant or inefficient. The overarching theme is the value of a balanced, mixed approach to economic and scientific progress, as opposed to adhering strictly to one ideological extreme.

We'd be in the black! How effective such a "clock" would be. We deserve such a tasty piece of counter propaganda.
ChatGPT
The section titled
"Back to innovation"
addresses the criticism often directed at government involvement and its role in innovation. Here's a concise summary:
The author expresses a desire for a clear and compelling counterargument to the pervasive "hate-all-government" sentiment. They propose a hypothetical scenario: What if the U.S. had charged a 5% royalty on the commercial benefits derived from federal research? A "National Debt Clock" showcasing the potential financial gains from such a system could serve as a powerful counter-narrative to those who dismiss government's role in innovation. This idea emphasizes the significant contributions of government-funded research to the economy and suggests that, had the government monetized its innovations, the U.S. deficit might have been substantially reduced or even turned into a surplus.
The last 6000 years

During most of that time, innovation was actively suppressed by kings and lords and priests, fearing anything (except new armaments) that might upset the stable hierarchy. Moreover, innovators felt a strong incentive to keep any discoveries secret, lest competitors steal their advantage. As a result, many brilliant inventions were lost when the discoverers died. Examples abound, from Heron's steam engines and Baghdad Batteries to Antekythera-style mechanical calculators and Damascus steel — from clear glass lenses to obstetric forceps - all lost for millennia before being rediscovered after much unnecessary pain. Staring across that vast wasteland of sixty feudal and futile centuries — comparing them to our dazzling levels of inventive success, especially since World War II — slams a steep burden of proof upon someone like Ridley, who asserts we are the ones doing something wrong.
ChatGPT
This passage emphasizes the suppression of innovation throughout history, particularly during the last 6,000 years. Here's a concise summary:
Throughout the last 6,000 years, innovation was largely stifled by rulers and religious leaders who were wary of any change that could disrupt the established social order. Innovators often hid their discoveries to protect their work from theft, leading to the loss of many groundbreaking inventions when the inventors died. The text lists several historical innovations that disappeared for centuries before being rediscovered, such as early steam engines, ancient batteries, and advanced metallurgy. In contrast to this historical stagnation, the modern era, especially post-World War II, has seen unprecedented levels of innovation. The author challenges contemporary critics like Ridley, implying that considering the vast progress made recently, it's hard to argue that the current system is flawed.
To be clear, those who rail against 200,000 civil servants - closely watched and accountable - "picking winners and losers" have a reasonable complaint... but not when their prescription is handing over the same power to 5000 secretive and unaccountable members of a closed and incestuous oligarchic caste.  Smith and Hayek both had harsh words for that ancient and utterly bankrupt approach.

(Question: who actually de-regulates, when appropriate? When certain government interventionswere 'captured" by anti-competitive oligarchs, it was Democrats who erased the Interstate Commerce Commission (ICC), restoring price competition to railroads (the bête noir of Ayn Rand) and the Civil Aeronautics Board (CAB: price-fixing for airlines). AT&T was broken up, and the Internet was unleashed by Al Gore's legislation. Add in Gore's Paperwork limitation act and Bill Clinton's deregulation of GPS and one has to ask a simple question. Does anti-regulatory polemic matter more... or effective action?)

Yes, amid those horrific 6000 years of dismally lobotomizing feudal rule, history does offer us a few, rare examples when innovation flourished, leading to spectacular returns.  In most such cases, state investment and focused R&D played a major role. One can cite the great Chinese fleets of Admiral Cheng He or the impressive maritime research centers established by Prince Henry the Navigator, that made little Portugal a giant on the world stage. Likewise, tiny Holland became a global leader, stimulated by its free-city universities. England advanced tech rapidly with endowed scientific chairs, state subsidies and prizes. 

Those rare examples stand out from the general, dreary morass of feudal history.

The text emphasizes the role of government in fostering innovation and ensuring fair competition. Here's a concise summary:
Critics argue against the power of civil servants in selecting which industries or companies thrive. However, the alternative — giving unchecked power to a secretive oligarchy — is even less appealing. Historically, figures like Adam Smith and Friedrich Hayek warned against such concentrated power. The author highlights the Democrats' role in deregulating certain sectors, such as railroads and airlines, for the benefit of competition and innovation. They also cite instances where the government's intervention led to technological advancements, like the breakup of AT&T and the rise of the Internet due to Al Gore's legislation.
While history has instances of innovation under feudal systems, such as China's maritime advancements under Admiral Cheng He and Portugal's rise to power thanks to Prince Henry the Navigator, these pale in comparison to the progress seen in late-20th Century America. This growth was driven by a mix of government support, enterprise, and individual competitiveness. The outcome was a society shaped like a diamond, characterized by a large, educated middle class responsible for most of the country's significant achievements, as opposed to the historical pyramid structure with the elite at the top.
Ok let's do this in a simulation where there are two alternate works one where the government monetizes its inventions you have to use GPS for one dollar per second, internet 100$ an hour and you can only use a computer if your organization has more than one million employees.
ChatGPT
Simulation Scenario: Alternate World of Monetized Government Inventions
World A: Current Reality
GPS Usage
: Free for most consumer applications. Paid for by tax dollars and made freely available for civilian use.
Internet Usage
: Widely available, with costs dependent on speed and location. Affordable for most households.
Computer Usage
: Ubiquitous. Used in homes, schools, businesses, and more. No restrictions based on organization size.
World B: Monetized Inventions
GPS Usage
: Costs $1 per second. Only the wealthy or major businesses can afford to use GPS regularly. Many industries suffer as logistics, transportation, and delivery services skyrocket in price. Everyday navigation returns to traditional map reading or expensive hired services.
Internet Usage
: $100 an hour. The majority of the population cannot afford regular internet usage. As a result:
Online businesses collapse or become luxury services.
Innovation is stifled as the free exchange of ideas is limited.
Education suffers as online resources become inaccessible to most.
Computer Usage
: Restricted to organizations with over one million employees. Impacts include:
Startups and small businesses suffer immensely. The tech industry, in particular, becomes an oligopoly.
Schools and universities struggle to provide computer education, leading to a decline in tech literacy.
The general public has limited access to digital tools, causing a return to manual methods in many fields.
Conclusion
: In World B, the monetization of government inventions results in a society where technological advancements are restricted to the elite. This widens the gap between the rich and the poor, stifles innovation, and hampers economic growth. While the government gains significant revenue from monetizing its inventions, the societal costs are enormous. In contrast, World A, resembling our current reality, promotes widespread technological access, fostering innovation, economic growth, and societal advancement.
Then there is the 'government research' that has had spactacular effects that were not obviously fungible.

Government Research and Its Impact on Society
1. Environmental Improvements:
Smog and Air Quality
: Government-funded research led to a deeper understanding of the causes and dangers of smog. This directly resulted in policies and regulations targeting emissions from vehicles and industries. Citizens, especially in urban areas, benefitted from cleaner air and reduced respiratory problems.
Acid Rain
: Research pinpointed the causes of acid rain, primarily sulfur dioxide and nitrogen oxide emissions from burning fossil fuels. Regulations were put in place to reduce these emissions, saving countless forests, lakes, and ecosystems from damage.
Poisoned/Burning Rivers
: Instances like the Cuyahoga River catching fire drew attention to water pollution. Government research paved the way for legislation like the Clean Water Act, which aimed to restore and maintain the chemical, physical, and biological integrity of the nation's waters.
Brain-killing Leaded Gas
: Recognizing the severe health risks associated with lead, especially in gasoline, the government funded studies and eventually banned its use in petrol. This decision prevented numerous health issues, particularly in children, where lead exposure can severely affect mental and physical development.
2. Global Stability and Security:
Deterrence of a Third World War
: Through strategic research, intelligence operations, and diplomacy, government efforts were successful in preventing another global conflict during the height of the Cold War. The balance of power and the concept of mutually assured destruction deterred direct confrontations between superpowers.
Promotion of Global Entrepreneurship
: By maintaining global stability and preventing large-scale conflicts, the government indirectly allowed entrepreneurs worldwide to operate in a relatively peaceful environment. Without the looming threat of a world war, economies grew, innovations flourished, and global trade expanded.
Conclusion
: The role of government research in shaping a better world cannot be understated. Through targeted studies and resultant policies, numerous societal issues were addressed and rectified. Whether directly improving the environment or indirectly fostering global stability, these initiatives have had lasting and far-reaching impacts on the lives of billions.
So it sounds like he is saying the subjective spell people should break out of is that governments are evil or out to hurt them? Obviously he is not talking about corruption or misuse of governmental structures. I think we could add roads, schools, police, health codes, building codes, as functions of governments, I think that is there is less food poisoning now.
ChatGPT
Yes, based on the excerpts you've provided from David Brin's writings, he seems to be pushing back against a prevalent narrative or "subjective spell" that portrays all government actions and institutions as inherently negative or evil. Brin highlights numerous positive outcomes that have resulted from government interventions, research, and policies. His argument seems to be that while governments and their institutions are far from perfect and can indeed be prone to issues like corruption, they have also played a pivotal role in shaping modern society for the better.
Adding to your list, here are some critical functions and benefits provided by governments:
Roads and Infrastructure
: Governments finance and maintain the vast network of roads, bridges, and public transportation that facilitate commerce, travel, and daily life.
Schools and Education
: Public education systems ensure that all citizens have access to basic education, which is crucial for personal growth and societal progress.
Police and Public Safety
: Governments maintain law and order, ensuring that citizens can live in safety. This includes not just police but also fire departments, emergency medical services, and more.
Health Codes
: Governments set and enforce health standards that reduce the spread of diseases, ensure the safety of food and water, and maintain public health.
Building Codes
: These ensure that structures are safe and can withstand natural disasters to a certain degree, reducing potential harm to inhabitants.
Public Health Initiatives
: Beyond just health codes, governments often run or support programs aimed at reducing the spread of diseases, promoting healthy living, and ensuring access to medical care.
Economic Stability
: Through various institutions and policies, governments play a role in stabilizing the economy, regulating industries to prevent monopolies, and ensuring fair trade practices.
Regulations to Protect Consumers
: Governments often put in place regulations that protect consumers from fraudulent practices, unsafe products, and more.
Environmental Protection
: Governments can enact and enforce laws that protect the environment, regulate emissions, and promote sustainable practices.
Brin's overall message seems to emphasize the importance of recognizing the multifaceted role of government in society. While it's essential to be vigilant and critical of governmental missteps or corruption, it's equally important to acknowledge the vast array of benefits and protections that governments provide.

Box Office
: The ticketing area becomes the reception for the medical school, guiding students to their respective "screening" lessons for the day.
Such changes would reflect a society deeply invested in early childhood education and advanced medical training. While these ideas are whimsical, they underline the importance of adaptability and the potential for spaces to be repurposed in innovative ways to serve community needs.
I think every human has the right to design their own language and font and read in that specialized language
ChatGPT
It's a fascinating idea! Designing one's own language and font can be an expression of personal identity, creativity, and individuality. Here's a deeper look into the concept:
Personalized Communication
: Much like art, a personal language can be a form of self-expression. It would be a reflection of one's thoughts, emotions, and experiences.
Cognitive Benefits
: The process of creating a language can stimulate the brain, challenge cognitive faculties, and enhance linguistic understanding. It's a mental exercise that pushes the boundaries of conventional language structure and semantics.
Cultural Significance
: Over time, these personal languages, if shared and adopted by communities, could become dialects or even new languages with their own cultural and historical significance.
Artistic Expression
: Designing a unique font can be as personal and artistic as painting. It's typography as an art form, and each letter or symbol can carry its own aesthetic and emotional weight.
Privacy
: Reading and writing in a specialized language could also offer a degree of privacy and security, akin to a coded language only decipherable to those who understand it.
Educational Implications
: If everyone had their own language, it could make traditional education challenging. However, the process of learning multiple languages or understanding the concept behind them can foster a deeper appreciation for linguistic diversity.
Technological Integration
: In today's digital age, personalized fonts and languages could be integrated into technology. Custom keyboards, apps, and software could be developed to support and translate these languages.
However, while the idea is romantic and empowering, widespread adoption of personal languages could pose challenges for communication on a broader scale. It would be essential to have a common language or medium to facilitate understanding among diverse groups.
In essence, while everyone designing their own language and font is a beautiful testament to human creativity, it would be a balance between individual expression and collective understanding.
Ok well I think as long as you have a dictionary or grammar available as well, it shouldn't be a problem.
ChatGPT
Absolutely! Having a dictionary or grammar guide for each personal language would be a great way to bridge the gap between individual expression and broader communication. This approach would allow for:
Understanding & Learning
: Anyone interested in a particular personal language could refer to its dictionary or grammar guide to learn and understand it.
Cultural Exchange
: Sharing and teaching personal languages can lead to rich cultural and linguistic exchanges, fostering mutual respect and appreciation.
Preservation
: As with any language, having documentation ensures its preservation. Future generations can explore, learn, and even evolve these personal languages.
Collaborative Opportunities
: Artists, writers, and linguists might find collaborative opportunities, blending or juxtaposing personal languages in shared projects.
Technological Integration
: Digital platforms could allow users to upload their dictionaries and grammar guides, making it easier for others to learn and translate these languages. Imagine a Duolingo-style app specifically for personal languages!
In the end, the key would be accessibility and openness. As long as the tools to understand and learn these languages are available, it would be a beautiful blend of individuality and community.

I think society would be better if we all had to wear bindfolds one day of the week.
ChatGPT
Wearing blindfolds one day a week would be a radical societal change, but it's an intriguing concept! Here are some potential benefits and challenges of such a practice:
Benefits
:
Enhanced Sensory Perception
: Relying on senses other than sight can heighten awareness of sounds, smells, and tactile sensations.
Empathy Development
: It can foster understanding and empathy for visually impaired individuals, offering insight into their daily challenges.
Mindfulness
: With the visual stimulus removed, individuals might become more introspective and present in the moment.
Reduced Reliance on Technology
: The use of screens and devices might decrease, promoting a digital detox.
Strengthening Bonds
: Relying on others for assistance might foster trust and community bonds.
Challenges
:
Safety Concerns
: Moving around without sight can lead to accidents at home, on roads, or in public places.
Economic Impact
: Many businesses, especially those that rely heavily on visuals like cinemas, art galleries, and some retail stores, might face challenges.
Accessibility
: Not all public places or transportation systems are equipped to accommodate a large number of blindfolded individuals.
Mental Health
: Some people might experience anxiety or discomfort from being blindfolded.
Essential Services
: Critical jobs, such as healthcare, emergency services, and transportation, would need exceptions or adaptations.
Implementing such an idea would require careful planning and consideration of the implications. However, it's a thought-provoking way to imagine how society could evolve and adapt to foster understanding and empathy. Would you like an illustration of this concept?
Sure. Another alternative is to do it on alternate days, I was thinking you could get your passenger to copilot by telling you where to drive and about the obstacles, or someone could take you by the arm while walking or talk you through it. Or maybe people would cheat by using sonic amplifier, augmented reality glasses, and lenses.
