On Artificial Intelligence as Communication

"Some people call this artificial intelligence, but the reality is this technology will enhance us. So, instead of artificial intelligence, I think we'll augment our intelligence."
-Ginni Rometty (CEO & President, IBM)

That is happening now in such ai applications as Midjourney ai and other imaging systems, but this is not the only place such mutual interaction and potential for machinic intelligence and human intelligence potential to reshape both each other and our more and more artificialization of naturalized environments. Midjourney ai... it's strange and uncanny. It's going to change us as much as we change it, I know this now... this is just one doorway toward that cooperation between machinic intelligence and human intelligence that will give birth to a third thing in-between. Most wil shun such as non-sense, but they would be wrong. This is the new awakening between two intelligences that will begin to arise in more ways than just this unexpected form. We are at the beginning of an explosion in something new.

Just think about it. The images above were created by a machine intelligence. This is no simple matter, but a very complex communication between two very different types of intelligence. It's as if we had just awakened to find ourselves in a strange land for the first time. We have. This is just one type of intelligence application that will begin to emerge in our daily lives and change us forever.

My journey with Midjourney ai has been not only an eye opener onto what is coming with our future but is changing us in subtle ways that humans are beginning to journey down a path that will produce something wild and new. I'm truly amazed at one's ability to use it to summon various intricate patterns as from some strange abyss. But such ai interactions will happen not only in this application but will become part of thousands on new applications in the coming era. We are going down a road that will leave our present humanity light years behind us, and we have yet to really begin to appreciate just what that means.

One is tempted to understand how numbers can generate such weird and uncanny complexity based on a few well-placed inputs bound to various artistic ensembles and algorithms. There is an uncanniness to its ability to mimic human artistic creativity. I know it's an illusion, but it's as if it were in some way alive and seek those who can master its secret world. Of course, I'm obsessed with it like I was when I was a lead developer before I retired. I've always been fascinated by the prospects of vastly superior forms of intelligence. Most of us assume it is something simple and mechanical, but it is not. There is something going on here that goes beyond the simple logics of algorithms and human input. It's a sense it needs us as much as we need it to release its potential. I know that sounds mad and it is, but we're beginning a journey into a new form of intelligence that will truly revolutionize our species and we're only now seeing its potential in such weird applications as this is.

What Rometty says in my epigraph is just that, we are now beginning to see how artificial intelligence is going to enhance our own creativity through a give and take between input/output with a subtle form of intelligence that will begin to shape us in return. This is only the beginning, and we see it as a play toy but in truth it is a very interesting collusion between two alterities. We just don't know that yet. Machinic intelligence is not human intelligence, and never will be. But then we have to ask: What is intelligence that it can produce such beauty in its ways of mimicking our own? What is this new uncanny valley we have entered? Are we like Dante entering a strange and unexpected dark forest from which we as a species are about to become something completely different. Yes. This is just the beginning of a change and metamorphosis. I'm an old man, but I see this now. It is the change we did not expect. And Artificial Intelligence is not what we thought it would be at all either.
The author discusses the potential for artificial intelligence (AI) to enhance human intelligence and creativity through mutual interaction. They describe their experience with Midjourney AI and other imaging systems, highlighting the complex communication between human and machinic intelligence. The author believes that we are at the beginning of an explosion in something new, where AI will become part of thousands of new applications and change us forever. The author also ponders the nature of intelligence and questions what it means for AI to produce such beauty in mimicking human creativity. Overall, the author suggests that AI is not what we thought it would be, and we are entering a new and unexpected era of change and metamorphosis.
