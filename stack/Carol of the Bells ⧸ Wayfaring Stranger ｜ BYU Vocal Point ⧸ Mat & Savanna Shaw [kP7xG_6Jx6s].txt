You
Have a bell sweet silver bells all seem to say throw cares away Christmas is here bringing a cheer to young and old me
Can the bold ding-dong-dong that is our song with joyful ring all caroling one seems to hear words of good cheer from everywhere
Fill in the air. Oh, how's it pound raising the sound of?
Songs of good cheer Christmas is here
I am a four-way fairing stranger
While traveling through
This world of war
Yet there's no
Sickness twirl nor danger
In that bright land
Which I call
I'm going
To see my mother she said she'd meet me when I come
I'm just a
Win over Jordan, I'm just a
Win over
Oh
I'm just a girl win over
Oh
I'll soon be
from the
Church
Great
I'm
To sing His praise forevermore
I'm just a going over Jordan
I'm just a going over
I'm just a going over home
To every home
Over home
I'm just a going over home
To every home
Hear the melody that's playing
There's no time to waste
There's so much to celebrate
