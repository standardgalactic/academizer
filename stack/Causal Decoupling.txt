This article by Adam B. Barrett et al. explores the use of Granger causality (GC) for characterizing directed functional connectivity between brain regions across different brain states, including wakefulness, sleep, and during task performance. Granger causality is a statistical concept used to determine whether one time series can predict another. The study involves new methodologies for applying GC to steady-state data, validated against analytical calculations and simulated spiking neuron local field potential data.

The researchers differentiate between 'pairwise' GC, which compares predictions based on the past of one signal alone and on the past of both signals, and 'conditional' GC, which quantifies how much the past of one signal assists in predicting the future of another, beyond what can be predicted by the pasts of other variables. They highlight the advantages of the linear autoregressive approach to GC, such as its ties to information theory and insensitivity to amplification levels.

However, the application of GC to electrophysiology data presents challenges, like non-stationarity and statistical bias. The authors present solutions to these challenges, including data segmentation and permutation analysis, and modifications to the linear autoregression model.

The methodologies are validated with simulated data from models with known GC values and simulated local field potential data from a spiking neuron simulator. This validation confirms that GC analysis can accurately represent causal structures in realistic neural dynamics. The study compares the effectiveness of pairwise and conditional GC in detecting changes in brain state, noting that while pairwise GC is more sensitive to brain state changes, conditional GC with a few variables can also yield meaningful results.

In summary, this study presents a rigorous methodology and new code for GC analysis of steady-state data, demonstrating the utility of GC in understanding functional neural interactions across different brain states.

This conference paper, titled "Flock Stability in the Vicsek Model" by Joshua M. Brown and Terry Bossomaier, is part of the Lecture Notes in Computer Science book series (volume 10413). It was first presented online on July 28, 2017, and has garnered 808 accesses and one citation, with an Altmetric score of 8.

Abstract:
The paper focuses on the Standard Vicsek Model and a popular variant employing topological neighbor interactions, both widely used for studying flocking phenomena in nature. The model demonstrates ordered and disordered states in real-world flocks through a temperature variable. The authors find that the ordered state achieved at low temperatures is not indefinitely stable, with implications for simulations and settling times. They also discover that while the loss of coherency in the metric case is reversible, it is permanent in the topological case.

Introduction:
The introduction section highlights the impressive motions of bird flocks, noting that similar flocking behavior is exhibited by various species, including schools of fish and colonies of bacteria. The Vicsek Model (VM), introduced by Vicsek et al. in 1995, is a minimal model that represents flock members as point particles with position and heading, moving with constant speed and adjusting their heading based on the average direction of neighboring particles. The model contrasts with Reynolds' earlier model, which combined alignment, dispersion, and cohesion rules for flocking phenomena.

Key Points:
1. The Vicsek Model is pivotal in studying flocking behavior, with its simplicity allowing for the analysis of ordered, disordered, and transitional states in flocks.
2. While previous studies have relied on the assumption that lower noise leads to increasing stability in flocking behavior, this paper challenges that notion.
3. The authors demonstrate that in the low noise regime, permanent stability is not guaranteed, especially over large time scales.
4. The paper provides a detailed analysis of the mechanics underlying these results, emphasizing that instability over large time scales is inevitable in certain cases.
5. The conclusion discusses strategies for managing the models to minimize instability, contributing to the broader understanding of flocking dynamics in natural systems.

Key aspects of the paper include:
Examination of the Vicsek Model (VM):
The VM, a fundamental tool in studying flocking behavior, is analyzed for its ability to represent various states (ordered, disordered, transitional) in flock behavior.

Implications for Simulation and Modeling:
The discovery that ordered states achieved at low temperatures (or noise levels) are not indefinitely stable has significant implications for how simulations are conducted and how settling times are considered in these models.
Differences in Metric and Topological Cases:
A notable finding is the contrast between metric and topological cases regarding the reversibility of coherency loss, highlighting unique characteristics of each model.
Strategies for Model Management:
The paper concludes with suggestions for managing these models to reduce instability, thereby enhancing the practical application of the Vicsek Model in understanding natural flocking dynamics.
Overall, this paper offers valuable insights into the dynamics of collective behavior, challenging some existing notions and providing a more nuanced understanding of the stability of flocking phenomena as represented in computational models.

In the "Flock Stability in the Vicsek Model" paper, the authors describe the methods used to study flock stability using the Standard Vicsek Model (SVM) and its topological variant (TVM). Here's a summary of the methods:

1. **Model Setup**: The SVM involves \( N \) particles moving continuously in a two-dimensional square space of linear size \( L \) with periodic boundary conditions. The model updates at a time interval \( \Delta t = 1 \).

2. **Position Update**: The position of each particle is updated according to the equation:
   \[ z_i(t+\Delta t) = z_i(t) + v_i(t)\Delta t, \]
   where \( v_i(t) \) is the velocity of particle \( i \) at time \( t \), having a constant magnitude \( s \) and heading \( \theta_i(t) \). This position update method is known as Backwards Update.

3. **Heading Update**: The heading angles are updated using the average direction of \( k \) neighbors of particle \( i \), including the particle itself. The neighborhood criterion differs between SVM and TVM. In SVM, it includes all particles within a radius \( r = 1 \), while in TVM, it comprises the nearest \( k_r \) particles, regardless of distance.

4. **Noise Term**: A noise term \( \xi_i(t) \) is added, which is a realization from the uniform interval \([-1, 1]\), and the overall noise level is denoted by \( \eta \), with \( 0 < \eta < 2\pi \). The noise term is critical in determining the system's phase state.

5. **Focus on Low Noise Regime**: The study focuses on the low noise regime (\( \eta < 0.5 \)), which is outside the phase transition regime, expecting large flocks to predominate.

6. **Order Parameter**: The order \( p(t) \) of the flock, which defines the overall alignment of particles at time \( t \), is used to measure the coherence of the flock. A value of \( p(t) = 1 \) signals complete alignment, while \( p(t) = 0 \) indicates complete disorder.

7. **Susceptibility**: Fluctuations in the order parameter are measured by susceptibility \( \chi = (\langle p^2 \rangle - \langle p \rangle^2) \), with a peak in \( \chi \) indicating a phase transition.

8. **Swarm Signalling Networks (SSN)**: In analyzing the topological case, SSNs derived from simulations are used to study consensus and connectivity between particles over time.

9. **Simulation and Analysis Tools**: Simulations were performed and visualized using C++, with post-processing conducted in Matlab. For statistical analysis, 100 repetitions were performed to calculate standard error.

10. **Variable Adjustments**: The free variables - \( p, N, s, k_r, r \) - were varied to explore different behaviors analogous to the results presented.

Through these methods, the authors analyze the stability of flocks in both metric and topological versions of the Vicsek Model, particularly focusing on how stability evolves over time and under varying conditions of noise and particle interaction rules.

Neighborhood Criteria:
The distinction between the neighborhood criteria in SVM and TVM is crucial, as it reflects different ways in which real animals might interact within a flock.
Incorporation of Noise:
The noise term is a critical factor in the model, introducing variability and unpredictability into the system, akin to natural environments.
Low Noise Focus:
Concentrating on the low noise regime provides insights into the behavior of flocks under conditions of high alignment and order.
Order Parameter and Susceptibility:
These metrics are fundamental in quantifying the coherence and phase transitions within the flock, providing a clear measure of flock stability.
Swarm Signalling Networks (SSN):
The use of SSNs in the topological case offers a sophisticated means to analyze the dynamic interactions and consensus-building processes within flocks.
Simulation Tools and Statistical Analysis:
The use of C++ for simulations and Matlab for post-processing ensures robust and efficient data handling and analysis.
Variable Adjustments:
The flexibility to vary key parameters allows for a thorough exploration of different flocking scenarios and behaviors.
Overall, the methodology outlined in this paper provides a solid framework for understanding the stability and dynamics of flocking behavior, enabling a deeper insight into how simple rules at an individual level can lead to complex group behaviors observed in nature.

In the next section of the paper, the authors discuss the behaviors leading to the instability of flocks in the Vicsek Model (VM) and propose potential ways to address these instabilities.

**Key Observations and Findings:**

1. **Flock Mergers and Instability**: The authors observe that once flocks reach a quasi-disordered state, they do not return to an ordered state without some dispersion rule. When flocks exhibiting these behaviors collide, they merge temporarily, forming new, denser flocks. This is demonstrated in Figure 9, where two flocks merge and then disband within 200 time steps, resulting in two new, denser flocks. 

2. **Persistence of Instability**: This quasi-disordered state and the associated instability persist regardless of the metric or topological interactions used in the model. The instability is particularly pronounced in the topological case, where it leads to a state where the original stable flock is no longer achievable. The metric case, however, shows a possibility of returning to stability, albeit not easily.

3. **Rate of Instability**: In systems with larger noise levels, the same mechanism of flock instability occurs, but at a slower rate. This is due to the time taken for the "requisite islands" of particles to contract sufficiently for fragmentation to occur.

**Conclusion and Implications:**

1. **Permanence of Consensus**: The study demonstrates that consensus in the Vicsek Model is not permanent for \( \eta < 0.5 \), regardless of the interaction type. 

2. **Potential Extensions to Address Instability**: The authors suggest that extensions to the SVM or TVM might mitigate this instability. They reference the Inertial Spin Model (ISM) by Cavagna et al., which introduces a spin component affecting the velocity of particles. This addition could lead to long-term flock stability and potentially prevent the contraction behavior in the topological case.

3. **Limitations of the Vicsek Model**: The Vicsek model's simplicity, while making it popular for numerical analyses, also leads to its limitations in practical applications. The authors suggest that the model should perhaps be replaced altogether in practical applications with a more robust model, rather than merely adjusting observation windows to avoid instability.

4. **Data Collection Strategies**: For the current Vicsek model, careful consideration of observation windows is necessary, especially when a settling time is required, to ensure that data collection regimes avoid flock instability.

In summary, this section of the paper emphasizes the inherent instabilities in the Vicsek Model's flocking dynamics and suggests that while modifications to the model could address these issues, a more robust model might be needed for practical applications.

��
<
0.5

Need for Model Extensions or Replacement
: The suggestion to potentially replace the VM with a more robust model, like the Inertial Spin Model (ISM), indicates a recognition of the VM's limitations in practical applications.
Data Collection Strategies
: The emphasis on careful consideration of observation windows when using the VM is important for researchers. It suggests that data collection should be planned with an understanding of the model's tendency toward instability, to ensure accurate representations of flock behavior.
Overall, this section of the paper provides a nuanced understanding of the complexities and limitations inherent in the VM. It suggests that while the VM is a valuable tool for studying flocking behavior, its application may need to be carefully considered or supplemented with additional models or rules to more accurately reflect the dynamics of real-world collective behavior.
