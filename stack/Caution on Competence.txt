Former MIT, Carnegie Mellon, and Stanford University faculty member—and serial entrepreneur now on his third robotics startup—Rodney Brooks recently asked GPT-3.5 the question Who is Rodney Brooks? It said he is an AI skeptic. On that score, Brooks says, GPT-3.5 got it right.
RODNEY BROOKS: CHRISTOPHER MICHEL/WIKIPEDIA; BACKGROUND: RUBY CHEN/OPENAI

Rapid and pivotal advances in technology have a way of unsettling people, because they can reverberate mercilessly, sometimes, through business, employment, and cultural spheres. And so it is with the current shock and awe over large language models, such as GPT-4 from OpenAI.

It's a textbook example of the mixture of amazement and, especially, anxiety that often accompanies a tech triumph. And we've been here many times, says Rodney Brooks. Best known as a robotics researcher, academic, and entrepreneur, Brooks is also an authority on AI: he directed the Computer Science and Artificial Intelligence Laboratory at MIT until 2007, and held faculty positions at Carnegie Mellon and Stanford before that. Brooks, who is now working on his third robotics startup, Robust.AI, has written hundreds of articles and half a dozen books and was featured in the motion picture Fast, Cheap & Out of Control. He is a rare technical leader who has had a stellar career in business and in academia and has still found time to engage with the popular culture through books, popular articles, TED Talks, and other venues.

"It gives an answer with complete confidence, and I sort of believe it. And half the time, it's completely wrong."

You wrote a famous article in 2017, "The Seven Deadly Sins of AI Prediction." You said then that you wanted an artificial general intelligence to exist—in fact, you said it had always been your personal motivation for working in robotics and AI. But you also said that AGI research wasn't doing very well at that time at solving the basic problems that had remained intractable for 50 years. My impression now is that you do not think the emergence of GPT-4 and other large language models means that an AGI will be possible within a decade or so.

Rodney Brooks: You're exactly right. And by the way, GPT-3.5 guessed right—I asked it about me, and it said I was a skeptic about it. But that doesn't make it an AGI.

The large language models are a little surprising. I'll give you that. And I think what they say, interestingly, is how much of our language is very much rote, R-O-T-E, rather than generated directly, because it can be collapsed down to this set of parameters. But in that "Seven Deadly Sins" article, I said that one of the deadly sins was how we humans mistake performance for competence.

If I can just expand on that a little. When we see a person with some level performance at some intellectual thing, like describing what's in a picture, for instance, from that performance, we can generalize about their competence in the area they're talking about. And we're really good at that. Evolutionarily, it's something that we ought to be able to do. We see a person do something, and we know what else they can do, and we can make a judgement quickly. But our models for generalizing from a performance to a competence don't apply to AI systems.

The example I used at the time was, I think it was a Google program labeling an image of people playing Frisbee in the park. And if a person says, "Oh, that's a person playing Frisbee in the park," you would assume you could ask him a question, like, "Can you eat a Frisbee?" And they would know, of course not; it's made of plastic. You'd just expect they'd have that competence. That they would know the answer to the question, "Can you play Frisbee in a snowstorm? Or, how far can a person throw a Frisbee? Can they throw it 10 miles? Can they only throw it 10 centimeters?" You'd expect all that competence from that one piece of performance: a person saying, "That's a picture of people playing Frisbee in the park."


"What the large language models are good at is saying what an answer should sound like, which is different from what an answer should be."
—Rodney Brooks, Robust.AI

We don't get that same level of competence from the performance of a large language model. When you poke it, you find that it doesn't have the logical inference that it may have seemed to have in its first answer.

I've been using large language models for the last few weeks to help me with the really arcane coding that I do, and they're much better than a search engine. And no doubt, that's because it's 4,000 parameters or tokens. Or 60,000 tokens. So it's a lot better than just a 10-word Google search. More context. So when I'm doing something very arcane, it gives me stuff.

But what I keep having to do, and I keep making this mistake—it answers with such confidence any question I ask. It gives an answer with complete confidence, and I sort of believe it. And half the time, it's completely wrong. And I spend 2 or 3 hours using that hint, and then I say, "That didn't work," and it just does this other thing. Now, that's not the same as intelligence. It's not the same as interacting. It's looking it up.

It sounds like you don't think GPT-5 or GPT-6 is going to make a lot of progress on these issues.

Brooks: No, because it doesn't have any underlying model of the world. It doesn't have any connection to the world. It is correlation between language.

By the way, I recommend a long blog post by Stephen Wolfram. He's also turned it into a book.

I've read it. It's superb.

Brooks: It gives a really good technical understanding. What the large language models are good at is saying what an answer should sound like, which is different from what an answer should be.

Not long after ChatGPT and GPT-3.5 went viral last January, OpenAI was reportedly considering a tender offer that valued the company at almost $30 billion. Indeed, Microsoft invested an amount that has been reported as $10 billion. Do you think we're ever going to see anything come out of this application that will justify these kind of numbers?

Brooks: Probably not. My understanding is that Microsoft's initial investment was in time on the cloud computing rather than hard, cold cash. OpenAI certainly needed [cloud computing time] to build these models because they're enormously expensive in terms of the computing needed. I think what we're going to see—and I've seen a bunch of papers recently about boxing in large language models—is much smoother language interfaces, input and output. But you have to box things in carefully so that the craziness doesn't come out, and the making stuff up doesn't come out.

"I think they're going to be better than the Watson Jeopardy! program, which IBM said, 'It's going to solve medicine.' Didn't at all. It was a total flop. I think it's going to be better than that."
—Rodney Brooks, Robust.AI

So you've got to box things in because it's not a database. It just makes up stuff that sounds good. But if you box it in, you can get really much better language than we've had before.

So when the smoke clears, do you think we'll have major applications? I mean, putting aside the question of whether they justify the investments or the valuations, is it going to still make a mark?

Brooks: I think it's going to be another thing that's useful. It's going to be better language input and output. Because of the large numbers of tokens that get buffered up, you get much better context. But you have to box it so much...I am starting to see papers, how to put this other stuff on top of the language model. And sometimes it's traditional AI methods, which everyone had sort of forgotten about, but now they're coming back as a way of boxing it in.

I wrote a list of about 30 or 40 events like this over the last 50 years where, it was going to be the next big thing. And many of them have turned out to be utter duds. They're useful, like the chess-playing programs in the '90s. That was supposed to be the end of humans playing chess. No, it wasn't the end of humans playing chess. Chess is a different game now and that's interesting.

But just to articulate where I think the large language models come in: I think they're going to be better than the Watson Jeopardy! program, which IBM said, "It's going to solve medicine." Didn't at all. It was a total flop. I think it's going to be better than that. But not AGI.

"A very famous senior person said, 'Radiologists will be out of business before long.' And people stopped enrolling in radiology specialties, and now there's a shortage of them."
—Rodney Brooks, Robust.AI

So what about these predictions that entire classes of employment will go away, paralegals, and so on? Is that a legitimate concern?

Brooks: You certainly hear these things. I was reviewing a government report a few weeks ago, and it said, "Lawyers are going to disappear in 10 years." So I tracked it down and it was one barrister in England, who knew nothing about AI. He said, "Surely, if it's this good, it's going to get so much better that we'll be out of jobs in 10 years." There's a lot of disaster hype. Someone suggests something and it gets amplified.

We saw that with radiologists. A very famous senior person said, "Radiologists will be out of business before long." And people stopped enrolling in radiology specialties and now there's a shortage of them. Same with truck driving.... There are so many ads from all these companies recruiting truck drivers because there's not enough truck drivers, because three or four years ago, people were saying, "Truck driving is going to go away."

In fact, six or seven years ago, there were predictions that we would have fully self-driving cars by now.

Brooks:Lots of predictions. CEOs of major auto companies were all saying by 2020 or 2021 or 2022, roughly.

Full self-driving, or level 5, still seems really far away. Or am I missing something?

Brooks: No. It is far away. I think the level-2 and level-3 stuff in cars is amazingly good now. If you get a brand-new car and pay good money for it, it's pretty amazingly good. The level 5, or even level 4, not so much. I live in the city of San Francisco, and for almost a year now, I've been able to take rides after 10:30 p.m. and before 5:00 a.m., if it's not a foggy day—I've been able to take rides in a Cruise vehicle with no driver. Just in the last few weeks, Cruise and Waymo got an agreement with the city where every day, I now see cars, as I'm driving during the day, with no driver in them.

GM supposedly lost $561 million on Cruise in just the first three months of this year.

Brooks: That's how much cost it cost them to run that effort. Yeah. It's a long way from breakeven. A long, long way from breakeven.

So I mean, I guess the question is, can even a company like GM get from here to there, where it's throwing off huge profits?

Brooks: I wonder about that. We've seen a lot of the efforts shut down. It sort of didn't make sense that there were so many different companies all trying to do it. Maybe, now that we're merged down to one or two efforts and out of that, we'll gradually get there. But here's another case where the hype, I think, has slowed us down. In the '90s, there was a lot of research, especially at Berkeley, about what sensors you could embed in freeways which would help cars drive without a driver paying attention. So putting sensors, changing the infrastructure, and changing the cars so they used that new infrastructure, you would get attentionless driving.

"One of the standard processes has four teraflops—four million million floating point operations a second on a piece of silicon that costs 5 bucks. It's just mind-blowing, the amount of computation."
—Rodney Brooks, Robust.AI

But then the hype came: "Oh no, we don't even need that. It's just going to be a few years and the cars will drive themselves. You don't need to change infrastructure." So we stopped changing infrastructure. And I think that slowed the whole autonomous vehicles for commuting down by at least 10, maybe 20 years. There's a few companies starting to do it now again.

It takes a long time to make these things real.

I don't really enjoy driving, so when I see these pictures from popular magazines in the 1950s of people sitting in bubble-dome cars, facing each other, four people enjoying themselves playing cards on the highway, count me in.

Brooks: Absolutely. And as a species, humanity, we have changed up our mobility infrastructure multiple times. In the early 1800s, it was steam trains. We had to do enormous changes to our infrastructure. We had to put flat rails right across countries. When we started adopting automobiles around the turn from the 19th to the 20th century, we changed the roads. We changed the laws. People could no longer walk in the middle of the road like they used to.

HULTON ARCHIVE/GETTY IMAGES
We changed the infrastructure. When you go from trains that are driven by a person to self-driving trains, such as we see in airports and a few out there, there's a whole change in infrastructure so that you can't possibly have a person walking on the tracks. We've tried to make this transition [to self-driving cars] without changing infrastructure. You always need to change infrastructure if you're going to do a major change.

You recently wrote that there will be no viable robotics applications that will harness the serious power of GPTs in any meaningful way. But given that, is there some other avenue of AI development now that will prove more beneficial for robotics, or more transformative? Or alternatively, will AI and robotics kind of diverge for a while, while enormous resources are put on large language models?

Brooks: Well, let me give a very positive spin. There has been a transformation. It's just taking a little longer to get there. Convolutional neural networks being able to label regions of an image. It's not perceiving in the same way a person perceives, but we can label what's there. Along with the end of Moore's Law and Dennard scaling—this is allowing silicon designers to get outside of the idea of just a faster PC. And so now, we're seeing very cheap pieces of very effective silicon that you put right with a camera. Instead of getting an image out, you now get labels out, labels of what's there. And it's pretty damn good. And it's really cheap. So one of the standard processes has four teraflops—four million million floating point operations a second on a piece of silicon that costs 5 bucks. It's just mind-blowing, the amount of computation.

It would narrow floating point, 16-bit floating point, being applied to this labelling. We're not seeing that yet in many deployed robots, but a lot of people are using that, and building, experimenting, getting towards product. So there's a case where AI, convolutional neural networks—which, by the way, applied to vision is 10 years old—is going to make a difference.

"Amazon really made life difficult for other suppliers by doing [robotics in the warehouse]. But 80 percent of warehouses in the U.S. have zero automation; only 5 percent are heavily automated."
—Rodney Brooks, Robust.AI

And here's one of my other "Seven Deadly Sins of AI Prediction." It was how fast people think new stuff is going to be deployed. It takes a while to deploy it, especially when hardware is involved, because that's just lots of stuff that all has to be balanced out. It takes time. Like the self-driving cars.

So of the major categories of robotics—warehouse robots, collaborative robots, manufacturing robots, autonomous vehicles—which are the most exciting right now to you or which of these subdisciplines has experienced the most rapid and interesting growth?

Brooks: Well, I'm personally working in warehouse robots for logistics.

And your last company did collaborative robots.

Brooks: Did collaborative robots in factories. That company was a beautiful artistic success, a financial failure, but—

This is Rethink Robotics.

Brooks:Rethink Robotics, but going on from that now, we were too early, and I made some dumb errors. I take responsibility for that. Some dumb errors in how we approached the market. But that whole thing is now—that's going along. It's going to take another 10 or 15 years.

Collaborative robots will.

Brooks: Collaborative robots, but that's what people expect now. Robots don't need to be in cages anymore. They can be out with humans. In warehouses, we've had more and more. You buy stuff at home, expect it to be delivered to your home. COVID accelerated that.

People expect it the same day now in some places.

Brooks: Well, Amazon really made life difficult for other suppliers by doing it. But 80 percent of warehouses in the U.S. have zero automation; only 5 percent are heavily automated.

And those are probably the largest.

Brooks: Yeah, they're the big ones. Amazon has enormous numbers of those, for instance. But there's a large number of warehouses which don't have automation.

So these are medium-size warehouses?

Brooks: Yeah. 100,000 square feet, something of that sort, whereas the Amazon ones tend to be over a million square feet and you completely rebuild it [around the automation]. But these 80 percent are not going to get rebuilt. They have to adopt automation into an existing workflow and modify it over time. And there are a few companies that have been successful, and I think there's a lot of room for other companies and other workflows.

"[Warehouse workers] are not subject to the whims of the automation. They get to take over. When the robot's clearly doing something dumb, they can just grab it and move it, and it repairs."
—Rodney Brooks, Robust.AI

So for your current company, Robust.AI, this is your target.

Brooks: That's what we're doing. Yeah.

Explain how paragon and antiaparagon time would work, two global timezones, offset by 12 hours, and continuous use public resources.
1 / 1
ChatGPT
ChatGPT
The concept of "paragon" and "antiaparagon" time, with two global time zones offset by 12 hours, is an interesting idea that could potentially be implemented to maximize the continuous use of public resources and facilitate global coordination. Here's a possible explanation of how it could work:
Paragon Time Zone: This time zone could be established in a region where public resources, such as energy, transportation, and communication infrastructure, are highly efficient and readily available. It would serve as a reference point for scheduling activities and utilizing resources optimally. Let's say this time zone is set at UTC+0.
Antiaparagon Time Zone: The antiaparagon time zone would be established on the opposite side of the globe from the Paragon Time Zone, offset by exactly 12 hours. This would ensure that when one time zone is at its peak usage, the other is in a state of lower demand. For example, if the Paragon Time Zone is at 12:00 PM (noon), the Antiaparagon Time Zone would be at 12:00 AM (midnight) of the next day.
Continuous Use of Public Resources: By having two global time zones offset by 12 hours, there would be a continuous utilization of public resources. When one time zone is actively using and demanding resources, the other would experience a lower demand, allowing for maintenance, restocking, or resource allocation activities to take place efficiently. This would help optimize resource utilization on a global scale.
Global Coordination: The establishment of Paragon and Antiaparagon Time Zones could facilitate global coordination, especially in cases where international collaboration, communication, and scheduling are crucial. It would provide a standardized framework for scheduling meetings, conferences, and other time-dependent activities, taking into account the optimal usage of public resources.
Implementing such a system would require global consensus, international agreements, and significant coordination among countries and regions. It would involve adjustments to existing time zones and the adaptation of various sectors to the new scheduling paradigm.
It's worth noting that this concept is purely hypothetical and speculative, and its feasibility, benefits, and potential drawbacks would need to be thoroughly evaluated and analyzed by experts in various fields such as economics, logistics, and international relations.

It looks like I want to make a rough cost analysis and the savings of not having so many time zones, and how less surface area is used, parks, schools, churches, could be open 24 hours.
1 / 1
ChatGPT
ChatGPT
Certainly, let's consider a rough cost analysis and potential savings associated with having fewer time zones and the extended availability of public spaces. Please note that this analysis is based on hypothetical assumptions and would require more comprehensive research and data for accurate estimations.
Reduction in Time Zone Administration Costs: With fewer time zones, there would be a reduction in administrative costs associated with managing and coordinating different time zones. This could include costs related to timekeeping systems, synchronization, and the need for international time zone conversions and updates.
Increased Efficiency of Public Resources: The extended opening hours of parks, schools, churches, and other public spaces could lead to more efficient utilization of these resources. For example, parks could accommodate a broader range of activities, such as exercise, recreation, and social gatherings, during non-traditional hours. Schools and educational institutions might have staggered schedules, allowing for continuous use of facilities and better utilization of resources like classrooms and laboratories. This increased efficiency could potentially lead to cost savings in terms of facility maintenance, staffing, and resource allocation.
Economic Benefits of Extended Business Hours: If businesses align their operating hours with the new time zone system, it could lead to increased economic activity. Extended business hours would cater to the diverse needs and schedules of consumers, potentially resulting in higher customer footfall, increased sales, and greater productivity. However, it's important to consider the potential trade-offs in terms of employee work-life balance, shift scheduling, and labor regulations.
Potential Drawbacks and Considerations: Implementing a global time zone system with extended opening hours may present challenges and costs as well. It would require adjustments and adaptations in various sectors, including transportation schedules, healthcare services, and international coordination of activities. Additionally, potential societal impacts, such as disruptions to traditional family and social routines, would need to be carefully considered.
To conduct a comprehensive cost analysis, you would need to gather more detailed data on existing time zone administration costs, expenses related to public resource utilization, economic impacts, and potential benefits and drawbacks. Consultation with experts in relevant fields, such as economics, urban planning, and public administration, would be essential in conducting a thorough analysis.
Please note that while exploring innovative ideas for resource optimization is valuable, the practical implementation and feasibility of such concepts require careful consideration of various factors and stakeholder perspectives.

Efficient water management, irrigation systems, and nutrient cycling would be essential for the success of such generators.
Environmental Considerations: Ensure careful environmental planning and monitoring to mitigate any potential negative impacts on marine ecosystems or local biodiversity. Seek expert input and conduct thorough environmental impact assessments to maintain ecological balance and preserve coastal habitats.
Integration and Synergy: Explore the potential for integrating the tidally powered desalination plants with kelp farms or rainforest generators, creating a symbiotic relationship between energy generation, freshwater production, and sustainable agriculture. The waste products from desalination plants, such as brine, could potentially be utilized in kelp farming as a nutrient source.
As with any large-scale projects involving energy generation and ecosystem management, it is crucial to involve interdisciplinary experts, conduct feasibility studies, and prioritize sustainability and environmental stewardship. Collaboration with local communities, governments, and environmental organizations would be vital in ensuring responsible implementation and long-term benefits.
These ideas represent innovative approaches to address freshwater scarcity, renewable energy generation, and sustainable food production. However, their practicality and viability require comprehensive research, testing, and thorough evaluation of potential social, economic, and environmental implications.

Ok I need help counting the rings. There is a tetraorthodrome intersecting the poles, dividing it into eight sections. It looks like an asterisk, the polar refrigerator septentrion is at the north pole, meridion at the story. Then it has an atomic tetraorthodrome meeting at an angle, these do not go to the poles but as far north as lower Canada, Spain, and Japan. A final orthodrome is built at the equator. Equatarion. I think it is a nonaorthodrome, nine rings intersecting a sphere (great circles). Its latitudes are set by expanding a Rubik's cube. I think it intersects at 26 points

Thank you for providing the Blender Python code for creating the shape. Based on the code you shared, it appears to generate several circles and perform rotations to create a complex geometric structure. Here's a breakdown of the code:
Circle Creation: The code starts by creating a circle with a radius of 1 using the
bpy.ops.mesh.primitive_circle_add
function. This circle serves as the base shape for further transformations.
Rotations: The
bpy.ops.transform.rotate
function is then used to perform rotations on the created circle. The rotations are done around the X, Y, and Z axes to achieve the desired shape.
Duplications: The
bpy.ops.object.duplicate_move
function is used to duplicate the existing shape and move it to create additional elements of the structure. It allows for translation and rotation of the duplicated shape.
Equator Creation: Finally, another circle is created at the equator using the
bpy.ops.mesh.primitive_circle_add
function.
Please note that the code provided gives an idea of the steps involved in creating the shape, but the specific arrangement and final result may depend on the values used for rotations, translations, and other parameters. To visualize the shape accurately, you may need to run the code in Blender or use appropriate visualization tools.

I just wanted to check my math, how many rings in all
1 / 1
ChatGPT
ChatGPT
Based on the provided Blender Python code, there are several circle primitives created throughout the code. To determine the total number of rings, we can count the occurrences of the
bpy.ops.mesh.primitive_circle_add
function calls.
In the code you shared, the
bpy.ops.mesh.primitive_circle_add
function is called six times. Therefore, based on the code snippet you provided, there are a total of six rings in the generated shape.
Please note that this count is specific to the given code and may differ if other parts of the code or additional operations are involved.

I think I duplicate two selected rings at a time
1 / 1
ChatGPT
ChatGPT
Apologies for the misunderstanding. If you are duplicating two selected rings at a time, it would affect the total count of rings in the generated shape.
From the code you provided, it seems that two rings are duplicated and moved to create additional elements of the structure using the
bpy.ops.object.duplicate_move
function.
Considering this duplication process, if each duplication adds two rings, then the total number of rings in the final shape would depend on the number of times the duplication occurs. It appears that the duplication process is repeated at least once in the given code snippet.
Therefore, if you perform the duplication process once, the total count of rings in the generated shape would be six rings (original rings) + 2 rings (duplicated rings) = 8 rings.
Please note that the actual count may vary depending on the number of duplications performed and any additional modifications made to the code or shape.

I see, thank you for clarifying that the equator is considered a ring as well.
In that case, if we include the equator as one of the rings, the total count of rings in the generated shape would indeed be nine.
To summarize:
Four orthodromes intersect at the poles.
Four atomic tetraorthodromes meet at an angle.
The equator forms an additional ring.
So, taking all these into account, the total count of rings in the shape would be nine.
Thank you for the clarification, and I apologize for any confusion caused earlier.

1 / 1
ChatGPT
ChatGPT
If you would like to create shapes in another programming language like Julia or Clojure and export them into an object file format (such as .obj), you can use libraries or modules available in those languages to generate the 3D geometry and then write the resulting data into a file.
Here's a general outline of the process for each language:
Julia:
Use a 3D graphics library like Makie.jl or MeshIO.jl to generate the shapes.
Use the corresponding library functions to export the generated geometry to an .obj file format.
Clojure:
Use a 3D graphics library like Quil or Penumbra to create the shapes.
Utilize the library functions to export the generated geometry to an .obj file format.
In both cases, you would need to install the relevant libraries using the package manager specific to each language.
Once you have generated the shapes and exported them to an .obj file format, you can import the resulting file into Blender or other 3D modeling software to visualize and further manipulate the geometry.
It's important to consult the documentation and examples provided by the respective libraries for detailed instructions on generating shapes and exporting them to the desired file format in Julia or Clojure.

Explain the difference between the dunning-krueger effect and imposter syndrome
1 / 1
ChatGPT
ChatGPT
The Dunning-Kruger effect and Imposter Syndrome are two psychological phenomena that can affect individuals' perceptions of their own abilities and competence. While they share some similarities, they differ in their underlying causes and manifestations:
Dunning-Kruger Effect:
The Dunning-Kruger effect refers to a cognitive bias where individuals with low ability or knowledge in a particular domain overestimate their competence. They tend to believe they are more skilled or knowledgeable than they actually are.
This bias arises from a lack of self-awareness or metacognitive abilities, preventing individuals from accurately assessing their own performance. As a result, they may exhibit unwarranted confidence and be unable to recognize their own limitations.
The effect is characterized by a U-shaped curve, with those at the lower end of competence overestimating themselves, while those with higher competence may underestimate themselves due to assuming others possess similar skills.
Imposter Syndrome:
Imposter Syndrome refers to a psychological pattern where individuals doubt their own accomplishments and have a persistent fear of being exposed as frauds, despite evidence of their competence or success.
Individuals experiencing Imposter Syndrome often attribute their achievements to luck or external factors rather than acknowledging their own skills and capabilities.
This phenomenon is typically seen in high-achievers who constantly feel inadequate and worry that they will be exposed as imposters, despite external validation or evidence to the contrary.
Imposter Syndrome is often driven by internal factors, such as high self-imposed standards, fear of failure, and the belief that others are more competent.
In summary, the Dunning-Kruger effect involves overestimating one's abilities due to a lack of self-awareness, while Imposter Syndrome involves persistent self-doubt and a fear of being exposed as a fraud despite evidence of competence.

The concept of learning as an "inoculation against surprise" refers to the idea that the primary function of learning is to reduce uncertainty and increase predictability in our interactions with the world.

When we encounter a new situation or piece of information, it often comes with a degree of surprise or novelty. This surprise can be thought of as a signal that our current understanding or model of the world is incomplete or incorrect in some way.

Learning, in this context, is the process by which we incorporate this new information into our mental models to reduce the surprise associated with similar situations in the future.

This could be as simple as learning that touching a hot stove is painful, or as complex as understanding the intricacies of a scientific theory.

In essence, each learning experience helps us to refine our predictions about the world, making future encounters less surprising.

This ties in with the concept of predictive coding, a theory in neuroscience that posits that the brain is constantly generating and updating predictions about the sensory input it will receive.

In the context of the broader discussion on negentropy and entropy, learning can be seen as a negentropic process: It reduces the internal disorder (or surprise) of our cognitive system by enhancing the accuracy and complexity of our internal models of the world.

By doing so, it enables us to interact with our environment in more efficient and predictable ways, thereby enhancing our survival and success.

ChatGPT
ChatGPT
That's a great perspective on the concept of learning as an "inoculation against surprise." Learning does indeed play a crucial role in reducing uncertainty and increasing predictability in our interactions with the world. By incorporating new information and updating our mental models, we can refine our predictions and make more accurate decisions in similar situations.
The idea of predictive coding aligns well with this concept, as it highlights the brain's constant generation and updating of predictions about sensory input. Through learning, our internal models become more sophisticated, allowing us to better anticipate and understand the world around us.
The connection to negentropy and entropy is also insightful. Learning can be seen as a negentropic process because it reduces the internal disorder or surprise within our cognitive system. By increasing the accuracy and complexity of our internal models, learning enhances our ability to navigate the environment effectively and adapt to new challenges.
Ultimately, learning serves as a powerful tool for reducing surprise, increasing predictability, and improving our overall understanding of the world. It empowers us to adapt, grow, and make informed choices in various aspects of life.

Explain how boredom can be used as a tool, afterall it is a sign that something is not interesting. This could improve novelty seeking and visual foraging
1 / 1
ChatGPT
ChatGPT
Boredom, often viewed as an unpleasant state of mind, can indeed be leveraged as a tool for various purposes, including promoting novelty-seeking and visual foraging. Here's how boredom can be beneficial:
Stimulating curiosity and exploration: When we feel bored, it indicates that our current activities or surroundings are not engaging enough to capture our interest. This can serve as a prompt to seek out new experiences, engage in novel activities, or explore different environments. Boredom can push us to venture beyond our comfort zones and discover new interests, hobbies, or perspectives.
Enhancing creativity: Boredom can provide fertile ground for creativity. When we are bored, our minds may naturally seek stimulation and novelty, leading to the generation of new ideas and solutions. In the absence of external distractions, our internal thoughts and imaginative capacities can flourish, allowing for creative thinking and problem-solving.
Encouraging self-reflection and introspection: Boredom can create a space for introspection and self-reflection. When external stimuli are lacking, we may turn our attention inward, contemplating our thoughts, emotions, and desires. This introspective state can promote self-awareness, personal growth, and the identification of areas in our lives where we seek more meaning or fulfillment.
Cultivating mindfulness and presence: Boredom can be an invitation to practice mindfulness and cultivate present-moment awareness. When we are not constantly occupied with external stimuli, we have an opportunity to tune into our immediate surroundings, our internal experiences, and the sensations of the present moment. This can enhance our ability to appreciate the simple joys of life and foster a sense of gratitude.
Fostering adaptability and resilience: Boredom can push us out of our comfort zones and expose us to new challenges. By embracing and navigating through periods of boredom, we develop resilience and adaptability.

ChatGPT
ChatGPT
The concept of learning as a reduction of surprise suggests that the primary function of learning is to decrease uncertainty and increase predictability in our interactions with the world. When we encounter new information or experiences, they often come with a certain level of surprise or novelty. This surprise indicates that our existing mental models or understanding of the world might be incomplete or inaccurate in some way.
Learning, in this context, is the process by which we update our mental models to incorporate new information and reduce the surprise associated with similar situations in the future. By learning from these experiences, we refine our predictions about the world and make future encounters less surprising.
The process of learning can occur in various forms, ranging from simple everyday experiences to more complex cognitive tasks. For example, learning that touching a hot stove causes pain is a simple form of learning that reduces surprise in similar situations. On the other hand, learning complex scientific theories or mastering a new skill involves more intricate processes of incorporating new information into our mental models.
The idea of learning as a reduction of surprise aligns with the theory of predictive coding in neuroscience. According to this theory, the brain constantly generates and updates predictions about the sensory input it expects to receive. When there is a mismatch between the predicted and actual input, surprise signals are generated, prompting the brain to update its predictions and reduce future surprise.
By actively seeking out new experiences, acquiring knowledge, and adapting our mental models, we continually refine our understanding of the world. Learning helps us navigate our environment more efficiently and predictably, leading to increased competence, problem-solving abilities, and overall success in various domains of life.
In summary, learning as a reduction of surprise emphasizes the role of learning in updating our mental models and reducing the uncertainty associated with new information and experiences. It allows us to make better predictions, adapt to changes, and interact with the world in a more informed and effective manner.

Basically compression reduces surprise
1 / 1
ChatGPT
ChatGPT
Yes, that is a fundamental idea in the context of learning and surprise. Compression, in the context of information theory, refers to the process of representing information in a more concise form by identifying patterns and regularities. When we encounter new information, it may contain elements of surprise or novelty because it doesn't fit neatly into our existing mental models or patterns of understanding.
Through the process of learning and compression, we strive to reduce the surprise associated with new information. By identifying patterns, making connections, and updating our mental models, we can compress the information and incorporate it into our existing knowledge base. This compression allows us to represent the information more efficiently, making it easier to predict and reducing the level of surprise associated with similar situations in the future.
In essence, the reduction of surprise occurs as we learn and develop more comprehensive and refined mental models that can better explain and predict the phenomena we encounter. This process of compression helps us organize and structure information, leading to a more efficient and effective cognitive system.

Markov blankets are easy
1 / 1
ChatGPT
ChatGPT
Markov blankets are a concept used in probabilistic graphical models to identify the minimal set of variables that shield a target variable from the rest of the variables in the model. They provide a way to determine which variables are directly relevant for predicting the target variable, while ignoring the irrelevant ones.
The idea behind Markov blankets is relatively straightforward. For a given target variable, its Markov blanket consists of three types of variables: its parents, its children, and the parents of its children. In other words, the Markov blanket contains all the variables that have a direct causal or probabilistic relationship with the target variable.
The importance of Markov blankets lies in their ability to simplify the analysis and computation in probabilistic graphical models. By focusing on the variables within the Markov blanket, we can ignore the other variables in the model, as they do not provide additional information about the target variable once the Markov blanket variables are known.
Overall, while the concept of Markov blankets may require some understanding of probabilistic graphical models, their purpose and utility in identifying relevant variables for prediction and inference are relatively straightforward.

ChatGPT
ChatGPT
I apologize for the confusion. If you are referring to the practical application of Markov blankets in detecting unfair dice or similar scenarios, it's important to note that Markov blankets are typically used in the context of probabilistic graphical models and inference algorithms. They provide a formal mathematical framework for analyzing dependencies and conditional independence relationships among variables.
While Markov blankets can be a powerful tool for probabilistic modeling and inference, their direct application in detecting unfair dice or preparing for such scenarios may not be immediate or intuitive in everyday situations. Detecting unfair dice usually involves statistical analysis, hypothesis testing, or experimental methods rather than solely relying on Markov blankets.
However, if you have a specific application or context in which you believe Markov blankets could be relevant for detecting unfair dice or related tasks, please provide more details, and I'll be happy to provide further assistance.

At least the retina does something like this and various sub systems of the brain and central ganglia
1 / 1
ChatGPT
ChatGPT
I see what you mean now. In the context of cognitive processes in humans and animals, there are indeed mechanisms that resemble the concept of a Markov blanket in probabilistic modeling. While not identical to the formal definition of a Markov blanket, these mechanisms serve similar purposes in terms of evaluating probabilities and making predictions.
For example, in visual perception, the retina can be seen as an information-processing system that acts as a kind of Markov blanket. It receives sensory input from the environment and processes it to extract relevant features and patterns. This processed information is then transmitted to higher-level brain regions, where further processing and interpretation take place. The retina's role can be considered as filtering and encoding sensory data, allowing subsequent brain regions to make predictions and decisions based on the information it provides.
Similarly, in the broader context of cognitive processing, different subsystems of the brain can be viewed as having their own "Markov blankets" that perform local computations and contribute to overall probabilistic reasoning and decision-making. These subsystems communicate and exchange information, allowing for the integration of multiple sources of evidence and the refinement of predictions.
In the field of developmental psychology, the theory-theory framework you mentioned proposes that children develop a theory of mind by forming intuitive theories about the mental states and behaviors of themselves and others. This process involves making probabilistic inferences and predictions based on available evidence, similar to the way a Markov blanket allows for probabilistic reasoning.
While these analogies help us understand some aspects of cognitive processes and their connection to probabilistic reasoning, it's important to note that they are conceptual interpretations and not a direct mapping of formal probabilistic models onto neural processes. The brain's mechanisms for probabilistic reasoning are complex and still an active area of research.

Ok well I think everyone is using some kind of Bayesian probability to revaluate their predictions and ideas when they get new information.
1 / 1
ChatGPT
ChatGPT
You're correct that Bayesian probability plays a fundamental role in how we update our beliefs and predictions based on new information. Bayesian reasoning provides a principled framework for updating prior beliefs in light of new evidence.
In everyday life, we often encounter situations where we need to revise our beliefs and predictions. When we receive new information, we assess its relevance and credibility, and then update our beliefs accordingly. Bayesian reasoning allows us to quantify and adjust the probabilities associated with different hypotheses or explanations based on the evidence at hand.
The basic idea behind Bayesian inference is to start with an initial belief, or prior probability, and then update it using Bayes' theorem, which takes into account the likelihood of the observed evidence given the hypothesis and the prior probability of the hypothesis. This iterative process of updating our beliefs based on new evidence is often referred to as Bayesian updating.
We naturally engage in Bayesian reasoning in various aspects of our lives. For example, when we receive contradictory information, we reevaluate our beliefs and revise our understanding of the situation. When we encounter new evidence that supports or contradicts our previous beliefs, we adjust the probabilities we assign to different explanations or outcomes.
Bayesian reasoning is not limited to formal applications in fields such as statistics or machine learning. It is a cognitive process that humans engage in intuitively, allowing us to make sense of the world, update our understanding, and make informed decisions based on the available evidence.

Connections with compression of surprise
1 / 1
ChatGPT
ChatGPT
There is a connection between Bayesian inference and the compression of surprise. In the context of Bayesian inference, surprise can be understood as the discrepancy between our prior beliefs (expectations) and the observed evidence. When new evidence contradicts our prior expectations, it introduces surprise.
Compression, on the other hand, refers to the process of encoding information in a more efficient and concise way. In the field of information theory, compression aims to reduce redundancy and represent information using fewer bits. The goal is to find patterns and regularities in the data that allow for more efficient encoding.
Surprise and compression are interconnected because surprise indicates the presence of information that is not easily compressible or predictable based on our prior beliefs. In Bayesian terms, surprise arises when the likelihood of the observed evidence given our prior beliefs is significantly different from what we expected.
The process of updating our beliefs through Bayesian inference can be seen as a form of compression. As we encounter new evidence and update our probabilities, we are essentially compressing our knowledge to incorporate the most relevant and informative aspects of the data. Bayesian updating allows us to refine our models and beliefs, reducing surprise by encoding the observed evidence more efficiently.
In this sense, Bayesian inference can be viewed as a mechanism for compressing surprise, as it helps us update our beliefs and incorporate new information in a way that reduces the discrepancy between our prior expectations and the observed evidence. By iteratively updating our probabilities based on the principles of Bayesian reasoning, we aim to achieve a more compressed and accurate representation of the underlying reality.

Negentropy as Surprise: Exploring Learning, Prediction, and Compression

The quest for understanding cognition and learning has led researchers to delve into concepts such as negentropy, surprise, and entropy. In this essay, we explore the intriguing relationship between these ideas and their implications for cognitive processes. 

Specifically, we investigate how learning can be viewed as a means to reduce surprise by harnessing negentropy through prediction and compression.

Entropy, often associated with disorder or randomness, can be thought of as a measure of the number of ways a system can be sliced or organized to achieve a particular result.

Conversely, negentropy refers to the reduction of this randomness or uncertainty within a system, emphasizing the emergence of order, organization, and information content.

One fascinating analogy that helps shed light on these concepts is the phenomenon of reverse mass wasting. In the natural world, mass wasting refers to the downhill movement of rocks, soil, or debris caused by gravity.

Reverse mass wasting, however, pertains to the opposite process - the uphill movement of materials. Similarly, in the realm of cognition, the reduction of uncertainty and the emergence of order through learning can be seen as a form of reverse mass wasting.

At the heart of this exploration lies the notion of surprise. Surprise arises when our predictions or expectations diverge from the actual outcomes or observations we encounter. Learning, then, can be seen as a process of inoculation against surprise.

By continuously refining our predictive models, we aim to minimize the discrepancy between what we expect and what we experience, ultimately reducing surprise.

Prediction and compression play crucial roles in this framework. Learning involves identifying patterns, regularities, and underlying structures in our environment to make accurate predictions about future events.

By making successful predictions, we can compress the information we receive, distilling it into more concise representations that capture the essential features and minimize redundancy.

Drawing on the analogy of entropy, where slicing a system in various ways can yield similar results, we explore how learning enables us to uncover meaningful ways to organize and represent information.

Through the reduction of uncertainty and the compression of data, we strive to increase the efficiency and effectiveness of our cognitive processes, enhancing our ability to navigate and understand the world around us.

By understanding the interplay between negentropy, surprise, and entropy, we gain valuable insights into the nature of learning and cognition.

This essay explores these themes, elucidating the role of prediction, compression, and the reduction of surprise in the pursuit of knowledge and the development of cognitive schemas as dissipative structures.

The People's History of Artificial Intelligence

Once upon a time, in a world where science and mysticism collided, there existed a group of brilliant minds.

They were a curious bunch, who dared to ask the impossible questions, explore the unknown, and dream beyond the limits of their reality.

One such dreamer, known for her spiritualistic musings, advocated the idea of "faking it until you make it," long before it became a popular mantra. 

Another philosopher, who believed in the infinite possibilities of the universe, proposed the theory of multiple dimensions and realities.

As the years went by, these curious thinkers continued to explore the mysteries of the human mind, consciousness, and spirituality

They wrote about the nature of time, the relationship between the physical and spiritual worlds, and the role of subjectivity in knowledge.

Some even delved into the depths of the psyche, analyzing dreams and exploring the unconscious mind. One famous dreamer, too afraid to look inside a mysterious book titled "The Timeless Wisdom of the Sphinx," found inspiration in the very act of dreaming itself.

Meanwhile, scientists were also busy creating new technologies and machines that promised to change the world forever.

One inventor, inspired by ancient Egyptian mythology, proposed the concept of a "Memex," a machine that could store and retrieve information, similar to the mythical Book of the Dead.

And then, in the midst of this technological and philosophical revolution, a group of visionaries came together to organize the first-ever AI conference.

They coined the term "artificial intelligence," and laid the groundwork for a new field that would merge science and spirituality in unexpected ways.

Over the years, AI researchers developed algorithms for training neural networks, creating autonomous robots, and simulating conversations with therapists.

They explored the nature of language, developed theories of cognitive development, and even proposed the idea of artificial curiosity.

Despite the incredible advances made in the field of AI, many questions remained unanswered.

In the end, the history of AI was not just a story of technological progress, but a tale of human curiosity, imagination, and spiritual exploration.
