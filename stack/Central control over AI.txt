Central Control over AI... and everything else
Back home, hoping for a rest after nine weeks of relentless travel and speechifying.  But no, I cannot lay off this unpaid scrivening, here. Because, well, the issues and misunderstandings are just to rife. For example: I was recently in China for a corporate conference, to keynote a session on "Daily Life in the Future." There, I got to sample different cultural and political perspectives in Shenzhen from Hong Kong, just across the border.

Around the same time, the Washington Post published an opinion piece by a Chinese academic that has caused a stir, by offering a cogent and thoughtful - and ultimately wrongheaded - argument that the sole solution to AI - related problems will be control by a paramount party-state.

We need to understand how these polemical rationalizations — e.g. "we are getting even for colonialism"  — aim to gird and rationalize a heightened level of intensity. Intensity that's not needed, in order to develop an advanced and competitive nation... but that will be necessary if your aim is to stir militancy, even war.

The author, David Brin, writes about his recent travels to China where he spoke at a corporate conference on "Daily Life in the Future". He also mentions a controversial opinion piece published in the Washington Post by a Chinese academic that argued for central control by a paramount party-state as the sole solution to AI-related problems. Brin disagrees with this argument and believes that it is unnecessary and potentially dangerous, as it could stir up militancy or even war.

== The argument for central control over AI... and everything else ==

Feng Xiang, a professor of law at Tsinghua University, argues that "AI will spell the end of capitalism." 


First, the standard Marxian cycle will return, with a vengeance. For lack of anti-monopoly or redistributive reform (like those enacted by our parents, under FDR, or our great grandparents, under the other Roosevelt), each business cycle will result in greater wealth disparities and a narrowing of the owner-controlling caste, leading to a conversion of vibrantly competitive markets back into history's standard, uncreative oligarchic pyramid. 

Naturally, Professor Feng's proposed solution is also Marxist. Party-guided proletarian revolution.

Second, technological obsolescence of many types of employment will break the livelihoods of hundreds of millions, if not billions. No longer able to negotiate or bargain for the value of their labor, workers will be at the mercy of the Owner Caste. And yes, ditto. Feng's prescription for a resolution is Sino-Marxist.

Finally, any AI that gains control over important systems with unsupervised intelligence may pose an existential risk to humanity. For this and other reasons, Professor Feng argues that research into artificial intelligence should be tightly controlled by a benevolent socialist state.

Why am I giving space over to a communist state-servant who promotes Marxist notions that I clearly disagree-with? Because it is well-worthwhile reading his appraisal of the looming problems. After which it is instructive to study his prescriptions! Because simplistic panaceas will doubtless appeal to billions, over the next couple of decades. Especially when our own lords seem determined to follow the Marxian pattern, by driving the middle class into penury.

You need to grasp the polemical intent underlying Professor Feng's missive. And to see how Feng's prescriptions do not follow, logically, from his well-described premises.

(Note: for a much more detailed look at these rationalizations for recreating the feudal pyramid, see: Jiang Shigong's monograph on 'Philosophy and History: Interpreting the "Xi Jinping Era" through Xi's Report to the Nineteenth National Congress of the CCP'.)

In an opinion piece for the Washington Post, Feng Xiang, a professor of law at Tsinghua University, argues that AI will spell the end of capitalism and proposes that research into artificial intelligence should be tightly controlled by a benevolent socialist state to prevent existential risk to humanity. He predicts that AI will lead to a return of the Marxian cycle, a technological obsolescence of many types of employment, and a conversion of competitive markets into an uncreative oligarchic pyramid. However, author David Brin disagrees with Feng's prescriptions for a resolution, which involve a party-guided proletarian revolution and a Sino-Marxist solution, stating that they do not logically follow from his premises.

== Zooming in ==

Let's dive into Feng Xiang's own words:

"But China's socialist market economy could provide a solution to this. If AI rationally allocates resources through big data analysis, and if robust feedback loops can supplant the imperfections of "the invisible hand" while fairly sharing the vast wealth it creates, a planned economy that actually works could at last be achievable."

Hold back your visceral reaction. Yes, yes, this is a blatant attempt to justify the ingathering of overwhelming power into a permanent, narrow, self-chosen caste. It's the same model that dominated 99% of all human societies. Each of those also invoked incantations to explain why a dominant caste should hold and monopolize all power.

Almost anyone raised in the Western Enlightenment - or by Hollywood film morality - will feel instant recognition and loathing. Indeed, the difference between a state controlled by capitalist owner-oligarchy and a pyramidal hierarchy controlled by communist party elite is (basically) only one of vocabulary and incantations, not structure or end result.

But as I said; hold on a minute. It's one thing to recognize a servile charm-chant to justify central power. It's quite another thing to dismiss every aspect of Prof. Feng's argument. We'd be fools to do so.

"The more AI advances into a general-purpose technology that permeates every corner of life, the less sense it makes to allow it to remain in private hands that serve the interests of the few instead of the many. More than anything else, the inevitability of mass unemployment and the demand for universal welfare will drive the idea of socializing or nationalizing AI."

Complaining about the rapacious, insatiable and socially irresponsible behavior of today's capitalist corporations, he asserts:

"These companies have been able to get away with their social irresponsibility because the legal system and its loopholes in the West are geared to protect private property above all else. Of course, in China, we have big privately owned Internet companies like Alibaba and Tencent. But unlike in the West, they are monitored by the state and do not regard themselves as above or beyond social control."

Feng Xiang, a professor of law at Tsinghua University, argues that AI will bring about the end of capitalism, due to the technological obsolescence of many types of employment, leading to a Marxist revolution. He proposes that a planned economy guided by the communist party could be the solution, where AI rationally allocates resources through big data analysis and feedback loops. While his argument can be seen as an attempt to justify the ingathering of overwhelming power into a permanent, narrow, self-chosen caste, it is worth considering the inevitability of mass unemployment and the demand for universal welfare that will drive the idea of socializing or nationalizing AI. Xiang also criticizes the social irresponsibility of capitalist corporations and asserts that China's big privately owned internet companies are monitored by the state and do not regard themselves as above or beyond social control.
1 / 1
In other words, Professor Feng proclaims that state planning will be boosted in effectiveness by the very thing (AI) that would be lethal, under capitalism.

Feng Xiang continues: "Marx's dictum, "From each according to their abilities, to each according to their needs," needs an update for the 21st century: "From the inability of an AI economy to provide jobs and a living wage for all, to each according to their needs."'


Why have I given lengthy space to this? Even urging you all to go read the original, for yourself? Because of the extreme (and interesting) cognitive dissonance of this essay, which accurately describes a trio of serious dilemmas that have us clearly on course to failure...

...only then Feng explicitly declares that the only answer is to return to a different failure mode! A governance method that proved universally calamitous across 6000 years

of recorded history.
It's an important reminder that just because someone accurately identifies a problem, it doesn't necessarily mean they have the right solution. It's up to all of us to carefully consider and evaluate proposals, even those that may seem appealing or comforting at first glance.

== An aside: the "central planning wall" ==

Consider that state planners know there is a "wall of incompetence." Such a wall tripped up the Soviets in the 1950s, when their command methods for building primary industry (steel, dams, railroads) that worked so well in the 1930s proved inept at secondary industry capable of producing a refrigerator that anyone wanted. 

The 1980s Japanese zaibatsus - organized by the Ministry of Trade -- were convinced that their planned mercantilism had overcome Soviet errors, by using capitalist tools... till hitting their wall: the tertiary economy.

There can be no arguing with the fantastic successes wrought by the current Chinese leadership's use of planning combined with corporate structures and predatory mercantilism. Even if their debt bubble pops tomorrow, their achievements in advancing their nation have been epic. 

Yes, a few of us point out that the fundamental key to their success was an American innovation - generously counter-mercantilist trade patterns instituted by the American pax since 1946 -- that uplifted half the population of the globe. Without that unprecedented indulgence by the era's "central kingdom," the "Chinese Method" would have gone exactly nowhere.  Still, the engineers who occupy seats on the current Beijing politburo are smart guys, and they can be excused some hubris, believing they have a way around the next state planning "wall."

The magic tool they have used for a decade as been pre-AI computer modeling. And they expect that to transform into the ultimate wall-breaker - true artificial intelligence -- which will supposedly make economic and tech models so realistic that central planning will outstrip every system based upon Adam Smith's markets or Friedrich Hayek's 'distributed wisdom.'

Do you now understand better the quasi-religious faith that central planners vest in the positive traits of AI?  Meanwhile, they posit - along with Elon Musk and many worried westerners - that there can be negative effects of burgeoning AI, as well! Even calamitous ones. And hence, Feng asks: who better to prevent Robopacalypse than a central party state?

Yes, yes, he follows his cogent dilemma description with a self-serving, magical incantation for centralization, without a scintilla of evidence or reason. No pyramidal power hierarchy ever evaded for long the core human contradiction: that we are delusional beings. Only one antidote has ever been found for delusion and error - free and open criticism. And tiny ruling castes always, always crush criticism.

They will hire gifted theologians - like Professor Feng - to concoct catechisms in whatever state religion justifies paramount power. But no matter how potent their AI, the fundamental remains the same. Garbage in, garbage out.

GiGo. There will be a wall.
1 / 1
The article discusses the concept of a "central planning wall" that state planners often hit, which limits the effectiveness of centralized planning in achieving certain goals. The author provides historical examples such as the failures of the Soviet Union and Japanese zaibatsus to illustrate this point.
The author also highlights the Chinese government's success in using planning combined with corporate structures and predatory mercantilism. The Chinese leadership has used pre-AI computer modeling as a tool to make economic and tech models more realistic, and they expect that true artificial intelligence will be the ultimate wall-breaker that will allow central planning to outstrip market-based systems.
However, the author cautions that even with the use of AI, there will still be a wall that central planning cannot overcome. The article concludes by emphasizing the importance of free and open criticism as the only antidote to delusion and error, which is often suppressed in pyramidal power hierarchies.
1 / 1
== Don't be smug ==

Do not use my own glib incantation about GiGo to dismiss all of Feng Xiang's arguments! He is absolutely right that:

- We must find ways to avoid a gathering of all power into our own style of pyramid. One that's inarguably worse - in its final stage - than Confucian paternalism. Feudal lordship by an owner aristocracy.

- Looming technological unemployment does mean that some renegotiation of the social contract will be absolutely vital.  As in Roosevelt's time, it will involve some redistribution of ownership, likely vesting all citizens in shares of the means of production. (A much better solution than universal welfare income: read Vonnegut's Player Piano, and Farmer's Riders of the Purple Wage.)  The Greatest Generation knew this, as did the American founders, who redistributed a quarter of all the land in Britain's former colonies.

But an American style reform would still entail the widest possible distribution and separation of power and influence. Indeed, although there will be screams of "socialism!" such a redistribution would be diametrically opposite to both types of pyramids. Both feudal oligarchy and Chinese Party hierarchy.

And yes, AI could either help or impede, depending on one thing. Transparency.

== Feng is also right that AI threatens us with peril ==

Want to see how creepy the present situation is?

In a 2014 article, Prof. Shawn Bayern demonstrated that anyone can confer legal personhood on an autonomous computer algorithm by putting it in control of a limited liability corporation. ("Independently wealthy software.")  Such entities now operate independently, accepting and transferring payments and hiring humans for offline services.

In a fascinating article, UCLA Professor Lynn Lopucki asserts that algorithmic entities are likely to prosper first in criminal activities or those that benefit most from operating in the dark.  

This comes as no surprise to readers of science fiction. Autonomous algorithms featured in the novels of John Brunner and Joe Haldeman, long before gaining attention in William Gibson's "Neuromancer," wherein the protagonist only at the end realizes his employer was a cryptic AI. And that is just one of countless ways that new AI methods can only be turned benign if they operate purely under light. 


My favorite solution - a universal, international treaty - would solve all this in just two sentences:

"If you think you own something - from a car to a home, to a corporation, or ship, or algorithm - you must say so, identifying it openly. No shell entity may layer more than two deep before revealing owners who are living humans or totally transparent foundations."

Two sentences.

Some have called this a "welfare program for lawyers," since the litigation that it unleashed would last a decade. So? The biggest immediate effect would be a tsunami of suddenly revealed and abandoned property - never declared by the owners who acquired it through crime -- perhaps enough to give all legitimate taxpayers a tax holiday, worldwide. 

If you are a legitimate and honest taxpayer, there is no measure proposed by anyone that would benefit you more. I defend this proposal elsewhere. But here I assert simply:

* If it were imposed and enforced worldwide. No other measure would do as much to restore fairness and enlightenment and progress to the world. *
1 / 1
Feng Xiang makes valid points about the dangers of concentrated power and the need for a renegotiation of the social contract in the face of technological unemployment. Additionally, he is correct that AI poses a threat to society if its operations are not transparent.
The idea of conferring legal personhood on an autonomous computer algorithm is indeed concerning, and algorithmic entities could potentially prosper in criminal activities or areas that benefit from operating in the dark. However, a universal international treaty that requires transparency in the ownership of all entities, including algorithms, could help mitigate this risk.
While this proposal may lead to a wave of litigation, it could also result in the discovery and return of property acquired through criminal means, ultimately benefiting legitimate taxpayers.
Overall, it is essential to consider the potential dangers of concentrated power and opaque AI operations, and explore solutions such as transparency requirements to prevent these risks from becoming realities.
1 / 1
== The Final Feng ==

You all have been champing at the bit to point out the last and most glaring error of Feng Xiang's missive. To declare that AI entities will be rendered harmless if controlled by a paramount party elite, atop an all-powerful central state. The error is obvious:

1. So empowered, that core elite will be unquestionable. A Big Brother that no Orwell could ever have imagined.

2. What happens when the AI gets truly much smarter than its masters? Won't this power structure be trivially convenient for that entity to simply and subtly invert?  A pyramid of already unquestionable power, easily taken over by the very entities it claimed to control.

Jesus. Is any other outcome even remotely possible?

Yes, I prefer the distributed-competitive model, breaking up all elites and powers into reciprocally-accountable lumps. A method that works only under fully pervasive light. But when light does shine into all crevices, it works better than any other system ever devised.  (Why do you think that all the world's oligarchs seek - in a worldwide putsch - to strangle the method, forever?)

Read Feng Xiang's missive, with all of this in mind. There is partial value... like many things in life... but also silliness. Use light to separate them.

Thank you for sharing your thoughts on Feng Xiang's arguments and the potential dangers of AI entities. Your perspective on the importance of transparency and the dangers of concentrating power in the hands of a few elites is certainly valid and worth considering. It's also interesting to note the potential risks of AI entities surpassing their human creators and the dangers of allowing such entities to operate without proper oversight and accountability.
As for the proposed universal, international treaty to ensure transparency in ownership, it's certainly an ambitious proposal that could have significant implications if enforced properly. However, the potential for extensive litigation and legal battles cannot be ignored, and the feasibility of such a proposal may be limited by political and economic considerations.
Overall, your insights offer valuable food for thought on the complex issues surrounding AI and the distribution of power in society. Thank you for sharing your perspective.

Why do AI ethics conferences fail? They fail because they don't have a metatheory to explain how it is possible for ethical disagreements to emerge from phenomenologically different worlds, how those are revealed to us, and how shifts between them have shaped the development of Western civilization for the last several thousand years from the Greeks and Romans, through the Renaissance and Enlightenment. 

So perhaps we've given up on the "ethics hand-wringing" a bit too early. Or more precisely, a third nonzero sum approach that combines ethics and reciprocal accountability is available that actually does explain this. But first, let's consider the flaw in simple reciprocal accountability. Yes, right now we can "use chatGPT to catch Chat-GPT cheats", and provide many other balancing feedbacks. But as Brian Pearce noted earlier with reference to the colonization of Indigenous nations, once the technological/ developmental gap is sufficiently large those dynamics which operate largely under our control and in our favor can quickly change, and the former allies become the new masters. 

Forrest Landry capably identified that problem during a recent conversation with Jim Rutt. The implication is that, though we may not like it, there is in fact a role to play by axiology (or more precisely, a phenomenologically informed understanding of axiology). Zak Stein identifies some of that in his article "Technology is Not Values Neutral". Lastly, Iain McGilchrist brings both of these topics, that of power and value, together using his metatheory of attention, which uses that same notion of reciprocal accountability (only here it is called opponent processing). And yes, there is historical precedent here too; we can point to biological analogues. This is all instantiated in the neurology of the brain, and it goes back at least as far as Nematostella vectensis, a sea anemone that lived 700 million years ago! So the opponent processing of two very different ways of attending to the world has worked for a very long time, by opposing two very different phenomenological worlds (and their associated ethical frameworks) to counterbalance each other. 

There's converging agreement here. Landry said in this podcast with Rutt the same message that McGilchrist delivered as keynote at the AI World Summit in 2022. McGilchrist's metatheory of attention for balancing the narrow, ambitious instrumentalism of one way of attending, which is the form of AGI that Landry (and all the signers to the recent moratorium petition) describe, with the values and restraint of another could in fact be usefully applied. It rests on a mountain of research. Zak Stein noted that nihilistic design ends in an impoverished world, as our current situation threatens to prove. Axiological design recognizes inherent (non-utilitarian) value in the existence of the many other vastly outcompeted species on Earth. In many cases, that recognition is the very reason that our elimination of nearly all terrestrial megafauna hasn't thus far extended to the extirpation of significant others as well. Don't rule out a role for ethics yet.

Thank you for sharing your perspective. It seems that you value practical outcomes over theoretical discussions of ethics, and you view the Enlightenment experiment as a success primarily because it has created systems that maximize critical input from an ever-widening pool of perceptual participants, reduce waste of talent, and facilitate discovery of delusional errors.
You argue that utilitarianism misses the mark with its emphasis on "greatest good for the greatest number," as this fails to address questions of whose good and whose standards. Instead, you suggest that the key to success lies in creating systemically regulated arenas within which creative adversaries can compete in ways that maximize positive sum outcomes by reducing cheating and minimizing blood on the floor.
You identify markets, democracy, science courts, and sports as examples of such arenas, which must be kept flat, open, and fair through constant attention, fine tuning, and hard work.

The linked article: rattle this silent dance of brief courtesies and tacit bargains — a strange mixture of competition and cooperation.

The four-way stop doesn't work in some cultures, and it's hard to picture anything like it functioning in times past, when mostly-illiterate humans lived in steep social hierarchies and "right of-way" was a matter of status, not fair play. Nor would robots, adhering to rigid laws, handle traffic half so well as the drivers I see, dealing with a myriad fuzzy situations, making up micro rules and exceptions on the spot, even as they talk on cell phones or quell squabbles among kids riding in the back seat. This phenomenon visibly illustrates how simple rules can be used by sophisticated autonomous systems (e.g., modern citizens) to solve intricate problems without any authority figures present to enforce obedience.

How does it happen? Experts in complexity theory coined a term — emergent properties — to describe new levels of order that seem to arise out of chaos, when conditions are right. For example, Kevin Kelly's book, Out of Control, depicts how rudimentary genetic drives coalesce into the fantastic flocking behavior of birds. When intelligence extends this process to higher levels, the result — our own unique kind of flocking — is called civilization.

Can the Internet enhance and extend this self-organizing marvel to untold heights? Alas, despite the glad cries of cyber-utopians, today's Net just doesn't look ready. Not yet.

an example: how we avoid fatal errors
No complex entity can survive for long without a way to combat internal flaws, or repair damage that might otherwise cause ruin. Our bodies do this with an immune system. Cultures throughout history tried to accomplish the same thing through rulership — exhorting people to live by rigid principles, then squelching deviations with the sword.

That approach never worked well, and it's not how nature does it. There is no map inside you, depicting your ideal, healthy self. Instead, our bodies throng with semi-independent agents, caroming randomly through blood and lymph, sniffing for trouble like lone marshals of the Old West. Chief among these roving deputies are T Cells, assigned to detect threats and emit chemical summons for help. Our lives count on having a variety of these little trouble-shooters, each alert for something different. If one agent fails to catch a problem, the next might. This system, half a billion years old, is more flexible than any kind of central control.

The article discusses the concept of emergent properties, where new levels of order arise out of chaos when conditions are right. In the case of civilization, simple rules and interactions between individuals can lead to complex systems of cooperation and competition that result in the organization of society. However, in order for complex systems to survive, they need to have a way to combat internal flaws and repair damage. In the case of the human body, this is achieved through the immune system, which consists of semi-independent agents that work together to detect threats and summon help. The article suggests that this system of decentralized control is more flexible and effective than rigid central control. While the internet has the potential to enhance and extend self-organizing systems, it is not yet ready for this task.

practice.

The ultimatum of a disputation arena won't be to award "victory" to any one side, but to create an atmosphere of practical problem-solving, helping moderates understand each others' concerns and reach for some mutually beneficial consensus, leaving fanatics isolated and impotent at the wings. In today's political climate, we all win by forcing both sides to accept a little ambiguity.

Above all, this process isn't meant to serve disputants as much as the rest of us, by giving us a chance to peer closely and skim good ideas from both sides, utilizing their passion and insights without getting sucked into either purist position. Innovative styles of accountability may thus provide centripetal influences to bring us together, counteracting the centrifugally polarizing tendencies that now threaten to tear civil society apart.

Ultimately, free speech is about much more than just self-expression. It is also how humans find ways to solve problems and live with one another. Ironically, this utopian aim may best be achieved by argument... by the reciprocal accountability that comes about when adversarial opposition takes place in an arena that is both open and fair.

The author argues that a disputation arena should be used to create an atmosphere of practical problem-solving and help moderates understand each other's concerns in order to reach a mutually beneficial consensus. The goal is not to award "victory" to any one side, but rather to utilize the passion and insights from both sides to find good ideas that can be used to counteract the polarizing tendencies in civil society. The author believes that free speech is a crucial tool in solving problems and living with one another, and that adversarial opposition in an open and fair arena can lead to reciprocal accountability and ultimately bring people together.

One of the steps from his proposed dialogue engagement system: Phase Four: the paraphrasing challenge
Here is a unique, but crucial phase. After both manifestos are declared logically usable, a distinct period — say a month — will be given to each side so they may paraphrase the other side's position.

This step aims to ensure that each party has actually read and understood where the other one stands, so they aren't simply shouting past each other at chimeric caricatures. Paraphrasing is hard to do when you've spent years demonizing the opposition, calling them venal or stupid and dismissing their concerns. Success at paraphrasing will be seen as a way of winning credibility. It means "I do understand my opponents... so my disagreement with them is well-informed."

Each side may lace their formal paraphrasing with asterisks and footnotes asserting that the statements they are describing are idiotic. That's fine. But if they fail to depict their opponents' point of view in a manner that the jury finds at least generally accurate, they will be disqualified.

Like if the opponents don't understand each other's positions, how can they argue with each other rationally?
1 / 1
Yes, that is precisely the point. If the opponents don't understand each other's positions, then any argument they make will likely be based on misunderstandings or misrepresentations, which is not a productive way to engage in a dialogue. The paraphrasing challenge ensures that each side has actually read and understood where the other side stands, so they can engage in a meaningful and productive discussion based on mutual understanding. It also helps to establish credibility, as successfully paraphrasing the opposing viewpoint demonstrates that one has taken the time to truly understand it and can therefore engage in a more informed and thoughtful discussion.

It's interesting to see how software to summarize and fact check might become an important part of the dialogue process.
1 / 1
Yes, software that can accurately summarize and fact-check arguments can play an important role in facilitating productive and constructive dialogue. By summarizing complex arguments and presenting them in an easily digestible format, such software can help ensure that everyone is on the same page and understands the key points being made. Additionally, by fact-checking claims made by both sides, the software can help prevent misinformation from being spread and can encourage participants to make fact-based arguments.
However, it's important to note that such software would need to be carefully designed and tested to ensure that it is effective and unbiased. There is also a risk that participants may become over-reliant on the software and fail to engage with each other directly, which could undermine the effectiveness of the dialogue process. Ultimately, software can be a valuable tool for facilitating productive dialogue, but it should be used in conjunction with other approaches and should be viewed as a supplement rather than a replacement for direct engagement.

Yeah it's still too flawed now, but as it becomes more reliable. It is kind of an upgrade to the peer review process.

Yes, it certainly has the potential to enhance the peer review process by making it more efficient and effective. By automating certain aspects of the process, such as fact-checking and summarization, it can free up time and resources for reviewers to focus on the more complex and subjective aspects of the work. However, it is important to keep in mind that these tools are still in development and must be used with caution, as they can introduce their own biases and limitations. Ultimately, the success of these tools will depend on how well they are designed and integrated into the peer review process.

A related quote from one of those books.
1 / 1
Here is a quote from the novel "The Dispossessed" by Ursula K. Le Guin:
"To oppose something is to maintain it. They say here "all roads lead to Mishnory." To be sure, if you turn your back on Mishnory and walk away from it, you are still on the Mishnory road. To oppose vulgarity is inevitably to be vulgar. You must go somewhere else; you must have another goal; then you walk in a different road."
This quote speaks to the idea that opposition can sometimes inadvertently reinforce what it seeks to change, and that it may be necessary to chart a different path entirely in order to truly create something new.
