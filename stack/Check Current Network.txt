A command in nmap to check the current network
ChatGPT
ChatGPT
To check the devices on your current network using Nmap, you can use the following command:
bash
Copy code
nmap -sn 192.168.1.0/24
This command performs a ping sweep (
-sn
) on the network
192.168.1.0
with a subnet mask of
24
(which is a common home network setup). Replace
192.168.1.0/24
with your actual network range if it's different. This will list all devices currently connected to your network. Remember, you need to have Nmap installed on your system to use this command.

Ok it gave me 4 ip addresses, can it get more information?

Yes, Nmap can provide more detailed information about the devices connected to your network. For a more in-depth scan, you can use the following command:
bash
Copy code
nmap -A 192.168.1.x
Replace
192.168.1.x
with each of the IP addresses you discovered. The
-A
option enables OS detection, version detection, script scanning, and traceroute. This will give you a more comprehensive report about each device, including the operating system, open ports, and running services.
However, be cautious when using this command, especially on networks you don't own or have permission to scan, as it can be seen as intrusive.
