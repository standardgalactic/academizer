To check if PyTorch is installed on your Ubuntu system, you can follow these steps:
Open a Terminal
: You can do this by searching for "Terminal" in your Ubuntu applications menu or by using the keyboard shortcut
Ctrl
+
Alt
+
T
.
Activate the Python Environment (if applicable)
: If you have installed PyTorch in a specific Python virtual environment, you need to activate it first. For example, if you used
virtualenv
or
conda
, you can activate the environment with commands like
source myenv/bin/activate
(for
virtualenv
) or
conda activate myenv
(for
conda
).
Check PyTorch Installation
: In the terminal, enter the following Python commands:
bash
Copy code
python -c
"import torch; print(torch.__version__)"
This command will attempt to import PyTorch and print its version. If PyTorch is installed, you will see the version number. If it's not installed, you will get an error message indicating that the
torch
module is not found.
Additional Verification
: To check for additional details like CUDA support, you can extend the Python command as follows:
bash
Copy code
python -c
"import torch; print(torch.__version__); print('CUDA available:', torch.cuda.is_available())"
This will print the PyTorch version and whether CUDA is available, which is important for GPU support.
If you find that PyTorch is not installed, you can install it by following the instructions on the PyTorch official website, selecting the appropriate configuration for your system.

The version
2.1.2+cu118
indicates that you have PyTorch version 2.1.2 installed with CUDA 11.8 support. This is a relatively recent version of PyTorch and includes support for CUDA, which allows you to take advantage of NVIDIA GPUs for accelerated computing tasks.
Here's a quick overview of what this means:
PyTorch Version 2.1.2
: This is the main version of PyTorch you have installed. PyTorch is a popular open-source machine learning library for Python, known for its flexibility and ease of use, especially in deep learning applications.
CUDA 11.8 Support (
cu118
)
: CUDA is a parallel computing platform and application programming interface (API) model created by NVIDIA. It allows software developers to use a CUDA-enabled graphics processing unit (GPU) for general purpose processing (an approach known as GPGPU, General-Purpose computing on Graphics Processing Units). The
cu118
indicates that your PyTorch installation is built to work with CUDA version 11.8, which means you can leverage compatible NVIDIA GPUs for faster computations in your PyTorch models.
If you have a compatible NVIDIA GPU in your system and the appropriate NVIDIA drivers installed, you should be able to utilize GPU acceleration for your deep learning models or any computation that PyTorch can offload to the GPU. This can significantly speed up model training and inference times compared to CPU-only computations.
