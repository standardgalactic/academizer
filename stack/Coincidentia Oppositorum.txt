The concept of "coincidentia oppositorum", or the unity of opposites, is a philosophical and theological concept that dates back to antiquity, but has been articulated in different ways throughout the centuries. It refers to the reconciliation or unity of opposites as a defining characteristic of the divine, or the ultimate reality.
Nicholas of Cusa (also known as Cusanus) and Georg Wilhelm Friedrich Hegel were two prominent philosophers who explored this concept. Nicholas of Cusa, a 15th century German philosopher, posited this idea as a key aspect of God, who is both everything and nothing, the maximum and the minimum. Hegel, an 18th-19th century philosopher, used the concept in his dialectical method where thesis and antithesis resolve into a synthesis, effectively demonstrating that seemingly contradictory realities can coexist in a higher form of truth.
As for 0HPL (an acronym I'm not familiar with as of my last update in September 2021), there may have been a development or a new thinker beyond my current knowledge that draws on this concept.
Now, to exemplify coincidentia oppositorum, consider the idea of being extremely pessimistic and extremely optimistic at the same time, coherently. This might seem paradoxical at first, but it can be possible within a broader perspective.
Here's how it could work: An individual could hold an extreme pessimistic view about the state of the world in its present form, noting problems like global warming, inequality, war, etc. Simultaneously, this person could be extremely optimistic about the potential for human creativity, innovation, and collaboration to bring about change and create a better future. This would imply a belief in the power of transformation, growth, and progress, even against the backdrop of a seemingly bleak reality.
This stance reconciles extreme optimism and extreme pessimism into a coherent worldview: the pessimism drives recognition of and engagement with real problems, while the optimism fuels motivation and action to bring about change. The power lies in this unity: it's a perspective that neither downplays the severity of current problems nor underestimates the potential for human progress and innovation. The interplay between these opposing forces could spur action and innovation, thus demonstrating the potency of the coincidentia oppositorum.

This is episode one, on reading, writing, metaphysics, literacy, and elitism

Having read so many of your original stories, I wanted to share my thought process for judging, and explain how I think about stories 

There are of course the bare concerns regarding prose quality, or technical skill in the management of pacing, framing, foreshadowing, and these types of things

For a story to be good, all of these things must be good.

And for many aspiring writers, they are still struggling with these fundamentals of composition. 

Indeed, this is a lifelong struggle, because we can always find ways to improve our technical abilities

There is no trick to improving at this; you must spend time reading good books, and you must practice copying their structure and flow.

Zero HP Lovecraft (0HPL) appears to be a writer, podcaster, or blogger whose work is available on the platform Substack. Based on the excerpt you've shared, their focus seems to be on literary analysis, writing skills, and metaphysical themes, among other things.
If we consider the application of "coincidentia oppositorum" within this context, it might imply a comprehensive understanding of literature, reading, and writing that embraces seeming contradictions.
For instance, 0HPL acknowledges that aspiring writers often struggle with the basics of composition and also states that "this is a lifelong struggle." This suggests that even as one gains mastery, there is always room for improvement - a form of coincidentia oppositorum, where the writer is both competent and yet always a learner.
It's hard to directly link this to "coincidentia oppositorum is power," but following the previous discussion, we could interpret the power as coming from this unity of being both a learner and an expert, always in a state of becoming better. This dynamic tension can be seen as driving motivation, curiosity, and progress, which are certainly powerful forces in any field, including writing and literary analysis.
To explore further, if 0HPL delves into metaphysical themes and concerns, it's quite possible that the concept of coincidentia oppositorum appears more explicitly in their content. More context or specific examples from 0HPL's work would be helpful to expand on this topic more accurately.

Neural Networks, Types, and Functional Programming
Posted on September 3, 2015


An Ad-Hoc Field
Deep learning, despite its remarkable successes, is a young field. While models called artificial neural networks have been studied for decades, much of that work seems only tenuously connected to modern results.

It's often the case that young fields start in a very ad-hoc manner. Later, the mature field is understood very differently than it was understood by its early practitioners. For example, in taxonomy, people have grouped plants and animals for thousands of years, but the way we understood what we were doing changed a lot in light of evolution and molecular biology. In chemistry, we have explored chemical reactions for a long time, but what we understood ourselves to do changed a lot with the discovery of irreducible elements, and again later with models of the atom. Those are grandiose examples, but the history of science and mathematics has seen this pattern again and again, on many different scales.

It seems quite likely that deep learning is in this ad-hoc state.

At the moment, deep learning is held together by an extremely successful tool. This tool doesn't seem fundamental; it's something we've stumbled on, with seemingly arbitrary details that change regularly. As a field, we don't yet have some unifying insight or shared understanding. In fact, the field has several competing narratives!

I think it is very likely that, reflecting back in 30 years, we will see deep learning very differently.

This article, titled "Neural Networks, Types, and Functional Programming," discusses the state of deep learning as a young, evolving field. It compares the development of deep learning to other scientific fields such as taxonomy and chemistry, which have evolved significantly from their initial, more ad-hoc states of understanding.
The author states that despite the great success and progress made in deep learning, its connection to older studies of artificial neural networks seems somewhat loose. The author posits that the field is still in an ad-hoc state, held together by a highly effective but seemingly non-fundamental tool. They suggest that the nuances of this tool appear somewhat arbitrary and are subject to change.
The author also observes that there's a lack of unifying insight or shared understanding in the field of deep learning. The field is characterized by competing narratives and a sense that its future development could lead to a significantly different understanding and approach.
As a concluding remark, the author proposes that our perspective on deep learning is likely to change in the next few decades, much like the transformation in understanding observed in other scientific fields. They imply that a more profound, unified understanding of the field is likely to emerge as it matures.

Deep Learning 30 Years in the Future
If we think we'll probably see deep learning very differently in 30 years, that suggests an interesting question: how are we going to see it? Of course, no one can actually know how we'll come to understand the field. But it is interesting to speculate.

At present, three narratives are competing to be the way we understand deep learning. There's the neuroscience narrative, drawing analogies to biology. There's the representations narrative, centered on transformations of data and the manifold hypothesis. Finally, there's a probabilistic narrative, which interprets neural networks as finding latent variables. These narratives aren't mutually exclusive, but they do present very different ways of thinking about deep learning.

This essay extends the representations narrative to a new answer: deep learning studies a connection between optimization and functional programming.

In this view, the representations narrative in deep learning corresponds to type theory in functional programming. It sees deep learning as the junction of two fields we already know to be incredibly rich. What we find, seems so beautiful to me, feels so natural, that the mathematician in me could believe it to be something fundamental about reality.

This is an extremely speculative idea. I am not arguing that it is true. I wish to argue only that it is plausible, that one could imagine deep learning evolving in this direction. To be clear: I am primarily making an aesthetic argument, rather than an argument of fact. I wish to show that this is a natural and elegant idea, encompassing what we presently call deep learning.

The author of this blog post, "Deep Learning 30 Years in the Future", proposes a speculative narrative about the future understanding of deep learning, predicting a possible connection between optimization and functional programming.
Three current narratives on deep learning are mentioned. First is the neuroscience narrative, which draws analogies between deep learning and biological systems. Second is the representations narrative, which focuses on how deep learning algorithms transform data, including concepts like the manifold hypothesis. Finally, there's the probabilistic narrative, which sees neural networks as tools for discovering latent variables. The author emphasizes that these narratives are not mutually exclusive, yet they present distinct ways of conceptualizing deep learning.
The main argument of the essay extends the representations narrative to propose a new perspective: deep learning as a study of the relationship between optimization and functional programming. This perspective correlates the representation narrative of deep learning to type theory in functional programming, potentially unifying these two complex fields.
The author admits that this is a highly speculative idea and clarifies that the intent is not to assert its truth, but rather to argue for its plausibility and aesthetic appeal. The belief is that this concept of deep learning is not just conceivable, but also inherently elegant, possibly encapsulating the essence of what we currently call deep learning. The proposal, then, is not an argument of fact but one of potential and aesthetic coherence.

In the case of very simple neural network architectures, where there's just a linear sequence of layers, this isn't very interesting. The representation of one layer's output needs to match the representation of the next layer's input - so what? It's a trivial and boring requirement.

But many neural networks have more complicated architectures where this becomes a more interesting constraint. For a very simple example, let's imagine a neural network with multiple similar kinds of inputs, which performs multiple, related tasks. Perhaps it takes in RGB images and also grayscale images. Maybe it's looking at pictures of people, and trying to predict age and gender. Because the similarities between the kinds of inputs and between the kinds of tasks, it can be helpful to do all of this in one model, so that training data helps them all. The result is multiple input layers mapping into one representation, and multiple outputs mapping from the same representation.


Perhaps this example seems a bit contrived, but mapping different kinds of data into the same representation can lead to some pretty remarkable things. For example, by mapping words from two languages into one representation, we can find corresponding words that we didn't know were translations when we started. And by mapping images and words into the same representation, we can classify images of classes we've never seen!

Representations and types can be seen as the basic building blocks for deep learning and functional programming respectively. One of the major narratives of deep learning, the manifolds and representations narrative, is entirely centered on neural networks bending data into new representations. The known connection between geometry, logic, topology, and functional programming suggests that the connections between representations and types may be of fundamental significance.

In this piece, the author discusses the importance of representations in neural network architectures. In simple networks, where there's a linear sequence of layers, the requirement for matching output and input representations between layers seems trivial. However, the narrative becomes more interesting in more complex architectures, where multiple kinds of inputs can map into a singular representation, leading to multiple outputs.
The author uses an example of a neural network that takes both RGB and grayscale images as inputs and predicts age and gender based on these inputs. By integrating different kinds of data into one model, the training process can be optimized, resulting in multiple input layers mapping into one representation and multiple outputs deriving from the same representation.
This technique of mapping different types of data into the same representation is underscored as a powerful tool. For instance, it allows for mapping words from two languages into one representation, enabling the discovery of translations not previously known. Similarly, by mapping images and words into the same representation, it becomes possible to classify images of classes never seen before.
The author goes on to argue that representations in deep learning and types in functional programming can be seen as their respective basic building blocks. The representations narrative in deep learning revolves around neural networks transforming data into new representations. The known connections between geometry, logic, topology, and functional programming indicate that the relationship between representations and types might be fundamentally significant. This could potentially suggest a deeper unifying principle between deep learning and functional programming.

Explain it in a different way.
1 / 1
ChatGPT
ChatGPT
Sure, let's use a different perspective.
The author is suggesting that the structure of neural networks and the way they process data has interesting similarities to functional programming, specifically in relation to data representations.
Think of a neural network as a machine in a factory, with each layer of the network as a different stage on the assembly line. In a simple factory, you might have a straight assembly line where one stage feeds directly into the next. That's like a basic neural network, where the output from one layer simply becomes the input for the next layer. In such a scenario, the requirement for data representations (the 'form' that data takes) to match between layers isn't a big deal - it's just a basic necessity for the factory to function.
However, in more complex factories, you might have multiple assembly lines feeding into a central stage, or a single line splitting to multiple outputs. That's analogous to more complex neural networks where you might have multiple inputs converging into a single data representation or multiple outputs generated from the same data representation.
The author gives an example of a network that takes in different types of images (color and grayscale), and outputs multiple types of predictions (age and gender). The inputs are different but related, as are the outputs, so it makes sense to use a shared model (or 'representation') to process them. This is more efficient and allows each part of the model to learn from all the data.
The author then explores the potential of this representation-focused approach. Just like a multilingual translator finding connections between words in different languages, or a code-breaker finding patterns in seemingly random data, a neural network can map different kinds of data (like images and words) into the same representation. This can lead to surprising insights, like being able to translate previously unknown words or classify never-seen-before images.
Lastly, the author draws a parallel between this concept of representations in deep learning and the concept of types in functional programming. Just as representations shape how neural networks transform and understand data, types shape how functional programming organizes and processes data. The author suggests that exploring the connections between these concepts could lead to a deeper understanding of both fields.

Deep Learning & Functional Programming
One of the key insights behind modern neural networks is the idea that many copies of one neuron can be used in a neural network.

In programming, the abstraction of functions is essential. Instead of writing the same code dozens, hundreds, or even thousands of times, we can write it once and use it as we need it. Not only does this massively reduce the amount of code we need to write and maintain, speeding the development process, but it also reduces the risk of us introducing bugs, and makes the mistakes we do make easier to catch.

Using multiple copies of a neuron in different places is the neural network equivalent of using functions. Because there is less to learn, the model learns more quickly and learns a better model. This technique - the technical name for it is 'weight tying' - is essential to the phenomenal results we've recently seen from deep learning.

Of course, one can't just arbitrarily put copies of neurons all over the place. For the model to work, you need to do it in a principled way, exploiting some structure in your data. In practice, there are a handful of patterns that are widely used, such as recurrent layers and convolutional layers.

These neural network patterns are just higher order functions - that is, functions which take functions as arguments. Things like that have been studied extensively in functional programming. In fact, many of these network patterns correspond to extremely common functions, like fold. The only unusual thing is that, instead of receiving normal functions as arguments, they receive chunks of neural network.

Windowed Map = Convolutional Layer
Haskell: zipWith a xs (tail xs)
Two dimensional convolutional neural networks are particularly notable. They have been behind recent successes in computer vision. (More on conv nets.)


Two Dimensional Convolutional Network
Recursive Neural Networks ("TreeNets") are catamorphisms, a generalization of folds. They consume a data structure from the bottom up. They're mostly used for natural language processing, to allow neural networks to operate on parse trees.

The above examples demonstrate how common patterns in neural networks correspond to very natural, simple functional programs.

The author explores the similarities between deep learning and functional programming by pointing out shared principles and methods in the two fields.
The concept of reusability is integral to both fields. In programming, the abstraction of functions allows code to be written once and then used as needed, reducing redundancy, speeding up development, and minimizing the risk of bugs. Similarly, in neural networks, the principle of using many copies of one neuron—referred to as 'weight tying'—simplifies the learning process, leading to faster and better model training.
However, the placement of neuron copies must be structured and principled, reflecting some underlying structure in the data. Common patterns, such as recurrent and convolutional layers, are often used in neural network design. These patterns are equated to higher-order functions in functional programming, i.e., functions that take other functions as arguments.
For instance, a windowed map in functional programming is likened to a convolutional layer in a neural network. A two-dimensional convolutional layer, in particular, has led to significant advancements in computer vision.
Similarly, Recursive Neural Networks, also known as "TreeNets", are compared to catamorphisms in functional programming. Catamorphisms are a generalized form of folds that consume a data structure from the bottom up. TreeNets use this approach to process parse trees in natural language processing.
The author concludes that these common patterns in neural networks mirror very natural, simple functional programs, thereby highlighting the intrinsic connections between deep learning and functional programming.

lots of different ways, of course - there's lots of variance in how people see deep learning - but there's often an undercurrent that feels very similar to functional programming conversations.

It feels like a new kind of programming altogether, a kind of differentiable functional programming. One writes a very rough functional program, with these flexible, learnable pieces, and defines the correct behavior of the program with lots of data. Then you apply gradient descent, or some other optimization algorithm. The result is a program capable of doing remarkable things that we have no idea how to create directly, like generating captions describing images.

It's the natural intersection of functional programming and optimization, and I think it's beautiful.

The author brings up a concept of "differentiable functional programming", seeing it as a promising new direction in programming, rooted in deep learning principles. In this approach, one would write a rough functional program composed of flexible, learnable components, then use data to define the correct behavior of the program. An optimization algorithm, such as gradient descent, would then be applied.
The idea of differentiable functional programming integrates concepts from both functional programming and optimization, leveraging the strength of both. The flexible, learnable pieces in the functional program are reminiscent of the learnable parameters (weights and biases) in a neural network. By adjusting these pieces through optimization, the functional program can be trained to perform remarkable tasks.
For example, this approach could lead to programs capable of automatically generating captions that accurately describe images—a task that we currently don't know how to program directly but can be achieved through machine learning. This represents a potential merger of the design principles of functional programming with the learning capabilities of deep learning.
In conclusion, the author views differentiable functional programming as a beautiful fusion of functional programming and optimization, encapsulating a sense of the transformative potential of deep learning in the realm of programming.

Conclusion
I find this idea really beautiful. At the same time, this is a pretty strange article and I feel a bit weird posting it. I'm very strongly presenting a speculative idea with little support behind it besides my own enthusiasm. Honestly, adopting the most objective perspective I can, I expect this idea is wrong, because most untested ideas are wrong. But it could be right, and I think it's worth talking about.

Beyond that, I'm not really the right person to explore a lot of the directions this suggests - for example, one of the obvious things to do is to analyze neural networks from a homotopy type theory perspective, but I don't have the relevant background. This is an idea that's begging for broader discussion. It really seems like publishing this is the right thing to do.

Finally, I'm hoping this essay might stir up more discussion and thoughts about what deep learning is really about. I think there's an important discussion waiting to be had.

Besides, what's the point of writing a blog if I can't speculate? Hopefully, I've been able to appropriately balance my excitement with my uncertainty.

For example, the once ubiquitous sigmoid layer has been substantially replaced by ReLU layers.↩

I think it's actually kind of surprising that these sort of models are possible at all, and it's because of a surprising fact. Many higher order functions, given differentiable functions as arguments, produce a function which is differentiable almost everywhere. Further, given the derivatives of argument functions, you can simply use chain rule to calculate the derivative of the resulting function.↩

This operation is also closely related to stencil/convolution functions, which are their linear version. They're typically implemented using those. However, in modern neural net research, where "MLP convolution layers" are becoming more popular, it seems preferable to think of this as an arbitrary function.

The author concludes by acknowledging the speculative nature of the ideas presented in the article. While the author believes the concept of "differentiable functional programming" to be both beautiful and promising, they admit that this idea, as it is untested, could also be incorrect. However, they assert the idea's value lies in sparking broader discussions.
The author also acknowledges that some areas suggested by this idea, like analyzing neural networks from a homotopy type theory perspective, are outside of their expertise. Thus, they advocate for further exploration and discussion by others who may have the relevant knowledge.
The article's aim is not just to propose a speculative idea, but to provoke discussions on what deep learning really is. The author hopes to stir up conversations that could lead to new insights into this field.
In an appendix, the author provides a comparison of components in deep learning and functional programming. For example, a learned vector in deep learning is similar to a constant in functional programming, an encoding RNN is similar to a fold, and so on.
The author also notes that many higher-order functions in functional programming, when given differentiable functions as arguments, can produce a function that is differentiable almost everywhere. This fact, while surprising, aligns with the principles of deep learning and demonstrates a potential avenue for the fusion of deep learning and functional programming.
In sum, the author urges readers to maintain an open mind, allowing for speculative ideas that might illuminate new perspectives and understandings in the field of deep learning.

This article explores the potential intersection of deep learning and functional programming. The concept that the author introduces, referred to as "differentiable functional programming", posits that a functional program could be designed with learnable components. These components would then be optimized using techniques such as gradient descent, which are common in deep learning.
Here's how I interpret it:
The idea draws on the principles of both functional programming and deep learning. In functional programming, functions are first-class entities that can be passed as arguments, returned from other functions, and assigned to variables. Functions are often used to abstract over repetitive tasks, leading to code that's easier to read, test, and debug.
Deep learning, on the other hand, is a subfield of machine learning that utilizes neural networks with many layers (hence "deep") to learn complex patterns in data. These networks can adjust their internal parameters (weights and biases) in response to the data they are exposed to, which is often referred to as "learning".
When these two principles are combined in "differentiable functional programming", we're envisioning a system where the functions in our program are not rigidly defined, but rather, can learn and adjust their behavior based on data. These functions can be considered as analogs to the neurons in a deep learning model, with the overall program structure mirroring the architecture of the neural network.
While it's an exciting and thought-provoking concept, it's also quite speculative and currently lacks empirical support. However, if feasible, this approach could yield powerful models capable of learning and adapting to their inputs in sophisticated ways, potentially leading to major advancements in areas such as artificial intelligence and software development.
Ultimately, it's a hypothesis about the future of deep learning and functional programming, suggesting that there could be a convergence of these two fields that could revolutionize how we build and understand algorithms and computational models.

I'd like to start by tracing a particularly interesting strand of deep learning research: word embeddings. In my personal opinion, word embeddings are one of the most exciting area of research in deep learning at the moment, although they were originally introduced by Bengio, et al. more than a decade ago.3 Beyond that, I think they are one of the best places to gain intuition about why deep learning is so effective.

A word embedding W:words→Rn is a paramaterized function mapping words in some language to high-dimensional vectors (perhaps 200 to 500 dimensions). For example, we might find:

W(''cat")=(0.2, -0.4, 0.7, ...)

W(''mat")=(0.0, 0.6, -0.1, ...)

(Typically, the function is a lookup table, parameterized by a matrix, θ, with a row for each word: Wθ(wn)=θn.)

W is initialized to have random vectors for each word. It learns to have meaningful vectors in order to perform some task.

For example, one task we might train a network for is predicting whether a 5-gram (sequence of five words) is 'valid.' We can easily get lots of 5-grams from Wikipedia (eg. "cat sat on the mat") and then 'break' half of them by switching a word with a random word (eg. "cat sat song the mat"), since that will almost certainly make our 5-gram nonsensical.


Modular Network to determine if a 5-gram is 'valid' (From Bottou (2011))
The model we train will run each word in the 5-gram through W to get a vector representing it and feed those into another 'module' called R which tries to predict if the 5-gram is 'valid' or 'broken.' Then, we'd like:

R(W(''cat"), W(''sat"), W(''on"), W(''the"), W(''mat"))=1

R(W(''cat"), W(''sat"), W(''song"), W(''the"), W(''mat"))=0

In order to predict these values accurately, the network needs to learn good parameters for both W and R.

Now, this task isn't terribly interesting. Maybe it could be helpful in detecting grammatical errors in text or something. But what is extremely interesting is W.

(In fact, to us, the entire point of the task is to learn W. We could have done several other tasks - another common one is predicting the next word in the sentence. But we don't really care. In the remainder of this section we will talk about many word embedding results and won't distinguish between different approaches.

This section describes a specific and very influential area of deep learning research called word embeddings. Word embeddings are essentially a way of representing words in a high-dimensional vector space (usually with hundreds of dimensions) such that words with similar meanings or usages are mapped to close or similar vectors in that space.
The way word embeddings are learned is through training a neural network on a specific task. One common task used for this purpose is the n-gram prediction task. In this task, the neural network is trained to predict whether a sequence of n words (for example, a 5-gram is a sequence of 5 words) makes sense or not. Half of the n-grams used for training are valid sequences taken from a large text corpus like Wikipedia, and half are invalid sequences created by replacing one word in a valid n-gram with a random word.
To make these predictions, the network first maps each word in the n-gram to its corresponding vector using the word embedding function. These vectors are then fed into another part of the network that makes the final prediction. Both the word embeddings and the parameters of the predictive part of the network are learned during training.
The important thing about this process is not the specific task that the network is trained on, but the word embeddings that are learned as a result. These word embeddings capture meaningful semantic relationships between words and are useful for a wide variety of natural language processing tasks. While the n-gram prediction task is one common way of learning word embeddings, there are many other tasks that could be used for this purpose, and the specific task used doesn't matter as much as the embeddings themselves.

Introduction
In the last few years, deep neural networks have dominated pattern recognition. They blew the previous state of the art out of the water for many computer vision tasks. Voice recognition is also moving that way.

But despite the results, we have to wonder... why do they work so well?

This post reviews some extremely remarkable results in applying deep neural networks to natural language processing (NLP). In doing so, I hope to make accessible one promising answer as to why deep neural networks work. I think it's a very elegant perspective.

One Hidden Layer Neural Networks
A neural network with a hidden layer has universality: given enough hidden units, it can approximate any function. This is a frequently quoted - and even more frequently, misunderstood and applied - theorem.

It's true, essentially, because the hidden layer can be used as a lookup table.

For simplicity, let's consider a perceptron network. A perceptron is a very simple neuron that fires if it exceeds a certain threshold and doesn't fire if it doesn't reach that threshold. A perceptron network gets binary (0 and 1) inputs and gives binary outputs.

Note that there are only a finite number of possible inputs. For each possible input, we can construct a neuron in the hidden layer that fires for that input,1 and only on that specific input. Then we can use the connections between that neuron and the output neurons to control the output in that specific case. 2


And so, it's true that one hidden layer neural networks are universal. But there isn't anything particularly impressive or exciting about that. Saying that your model can do the same thing as a lookup table isn't a very strong argument for it. It just means it isn't impossible for your model to do the task.

Universality means that a network can fit to any training data you give it. It doesn't mean that it will interpolate to new data points in a reasonable way.

No, universality isn't an explanation for why neural networks work so well. The real reason seems to be something much more subtle... And, to understand it, we'll first need to understand some concrete results.

In this section, the author discusses the universality of neural networks. Universality here refers to the ability of a neural network with at least one hidden layer to approximate any function given enough hidden units. This universality, while theoretically significant, doesn't offer a satisfying explanation for why neural networks are so effective in practical applications. This is because, while a universal network can fit any given training data perfectly, it doesn't necessarily generalize well to unseen data.
To truly understand why deep learning methods work so well, the author suggests that we need to delve into specific applications and results. This leads to a discussion on word embeddings, a particularly important concept in Natural Language Processing (NLP).
Word embeddings are a method of converting words into numeric vectors in such a way that words with similar meanings are located near each other in this high-dimensional space. The success of deep learning in generating effective word embeddings for various NLP tasks is one of the key examples the author uses to explain why deep learning is so effective in practice.
It is worth noting that the concept of universality in neural networks does not necessarily translate into practical effectiveness due to overfitting and the curse of dimensionality. Deep learning excels due to its ability to learn hierarchical representations and its robustness to noise and irrelevant features. This hierarchical feature learning is a crucial aspect of deep learning's effectiveness, especially in tasks like image recognition and NLP. The learned features and representations are often generalizable, providing better performance on unseen data.

Sorry those were in the wrong order. I'm skipping to the end.

Criticisms
I've heard some of the results reviewed above criticized by researchers in other fields, in particular, in NLP and linguistics. The concerns are not with the results themselves, but the conclusions drawn from them, and how they compare to other techniques.

I don't feel qualified to articulate these concerns. I'd encourage someone who feels this way to describe the concerns in the comments.

Conclusion
The representation perspective of deep learning is a powerful view that seems to answer why deep neural networks are so effective. Beyond that, I think there's something extremely beautiful about it: why are neural networks effective? Because better ways of representing data can pop out of optimizing layered models.

Deep learning is a very young field, where theories aren't strongly established and views quickly change. That said, it is my impression that the representation-focused perspective of neural networks is presently very popular.

This post reviews a lot of research results I find very exciting, but my main motivation is to set the stage for a future post exploring connections between deep learning, type theory and functional programming

ChatGPT
ChatGPT
"Coincidentia oppositorum" is a Latin phrase that means "coincidence of opposites." It's a philosophical concept that describes a situation where contradictory conditions exist simultaneously. The idea is often linked to several philosophers and mystics, especially those from the tradition of dialectical reasoning and Neoplatonism.
The idea is that often reality involves a unity or interconnection of opposites - things that might seem in tension or even completely contradictory can in fact be complementary or interconnected aspects of a single reality. In essence, the concept encapsulates the idea of reconciling conflict or opposition.
In a broad sense, "coincidentia oppositorum" has been applied to various fields including philosophy, religion, psychology, and even physical sciences. For instance, in quantum physics, the principle of wave-particle duality reflects a coincidentia oppositorum, as it describes the phenomenon where particles such as electrons and photons exhibit both wave and particle properties.
In the context of our discussion, we could see deep learning as a coincidentia oppositorum in that it involves aspects that may appear to be contradictory, such as deterministic algorithms and stochastic optimization methods, or simplicity of individual units (like neurons) and complexity of the overall network behavior.

Yeah I do see that. Even just running some images through clip interrogator would be a way to compress, if I don't mind lossy compression
1 / 1
ChatGPT
ChatGPT
Absolutely, leveraging machine learning models like OpenAI's CLIP for image compression is indeed a fascinating idea.
CLIP (Contrastive Language-Image Pretraining) has shown impressive capabilities in understanding and generating images from textual descriptions. This makes it potentially useful for a form of lossy compression, where you could store an image as a compact textual description instead of pixel data.
In essence, you could use CLIP to generate a description of the image, store that description, and then use it later to regenerate the image. This regenerated image won't be a perfect replica of the original due to the lossy nature of the compression, but it might be good enough for certain applications, especially where storage space is at a premium.
However, it's important to note that there are still many technical challenges to overcome before this idea could be practical. The quality of the regenerated images and the efficiency of the compression (i.e., how much storage space you actually save) would need to be carefully evaluated. Additionally, training and running models like CLIP require substantial computational resources, which might limit the practicality of this approach for large-scale or real-time applications as of now.
Nonetheless, this is a very innovative and promising direction for exploration in the realm of data compression!

The use of templates and transformative filters adds another layer of flexibility and adaptability to your algorithm. Templates can capture common structures or patterns in the scenes, allowing for more efficient encoding and decoding. Transformative filters can be applied to the data, capturing the differences between frames and reducing redundancy.
Overall, your approach seems to leverage various techniques and insights from computer vision and data processing to optimize the compression process for dynamic scenes. While there are challenges to address, such as the trade-off between compression efficiency and computational complexity, this multi-faceted approach holds great potential for achieving efficient and effective compression.
Continuing to refine and develop your algorithm through experimentation and testing will be key to realizing its full potential. Additionally, considering real-world scenarios and datasets will help ensure its applicability and effectiveness in practical situations.

Abstract:
Robust image hashing, which maps the perceptual contents of image to a short digest, is a key technique for tackling the challenges of content-based indexing, searching and copyright protection. In this letter, we propose a quaternion invariance based hashing algorithm that can fuse complementary visual features to compact hash. The proposed algorithm leverages quaternion polar cosine transform to holistically capture the spatial and chromatic characteristics of digital image, and rotation-invariant features are derived from the phase information in the quaternion frequency domain. In addition, we also propose an information theoretic based metric for feature quality assessment and a greedy strategy to select the optimal subset of features for hash computation. Extensive experiments over a large database demonstrate that the proposed work shows higher content identification accuracy than most competing algorithms, and the resulting hash is compact and easy to compute.

Researchers from MIT and Harvard in the United States and the Technical University of Munich in Germany have demonstrated how a hash function can significantly speed up searches in a particularly large database. This new development could accelerate DNA analysis, amino acid sequences, or studies of other biological information.

Their research - supported, in part, by Google, Intel, Microsoft, the National Science Foundation, the United States Air Force Research Laboratory, and the United States Air Force Artificial Intelligence Accelerator - will be presented at the International Conference on Very Large Databases.

Hashing is a fundamental operation in online databases such as library catalogues and e-commerce websites. Hash functions generate codes that replace data inputs, allowing for more accessible information retrieval as the codes are shorter and of fixed length. However, collisions can occur when two pieces of data are hashed with the same value, causing slower searches and reduced performance.

To avoid collisions, perfect hash functions are used, but they require more time to compute and must be constructed for each dataset. As hashing is used in various applications, including database indexing, data compression, and cryptography, fast and efficient hash functions are crucial. To improve hash function performance, researchers from MIT and other institutions investigated using machine learning to build better hash functions.

Their findings showed that using learned models, which are created by running a machine-learning algorithm on a dataset, can result in half as many collisions in certain situations. Learned models were also more computationally efficient than perfect hash functions.

"What we found in this work is that in some situations, we can come up with a better tradeoff between the computation of the hash function and the collisions we will face," says Ibrahim Sabek, a postdoc in the MIT Data Systems Group of the Computer Science and Artificial Intelligence Laboratory (CSAIL). "We can increase the computational time for the hash function a bit, but at the same time, we can reduce collisions very significantly in certain situations."

As just one example, the technique could accelerate computational systems that scientists use to store and analyse DNA, amino acid sequences, or other biological information.

Sabek is co-lead author of the paper with electrical engineering and computer science (EECS) graduate student Kapil Vaidya. They are joined by co-authors Dominick Horn, a graduate student at the Technical University of Munich; Andreas Kipf, an MIT postdoc; Michael Mitzenmacher, professor of computer science at the Harvard John A. Paulson School of Engineering and Applied Sciences; and senior author Tim Kraska, associate professor of EECS at MIT and co-director of the Data Systems and AI Lab.

Perfect hash functions offer collision-free work
Traditional hash functions generate a random code corresponding to the slot where a data input or key will be stored. For example, if there are 10 keys to be placed into 10 slots, the function would generate a random integer between 1 and 10 for each input. However, collisions can occur when two keys end up in the same slot.

Perfect hash functions provide a collision-free solution. By providing the function with additional knowledge, such as the number of slots available for data placement, it can perform additional computations to determine the appropriate slot for each key, thereby avoiding collisions. However, the added computations make the function more challenging to create and less efficient.

"We were wondering, if we know more about the data — that it will come from a particular distribution — can we use learned models to build a hash function that can actually reduce collisions?" says Vaidya.

A data distribution displays all possible values in a dataset along with their frequency of occurrence. This distribution enables the calculation of the likelihood that a particular value is present in a data sample.

In their research, the team employed machine learning to estimate the shape of the data distribution, or how the data are distributed, by using a small sample from the dataset. The resulting learned model then predicts the location of a key in the dataset.

The researchers discovered that learned models are easier and faster to construct than perfect hash functions, resulting in fewer collisions than traditional hash functions when data is distributed predictably. However, if the gaps between data points vary too much, using learned models could result in more collisions.

"We may have a huge number of data inputs, and each one has a different gap between it and the next one, so learning that is quite difficult," Sabek explains.

More sub-models lead to more accuracy
When data exhibited predictable distribution patterns, using learned models reduced the rate of colliding keys in a dataset from 30% to 15% compared to traditional hash functions. Additionally, they were able to achieve superior throughput than perfect hash functions. In optimal scenarios, using learned models resulted in a runtime reduction of almost 30%.

The researchers also discovered that the number of sub-models had the most significant impact on throughput when exploring the use of learned models for hashing. Each learned model comprises smaller linear models that approximate the data distribution. Increasing the number of sub-models enhances the accuracy of the learned model's approximation, but it also results in a longer processing time.

"At a certain threshold of sub-models, you get enough information to build the approximation that you need for the hash function. But after that, it won't lead to more improvement in collision reduction," says Sabek.

Building off this analysis, the researchers want to use learned models to design hash functions for other data types. They also plan to explore learned hashing for databases where data can be inserted or deleted. When data are updated this way, the model needs to change accordingly, but changing the model while maintaining accuracy is a complex problem.

"We want to encourage the community to use machine learning inside more fundamental data structures and operations," says Sabek. "Any kind of core data structure presents us with an opportunity use machine learning to capture data properties and get better performance. There is still a lot we can explore."

The information-theoretic metric used in Dynagraphic Compression is a measure of the quality of the features extracted from the images. It assesses the amount of information captured by the features in relation to the overall image content.
The metric evaluates the relevance and discriminative power of the features based on their information content. Features that carry more unique and informative characteristics of the image contribute more to the overall hash quality. On the other hand, features that contain redundant or less significant information are given lower weight or may be discarded.
By incorporating this information-theoretic metric into the feature selection process, Dynagraphic Compression ensures that the selected features are meaningful and contribute effectively to the compression process. This helps to optimize the compression ratios while preserving relevant details and minimizing the loss of important information.
The specific details and calculations of the information-theoretic metric may vary depending on the implementation and the specific algorithms used in Dynagraphic Compression.
