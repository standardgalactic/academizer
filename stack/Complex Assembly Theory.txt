Operational semantics, homology, and type theory.
ChatGPT
It seems like you are bringing up three distinct topics related to computer science and mathematics: operational semantics, homology, and type theory. Let me briefly address each one.
Operational Semantics
: Operational semantics is a method for describing the behavior of programming languages. It provides a set of rules that precisely specify the steps a program will take during execution. Operational semantics is often used to prove properties about programs, such as correctness or equivalence with other programs.
Homology
: Homology in mathematics, specifically in algebraic topology, is a concept used to represent and study topological spaces. Homology groups provide algebraic invariants that help categorize topological spaces based on their structure. These invariants are useful for solving problems in geometry and topology, giving insights into the properties and features of various spaces.
Type Theory
: Type theory is a framework in logic, mathematics, and computer science that deals with types, which help to categorize values and expressions in a programming language. In type theory, every term has a type, and the process of computation can be viewed as a process of type transformation. Type theory is foundational for many functional programming languages and is crucial for ensuring the correctness and safety of programs.

all right for our third speaker today we  have Tony Anala who  intriguing title of homotopia's with us  so thank you for the introduction  and yes of the title is maybe a bit of a  provocation but uh  let's start so  I understand that many people here are  not algebraichiometers but it's also the  special year  and somehow my talk will also fall in  line of this special year in the sense  that I will discuss about cohomology  theories  in algebraic geometry  and let's just quickly recall what this  means is that we have our geometric  object X  maybe it's a variety it might be a  scheme it might be you know just a  geometric object in Enterprise geometry  and under that object  you will associate  cohomology groups  and on the right hand side we now have  something that's linear algebra  basically  so in some sense chromology theories are  ways to turn geometry  into linear algebra and also whenever  you compare to geometric object you get  the linear map you basically get a  matrix  okay that makes sense  and I think one of the sort of original  motivations that maybe I don't think  anyone has discussed thus far was the  proof of the whale conjectures  and there people really wanted to  understand  how the number of solutions the whole  normal equation system  behaves for finite Fields so you only  have finite many solutions when you  increase the size of the field  and how this  how sort of chronology helps with that  is that first of all you notice that  these Solutions are the fixed points of  the of the propaneers which is a  geometric  operator on X so it's an automorphism of  X well endomorphism of X and then  the solutions of for the Solutions in  finite field correspond to the Solutions  in the algebraic closure which is an  infinite field  that are fixed under this frobenius  operator  but this other number you can compute by  applying something like the left such  fixed point formula  so in the end you will end up Computing  this number as an alternating sum of  some traces here and this is just a very  amazing sort of thing that you can do  with commodity theories and algebraic  tumor  and of course like in order to  apply this formula you need to have a  theory of like comology theory that  works in in settings that are  seemingly discrete like geometry  impossible characteristic and  well then first people started to try to  find the technology Theory but then they  found they made the following  observation that probably many of you  already made while listening to these  thoughts namely there is not only one  cohology Theory but there's actually  plenty of  so let me list some of them that we have  because it's a special year the periodic  special year we have heard about all  this periodic comology theories  so we have Iran maybe that's not the  adequate but certainly you have  crystalline go homology  and you also have something called the  prismaticology  okay so these are three examples I was  ecology theories and to be honest like I  sound like  no  that's right  but anyway these are the politics  were talking about and plenty of others  uh but then there was another technology  theory that appeared in U.S and art  Monson Island stock at least which is  algebraic K Theory  okay this is another commodity Theory  and I'll just add one more in this list  well okay  more about one more to this stage which  is algebraic corporalism so this is  theory that looks like the chromogic  theories in algebraic topology  and to end maybe I should have really  started with this uh you have the L  addict  it's a very important  in the story that I've explained before  and then you also have something called  the motivic  cohenology  which also I think up here I think I can  stop  uh now we have seven Commodities there  is on the board or maybe six oh yes  um and a question  I mean you cannot count right  and then a question  is like okay it's a bit messy like you  have all these different commodity  theories they form a zoo is there a way  to somehow construct the universal  alcoholic Theory or if you view  commodity theories as turning geometric  objects with linear algebra is there a  universal way to linearize  these objects and the first sort of  suggested framework to do this  is rosendix framework for motives  foreign  accuracies  and maybe  yeah sweep something on the Rock but  anyway this is something  that is universal enough to at least  recover  Y and alcohol homology and things like  this  and  it was not only used first as a  sort of a  an organizing principle for all the  different technology theories but also  it was suggested as like a potential  strategy for him like proving the  hardest part of the  of the well conjectures uh by proving  so-called standard conjectures but the  standard conjectures are very difficult  it seems they're still open and I think  they'll improved the hardest part of the  mobile contractors using another way  okay  well after some time passed people  realize that this sort of suggested  framework for motives is not really  somehow the yield to the

Certainly! Let���s delve into some of the concepts mentioned in the lecture:
1.
Cohomology Theories in Algebraic Geometry
:
Cohomology
: A mathematical tool that assigns algebraic structures to topological spaces, allowing for the exploration of their properties. In algebraic geometry, it helps translate problems of geometric nature into algebraic terms.
Cohomology Groups
: These groups are associated with a geometric object, acting as algebraic invariants that help classify and study the object's structure.
Specific Types of Cohomology Theories:
Crystalline Cohomology
: Useful for studying varieties over fields of positive characteristic. It incorporates notions of differential geometry within algebraic geometry, considering 'infinitesimal' properties of schemes.
Prismatic Cohomology
: Introduced to study p-adic geometry, prismatic cohomology unifies various cohomology theories, providing a tool for understanding deformations and variations of p-adic structures.
Algebraic K-Theory
: This theory explores the relationships among different algebraic structures. It���s crucial for studying problems related to algebraic varieties, including vector bundles and their higher-dimensional analogs.
Algebraic Cobordism
: It is an approach to study algebraic varieties using topological techniques, allowing for a unifying framework that connects various cohomology and homology theories.
L-adic Cohomology
: A fundamental tool for investigating algebraic varieties over finite fields. It helps explore solutions to polynomial equations over such fields and plays a significant role in the proof of the Weil conjectures.
Motivic Cohomology
: It plays a foundational role in algebraic K-theory and the study of algebraic cycles (combinations of subvarieties). Motivic cohomology provides a link between algebraic geometry and number theory.
Grothendieck���s Framework for Motives:
Motives
: Proposed by Grothendieck, motives are hypothetical objects that act as building blocks for algebraic varieties. They were introduced to provide a universal cohomology theory.
Standard Conjectures
: These are hypotheses related to the properties and behavior of motives. Although unproven, they offer deep insights into the structure of algebraic varieties and the nature of cohomology theories.
The text also refers to the "zoo" of cohomology theories, indicating the multitude and diversity of these theories in algebraic geometry. The lecturer explores the possibility of finding a 'universal' cohomology theory or a systematic way to linearize geometric objects, with Grothendieck's framework for motives offered as a potential approach to this challenge.
Each of these topics is deeply complex, and this overview is quite high-level. If you have specific questions or need clarification on any point, please let me know!
field  and how this  how sort of chronology helps with that  is that first of all you notice that  these Solutions are the fixed points of  the of the propaneers which is a  geometric  operator on X

 okay  well after some time passed people  realize that this sort of suggested  framework for motives is not really  somehow the yield to the ultimate  framework for commonwe jpr racing or  geometry and the and in particular like  early or late 90s early 2000s  Fabian Morel who is here oh  and Vladimir weapons  constructed A1 homophobic Theory  because it's gonna be like the staple  version  and  and this is something that captures  things that are not quite  homology but are something like K Theory  or algebraic Commodities and this was  used by weymotsky and other people  in the roster to prove  this sort of block Kata and inner  conjecture on quadratic Force  and one way to understand the  relationship between these two things is  you can sort of think that  you obtain Maldives  when you consider objects that are  linear  over the motivic CO homology as an  object like a Serene object in one  hormone topic here  okay  but so one of the fundamental  assumptions for May 1 homophobic Theory  or the observation you start when you  start building this theory is that A1 is  contractable meaning that the chronology  of A1 should be the same as technology  of the point but I think in media's talk  yesterday  we did so you see that that Iran Co  homology of A1 is very complicated  and this is why I mean my co-authors and  I are trying to consider  what I call uh chromatopoe Theory  without  well let's say A1  so this is a variant of the economy  Theory where A1 is not assumed to be  contractable and you can see why this is  sort of a provocative title because  maybe I should have put an A1 there but  it's not nearly as far  in any case the relationship between  this Theory which I will call Ms coming  from what we expect Spectra and this sh  A1 homotopia theory is that you obtain  this one from the left side  by forcing  A1  to be contractable  [Music]  somehow the rough idea of of the  construction of this MS  we so so anyone sorry sorry Theory  starts with the assumption that A1 is  contractable and this is what we want to  avoid  so instead of that  we only ask the homology of productive  spaces to behave as as expected roughly  speaking and this is surprisingly enough  for us to get  some sort of geometric results  okay so I've explained some sort of uh  well I haven't explained anything I've  said a lot of things about this VR  category where you don't even have  anyone home of this uh okay that's all  nice you can get  oh sorry  I guess the point to us that you can get  these things  out of there  and another remark I should say here  here you have Dash Spirals and here you  have solid arrows  um and this is for the reason that  actually if you're working over things  with singularities then even to get K  Theory and mgl they don't really live  here but they should do it here because  actually algebraic Theory also is not  going to be a one invariant for singular  schemes anyway  okay we have a category we can get  things out of it but can we actually  prove anything about it and  we can prove some things  but let me try to explain  and then the first result  is a recent paper by Marco UA and me and  this is like the analog of the  contractability of infinite dimensional  sphere in topology  and how does this analog look like  well  you have a Infinity infinite dimensional  F5 space minus the origin  you can include it in the infinite  dimensional advised space  and the claim is that this is an  equivalence  in our motive expecting category  and and you can see that if A1 is  contractable then actually it's always  going to be a Infinity so actually if A1  was correct was contractable then this  sort of infinite dimensional sphere  would be contractable as well  and okay  cool but why would anyone care  well this is actually an important  ingredient  uh in proving that  uh rasmanians  or infinite dimensional correspondence  classify  Vector bundles  in what we expect from  so there's a statement in topology that  on a nice enough topological space the  homotopic process of maps to an infinite  plus money and  are in one-to-one correspondence with  Vector bundles on that thing and the  analogous statement is true in our  modific Spectrum category  and and what is this then useful well  you can use this or this is actually an  important ingredient  or maybe slightly weaker version of this  of another theorem  which sort of shows that we can  oh sorry this is actually just  okay that looks bad but  luckily it's recorded  but this this can be for that result so  I'm running a

It appears that you've provided the introductory portion of a dissertation by Rafael Reif titled "Doping Process in Silicon Epitaxy: Transfer Function and Physicochemical Model." This dissertation was submitted to the Department of Electrical Engineering and the Committee on Graduate Studies at Stanford University in November 1978 as part of the requirements for the degree of Doctor of Philosophy (Ph.D.).
This document likely delves into the topic of silicon epitaxy, specifically focusing on the doping process. The "Transfer Function and Physicochemical Model" suggests that the dissertation may explore mathematical and physical models related to the process.
If you have specific questions or need information from this dissertation, please feel free to ask, and I'll do my best to provide relevant information based on the content you're interested in.
ABSTRACT
The doping process in a horizontal silicon epitaxial reactor is
characterized by a mathematical expression that relates the dopant gas
flow into the reactor as a function of time to the dopant concentration
in the epitaxial layer as a function of depth. This transfer function
is obtained from the response of the reactor to step changes in the
dopant gas flow and 1s verified by experiments in which flow follows a
more complicated time dependence.
A physicochemical model that describes the incorporation of dopant
atoms into growing silicon epitaxial films 1s introduced
It takes into
account gas-phase transport dynamics in addition to such surface reac-
tions as adsorption, surface migration, site incorporation, and desorp-
tlon, and describes the doping process under both time-independent and
time-dependent operating conditions. It is also used to derive the
transfer function of the doping process.
The behavior of the epltaxial reactor predicted by the model under
different operating conditions is described and compared to experimental
results. This comparison verifies that the doping process is controlled
by thermod ynamics at low growth rates and by kinetics at high rates, which
The temperature and crystallographic-
is in agreement with experiment
orlentation dependences of the doping process indicate that surface reac-
tions are responsible for kinetic control at high growth rates. Exper-
iments also confirm that the time-dependent behavior of the epitaxial
reactor is controlled at low growth rates by the relaxation time of the
slowest step of the doping sequence and, at high rates, by the velocity
at which dopant atoms occupying surface incorporation sites are covered
by subsequently arriving silicon atoms
ChatGPT
The abstract of Rafael Reif's dissertation titled "Doping Process in Silicon Epitaxy: Transfer Function and Physicochemical Model" provides a summary of the key findings and topics covered in the research:
Transfer Function for Doping Process
: The study characterizes the doping process in a horizontal silicon epitaxial reactor using a mathematical expression. This expression connects the dopant gas flow into the reactor over time to the dopant concentration within the epitaxial layer at different depths. The transfer function is determined based on the reactor's response to step changes in the dopant gas flow.
Physicochemical Model for Dopant Incorporation
: The dissertation introduces a physicochemical model that explains how dopant atoms are incorporated into growing silicon epitaxial films. This model accounts for various factors, including gas-phase transport dynamics and surface reactions such as adsorption, surface migration, site incorporation, and desorption. It addresses both time-independent and time-dependent operating conditions and is used to derive the transfer function for the doping process.
Comparison of Model Predictions with Experiments
: The research examines the behavior of the epitaxial reactor as predicted by the physicochemical model under different operating conditions. These predictions are then compared to experimental results. The comparison indicates that the doping process is influenced by thermodynamics at low growth rates and kinetics at high growth rates. Additionally, the temperature and crystallographic orientation are found to impact the doping process, with surface reactions playing a significant role in controlling the process at high growth rates.
Time-Dependent Behavior
: The study shows that at low growth rates, the time-dependent behavior of the epitaxial reactor is governed by the relaxation time of the slowest step in the doping sequence. At high growth rates, it is controlled by the velocity at which dopant atoms, occupying surface incorporation sites, are covered by subsequently arriving silicon atoms.
Overall, this dissertation appears to provide a comprehensive analysis of the doping process in silicon epitaxy, incorporating mathematical modeling and experimental validation to gain insights into the physicochemical aspects of the process under different conditions.

INTRODUCTION
Chemical vapor deposition (CVD) of epitaxial silicon is one of the
most important processes in the fabrication of integrated circuits.
Silicon epitaxial films are widely used in such integrated-circuit tech-
11, DMOS, VMOS, and silicon on sapphire. Chemical
nologies as bipolar,
vapor-deposited silicon is also used in the fabrication of power, infor-
mation, microwave, imaging, and solar-energy-conversion devices.
Many experimental and theoretical studies of the fundamentals of
silicon CVD and the doping of chemical vepor-deposited silicon have fo-
cused on silicon-deposition and dopant-incorporation processes under
time-independent conditions. The principal problem has been to deter-
mine the epitaxial growth rate and doping level resulting from a given
mixture of silicon- and dopant-containing species in the gas phase under
a specific set of experimental conditions. For uniformly doped and
reasonably thick silicon layers, this approach has been satisfactory;
however, it is greatly limited when the silicon films are nonuniformly
doped and/or very thin.
Nonuniformly doped epitaxial layers can be used to fabricate spe-
cialized devices or to optimize device characteristics, and very thin
epitaxial layers are becoming increasingly important with the develop-
ment of very large scale integration (VISI) technology. The results of
the above studies, however, are not adequate for the fabrication of
nonuniformly doped epitaxial films or very thin epitaxial layers. The
time-independent relationship between gas-phase dopant concentration and
epitaxial-layer doping density does not account for transient effects
and, therefore, cannot be applied to grow epitaxial layers with arbitrary
doping profiles unless there is no limitation on layer thickness, which
is usually not the case. On the other hand, the transient associated
with the first few seconds (or minutes) of growth before the doping pro-
cess reaches steady state affects the dopant concentration of very thin
layers, and this effect cannot be assessed, at this point, by the current
state of the art.

The introductory chapter of the dissertation outlines the significance of chemical vapor deposition (CVD) of epitaxial silicon in integrated circuit fabrication. It highlights the widespread use of silicon epitaxial films in various technologies, including bipolar, DMOS, VMOS, and silicon on sapphire devices, as well as power, information, microwave, imaging, and solar-energy-conversion devices.
The chapter discusses that much of the previous research on silicon CVD and doping has primarily focused on time-independent conditions. This research aimed to determine the epitaxial growth rate and doping levels under specific experimental conditions. However, this approach has limitations, especially when dealing with nonuniformly doped epitaxial layers and very thin layers.
Key points from the introduction include:
Importance of CVD
: CVD of silicon is crucial for integrated circuit manufacturing and various other technology applications.
Research Focus
: Previous studies have concentrated on time-independent silicon deposition and doping processes, aiming to determine growth rates and doping levels.
Limitations
: This approach is insufficient for nonuniformly doped epitaxial films and very thin epitaxial layers used in advanced technologies.
Objectives of the Dissertation
:
Deriving a "transfer function" to relate the time-dependent dopant gas flow to the depth-dependent epitaxial dopant concentration. This function can be used to calculate the required dopant gas flow over time to achieve specific epitaxial doping profiles.
Developing a general model for the dopant incorporation process in silicon epitaxy, capable of describing the behavior of the doping process under various time-dependent conditions.
Overall, the dissertation aims to address the limitations of existing research by providing tools and models to better understand and control the silicon CVD and doping processes, especially in situations involving nonuniform doping and very thin epitaxial layers.
Chapter II reviews the fundamentals of silicon CVD and summarizes
the most significant results reported in the area of dopant inclusion
The transient and steady-state conditions of the doping process in
horizontal epitaxial reactor are studied in Chapter III. The transient
response was analyzed so as to obtain an expression for
transfer func-
tion of the doping process, based on the response of the epitaxial system
to both increasing and decreasing step changes in the dopant gas flow
with time; this expression was then verified by experiments in which the
input was a more complicated function of time
The effect of growth rate
on the parameters entering into the transfer function was also investi-
gated.
A physicochemical model that deseribes the incorporation of dopant
atoms into growing silicon epitaxial films is introduced in Chapter IV.
The model considers a sequence of processes occurring in the gas phase
and at the surface. Mass balance of the dopant-containing species is
examined at each important point in the epitaxial system so as to describe
the doping process under both transient and steady-state conditions. As
a result, seven differential equations containing the mathematical de-
scription of the doping process are derived as is an equivalent electrical
circuit represented by an analogous set of equations. This circuit pro-
vides ins: ight into the mechanisms taking part in the doping process and
their relative importance
In Chapter V, the steady-state and transient behavior of the epitax-
ial doping process predicted by the model is described and compared to
experimental results. Conclusions and recommendations follow in Chapter
VI.

Chemical Vapor Deposition (CVD) is a vacuum deposition method used to produce high-quality, and high-performance, solid materials. The process is often used in the semiconductor industry to produce thin films. In typical CVD, the wafer (substrate) is exposed to one or more volatile precursors, which react and/or decompose on the substrate surface to produce the desired deposit. Frequently, volatile by-products are also produced, which are removed by gas flow through the reaction chamber. Microfabrication processes widely use CVD to deposit materials in various forms, including: monocrystalline, polycrystalline, amorphous, and epitaxial. These materials include: silicon (dioxide, carbide, nitride, oxynitride), carbon (fiber, nanofibers, nanotubes, diamond and graphene), fluorocarbons, filaments, tungsten, titanium nitride and various high-�� dielectrics��.

Assembly theory explains and quantifies 
selection and evolution 
Abhishek Sharma1,6, D��niel Cz��gel2,3,6, Michael Lachmann4, Christopher P. Kempes4, 
Sara I. Walker2,5������ & Leroy Cronin1������ 
Scientists have grappled with reconciling biological evolution1,2 with the immutable 
laws of the Universe def i ned by physics. These laws underpin life���s origin, evolution 
and the development of human culture and technology, yet they do not predict the 
emergence of these phenomena. Evolutionary theory explains why some things exist 
and others do not through the lens of selection. To comprehend how diverse, open- 
ended forms can emerge from physics without an inherent design blueprint, a new 
approach to understanding and quantifying selection is necessary3���5. We present 
assembly theory (AT) as a framework that does not alter the laws of physics, but 
redef i nes the concept of an ���object��� on which these laws act. AT conceptualizes objects 
not as point particles, but as entities def i ned by their possible formation histories. 
This allows objects to show evidence of selection, within well-def i ned boundaries of 
individuals or selected units. We introduce a measure called assembly (A), capturing 
the degree of causation required to produce a given ensemble of objects. This approach 
enables us to incorporate novelty generation and selection into the physics of complex 
objects. It explains how these objects can be characterized through a forward dynamical 
process considering their assembly. By reimagining the concept of matter within 
assembly spaces, AT provides a powerful interface between physics and biology. It 
discloses a new aspect of physics emerging at the chemical scale, whereby history and 
causal contingency inf l uence what exists. 
In evolutionary theory, natural selection1 describes why some things 
exist and others do not2. Darwin���s theory of evolution and its modern 
synthesis point out how selection among variants in the past generates 
current functionality3, as well as a forward-looking process4. Neither 
addresses the space in which new phenotypic variants are generated. 
Physics can, in theory, take us from past initial conditions to current 
and future states. However, because physics has no functional view 
of the Universe, it cannot distinguish novel functional features from 
random fluctuations, which means that talking about true novelty is 
impossible in physical reductionism. Thus, the open-ended generation 
of novelty5 does not fit cleanly in the paradigmatic frameworks of either 
biology6 or physics7, and so must resort ultimately to randomness8. 
There have been several efforts to explore the gap between physics and 
evolution9,10. This is because a growing state space over time requires 
the exploration of a large combinatorial set of possibilities11, such as 
in the theory of the adjacent possible12. However, the search generates 
an unsustainable expansion in the number of configurations possi- 
ble in a finite universe in finite time, and does not include selection. 
In addition, this approach has limited predictive power with respect 
to why only some evolutionary innovations happen and not others. 
Other efforts have studied the evolution of rules acting on other rules13; 
however, these models are abstract so it is difficult to see how they can 
describe���and predict���the evolution of physical objects. 
Here, we introduce AT, which addresses these challenges by describing 
how novelty generation and selection can operate in forward-evolving 
processes. The framework of AT allows us to predict features of new 
discoveries during selection, and to quantify how much selection was 
necessary to produce observed objects14,15 without having to prespecify 
individuals or units of selection. In AT, objects are not considered as 
point particles (as in most physics), but are defined by the histories of 
their formation as an intrinsic property, mapped as an assembly space. 
The assembly space is defined as the pathway by which a given object 
can be built from elementary building blocks, using only recursive 
operations. For the shortest path, the assembly space captures the 
minimal memory, in terms of the minimal number of operations neces- 
sary to construct an observed object based on objects that could have 
existed in its past16. One feature of biological assemblies of objects is 
multiple realizability wherein biological evolution can produce func- 
tionally equivalent classes of objects with modular use of units in many 
different contexts. For each unit, the minimal assembly is unique and 
independent of its formation, and therefore accounts for multiple 
realizability in how it could be constructed17,18. 
We introduce the foundations of AT and its implementation to 
quantify the degree of selection and evolution found in a collection of 
objects. Assembly is a function of two quantities: the number of copies 
of the observed objects and the objects��� assembly indices (an assembly

index is the number of steps on a minimal path producing the object). 
Assembly captures the amount of memory necessary to produce a 
selected configuration of historically contingent objects in a manner 
similar to how entropy quantifies the information (or lack thereof) 
necessary to specify the configuration of an ensemble of point particles, 
but assembly differs from entropy because of its explicit dependence 
on the contingency in construction paths intrinsic to complex objects. 
We demonstrate how AT leads to a unified language for describing selec- 
tion and the generation of novelty, and thereby produce a framework 
to unify descriptions of selection across physics and biology. 
Assembly theory 
The concept of an object in AT is simple and rigorously defined. An 
object is finite, is distinguishable, persists over time and is breakable 
such that the set of constraints to construct it from elementary build- 
ing blocks is quantifiable. This definition is, in some sense, opposite 
to standard physics, which treats objects of interest as fundamental 
and unbreakable (for example, the concept of ���atoms��� as indivisible, 
which now applies to elementary particles). In AT, we recognize that 
the smallest unit of matter is typically defined by the limits of obser- 
vational measurements and may not itself be fundamental. A more 
universal concept is to treat objects as anything that can be broken 
and built. This allows us to naturally account for the emergent objects 
produced by evolution and selection as fundamental to the theory. The 
concept of copy number is of foundational importance in defining a 
theory that accounts for selection. The more complex a given object, 
the less likely an identical copy can exist without selection of some 
information-driven mechanism that generates that object. An object 
that exists in multiple copies allows the signatures describing the set 
of constraints that built it to be measured experimentally. For example, 
mass spectrometry can be used to measure assembly for molecules, 
because it can measure how molecules are built by making bonds19.
ChatGPT
The article you've shared appears to discuss a new framework called "assembly theory" (AT) that seeks to explain and quantify selection and evolution in a way that bridges the gap between physics and biology. Here are some key points from the article:
Evolutionary theory, which is based on natural selection, explains why certain things exist and others do not. However, it does not address how new phenotypic variants are generated.
Physics, while capable of describing past and future states based on initial conditions, lacks a functional view of the universe, making it unable to distinguish true novelty from random fluctuations.
The article introduces assembly theory (AT), which redefines the concept of objects in physics. Objects are no longer considered point particles but are defined by their possible formation histories, creating an assembly space.
Assembly space captures the minimal memory required to construct an observed object based on objects that could have existed in its past.
AT provides a framework for quantifying the degree of selection and evolution in a collection of objects. Assembly, a key concept in AT, depends on the number of copies of observed objects and their assembly indices.
Assembly differs from entropy and explicitly considers the contingency in construction paths intrinsic to complex objects.
AT unifies descriptions of selection across physics and biology, offering a common language to describe selection and the generation of novelty.
This new framework aims to bridge the gap between the physics of complex objects and the process of biological evolution, providing a deeper understanding of how novelty and selection operate in forward-evolving processes.

Certainly! Let's delve a bit deeper into the key concepts of assembly theory (AT) and how it relates to the understanding of selection and evolution:
Evolutionary Theory and Physics Gap:
Evolutionary theory, based on natural selection, explains why certain traits or characteristics exist in biological organisms. However, it doesn't address the fundamental question of how new traits or features emerge in the first place. Physics, on the other hand, can describe the evolution of the universe from initial conditions to current and future states but lacks a way to differentiate truly novel functional features from random fluctuations.
Assembly Theory (AT):
AT provides a framework to bridge this gap. It introduces a new way of defining objects in the universe. Instead of treating objects as fundamental, unbreakable entities (as in traditional physics), AT defines objects based on their possible formation histories. Objects are seen as entities that can be constructed from elementary building blocks through recursive operations, and the pathways by which they are built are referred to as assembly spaces.
Assembly Space:
Assembly space is a central concept in AT. It represents the pathway by which a particular object can be constructed from simpler building blocks. It captures the minimal memory or information required to create an observed object based on objects that could have existed in its past. In essence, assembly space quantifies how an object came to be.
Assembly and Selection:
AT introduces the idea of "assembly" as a measure of the degree of selection and evolution present in a collection of objects. It depends on two factors: the number of copies of observed objects and the objects' assembly indices, which represent the number of steps needed to construct an object.
Distinguishing Complex Objects:
AT differs from traditional physics concepts by recognizing that objects can be broken down and built up. This perspective allows AT to account for complex objects that emerge through evolutionary processes, such as those in biology.
Unified Language:
One of the significant advantages of AT is that it provides a unified language for describing selection and the generation of novelty. It offers a way to quantify the role of selection in shaping the characteristics of objects.
Bridging Physics and Biology:
AT serves as an interface between physics and biology. It helps explain how objects with complex features can emerge and be characterized based on their assembly histories. This approach uncovers a new aspect of physics that considers the influence of history and causal contingency on the existence of objects.
In summary, assembly theory (AT) is a conceptual framework that redefines how objects are defined and understood in physics, allowing for the quantification of selection and evolution. It bridges the gap between the processes of physics and biology, offering a new perspective on the emergence of complex features in the universe.
Assembly index and copy number 
To construct an assembly space for an object, one starts from elemen- 
tary building blocks comprising that object and recursively joins these 
to form new structures, whereby, at each recursive step, the objects 
formed are added back to the assembly pool and are available for sub- 
sequent steps (Supplementary Information Sections 1 and 2). AT cap- 
tures symmetry breaking arising along construction paths due to 
recursive use of past objects that can be combined in different ways to 
make new things. For any given object i, we can define its assembly 
space as all recursively assembled pathways that produce it. For each 
object, the most important feature is the assembly index ai, which 
corresponds to the shortest number of steps required to generate the 
object from basic building blocks. This can be quantified as the length 
of the shortest assembly pathway that can generate the object (Fig. 1). 
In chemical systems, molecular assembly theory treats bonds as 
the elementary operations from which molecules are constructed. 
The shortest path to build a given molecule can be found by breaking 
its bonds and then ordering its motifs in order of size, starting from 
atoms and moving to larger motifs by adding bonds in sequence. Given 
a motif generated on the path, the motif remains available for reuse. 
The recursivity allows identifying the shortest construction path with 
parts already built on that path, allowing us to quantify the minimum 
number of constraints, or memory size, to construct the molecule. The 
assembly index can be estimated from any complex discrete object with 
well-defined building blocks, which can be broken apart, as shown in 
Fig. 1. At every step, the size of the object increases by at least one. The 
number of total possible steps, although potentially large, is always 
finite for any finite object and thus the assembly index is computable 
in finite time. For molecules, the assembly index can be determined 
experimentally. 
A hallmark feature of life is how complex objects are generated by 
evolution, of which many are functional. For example, a DNA molecule 
holds genetic information reliably and can be copied easily. By contrast, 
a random string of letters requires much information to describe it, 
but is not normally seen as very complex or useful. Thus far, science 
has not been able to find a measure that quantifies the complexity of 
functionality to distinguish these two cases. Here we overcome this 
inherent problem by pointing out another feature of the evolutionary 
process: the complex and functional objects it generates take many 
steps to make, and selection allows many identical copies of these 
objects. Therefore, an evolutionary process can be identified by the 
production of many identical, or near-identical, multistep objects. 
The assembly index on its own cannot detect selection, but copy num- 
ber combined with the assembly index can. This approach defines a 
new way to measure complexity in terms of the hierarchy of causation 
stemming from selection at different levels. 
Because we do not typically know the full assembly trajectory of 
an object, we instead adopt a conservative alternative. AT finds the 
minimal number of steps to produce the object. We assume that every 
subobject, once available, can be used as often as needed to generate 
the object. A different approach would be to use Kolmogorov complex- 
ity20,21 applied to a given molecule, but this requires starting with a 
graphical representation, and a program to compute the graph of that 
molecule. The Kolmogorov complexity of a string is the shortest pro- 
gram that will output that string for a programming language capable 
of universal computation. This measure cannot be easily computed, 
because checking whether any single program will output the string is 
uncomputable, as it involves, at least, deciding whether the program 
stops. Running this program reflects nothing of the underlying process 
of how the molecule was constructed. Only late in the evolutionary 
process will molecules be produced by anything starting to resemble 
Turing machines, loops, stacks, tapes and so on22. Thus, using universal 
computation to assess molecules adds unrealistic dynamics, making 
the answer uncomputable. The assembly measure that we have pre- 
sented here both uses realistic dynamics for molecules, using bonds as 
building blocks, and is computable for any molecule. The main work 
for detecting evolution and memory is done here by combining the 
assembly index and copy number of the objects. 
The aim of AT is to develop a new understanding of the evolution 
of complex matter that naturally accounts for selection and history 
in terms of what operations are physically possible in constructing 
an object23,24. We will discuss AT as applied to chemical systems as the 
main application in this manuscript because their assembly index has 
been experimentally measured. For molecules, assembly index has a 
clear physical interpretation and has been validated as quantifying 
evidence of selection in its application to the detection of molecular 
signatures of life. However, we anticipate the theory to be sufficiently 
general to apply to a wide variety of other systems including poly- 
mers, cell morphology, graphs, images, computer programs, human 
languages and memes, as well as many others. The challenge in each 
case will be to construct an assembly space that has a clear physical 
meaning in terms of what operations can be caused to occur to make 
the object23 (Fig. 1). 
In AT there are two important features of the context the object 
is found in. First, there must be objects in its environment that can 
constrain the steps to assemble the object and second these objects 
themselves have been selected because they must be retained over 
subsequent steps to physically instantiate the memory needed to build 
the target object. Among the most relatable examples are enzyme 
catalysts in biochemistry, which permit the formation of very unlikely 
molecules in large numbers because the enzymes themselves are also 
selected to exist with many copies. We make no distinction between 
the traditional notion of biological ���individual��� and objects that are 
selected in the environment to quantify the selection necessary to 
produce a given configuration. Thus, our approach naturally accounts for well-known phenomena, such as niche construction, whereby organ- 
isms and environment are co-constructed and co-selected. 
Copy number is important because a single example of a highly 
complex molecule (with a very high assembly index) could poten- 
tially be generated in a series of random events that become increas- 
ingly less likely with increasing assembly index. If we consider a 
forward-building assembly process (see Supplementary Information 
Sections 1 and 2 for details), without a specific target in mind, the num- 
ber of possible objects that could be built at each recursive step grows 
super-exponentially in the absence of any constraints. The likelihood 
of finding and measuring more than one copy of an object therefore 
decreases super-exponentially with increasing assembly index in the 
absence of selection for a specified target. Objects with high assembly 
index, found in abundance, provide evidence of selection because of 
the combinatorially growing space of possible objects at each recursive 
assembly step (Fig. 2). Finding more than one identical copy indicates 
the presence of a non-random process generating the object.

Certainly! Let's explore the concepts of "assembly index" and "copy number" in the context of assembly theory (AT) and how they relate to understanding the complexity and selection of objects:
Assembly Index (ai):
The assembly index is a fundamental concept in AT. It represents the shortest number of steps required to generate a particular object from basic building blocks. In other words, it quantifies the minimal memory or information needed to construct the observed object based on objects that could have existed in its past. The assembly index measures the complexity of how an object is assembled.
Assembly Space:
To construct an assembly space for an object, one starts with elementary building blocks and recursively joins them to create new structures. At each recursive step, the objects formed are added back to the assembly pool and are available for subsequent steps. The assembly space captures the possible pathways for constructing an object, considering various arrangements and combinations of building blocks.
Copy Number:
Copy number refers to the number of identical or near-identical copies of a specific object. It's a measure of how many instances of a particular object exist in a given environment. Copy number is crucial because it provides evidence of selection and the presence of non-random processes. In AT, objects with high assembly indices, found in abundance (high copy number), indicate the influence of selection.
Detecting Selection:
The assembly index alone cannot detect selection, but when combined with copy number, it becomes a powerful tool for identifying the impact of selection. When multiple identical copies of objects with high assembly indices are found, it suggests that these objects are not the result of random events but are instead generated by a non-random, selective process.
Application to Evolution:
AT is particularly relevant for understanding the evolution of complex matter, including biological systems. It accounts for selection and history in terms of the operations physically possible for constructing objects. In biological contexts, objects can include molecules, enzymes, or other complex structures. For example, enzyme catalysts in biochemistry permit the formation of unlikely molecules because enzymes themselves are selected to exist in many copies.
General Applicability:
While AT has been applied primarily to chemical systems with experimentally measured assembly indices, it's considered a general framework that can apply to a wide range of systems, such as polymers, cell morphology, computer programs, human languages, and more. The challenge lies in constructing an assembly space that has a clear physical meaning for each specific system.
In essence, assembly theory offers a way to quantify the complexity of objects, understand the role of selection in their creation, and bridge the gap between physics and biology by providing a framework that accounts for the emergence of complexity in the universe. It emphasizes that complex and functional objects typically require many steps to assemble and that the presence of multiple identical copies of such objects is indicative of selection.

assembly to be compared between ensembles with different numbers 
of objects. 
Assembly quantifies two competing effects, the difficulty of discov- 
ering new objects, but, once discovered, some objects become easier 
to make; this is indicative of how selection was required to discover

and make them. The exponential growth of assembly with depth in 
assembly space, as quantified by assembly index, is derived by consid- 
ering a linearly expanding assembly pool that has objects that combine 
at step aa���+1, whereby an object at the assembly index a combines 
with another object from the assembly pool. Discovering new objects 
at increasing depth in an assembly space gets increasingly harder with 
depth because the space of possibilities expands exponentially. Once 
the pathway for a new object has been discovered, the production of 
an object (copy number greater than 1) gets easier as the copy number 
increases because a high copy number implies that an object can be 
produced readily in a given context. Thus, the hardest innovation is 
making an object for the first time, which is equivalent to its discovery, 
followed by making the first copy of that object, but once an object 
exists in very high abundance it must already be relatively easy to make. 
Hence, assembly (A) scales linearly with copy number for more than 
one object for a fixed cost per object once a process has been discovered 
(see Supplementary Information Section 3 for additional details). 
Increasing assembly (A) results from increasing copy numbers n and 
increasing assembly indices a. If high values of assembly can be shown 
to capture cases in which selection has occurred, it implies that finding 
high assembly index objects in high abundance is a signature of selec- 
tion. In AT, the information required at each step to construct the object 
is ���stored��� within the object (Fig. 2). Each time two objects are combined 
from an assembly pool, the specificity of the combination process 
constitutes selection. As we will show, randomly combining objects 
within the assembly pool at each step does not constitute selection 
because no combinations exist in memory to be used again for building 
the same object. If, instead, certain combinations are preferentially 
used, it implies that a mechanism exists that selects the specific 
operations and, by extension, specific target objects to be generated. 
Later we will quantify the degree of selectivity by parameter �� in the 
growth dynamics, which allows parameterizing selection in an empir- 
ically observable manner by parameterizing reuses of specific sets of 
operations (see Supplementary Information Section 3 for example). 
Assembly as given in equation (1) is determined for identified finite 
and distinguishable objects (with copy number greater than 1) and 
their distinct assembly spaces. However, in real samples, there are 
almost always several different coexisting objects, which will include 
a common history for their formation. Transistors, for example, are 
used across several different technologies, suggesting a common sub- 
space in the assembly spaces of many modern technologies that 
includes transistor-like objects. This common subspace, constituting 
the overlap in the assembly paths of distinct structures, is called a 
co-assembly space. By contrast, a joint assembly space of several objects 
is the combined assembly space required to generate those objects. 
As a potential extension of the assembly equation, to account for the 
joint assembly of objects, we expand the formulation of the assembly 
equation that includes the quantification of shared pathways to con- 
struct objects to determine the assembly (A) of an ensemble with dif- 
ferent objects that
ChatGPT
The assembly equation in the context of assembly theory (AT) is a fundamental concept used to quantify the total amount of selection necessary to produce an ensemble of observed objects. This equation, represented as follows:
A = ��� [ai * ni] / (e^(-1) * NT)
Here's what each component of the equation represents:
A: Assembly, which is the total amount of selection required.
ai: The assembly index of a specific object i, which is the shortest number of steps needed to construct that object from basic building blocks.
ni: The copy number of object i, representing how many identical or near-identical copies of that object exist.
e: Euler's number (a mathematical constant approximately equal to 2.71828).
NT: The total number of objects in the ensemble.
The assembly equation allows us to capture two important effects:
Difficulty of Discovering New Objects:
Objects that require more steps to be constructed (higher assembly indices) are harder to discover. This reflects the difficulty of finding new objects.
Ease of Reproducing Objects:
Once an object has been discovered and exists in multiple copies (higher copy number), it becomes easier to reproduce because the object's construction process is better understood. This part of the equation acknowledges that making more copies of an object becomes less challenging once the initial discovery has been made.
The exponential growth of assembly with depth in assembly space, as quantified by assembly index, highlights that discovering new objects becomes increasingly challenging as the complexity of the objects and their assembly paths increases. However, once these objects are known and exist in abundance, they become easier to reproduce.
The assembly equation helps us identify signatures of selection. Objects with high assembly indices (indicating complexity) and high copy numbers (indicating reproduction ease) are indicative of selection. This means that discovering and producing highly complex objects are the most challenging aspects of innovation, but once achieved, these objects can become widespread.
The assembly equation provides a quantitative framework for understanding how selection and history influence the emergence of complex objects in various systems, including chemistry and biology. It highlights that the specific pathways and operations used in the assembly process are indicative of selection, rather than random combinations. This framework can be applied to analyze diverse systems and quantify the role of selection in their evolution.
The concept of the assembly space allows us to understand how selec- 
tion and historical contingency impose constraints on what can be 
made in the future. By aiming to detect ���selection���, we mean a process 
similar to selection in Darwinian evolution. We do not, however, model 
functional differences that selection might act on. Instead, we account 
only for the specificity of selection���that some objects are more likely 
to be used to make new things and some are less likely. The only func- 
tionality we want to detect or describe is in the memory of the process 
to generate the object, with examples including a metabolic reaction 
network or a genome. This allows the three Lewontin conditions for evo- 
lution to hold25. A key feature of assembly spaces is that they are com- 
binatorial, with objects combined at every step. Combinatorial spaces 
do not play a prominent role in current physics, because their objects 
are modelled as point particles and not as combinatorial objects (with 
limited exceptions). However, combinatorial objects are important in 
chemistry, biology and technology, in which most objects of interest 
(if not all) are hierarchical modular structures. More objects exist in 
assembly space than can be built in finite time with finite resources 
because the space of possibilities grows super-exponentially with the 
assembly index. To tame this explosive growth, in AT historical contin- 
gency is intrinsic with the space built compositionally, where items are 
combined recursively (accounting for hierarchical modularity) and 
this substantially constrains the number of possible objects. It is the 
combination of this compositionality with combinatorics that allows 
us to describe selection (Fig. 3). 
To produce an assembly space, an observed object is broken down 
recursively to generate a set of elementary building units. These units 
can be used to then recursively construct the assembly pathways of the 
original object(s) to build what we call assembly observed, AO. AO cap- 
tures all histories for the construction of the observed object(s) from 
elementary building blocks, consistent with what physical operations 
are possible. Because objects in AT are compositional, they contain 
information about the larger space of possible objects from which 
they were selected. To see how, we first build an assembly space from 
the same building blocks in AO, which include all possible pathways for 
assembling any object composed of the same set elementary building 
blocks as our target object. The space so constructed is the assembly 
universe (AU). 
In the assembly universe, all objects are possible with no rules, yield- 
ing a combinatorial explosion and with double exponential growth in

the number of objects, as is characteristic of exploding state spaces and 
the adjacent possible (see Supplementary Information Section 4 for 
details). Although mathematically well defined, this double exponential 
growth is unphysical because the physical processes place restric- 
tions on what is possible (in the case of molecules, an example is how 
quantum mechanics constrains the numbers of bonds per atom). The 
assembly universe also has no concept of directionality in time, as there 
is no ordering to construction processes. Because everything can exist, 
there is an implication that objects can be constructed independently of 
what has existed in the past and of resource or time constraints, which 
is not what we observe in the real universe. For most systems of interest, 
including in molecular assembly spaces, the number of molecules in 
the assembly universe is orders of magnitude larger than the amount 
of matter available in the cosmologically observable universe. There is 
no way to computationally build and exhaust the entire space, even for 
objects with relatively low assembly indices. For larger objects, such as 
proteins, this can be truly gigantic26. In AT, we do not observe all possible 
objects at a given depth in the assembly space because of selection, 
more reflective of what we see in the real universe. We next show how 
taking account of memory and resource limitation severely restricts the 
size of the space of what can be built, but also allows higher-assembly 
objects to be built before exhausting resources constructing all the 
possible lower-assembly objects. AT can account for selection precisely 
because of the historical contingency in the recursive construction of 
objects along assembly paths. 
Assembly possible (AP) is the space of physically possible objects, 
which can be generated by means of the combinatorial expansion of 
all the known physical rules of object construction and allowing all 
rules to be available at every step to every object. This can be described 
by a dynamical model representing undirected forward dynamics in 
AT. When an object with assembly index a combines with its own his- 
tory, its assembly index increases by one, aa���+1. If the resulting object 
can be made by means of other, shorter path(s), its assembly index will 
be smaller than a+1 or even a. Another assumption behind the dynam- 
ical model of undirected dynamics is a microscopically driven stochas- 
tic rule that uses existing objects uniformly: the probability of 
choosing an object with assembly index a to be combined with any 
other object is proportional to Na, the number of objects with assembly 
index a (see Supplementary Information Section 5 for further details). 
Within assembly possible, assembly contingent (AC) describes the 
possible space of objects where history, and selection on that history, 
matter. Historical contingency is introduced by assuming that only 
the knowledge or constraints built on a given path can be used in the 
future, or with different paths interacting in cases in which selected 
objects that had not interacted previously now interact. We define the 
probability Pa of an object being selected with assembly index (a) as

The concept of the assembly space is a fundamental aspect of assembly theory (AT), and it plays a crucial role in understanding how selection and historical contingency influence what can be made in the future. Here are the key points regarding the assembly space in AT:
Selection Similar to Darwinian Evolution:
AT aims to detect a process of selection that is similar to natural selection in Darwinian evolution. However, it does not focus on modeling functional differences among objects but rather on the specificity of selection. In other words, it considers that some objects are more likely to be used in creating new objects, while others are less likely.
Functionality in Memory:
The primary functionality that AT seeks to detect or describe is in the memory of the process used to generate an object. This can include processes like metabolic reaction networks or genomes. This approach aligns with the three Lewontin conditions for evolution.
Combinatorial Objects:
In AT, assembly spaces are combinatorial. Objects are combined at each step in the assembly process, leading to combinatorial growth in the number of possible objects. This is distinct from how objects are typically modeled in physics, where they are often treated as point particles.
Historical Contingency:
Historical contingency is intrinsic to assembly spaces in AT. Objects are constructed compositionally, with the combination of items happening recursively. This compositionality, along with combinatorics, allows AT to describe selection. The concept of historical contingency reflects that objects are built based on what has existed in the past.
Assembly Space Construction:
To create an assembly space, an observed object is broken down recursively into elementary building units. These units are then used to construct assembly pathways for the original object, considering what physical operations are possible. This process captures all histories for constructing the observed object(s) from elementary building blocks.
Assembly Universe:
The assembly universe includes all possible objects without specific rules or constraints. It represents a space where everything is possible and has no concept of directionality in time.
Assembly Possible and Assembly Contingent:
Assembly Possible (AP) is the space of physically possible objects, considering all known physical rules and allowing all rules to be available at every step. Assembly Contingent (AC) represents the space of objects where history and selection matter. Historical contingency is introduced by limiting the knowledge or constraints built on a given path for future use.
Parameterizing Selection:
The concept of parameter �� allows for the quantification of selection. When ��=1, it implies that all objects assembled in the past are available for reuse, indicating a lack of selection. For ��<1, only a subset of objects is available for reuse, suggesting that selection has occurred.
Growth Dynamics:
AT uses growth dynamics to model how objects are constructed and selected over time. The rate of discovery (kd) and the parameter �� influence the dynamics of object assembly and selection.
Historical Dependence and Selection:
The way objects are chosen and combined reflects historical dependence and selection. Objects with higher assembly indices and copy numbers indicate the presence of selection in the assembly process.
Overall, the assembly space concept in AT provides a framework for understanding how selection and history shape the emergence of complex objects in various domains, including chemistry, biology, and technology. It allows for the quantification of selection and the study of the constraints and possibilities within complex systems.
each run, the assembly space of multiple coexisting polymers, their 
joint assembly space, was approximated by the union of the shortest 
pathways of all observed polymers. An example of joint assembly space 
in an undirected exploration up to 30 steps is shown in Fig. 4a. 
Comparison between the explored joint assembly space in undi- 
rected and directed exploration up to 100 steps is shown in Fig. 4b (see 
Supplementary Information Section 6 for details). To quantify the 
degree of exploration at a given assembly step, we calculated the explo- 
ration ratio, defined by the ratio of observed nodes to total number of 
nodes present in the joint assembly space. Figure 4c shows the explo- 
ration ratio and the mean maximum assembly index observed, approx- 
imated by nlog 
( ) 
2 ,where n is the length of the polymer for the 
undirected and directed exploration processes (both upper and lower 
bounds scale as nlog 
( ) 
2 in leading order). Here, the mean maximum 
assembly index was estimated by calculating the assembly index of the 
mean value of the longest observed polymeric chains over 25 runs. 
Comparing the directed process to the undirected exploration illus- 
trates a central principle: the signal of selection is simply a lower explo- 
ration ratio and higher complexity (as defined by the maximum 
assembly index). The observation of a lower exploration ratio in the 
directed process than in the undirected process is the evidence of the 
presence of selectivity in the combination process between the 
polymers existing in the assembly pool. The process representing sort- 
ing and selecting chains within the assembly pool represents an out- 
come of a physical process leading to selection (see Supplementary 
Information Section 7 for an additional model). 
We conjecture that, the ���more assembled��� an ensemble of objects, 
the more selection is required for it to come into existence. The his- 
torical contingency in AT means that assembly dynamics explores 
higher-assembly objects before exhausting all lower-assembly 
objects, leading to a vast separation in scales separating the number 
of objects that could have been explored versus those that are actually 
constructed following a particular path. For example, proteins built 
both from d and l amino acids and their pathways are part of assembly 
possible, but, within an assembly contingent trajectory, only proteins 
constructed out of l amino acids might be present, because of early 
selection events. This early symmetry breaking along historically con- 
tingent paths is a fundamental property of all assembly processes. It 
introduces an ���assembly time��� that ticks at each object being made: 
assembly physics includes an explicit arrow of time intrinsic to the 
structure of objects. 
Assembly unifies selection with physics 
In the real universe, objects can be built only from parts that already 
exist. The discovery of new objects is therefore historically contingent. 
The rate of discovery of new objects can be defined by the expansion 
rate (kd) from equation (2), introducing a characteristic timescale �� ��� k 
d 
1 d, 
defined as the discovery time. In addition, once a pathway to build an 
object is discovered, the object can be reproduced if the mechanism 
in its environment is selected to build it again. Thus far, we have con- 
sidered discovery dynamics within the assembly spaces and did not 
account for the abundance or copy number of the observed objects 
when discovered. To include copy number in the dynamics of AT, we 
must introduce a second timescale, the rate of production (kp) of a 
specific object, with a characteristic production timescale �� ��� k 
p 
1 p 
(Fig. 5). For simplicity, we assume that selectivity and interaction among 
emerging objects are similar across assembled objects. Defining these 
two distinct timescales for initial discovery of an object and making 
copies of existing objects allows us to determine the regimes in which 
selection is possible (Fig. 5). 
For 1 
�� 
�� 
p 
d ���, whereby objects are discovered quickly but reproduced 
slowly, the expansion of assembly space is too fast under mass con- 
straints to accumulate a high abundance of any distinguishable objects, 
leading to a combinatorial explosion of unique objects with low copy 
numbers. This is consistent with how some unconstrained prebiotic 
synthesis reactions, such as the formose reaction, end up producing 
tar, which is composed of a large number of molecules with too low a 
copy number to be individually identifiable27,28. Selection and evolution 
cannot emerge if new objects are generated on timescales so fast that 
resources are not available for making more copies of those objects 
that already exist. For ���1 
�� �� 
p 
d , objects are reproduced quickly but new 
ones are discovered slowly. Here resources are primarily consumed in 
producing additional copies of objects that already exist. Typically, 
new objects are discovered infrequently. This leads to a high abundance 
of objects produced by extreme constraints, which could limit the 
further growth of assembly space. This illustrates how exploration 
versus exploitation can play out in AT. Significant separation of the two 
timescales of discovery of new objects and (re)production of selected 
objects results in either a combinatorial explosion of objects with low 
copy numbers or, conversely, high copy numbers of low assembly 
objects. In both cases, we will not observe trajectories that grow more 
complex structures. 
The emergence of selection and open-ended evolution in a physical 
system should occur in the transition regime where there is only a small 
separation in the timescales between discovering new objects and 
reproducing ones that are selected, for example the region located

dp 
��� (Fig. 5). To investigate discovery and produc- 
tion dynamics simultaneously, we introduce mass action kinetics in 
the framework of AT. Our aim is to demonstrate how the generation of 
novelty can be described alongside selection in a forward process (thus 
unifying key features of life with physics) and how measuring assembly 
identifies how much selection occurred. We do so by studying phe- 
nomenological models, with the understanding that we are putting 
selection in by hand in our examples to demonstrate foundational 
principles of how assembly quantifies selection. To explore this, we 
consider a forward assembly process whereby the copy numbers of 
emerging objects follow homogeneous kinetics, together with the 
discovery dynamics as given by equation (2). With the discovery of new 
unique objects over time, symmetry breaking in the construction of 
contingent assembly paths will create a network of growing branches 
within the assembly possible. In principle, interactions among existing 
objects and external factors lead to discovery of new objects, expand- 
ing the space of possible future objects. Such events can drastically 
change the copy number distribution of objects at various assembly 
indices, depending on the emerging kinetics in the formation of new 
objects. By combining discovery and production kinetics in a simplified 
formulation, we estimate copy numbers of objects at different assem- 
bly indices and show assembly of the ensemble over time in the forward 
process at different degrees of selection (see Supplementary Informa- 
tion Section 8 for an example). 
The interplay between the two characteristic timescales describes 
how discovery dynamics (��k���1/ 
d d) and forward kinetics (�� k���1/ 
pp), 
together with selection (characterized by the selection parameter ��), 
are essential for driving processes towards creating higher-assembly 
objects. This is characteristic of trajectories within assembly contin- 
gent. Assembly captures key features of how the open-ended growth 
of complexity can occur within a restricted space only by generating 
new objects with increasing assembly indices, while also producing 
them with a high copy number. Selectivity (��<1) together with com- 
parable production timescales (������� 
dp) is essential for the production 
of high assembly ensembles. This suggests that selectivity in an 
unknown physical process can be explained by experimentally detect- 
ing the number of objects, their assembly index and copy number as 
a function of time. Considering molecules as objects and assuming 
that molecules observed using analytical techniques such as mass 
spectrometry implies a high copy number, the discovery rate and the 
selection index (��) can be computed from the temporal data of 
observed molecules at all assembly indices. 
Conclusions 
We have introduced the foundations of AT and how it can be imple- 
mented to quantify the degree of selection found in an ensemble of 
evolved objects, agnostic to the detailed formation mechanisms of 
the objects or knowing a priori which objects are products of units 
of selection. To do so, we introduced a quantity, assembly, built from 
two quantities: the number of copies of an object and its assembly 
index, where the assembly index is the minimal number of recursive 
steps necessary to build the object (its size). We demonstrated how AT 
allows a unified language for describing selection and the generation 
of novelty by showing how it quantifies the discovery and production 
of selected objects in a forward process described by mass action 
kinetics. AT provides a framework to unify descriptions of selection 
across physics and biology, with the potential to build a new physics 
that emerges in chemistry in which history and causal contingency 
through selection must start to play a prominent role in our descrip- 
tions of matter. For molecules, computing the assembly index is 
not explicitly necessary, because the assembly index can be probed 
directly experimentally with high accuracy with spectroscopy tech- 
niques including mass spectroscopy, infrared and nuclear magnetic 
resonance spectroscopy29.

Explain the main points of the theory
1 / 2
ChatGPT
The main points of Assembly Theory (AT) can be summarized as follows:
Definition of Assembly:
AT defines "assembly" as the total amount of selection necessary to produce a set of observed objects. It quantifies assembly using an equation that combines the assembly index (a measure of object complexity) and the copy number (the number of identical copies of an object).
Assembly Index:
The assembly index measures the minimum number of recursive steps required to construct an object from elementary building units. It reflects the complexity or size of the object. Objects with higher assembly indices are more complex.
Copy Number:
Copy number refers to the number of identical copies of an object within a set or ensemble. It is an important factor in quantifying assembly because it indicates how readily an object can be produced in a given context.
Historical Contingency:
AT incorporates the concept of historical contingency. It means that the order and sequence of assembly steps matter. The knowledge or constraints built along a particular assembly path can influence future assembly processes.
Selection:
AT focuses on selection processes, similar to natural selection in biology. Some objects are more likely to be used in assembly processes, while others are less likely. Selection is quantified using a parameter called ��, which characterizes the degree of selectivity.
Exploration vs. Exploitation:
AT explores the interplay between discovering new objects and reproducing existing ones. It considers two characteristic timescales: the discovery time (��d) and the production time (��p). The balance between these timescales determines whether objects are discovered quickly or produced rapidly.
Unified Language:
AT provides a unified language for describing selection and the generation of novelty in various systems, ranging from chemistry to biology. It allows researchers to quantify and compare assembly processes across different domains.
Application:
AT can be applied to analyze the assembly of molecules, polymers, or any objects composed of building units. It also has practical applications in experimental techniques such as mass spectrometry and spectroscopy.
Interdisciplinary Perspective:
AT exemplifies an interdisciplinary approach, bridging concepts from physics, biology, chemistry, and complex systems. It demonstrates how ideas from different fields can be integrated to gain insights into the emergence of complexity.
Overall, Assembly Theory offers a framework to quantify and understand the role of selection, historical contingency, and complexity in the assembly of objects across diverse disciplines. It helps researchers explore the common principles underlying assembly processes in nature and human-made systems.

Detecting alien life is a difficult task because it's hard to find signs of life that could apply to any 
life form. However, complex molecules could be a promising indicator of life and evolution. 
Currently, it's not possible to experimentally determine how complex a molecule is and how that 
correlates with information-theoretic approaches that estimate molecular complexity. Assembly 
Theory has been developed to quantify the complexity of a molecule by finding the shortest path 
to construct the molecule from simple parts, revealing its molecular assembly index (MA). In this 
study, we present an approach to rapidly and exhaustively calculate molecular assembly and 
explore the MA of over 10,000 molecules. We demonstrate that molecular complexity (MA) can be 
experimentally measured using three independent techniques: nuclear magnetic resonance 
(NMR), tandem mass spectrometry (MS), and infrared spectroscopy (IR), and these give consistent 
results with good correlations. By identifying and counting the number of absorbances in IR 
spectra, carbon resonances in NMR, or molecular fragments in tandem MS, the molecular 
assembly index of an unknown molecule can be reliably estimated from experimental data. This 
represents the first experimentally quantifiable approach to defining molecular assembly, a 
reliable metric for complexity, as an intrinsic property of all molecules and can also be performed 
on complex mixtures. This paves the way to use spectroscopic techniques to unambiguously detect 
alien life in the solar system, and beyond on exoplanets.

The exploration of chemical space reveals the striking fact that most molecules greater than molecular 
weight of 300 Da, which are not simple oligomers, are all connected to the existence of life on earth.1 
This is because complex molecules such as natural products2 are too complex to form by chance in any 
detectable abundance, and therefore can only be made by the complex biochemical pathways found in 
biological cells. Currently, the exploration of complex chemical space is done in-silico3,4 and this 
focusses on chemical structure,5 topological features,6 application-specific physicochemical descriptors 
and graph theory and tends to explore medicinal chemical space for drug discovery and development.7 
In this regard pharmaceuticals can also be considered to be biosignatures, or more specifically 
technosignatures, since many are complex and would not have been made without humans using 
technology.8���10 In addition to target selectivity, synthetic accessibility is important to explore the 
complexity of the molecule.11 There are many competing notions of chemical complexity12, which have 
led to different algorithmic methodologies being developed using metrics based on molecular weight, 
counting chiral centres or primarily focusing on substructure properties etc.13���15 However, with the recent 
development in automated chemical synthesis,16 a proxy for complexity is required that is fast to estimate 
molecular complexity directly from the acquired experimental data, instead of performing complete 
structure elucidation. Additionally, for biosignature detection,17 it is important that the complexity metric 
can be estimated directly from the experimental data without any assumptions about the local

This research paper discusses the challenging task of detecting alien life by focusing on the complexity of molecules as potential indicators. The main points and findings of the paper are as follows:
Challenges in Detecting Alien Life
: Detecting alien life is a complex endeavor due to the diversity of possible life forms. One promising approach is to look for complex molecules, as they are unlikely to form by chance and are often associated with biological processes on Earth.
Assembly Theory
: Assembly Theory is introduced as a framework for quantifying the complexity of molecules by finding the shortest path to construct them from simpler components. This approach results in a molecular assembly index (MA) that reflects a molecule's complexity.
Experimental Measurement of Molecular Complexity
: The paper presents a novel approach to experimentally measure molecular complexity (MA) using three independent techniques: nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR), tandem mass spectrometry (MS), and infrared spectroscopy (IR). These techniques are shown to provide consistent results with good correlations.
Estimating MA from Experimental Data
: By analyzing experimental data, such as counting the number of absorbances in IR spectra, carbon resonances in NMR, or molecular fragments in tandem MS, the molecular assembly index of an unknown molecule can be reliably estimated. This approach represents the first experimentally quantifiable method to define molecular assembly as an intrinsic property of molecules.
Implications for Alien Life Detection
: The ability to estimate molecular complexity directly from experimental data opens the possibility of using spectroscopic techniques to detect signs of alien life in our solar system and on exoplanets. Complex molecules, which are unlikely to form abiotically in abundance, could serve as biosignatures.
Complexity in Chemical Space
: The exploration of chemical space reveals that complex molecules with a molecular weight greater than 300 Da are often associated with life on Earth. Such molecules are typically challenging to form without the involvement of biological processes or advanced technology.
Proxy for Complexity
: As automated chemical synthesis advances, there is a need for a complexity metric that can be quickly estimated from experimental data, rather than relying on complete structure elucidation. This proxy for complexity is valuable in various fields, including drug discovery and biosignature detection.

I was thinking that assembly theory sounds like predictive coding and active inference.
ChatGPT
You're correct in noticing some similarities between Assembly Theory and concepts like predictive coding and active inference, especially in the context of understanding complex systems and information processing. Here's a brief comparison:
Assembly Theory
:
Assembly Theory is primarily used in the field of chemistry and biology to quantify the complexity of molecules and their assembly from simpler components.
It focuses on describing how complex structures emerge from the interactions and assembly of individual elements.
Assembly Theory helps understand the history and causal contingency in the formation of objects, introducing an "assembly time" intrinsic to the structure of objects.
Predictive Coding
:
Predictive coding is a framework used in neuroscience and artificial intelligence to explain how the brain processes sensory information.
It posits that the brain continually generates predictions about sensory inputs and compares these predictions to actual sensory data to minimize prediction errors.
Predictive coding involves hierarchical models and the updating of predictions based on incoming sensory information.
Active Inference
:
Active inference is an extension of predictive coding and is used to describe how living organisms, including humans, minimize surprise or prediction errors.
It emphasizes the role of agents (organisms) in actively gathering information and acting on the environment to fulfill predictions.
Active inference integrates perception, action, and learning within a unified framework.
While there are similarities, Assembly Theory tends to focus on complex physical structures (such as molecules), their assembly processes, and quantifying their complexity. In contrast, predictive coding and active inference are more concerned with information processing, perception, and decision-making in biological systems. However, all these concepts share a common thread of understanding complex systems and how they adapt and evolve over time.

A metaphor to explain assembly theory
ChatGPT
Assembly Theory can be likened to building intricate structures with a set of basic LEGO bricks. Each LEGO brick represents a simple component, and the way you assemble them symbolizes the process of constructing complex objects. Just as various LEGO pieces can be combined to create diverse structures, Assembly Theory explores how different components in nature, whether in molecules or ideas, come together to form complex entities through specific assembly pathways. It's like decoding the instructions for building intricate LEGO models, revealing the underlying principles of how complexity emerges from simplicity.
That might be a little too simplified
ChatGPT
Certainly, let's refine the metaphor:
Imagine Assembly Theory as a complex jigsaw puzzle. In this puzzle, you have a vast collection of unique pieces, each representing a fundamental building block or component. The goal is to understand how these pieces fit together to create intricate pictures of the world, much like molecules forming complex structures.
Just as you examine the shape, edges, and patterns on each puzzle piece to determine where it fits, Assembly Theory analyzes the properties and relationships of these fundamental components to unveil the pathways by which complexity emerges. It's like solving the puzzle of existence, piece by piece, to reveal the grand picture of how everything in our universe comes together.
This metaphor captures the idea that Assembly Theory involves deciphering the intricate connections between simple elements to understand the larger, more complex systems they build.
