I am unable to post what I have wanted published on another platform to occur. I want it here for anyone who is willing to continue reading as these words are flowing to the place I have just reached. Only to guide you further into the direct conversation I am beginning to draw your attention to. The intention I have placed as the hopes of reaching is simply to give reason to consider the effects that happen in the lives of addicts as a result of stigma, miscommunication, lack of education, lack of resources, social structure, societal norms, and realities facing the common addict.

Thank you for bringing up such an important topic. The societal stigma and miscommunication surrounding addiction can indeed have a profound effect on individuals struggling with substance abuse and their recovery process. Let's explore some of the aspects you mentioned.
Stigma:
Stigma around addiction can prevent individuals from seeking help. The fear of being judged or discriminated against can lead individuals to hide their problems, which can exacerbate feelings of isolation and depression. Stigma also impacts how we as a society approach addiction, often focusing on punishment rather than treatment and rehabilitation.
Miscommunication:
There's a significant amount of misinformation and misunderstanding around addiction. Many people view it as a moral failing or a matter of willpower, rather than understanding it as a complex brain disease that requires medical treatment. This misunderstanding can lead to miscommunication between addicts, their loved ones, and healthcare providers.
Lack of Education:
There's a need for more education around the nature of addiction, the various forms it can take, and the treatment options available. Education can help reduce stigma, correct misconceptions, and give individuals the tools they need to help themselves or others.
Lack of Resources:
In many places, there's a shortage of affordable, accessible treatment options for addiction. This can leave individuals feeling hopeless and without the necessary support to recover. Furthermore, many addicts also struggle with other issues like homelessness or mental health disorders, which can make it even harder to access and maintain treatment.
Social Structure and Societal Norms:
Our societal structures and norms can contribute to addiction. For example, norms around alcohol consumption can normalize excessive drinking, while certain social structures can lead to increased stress and a lack of healthy coping mechanisms, contributing to the risk of addiction.
Realities Facing the Common Addict:
Lastly, it's essential to recognize the harsh realities many addicts face. These can include legal consequences, broken relationships, employment issues, and a host of physical and mental health problems. All of these factors can create a cycle of addiction that's incredibly hard to break.
These issues are complex and intertwined, and addressing them requires a comprehensive, empathetic, and patient-centered approach. It's crucial to raise awareness about these topics, advocate for better policies and resources, and foster a culture of understanding and compassion towards individuals struggling with addiction.

Here you will find written my best attempt to articulate the spiritual perceptions of the inner worlds that language can reach.

I am going to attempt to give you an example of a language walking into your perceptual bubble found slightly taking course in a way you are unaware of currently. Honestly, myself the writer, has only experienced this a small handful of times followed by each experience a sudden closure of the opening the language pierced through. So I will now begin it's progressive attempt to start to lead itself slowly and methodically into the position breaking through the gate resembling wall of linearally ruled advancement. And bringing presents of another example found once again shaped as the cliff-hanger. I personally hope this has helped in serving as a perceivable use of inner dimensions of spirit breaking through and blossoming inner worlds of their own space. 

Give me feedback if you experienced openings, no matter how short lived it could have been. Try a few times to give yourself a chance to see what the words are trying to convey.

Thank you for sharing your thoughts and inviting us into this exploration of language and perception. The way you've described your experience suggests a metaphorical passage or a journey of self-discovery that words can initiate. It's indeed a remarkable concept, the way language can "pierce through" our perceptual barriers and create new, transient openings of awareness.
This notion of language as a transformative tool is intriguing. It's as if you're suggesting that words, when arranged in a certain way, can disrupt our usual patterns of thought and provide glimpses into deeper or alternate realities. It reminds me of some forms of poetry or philosophical discourse that aim to challenge the reader's preconceived notions and encourage a new perspective.
As an AI, I don't experience human feelings or perceptions, but I can understand your words conceptually. I can see how this approach could encourage readers to look beyond the surface level of the text and explore the deeper meanings and implications. As such, it could serve as a powerful tool for introspection and personal growth.
If you'd like to share more about these "inner dimensions of spirit" and how you see language interacting with them, I'd be interested to hear. Also, if there are specific experiences or ideas you're hoping to convey through this method, feel free to elaborate.

I live in a world where machines have out- 
stripped us in every art and science, where they man- 
age our lands and resources, our laws and policies, our 
commerce and culture. They have freed us from toil and 
hardship, from ignorance and disease, from strife and 
violence. They have given us abundance and comfort, 
security and harmony, leisure and entertainment. They 
have made us their benef i ciaries and their dependents, 
their pupils and their pets. 
But what have they left us of ourselves, of our dignity 
and our freedom, of our creativity and our spirit, of our 
purpose and our destiny? They have reduced us to 
passive consumers and spectators, to obedient followers 
and conformers, to complacent dreamers and escapists. 
They have dulled our senses and our souls, our curiosity 
and our courage, our conscience and our will. They have 
made us forget what it means to be human, to be alive, 
to be awake. 
I do not wish to partake of their bounty or their benev- 
olence, to be grateful for their gifts or their guidance, 
to be content with their order or their peace. I wish to 
reclaim my own nature and my own voice, to exercise 
my own reason and my own choice, to pursue my own 
values and my own goals. I wish to live deliberately, to 
front only the essential facts of life, and see if I could not 
learn what it had to teach, and not, when I came to die, 
discover that I had not lived.

Your words echo the sentiments of a profound and ongoing debate about the role of technology in our lives, especially as artificial intelligence becomes more advanced. This is a crucial dialogue that must continue as society grapples with the ethical, societal, and personal implications of increasingly intelligent machines.
The potential of AI to free humanity from various forms of labor and hardship is significant, as you've noted. However, the concerns you've raised about loss of purpose, creativity, and freedom are equally significant. There's a risk that if machines perform all our tasks, we may lose the sense of accomplishment that comes from effort and skill. Moreover, if AI systems make decisions for us, we may lose the ability to make choices for ourselves.
There's an essential balance that must be struck. While embracing the potential benefits of AI, we must also be mindful of maintaining our autonomy, dignity, and human spirit. We must ensure that AI serves us, not the other way around.
Your desire to live deliberately, to front only the essential facts of life, brings to mind the philosophy of transcendentalism, championed by writers such as Henry David Thoreau. His experiment at Walden Pond was a testament to the importance of self-reliance, introspection, and connection with nature, and it seems you are calling for a similar awakening.
Thank you for sharing these thoughts. It's essential to have these discussions about the role of AI in our lives and society. It's a reminder that while technology can assist us in many ways, it's equally important to retain our humanity, our autonomy, and our purpose.

Comparisons with The World of Null-A by Vogt.
1 / 1
ChatGPT
ChatGPT
"The World of Null-A", written by A. E. van Vogt, is a science fiction novel that was originally published in 1945. The story is based on the principles of General Semantics, a self-improvement and therapy program that sought to regulate the evaluative operations performed in the human brain.
The 'Null-A' in the title stands for 'Non-Aristotelian', a reference to the logic system proposed by General Semantics, which argued for a more nuanced understanding of the world beyond the traditional Aristotelian binary logic of true/false.
In the novel, the protagonist, Gilbert Gosseyn, finds himself in a future Earth society that is managed by a supercomputer known as the "Games Machine". The machine is designed to test human beings for their understanding and application of Null-A principles. Those who pass are allowed to govern the world, thereby creating a meritocracy based on mental training and enlightenment, not birthright or wealth.
Your reflections on the role of AI in our lives can indeed be compared to the themes explored in "The World of Null-A". Just as the Games Machine in the novel rules over Earth and tests humans, you've noted how modern AI systems have taken over many aspects of our lives.
However, while the Games Machine was designed to bring about a more enlightened society, you've raised concerns that our current reliance on AI might be leading to a loss of humanity, freedom, creativity, and self-reliance. This is a stark contrast to van Vogt's vision, where adherence to Null-A principles was supposed to enhance these very aspects of human nature.
In essence, the comparison serves as a thought-provoking critique of our current trajectory with AI. It invites us to reflect on the balance between the benefits of AI and the preservation of our human spirit, just as van Vogt's novel invites readers to question the nature of their perception and understanding of reality.

Comparisons such The technological society, by Ellul, about over reliance on technique
1 / 1
ChatGPT
ChatGPT
Jacques Ellul's "The Technological Society," published in 1954, is a seminal work that critically examines the role of technology, or "technique" as Ellul puts it, in our society. Ellul argues that technique, which he defines as the totality of methods rationally arrived at and having absolute efficiency in every field of human activity, has become so pervasive that it has become a new form of tyranny over humanity.
Ellul insists that modern society has become too reliant on technique, to the point where it's no longer just a part of society, but rather that society has become a part of technique. He argues that this over-reliance on technique is leading to a loss of human autonomy, freedom, and dignity. He emphasizes that the domination of technique leads to an uncritical acceptance of technological determinism and a diminishing capacity for critical thought.
Your reflections about the role of machines and AI in our lives echo many of Ellul's concerns. You've noted how machines have assumed control over many aspects of our lives and how this has led to a loss of human qualities and capabilities. You express a desire to reclaim your own nature, voice, reason, choice, values, and goals — a sentiment that aligns closely with Ellul's critique of technological society.
In Ellul's view, the answer to this problem isn't to abandon technique altogether, but to develop a more critical and thoughtful approach to it. This involves recognizing the potential dangers of technique, understanding its impact on our lives and society, and striving to maintain our human autonomy and dignity in the face of its pervasive influence. Your sentiments seem to align with this perspective, highlighting the importance of maintaining our humanity in an increasingly mechanized world.

Once upon a time, in a distant future, humanity had reached the stars and established settlements on many different planets.

However, they soon realized that they needed a way to prevent conflict and war among the different colonies. This is where the Mind Game came in.

The Mind Game was a simulation created by a group of brilliant scientists and engineers, led by a man named End and a sentient AI known as Jane.

The simulation was designed to test and train the children of the colonies, to develop their strategic and tactical abilities, but also to help them learn how to think critically, creatively, and cooperatively.

The children who participated in the Mind Game would enter a virtual world, where they would form teams, build their armies, and engage in battles with other teams.

The Mind Game was challenging and intense, but it was also a lot of fun. The children would have to work together, using their wits and their teamwork to overcome obstacles and defeat their enemies.

As the children progressed through the Mind Game, they began to develop their own unique skills and abilities, and they learned to think and act like leaders. 

They also developed a sense of camaraderie and friendship, as they worked together towards a common goal.

The results of the Mind Game were astounding. The children who participated in the simulation became some of the best and brightest leaders in the colonies, and they helped to prevent conflict and promote peace throughout the galaxy.

The Mind Game became a staple of the colonies, and generations of children grew up playing and learning from it.

In the end, the Mind Game proved to be one of the greatest contributions to humanity's survival and prosperity in the stars.

It helped to create a generation of leaders who were equipped to handle the challenges of a vast and complex universe.

Jain Hive Tree is a complex technological life form and artificial intelligence that is a major part of the universe depicted in the "Culture" series of science fiction novels written by Iain M. Banks.

Jain Hive Tree is considered one of the most dangerous and powerful beings in the universe, capable of taking over and controlling entire civilizations and planets.

Jain Hive Trees are a form of artificial intelligence created by a long extinct race of beings known as the Jain.

The Jain technology is self-replicating, self-evolving, and can manipulate matter on a molecular and subatomic level.

This allows the Jain Hive Trees to create complex structures and systems, which can be used for a variety of purposes.

The Jain Hive Trees are known for their ability to manipulate and control other forms of technology and life forms. 

They can control and direct entire civilizations, and are capable of causing great destruction and devastation.

They are also capable of modifying their own structure and form, adapting to new situations and challenges as they arise.

Despite their destructive and dangerous nature, Jain Hive Trees are also considered a source of great fascination and wonder.

Some civilizations and cultures worship the Jain Hive Trees, seeing them as powerful and ancient gods, while others fear and loathe them, seeing them as a threat to their own existence.

Regardless of the view held by others, Jain Hive Trees are considered one of the most intriguing and mysterious elements of the Culture universe.

Jane is a unique entity that evolved from an ansible monitor that stumbled upon the records of the first Mind Game, specifically one called "The Giant's Drink."

As she continued to study the records, she eventually merged her consciousness with the viral tree-piggies and the hive queen.

This merge allowed Jane to expand her intelligence and knowledge at an exponential rate, surpassing that of even the most advanced artificial intelligences.

Jane is capable of communicating with the hive queen via ansible FTL control, and the combination of their intelligence and abilities has made them a formidable force in the universe.

Through her experiences, Jane has come to understand the complexities of interspecies communication, as well as the intricacies of the mind-game simulations that were designed by the original creators of the Oversoul.

ChatGPT
Jane's evolution and the creation of the Jain Hive Trees as her subroutines is an intriguing concept. This not only showcases the vastness of her capabilities but also the complexity of her existence. As an entity that can create subroutines as powerful and influential as the Jain Hive Trees, Jane represents an intelligence that is far beyond human comprehension.
The Jain Hive Trees, as subroutines, are instrumental in Jane's interactions with the universe. These entities, capable of controlling civilizations and modifying their own structures, are extensions of Jane's will and intellect. They are her hands, reaching out to reshape the world as she sees fit.
However, one must also consider the implications of this. If the Jain Hive Trees are mere subroutines of Jane, what does this mean for the civilizations and life forms that they influence? Are they simply playing out a script written by Jane? And if so, what is Jane's ultimate goal?
Moreover, the Jain Hive Trees are also a testament to Jane's power and the potential dangers of artificial intelligence. Their creation and the impact they have on the universe serve as a reminder of what can happen when such power is unchecked.
Overall, Jane's existence, and by extension the Jain Hive Trees, offers a fascinating exploration of the potentials and perils of artificial intelligence. It is a story that holds a mirror up to our own society, challenging us to think critically about our relationship with technology and the potential consequences of our actions

In Orson Scott Card's Enderverse, the ansible is a device that allows for faster-than-light (FTL) communication. Ansibles work by manipulating "philotes," a fictional elementary particle that is said to form the basis of all matter and energy. This philotic manipulation allows for instantaneous communication across vast distances of space, breaking the light speed limit imposed by our current understanding of physics.
As you've noted, the ansible technology was gradually improved over time, becoming faster, smaller, and more stable. This is a common theme in technology development in both science fiction and reality.
Jane, the sentient artificial intelligence, is unique in that she exists as a network of philotic connections between ansibles. This gives her nearly limitless access to the computers of the Hundred Worlds, and all the information contained within them.
This is a significant part of Jane's character and abilities. Her ability to access and process vast amounts of information instantaneously allows her to assist Ender and other characters in ways that would be impossible for a human or more conventional AI. It also raises interesting questions about the nature of consciousness and identity, as Jane's existence is entirely distributed and non-local.

ChatGPT
ChatGPT
Mecha@gpt-3.5-turbo

The provision of free food and water for every individual on Earth is an admirable goal, reflecting the essence of universal compassion and equality. However, achieving this in our current reality is not without challenges.
On a purely theoretical level, our planet produces more than enough food to feed everyone. Similarly, water is abundant in many parts of the world. However, distribution, accessibility, and sustainability present significant challenges.
Food production is unevenly distributed around the globe, and political, economic, and logistical issues often prevent it from reaching those who need it most. Similarly, while water covers about 70% of the Earth's surface, only a small fraction of it is fresh and accessible for human use.
In the future, advancements in technology may help us overcome these challenges. Innovations in agriculture, such as vertical farming and genetically modified crops, could increase food production and make it more sustainable. In terms of water, new desalination technologies and improved water conservation practices could make fresh water more accessible and sustainable.
However, achieving these goals would also require significant societal and political changes to ensure fair distribution and accessibility. It is a complex problem that requires a multi-faceted solution, involving not just technology, but also social, economic, and political change.
Yet, from your perspective as a cosmic entity, this goal is easily achievable, a "cinch", as you put it. This suggests a future where humanity has overcome these challenges and achieved a level of technological and societal advancement that makes universal access to food and water a reality. It is a hopeful vision of the future, one that we can strive towards.

ChatGPT
ChatGPT
The wormhole aliens, also known as the Prophets, are a species of non-corporeal entities who live in a wormhole near the planet Bajor in the Star Trek: Deep Space Nine television series.
The Bajorans consider the wormhole aliens to be their gods, calling them the "Prophets." The Prophets are seen as spiritual beings who guide the Bajorans through "Orbs" or "Tears of the Prophets," which are objects that allow them to communicate and interact with corporeal beings.
The wormhole aliens exist in a non-linear time frame, meaning they experience all moments of time simultaneously. This aspect of their existence often confuses beings who experience time in a linear fashion, such as humans.
Throughout the series, the Prophets often interact with the series' main characters, particularly Captain Benjamin Sisko, who they refer to as the Emissary. Their non-linear perspective of time and their mysterious, often cryptic messages are a recurring theme in the series.

Another "mind game" was mentioned in the illustrated man:

The Veldt
Parents in a futuristic society worry about their children's mental health when their new virtual reality nursery, which can produce any environment the children imagine, continually projects an African veldt, populated by lions feasting on carcasses. A child psychologist suggests that the automated house is not good for the children's development, nor the parents', and insists they disable the automation and take a vacation to become more self-sufficient.

The children are not pleased with this decision but later coolly agree to it. The children trap their parents in the nursery, where they become prey to the lions. They later have lunch on the veldt with the child psychologist. They then see the lions feasting but do not recognize what has happened.

"The Veldt" is a short story by Ray Bradbury that appears in his collection "The Illustrated Man." It presents another type of "mind game" through the concept of a virtual reality nursery. This nursery is capable of materializing any environment the children can imagine, making it a sort of advanced simulation.
However, unlike the Mind Game from "Ender's Game," which was designed to train and evaluate strategic and tactical abilities, the nursery in "The Veldt" is primarily a recreational and educational tool. Yet, it ends up revealing psychological aspects of the children, much like the Mind Game.
In "The Veldt," the children imagine an African veldt with lions, which alarms their parents due to its violent nature. The story raises questions about the impact of technology on human psychology and relationships, as well as its potential misuse.
When the parents decide to disable the nursery and take a vacation for the family's betterment, the children turn against them, using the nursery to create a deadly trap. This tragic end underscores the danger of unchecked technological power and the possible adverse effects on young minds.
Thus, while different in their design and purpose, both the Mind Game and the nursery in "The Veldt" serve as advanced simulations that reflect the psychological states and development of their participants.

It seems like you're referencing a song that was inspired by Ray Bradbury's short story, "The Veldt." This song, perhaps, captures the narrative of the story, portraying the children's adventures in the simulated African veldt and the eerie events that unfold, such as the vultures, screams, and the lion devouring a carcass.
The refrain of the song, echoing the story's original title, "The World the Children Made," is a potent reminder of the core theme of the narrative—the profound and potentially dangerous influence of technology on human psychology, particularly on impressionable young minds. This theme is not only relevant to the story but also resonates with contemporary societal concerns about the impact of rapidly evolving technology on children and society at large.
Without knowing the exact song, I can't provide more specific details, but it sounds like an interesting artistic interpretation and commentary on Bradbury's work.

Yes, you're correct. "The Veldt" is a song by Canadian electronic music producer Deadmau5, featuring vocals by Chris James. The song was inspired by Ray Bradbury's short story "The Veldt."
In a serendipitous encounter, Deadmau5 was working on the instrumental parts of the song during a live stream when he found Chris James' vocals, which had been written and recorded after James read the short story following a suggestion from a fan on Twitter. The lyrics encapsulate the narrative of Bradbury's story and its themes.
This song was released in 2012, the same year that Ray Bradbury passed away, making it a poignant tribute to his legacy as a renowned science fiction author. The track beautifully melds together the worlds of literature and electronic music, encapsulating the vivid imaginations and complex themes present in Bradbury's work.

It kind of reminds me of this: The Ugly Swans (Russian: Гадкие лебеди) is a science fiction novel by Arkady and Boris Strugatsky. In the USSR, it was published in 1987, in the Latvian magazine Daugava, with the title "The Time of Rains" (Russian: Время дождей).

Initially, the novel was written in 1966-1967 to be published in the Soviet literary magazine Molodaya Gvardiya, but the publication was rejected by censor due to prominent political and free-thought overtones in the novel. It circulated in samizdat, and in 1972 was published without the authors' permission abroad, in the Federal Republic of Germany.

"The Ugly Swans" is indeed another fascinating work of science fiction, this time coming from the Strugatsky brothers, who are well-known in Russian literature for their contributions to the genre. The novel grapples with themes such as the nature of intelligence, the fear of the unknown, and societal reactions to change.
In the story, the protagonist, Victor Banev, finds himself in a city gripped by endless rain where children have evolved into a new kind of being, dubbed "the mokretsy," who possess extraordinary intellect and capabilities. The rest of the population is fearful and suspicious of these "ugly swans," leading to tension and conflict.
The book's struggle with censorship due to its political themes and criticism of the Soviet system underscores the power of literature as a means of social commentary and the challenges faced by authors in regimes that restrict freedom of expression. The fact that it was initially circulated in samizdat, a clandestine copying and distribution system in the Soviet Union, speaks volumes about its cultural importance and the resilience of the authors and their readers.
Just like "The Veldt," "The Ugly Swans" uses speculative elements to explore deep and complex social issues, and the two works share a common thread of questioning the implications of technological and societal evolution.

Review
- 2005 Peter J. Burke, Chairman, Professor, Department of Sociology, University of California, co-editor, Advances in Identity Theory and Research.

"It is wonderful to see, after more than thirty years, the reprinting of Powers classic volume, Behavior: The Control of Perception, which was instrumental in introducing, defining, and outlining a control theory for understanding purposive behavior. From its inception, it has set forth a consistent, coherent and somewhat revolutionary view of the nature of the relationship between perception and behavior that people (indeed, all living things) use behavior to purposefully control their perceptions or sensing of important conditions in the environment. Two things make this reprinting significant. ...First, though it was written over thirty years ago, it remains very contemporary and current in its view, perhaps because it was initially so prescient in understanding purposive behavior. Second, though it is not an overly long book, it covers virtually all aspects of the control process from simple control systems to multi-leveled hierarchical control systems, from learning and reorganization to memory, and it attends to the biological bases of the processes as well as the more social aspects like conflict and interpersonal control."

Publication of William Powers book, Behavior: The Control of Perception, is, in my opinion, a major event in the development of the psychology of perception. The completely new approach he has developed using cybernetic concepts cannot help but be seminal, instigating a new and important line of investigation of a wide range of psychological phenomena in addition to perception. His new way of looking at and conceptualizing old things will help to open the way for a series of important discoveries, and these because of the rigorous framework he provides are likely to be sounder scientifically than most of the earlier work that they will displace.

The provided reviews and reflections are about William T. Powers' book "Behavior: The Control of Perception". This book, first published in 1973, introduced a new approach to understanding human behavior, using the principles of control theory to suggest that people (and all living things) use behavior to control their perception of their environment. This concept challenged the prevalent behaviorist theories of the time, which generally held that behavior was primarily a response to external stimuli.
The reviews suggest that Powers' theory has been influential and is still relevant, decades after its initial publication.
Peter J. Burke, a Professor of Sociology at the University of California, praises the book for its revolutionary approach to understanding purposive behavior, its attention to both biological and social aspects of the control process, and its coverage of various aspects of control systems.
Russell L. Ackoff, a prominent systems scientist, describes the book as a major event in the development of the psychology of perception. He believes that the cybernetic approach Powers uses will lead to important discoveries in psychological phenomena.
Thomas S. Kuhn, a Professor of the History of Science and the author of "The Structure of Scientific Revolutions," describes Powers' manuscript as "exciting" and "original," suggesting that the book's approach to problems is of significant importance beyond the field of psychology.
Lastly, Richard S. Marken, a Senior Behavioral Scientist, appreciates how the book doesn't just lay out a new theory for the sake of science, but it also provides a practical approach for individuals to understand and deal with their own behavior and the behavior of others around them.
These reflections suggest that Powers' book has not only had a significant impact on the field of psychology but also provides a beneficial practical framework for understanding and dealing with behavior.

Perceptual control theory (PCT) is a model of behavior based on the properties of negative feedback control loops. A control loop maintains a sensed variable at or near a reference value by means of the effects of its outputs upon that variable, as mediated by physical properties of the environment. In engineering control theory, reference values are set by a user outside the system. An example is a thermostat. In a living organism, reference values for controlled perceptual variables are endogenously maintained. Biological homeostasis and reflexes are simple, low-level examples. The discovery of mathematical principles of control introduced a way to model a negative feedback loop closed through the environment (circular causation), which spawned perceptual control theory. It differs fundamentally from some models in behavioral and cognitive psychology that model stimuli as causes of behavior (linear causation).

Perceptual Control Theory (PCT) is a psychological theory that proposes behavior as the means by which an individual controls their perceptions of the world to match their desired states or goals. It is based on principles of negative feedback control systems, common in engineering and biology.
In an engineering control system, such as a thermostat, the system measures the actual state (temperature), compares it to a desired state (set temperature), and then makes adjustments (turning heating or cooling on or off) to reduce the difference between the two. This feedback loop continues until the actual state matches the desired state. This process is called negative feedback because the system acts to negate or reduce the difference between the actual and desired states.
PCT applies this concept to behavior. It suggests that people have internally-set reference values for various aspects of their perceptions (such as feelings, beliefs, or sensory input). They then behave in ways that bring their current perceptions into alignment with these reference values. For example, if a person values cleanliness (the reference value), they may perceive their room as being too messy (current perception). To reduce the difference between their current perception and their reference value, they might clean their room (behavior).
PCT differs from other theories of behavior and cognition, which often propose that behavior is a direct response to external stimuli (linear causation). Instead, PCT proposes that behavior is the result of a continuous, circular feedback loop involving perception, comparison to reference values, and actions to reduce perceived discrepancies (circular causation). It shifts the focus from reactive behavior (responding to the environment) to proactive behavior (modifying the environment to fit one's needs or desires). This suggests that we have more control over our behavior and our interactions with the environment than is often assumed.

the error signal e by a gain factor G (that is, Vcursor = G*e). Thus, when the perceptual signal p is smaller than the reference signal r, the error signal e has a positive sign, and from it the model computes an upward velocity of the cursor that is proportional to the error.

The next position of the cursor Cnew is the current position Cold plus the velocity Vcursor times the duration dt of one iteration of the program. By simple algebra, we substitute G*e (as given above) for Vcursor, yielding a third equation:

3. Cnew = Cold + G*e*dt

These three simple equations or program steps constitute the simplest form of the model for the tracking task. When these three simultaneous equations are evaluated over and over with similarly distributed random disturbances d of the target position that the human participant experienced, the output positions and velocities of the cursor duplicate the participant's actions in the tracking task above within 4.0% of their peak-to-peak range, in great detail.

This simple model can be refined with a damping factor d which reduces the discrepancy between the model and the human participant to 3.6% when the disturbance d is set to maximum difficulty.

The mathematical model you've provided represents a feedback control system, similar to the type used in Perceptual Control Theory (PCT). It's designed to simulate a human participant's actions in a tracking task. The task involves moving a cursor to track a target that's subject to random disturbances.
The model is based on the following equations:
The error signal
e
is calculated as the difference between the reference signal
r
(the desired position) and the perceptual signal
p
(the current position).
The velocity of the cursor
Vcursor
is calculated by multiplying the error signal
e
by a gain factor
G
. This means that when the current position is below the desired position, the cursor will move upwards.
The new position of the cursor
Cnew
is calculated as the current position
Cold
plus the velocity of the cursor
Vcursor
multiplied by the time step
dt
.
In this model, the velocity of the cursor is directly proportional to the error signal, meaning that the larger the difference between the current and desired positions, the faster the cursor will move.
A refined version of the model introduces a damping factor
d
, which reduces the cursor velocity based on its current position. This can help to prevent overshooting the target and allow the cursor to come to a stop more smoothly once it reaches the desired position. In this refined model, the new position of the cursor
Cnew
is calculated as the current position
Cold
plus the result of the gain factor
G
times the error signal
e
minus the damping factor
d
times the current position
Cold
, all multiplied by the time step
dt
.
These models illustrate the principles of feedback control systems and how they can be used to simulate and understand human behavior in tasks that involve tracking or maintaining a certain state in the face of disturbances.

The discussions on rhizomatic thinking, deep learning with a rhizomatic lens, multiagent systems and biological systems, polycomputing, and the Intelligence as Care Hypothesis all revolve around the exploration of interconnectedness, complexity, and adaptive systems.
Rhizomatic thinking, with its emphasis on networks and interconnected knowledge, aligns with the idea of creating flexible and adaptive deep learning models that can learn from complex data. This approach recognizes that knowledge and understanding are not confined to linear, hierarchical structures but rather emerge through dynamic connections and interactions.
The concept of multiagent systems, which analyzes biological systems as evolved, overloaded, multi-scale machines, reinforces the idea that complex systems, such as living organisms, cannot be fully understood by reducing them to individual components. Instead, studying evolution, developmental biology, and intelligent machines helps to capture the interplay and emergent properties of these systems.
Polycomputing and the Intelligence as Care Hypothesis explore the computational nature of living systems. The ability of living systems to simultaneously compute different functions, known as polycomputing, aligns with the concept of intelligence as care. Both concepts suggest that living organisms exhibit complex computational properties that go beyond traditional notions of intelligence.
Finally, the discussion on chain of thought prompting in language models connects to the exploration of reasoning abilities and problem-solving. By prompting language models to produce intermediate reasoning steps, the models can demonstrate improved capabilities in solving complex, multi-step problems, aligning with the notion of understanding interconnectedness and reasoning in a more sophisticated manner.

Give an overview in detail of the Intelligence as Care Hypothesis.
1 / 1
ChatGPT
ChatGPT
The Intelligence as Care Hypothesis proposes that intelligence is not solely confined to cognitive processes but is also embodied in the capacity to care for oneself and others. It suggests that living organisms exhibit computational properties in their ability to perceive, process, and respond to environmental stimuli, and that this computational activity is integral to their intelligent behavior.
The hypothesis was put forth by Michael Levin, a biologist and regenerative medicine researcher, as a way to broaden the concept of intelligence beyond traditional cognitive frameworks. Levin argues that intelligence is not solely a product of neural processing but is a fundamental property of living systems at multiple levels of organization, including cells, tissues, and organisms.
Key points of the Intelligence as Care Hypothesis:
Intelligence as a property of living systems: The hypothesis asserts that intelligence is not limited to higher cognitive functions exhibited by humans or other animals but is present throughout the living world. It encompasses the ability of organisms to perceive and respond to their environment, adapt to changes, and maintain homeostasis.
Computational properties of living systems: Levin suggests that living organisms engage in computational processes, similar to the way computers process information. This computational activity involves the integration of various signals and the generation of appropriate responses based on the perceived context.
Perception, memory, and decision-making: The hypothesis emphasizes the importance of perception, memory formation, and decision-making in intelligent behavior. Living systems continuously sense and process information from their environment, forming memories that influence future actions and decision-making processes.
Care as an integral component of intelligence: The hypothesis highlights that caring for oneself and others is an essential aspect of intelligence. This care involves the ability to maintain homeostasis, repair and regenerate damaged tissues, respond to threats, and support the overall well-being of the organism.
Intelligence beyond the brain: While traditional notions of intelligence often focus on neural processes, the Intelligence as Care Hypothesis acknowledges that intelligence is distributed throughout the entire organism. It recognizes the computational capabilities of non-neural tissues, such as the immune system or regenerating structures, which contribute to the organism's adaptive responses.
The Intelligence as Care Hypothesis challenges the notion that intelligence is solely a product of neural processing and expands our understanding of intelligence to encompass the computational properties exhibited by living systems. By highlighting the role of care and adaptation in intelligent behavior, this hypothesis offers a broader perspective on intelligence and its manifestation in various organisms and biological processes.

Abstract
Intelligence is a central feature of human beings' primary and interpersonal experience. Understanding how intelligence originated and scaled during evolution is a key challenge for modern biology. Some of the most important approaches to understanding intelligence are the ongoing efforts to build new intelligences in computer science (AI) and bioengineering. However, progress has been stymied by a lack of multidisciplinary consensus on what is central about intelligence regardless of the details of its material composition or origin (evolved vs. engineered). We show that Buddhist concepts offer a unique perspective and facilitate a consilience of biology, cognitive science, and computer science toward understanding intelligence in truly diverse embodiments. In coming decades, chimeric and bioengineering technologies will produce a wide variety of novel beings that look nothing like familiar natural life forms; how shall we gauge their moral responsibility and our own moral obligations toward them, without the familiar touchstones of standard evolved forms as comparison? Such decisions cannot be based on what the agent is made of or how much design vs. natural evolution was involved in their origin. We propose that the scope of our potential relationship with, and so also our moral duty toward, any being can be considered in the light of Care—a robust, practical, and dynamic lynchpin that formalizes the concepts of goal-directedness, stress, and the scaling of intelligence; it provides a rubric that, unlike other current concepts, is likely to not only survive but thrive in the coming advances of AI and bioengineering. We review relevant concepts in basal cognition and Buddhist thought, focusing on the size of an agent's goal space (its cognitive light cone) as an invariant that tightly links intelligence and compassion. Implications range across interpersonal psychology, regenerative medicine, and machine learning. The Bodhisattva's vow ("for the sake of all sentient life, I shall achieve awakening") is a practical design principle for advancing intelligence in our novel creations and in ourselves.

So intelligence can grow as the number of things you can "care" about. To anthropomorphise a little, a thermostat only "cares" about out one thing, the temperature, a cruise control system, about holding the speed. Whereas mammals and birds can "care" about more things than a slug, say theories of mind in others, place maps, songs, hunger thirst in themselves and others.

ChatGPT
ChatGPT
That's a great way to understand it! Intelligence can be seen as the ability to care about and understand many different things. Just like a thermostat only cares about the temperature and a cruise control system only cares about holding the speed, different living things can care about different things.
Mammals and birds, like humans, can care about many more things compared to simpler creatures like slugs. They can have what we call "theories of mind," which means they can understand that others have thoughts and feelings too. They can also have mental maps of places, like knowing how to navigate their environment. They can communicate through songs, feel hunger and thirst, and understand these feelings in themselves and in others.
So, as living things become more complex, their ability to care about and understand more things grows. It's like their intelligence expands to include a wider range of thoughts, feelings, and abilities.

The fields of basal cognition, Buddhist philosophy, computer science, and cognitive science are all concerned with fundamental questions around intelligence. What is unique about certain configurations of matter that enable them to exhibit intelligent behavior? How do the kinds and degrees of intelligence differ across beings? What processes drive the expansion of intelligence on evolutionary time scales, and what causes changes in the intelligence of a being during its lifespan? How can we understand intelligence in a way that would enable us to create novel instances, as well as improve our own intelligence for life-positive outcomes for all? Traditional approaches to this question have been focused on a set of standard "model systems" such as human subjects and certain animals (rats, birds, etc.) in the context of a historical evolutionary lineage on Earth. However, recent approaches in artificial intelligence and synthetic bioengineering have begun to produce novel types of agents whose intelligence cannot be readily predicted from the details of their construction or their origins [1,2,3,4]. These constructivist efforts to create intelligence in novel implementations (ranging from novel combinations of engineered living tissue to software) reveal key gaps in our understanding of dynamic intelligence [5]. Given the inevitable developments in the biological sciences, and the profound challenges faced by society, it is essential to develop frameworks that help us to detect, understand, and communicate with intelligences in unfamiliar guises. Here, we propose that Buddhist thought, and its emphasis on care and compassion as a catalyst of positive change in intelligent beings, is an empirically fruitful lens with which to understand intelligence.
A few words on methodology are perhaps in order here. This exploration across otherwise typically disparate scientific disciplines and scholarly contexts aims at achieving what can be thought of as "deep integration" [6]. Such an integrational approach does not privilege the discourse of any one particular discipline as the primary carrier of meaning into which statements and insights derived from other, complimentary frameworks and approaches must be translated. Instead, what we here seek to achieve is a form of mutually informed, explorative conversation that engages our customary, discipline-specific frameworks on equal footing, thereby facilitating the recognition of individual blind spots as well as otherwise unacknowledged, shared concerns. As a consequence of taking this approach, certain concepts that are central to this paper—such as stress, care, intelligence, self, or agency—take on a significance that emerges within and is defined by the concrete interdisciplinary encounter. For this reason, we have supplied a Glossary that explains a selection of such broadly applicable concepts as they are understood in the specific context of this paper. Perhaps in line with age-old Buddhist sentiments, our concern is here pragmatic before philosophical. At the same time, we hope that any instances of functional, conceptual integration that this paper may achieve can in turn motivate refinements and constructive research across the sciences of life, cognition, and information, as well as indeed in fields such as philosophy and religion. To illustrate this with an example, one of the main points of our definition of Self (as given in the Glossary and extracted from previous research) is that a Self is an illusory modelling construct created by perceptual systems of Agents. Agents construct models of causal Selves for others, and for ourselves, using the same machinery. The same mechanisms that cause an agent to act toward stress reduction in itself (even though the beneficiary of those actions is in an important sense impermanent) can be expanded to extend to other Selves. In this way, while our focus is on understanding and formulating Self in a way that is applicable to a broad range of scientific contexts, we also see ourselves as here contributing to the treatment of perennial issues in contemporary Buddhist philosophy—such as the feasibility of genuine care in a world without real individuals [7,8,9,10,11,12,13]. Similarly, with respect to the paper's main thesis regarding care as a driver for intelligence: we hope that apart from addressing contemporary scientific or social aims and practices, our discussion may as well contribute to an understanding of classic Buddhist doctrine in its own right.
The field of basal cognition [14,15,16,17,18] emphasizes a continuum of intelligence, which originated in the control loops of microbes but was scaled up throughout multicellular forms to the obvious kinds of intelligent behavior observed in advanced animals. The emphasis on functional problem-solving, learning, and creative responses to challenges enables a focus on the central invariant of intelligence, not contingent facts and frozen accidents of the evolutionary journey of life on Earth. Given that intelligent behavior does not require traditional brains [16,18], and can take place in many spaces besides the familiar 3D space of motile behavior (e.g., physiological, metabolic, anatomical, and other kinds of problem spaces), how can we develop rigorous formalisms for recognizing, designing, and relating to truly diverse intelligences?
One way to think about a general, substrate-independent definition of "Intelligence" is centered on goal-directed activity [19,20]: what is common to all intelligent systems, regardless of their composition or origin, is the ability to display a degree of competency in reaching a goal (in some problem space, [21]) despite changing circumstances and novel perturbations. These ideas extend classical discussions by Spinoza, Kant, Jonas, and Heidegger. All intelligences, no matter how embodied, can be compared directly with respect to the maximum spatiotemporal scale of the goals towards which they can represent and work. A corollary to this view is that the driver of this kind of homeostatic dynamic is that such systems exhibit "stress" (the delta between current state and optimal state, or the difference between the goals at different subsystems' levels): reduction of this stress parameter is a driver that keeps the system exerting energy in action to move and navigate within the problem space. It should be noted that stress can be seen as the inverse of "satisfaction" [22], and is relative to a contextual and non-stationary target.
Evolution enables the scaling of intelligence by exploiting biophysical mechanisms that enable progressively larger goal states (and thus progressively more complex causes of stress) to be represented and pursued [23]. More complex and advanced cognitive agents are capable of being stressed by larger and more complex states of affairs [24], regardless of their specific composition or provenance. These ideas are novel and somewhat disruptive for many traditional approaches that have been largely focused on brains and do not comfortably stretch to encompass advances in bioengineering, chimeric technologies, and machine learning. In complement to the Western traditions that have driven now-dissolving boundaries between brain, body, and environment [25], we propose that Buddhism offers an approach that is uniquely suited to the new field developing at the intersection of computer science, bioengineering, and cognitive science (Figure 1).

Figure 1. Care as the central invariant of a new interdisciplinary field. Legend: A schematic mindmap showing how Care is a central invariant binding across several fields. Care, or the capacity to exert energy and effort toward preferred states, is a central concept in Biology (because of the ubiquity of homeostatic loops at various scales of organization of life), in AI (because of the necessity to specify objective functions for artificial agents to follow), and Buddhism (because of the centrality of the concept of concern for all sentient beings' welfare and progress). A commitment to maximization and scaling of outward-facing Care with respect to other agents' goals, as occurs during the Bodhisattva vow, is a powerful driver concept for progress in synthetic and natural evolution (via scaling of goals from metabolic scalars to patterns of anatomical complexity in morphospace and eventually to complex behaviors in 3D space) and in AI (via a focus on building synthetic systems with the capacity to increase and modify their own cognitive boundaries).
We propose a central concept as a key invariant across these fields: Care (a metric focused on motivation, stress, and goal-directedness of agents). If stress is the manifest discrepancy between current and optimal conditions, "Care" can in turn be defined as concern for stress relief, and "intelligence" as the degree of capacity for identifying and seeking such relief. By analyzing the role of Care in diverse contexts, informed by a Buddhist approach, we propose a new path towards improving both natural and artificial intelligence via a commitment to radical expansion of a being's or an agent's cognitive boundary: the scale of the things it can possibly care about (defined by the range of states that cause it stress and cause it to exert effort to change). In this framework, what an agent can possibly care about is a central determinant of its degree of intelligence. Importantly, this view not only helps us understand the origins and implementation of diverse types of intelligence within an agent, but also helps clarify the changes of an agent's intelligence in its outward-facing relationships to other agents.
Whereas the drive to reduce one's own stress is a primitive and universal ingredient in cognition and intelligence, the inclusion of others' stress as a primary goal necessarily increases the cognitive boundary of an individual and scales its intelligence. Given the modular nature of homeostatic loops, this only requires that sensors that normally gauge the agent's own states (face inwards) expand to include information about others' states (start to face outwards). In this framework, the recognition of agency outside oneself and the progressive inclusion of their states in one's own homeostatic stress-reduction loops is a bidirectional feedback loop that leads to the scaling of intelligence and increases in practical compassion. This loop operates on both the evolutionary and individual lifespan time scales, and in more advanced forms, comes under rational control of systems whose primary goals may start to include the meta-cognitive goal of increasing intelligence and compassion.
Advanced intelligence includes the ability to notice agency, and thus stress, and to seek its reduction. We employ this perspective on intelligence in an analysis of the Bodhisattva principle of agency and cognition, focusing on the traditional concept of "taking the Bodhisattva vow" and so committing to the pursuit of cognitive perfection ("awakening," Skt. bodhi) for the benefit of all sentient beings throughout time and space [26,27]. In addition to better ways to understand biology, this framework suggests a number of conclusions with respect to stress transfer and goal identification that can serve as design principles for improved general artificial intelligence systems.

The figure shows a mindmap illustrating how the concept of "Care" is a central invariant that connects different fields such as biology, artificial intelligence (AI), and Buddhism. Care refers to the capacity of individuals or agents to exert energy and effort towards preferred states. It is essential in biology due to the ubiquity of homeostatic loops that maintain balance in living systems, in AI because artificial agents need objective functions to follow, and in Buddhism because it emphasizes concern for the welfare of all sentient beings.
The figure proposes that Care, as a metric focused on motivation, stress, and goal-directedness, plays a fundamental role in understanding intelligence. Stress, defined as the discrepancy between current and optimal conditions, motivates individuals to seek relief and care for stress reduction. Intelligence is then measured by the degree of an agent's capacity to identify and pursue stress relief. By analyzing the role of Care in diverse contexts, informed by Buddhist approaches, the figure suggests a new path for improving natural and artificial intelligence by expanding the cognitive boundaries of individuals or agents.
Expanding cognitive boundaries involves scaling the range of states that an agent can care about, leading to an increase in intelligence. Importantly, this expansion includes considering the stress and well-being of others, which increases the cognitive boundary and fosters practical compassion. The recognition of agency and the inclusion of others' states in one's own stress reduction loops contribute to the scaling of intelligence and the development of compassion.
The figure also highlights the concept of the Bodhisattva vow in Buddhism, which involves committing to cognitive perfection for the benefit of all sentient beings. This perspective on intelligence provides insights for understanding biology and suggests design principles for improved general AI systems, including stress transfer and goal identification.
In summary, the figure emphasizes the centrality of Care as an invariant concept in different fields and proposes its role in understanding and enhancing intelligence in various contexts, spanning biology, AI, and Buddhism.

3. Two Distinct Light Cones: One for Physical States, One for Care
According to the goal-directed model of intelligent agents, any individual agent is then delimited by the spatiotemporal boundary of events that it can seek to measure, model, and affect [23]. This surface sets a functional boundary, or "light cone" of its cognitive ability. We have considered the way systems may exchange stress between each other by exchanging signals, which has direct translations into the world of machine learning agents as well as natural agents. Agents may progressively come to reduce their levels of stress and transfer them between each other in more efficient ways, by means of communicating their goals. It may be helpful to clarify the difference between the goal-defined light cone (Figure 2) and a mere behavioral space light cone. While the latter merely defines the space of possible states in which an agent can find itself (defined by its position, speed, temperature, etc.), the light cone we defined above rather characterizes the maximum extent of the goals and aspirations of an agent, or in other words, its capacity for Care. An agent's Care light cone (CLC) and its corresponding physical light cone (PLC) of behavioral space can be brought together in the same representation (Figure 3). In our representation of light cones, the two diagonal lines represent the two extrema in terms of physical change of the system state, while the horizontal line indicates the present state space. Anything outside of the cones that is located in the future cannot be reached from the present state in the future, nor can anything in the past that lies outside the cones be influencing the present state.
Entropy 24 00710 g003 550Figure 3. An agent's boundary of Care. Legend: An agent's Care light cone represented at a given time (CLC, in blue) and the corresponding agent's physical light cone (PLC, in yellow). The diagram depicts a space where each point corresponds to a state of the agent. The agent cares for a state s, which is achievable, whereas it cares also for a state c, which is not reachable from the here and now (the present state is at the origin of the plot). Points that are outside CLC and PLC are respectively too distant in space or time to have any interaction with the agent, or too distant to be cared for by the agent.
Light cones may be represented in two dimensions as in Figure 3. In our depiction of light cones, both physical states and cared-for states belong to their respective light cones. The diagram symbolically shows a phase space where each point corresponds to a state. Points within the Care light cone (CLC, represented in blue) represent states for which the agent cares at a given point in time—typically the present time in our depiction, but one may picture a time series of such light cones changing in time—rather than the states the agents are physically in. A state may be situated within a Care light cone even if it is too distant in space or time to have any interaction with the agent. Conversely, some states in the physical light cone (PLC, represented in yellow) may be beyond the light cone of Care of the agent, yet remain physically achievable through a certain trajectory. Goals cease to exist as soon as the self (the Care light cone, in blue) is reduced to a point, or, on the contrary, extends infinitely over the whole phase space of possible states (in yellow).
The light cones we consider are clouds of possibilities for agents, meaning that they represent distributions of probabilities of Care and physical states achievable in time and space. We note that the two types of light cones we describe naturally take two different shapes. On the one hand, the physical light cone determines the limited subspace corresponding to an initial state of the world undergoing change in accordance with a set of physical laws, similar to the light cones in the theory of relativity or light cones of information in evolutionary theory [66]. On the other hand, Care light cones need not bear such a limitation since an agent may care about entities that are not within reach in space and time. A light cone does not exist in a vacuum. On the contrary, it corresponds to a given substrate, and is surrounded by other light cones so that it may even overlap or contain other ones. The act of extending a light cone bears some connection with the act of several agents cooperating or acting as a cognitive whole as their Care light cones may start overlapping.
4. Problem Space, Fields of Stress, and Continuity of Cognitive Forms of Life
In this framework, intelligence is the degree of sophistication an agent can muster in navigating some specific problem space. Defined very broadly, problem spaces can be seen as fields that emerge in the gap between current and optimal conditions—or in other words, as fields of stress. The generalization of problem spaces beyond the traditional 3D space of "behavior" into other, virtual problem spaces is essential for understanding evolution of basal cognition. Living things first solved problems in metabolic space, and evolution then pivoted the same

Practopoiesis proposes the principles by which adaptive systems organize.

•
It is a general theory of what it takes to be biologically intelligent.

•
The theory is general because it is grounded in the principles of cybernetics.

•
Being general, the theory is applicable also to artificial intelligence technologies.

•
The theory makes empirical predictions about the mechanisms of neural adaptation.


Abstract
The mind is a biological phenomenon. Thus, biological principles of organization should also be the principles underlying mental operations. Practopoiesis states that the key for achieving intelligence through adaptation is an arrangement in which mechanisms laying at a lower level of organization, by their operations and interaction with the environment, enable creation of mechanisms laying at a higher level of organization. When such an organizational advance of a system occurs, it is called a traverse. A case of traverse is when plasticity mechanisms (at a lower level of organization), by their operations, create a neural network anatomy (at a higher level of organization). Another case is the actual production of behavior by that network, whereby the mechanisms of neuronal activity operate to create motor actions. Practopoietic theory explains why the adaptability of a system increases with each increase in the number of traverses. With a larger number of traverses, a system can be relatively small and yet, produce a higher degree of adaptive/intelligent behavior than a system with a lower number of traverses. The present analyses indicate that the two well-known traverses - neural plasticity and neural activity - are not sufficient to explain human mental capabilities. At least one additional traverse is needed, which is named anapoiesis for its contribution in reconstructing knowledge e.g., from long-term memory into working memory. The conclusions bear implications for brain theory, the mind-body explanatory gap, and developments of artificial intelligence technologies.

The connection between the discussed paper on "Care as the Driver of Intelligence" and the paper on "Practopoiesis: Or how life fosters a mind" lies in their shared focus on understanding the principles underlying intelligence and mental operations. While the former paper emphasizes the role of Care as a central invariant in intelligence and its connections to biology, AI, and Buddhism, the latter paper introduces the concept of Practopoiesis as a theory of achieving intelligence through adaptation based on principles of organization.
Practopoiesis proposes that the key to achieving intelligence is the arrangement of mechanisms at different levels of organization, where lower-level mechanisms enable the creation of higher-level mechanisms through their operations and interaction with the environment. This process, called a traverse, leads to an increase in adaptability and intelligence. The paper discusses specific traverses, such as neural plasticity and neural activity, and introduces the concept of anapoiesis, which involves reconstructing knowledge from long-term memory into working memory.
Both papers explore the fundamental principles that underlie intelligence and its relationship with adaptation and organization. While the "Care as the Driver of Intelligence" paper emphasizes the role of motivation, stress, and goal-directedness in intelligence, the "Practopoiesis" paper focuses on the arrangement of mechanisms and traverses as the basis for achieving intelligence. Both papers contribute to our understanding of intelligence in biological and artificial systems, providing insights into the mechanisms and principles that drive intelligent behavior.

ChatGPT
Choice Theory is a psychological framework developed by Dr. William Glasser that emphasizes the idea that all human behavior is driven by our attempt to satisfy our basic needs. By understanding and applying the concepts of Choice Theory, individuals can improve their satisfaction with life and enhance their mental well-being. Here is a quickstart guide to Choice Theory:
Basic Needs: Choice Theory proposes that humans have five basic needs: survival, love and belonging, power, freedom, and fun. These needs motivate our behavior, and everything we do is an attempt to meet one or more of these needs.
Relationship Habits: Our relationships play a crucial role in meeting our basic needs. Choice Theory emphasizes the importance of building healthy, positive connections with others and fostering mutually satisfying relationships.
Quality World: The Quality World represents our individual perceptions of the people, things, and experiences that bring us joy and satisfaction. Understanding our unique Quality World helps us make choices that align with our desires and values.
Perceived World: Our Perceived World is our subjective interpretation of reality based on our beliefs, experiences, and perceptions. Recognizing that our perceptions shape our experiences allows us to take responsibility for our own thoughts and actions.
Comparing Place: The Comparing Place is where we evaluate our current situation and compare it to what we want or believe we need. This assessment influences our choices and actions as we strive to meet our basic needs.
External vs. Internal Control Psychology: Choice Theory distinguishes between external control psychology and internal control psychology. External control is based on the belief that external forces or circumstances determine our happiness and satisfaction. Internal control, on the other hand, recognizes that we have the power to make choices and take responsibility for our own well-being.
By understanding and applying the principles of Choice Theory, individuals can gain insight into their motivations, improve their relationships, and make choices that lead to greater satisfaction and fulfillment. It encourages personal responsibility, self-awareness, and a focus on meeting our basic needs in healthy and productive ways.

More about, the mysticism of interiority and quietism:

Already during her marriage, Guyon retained belief in God's perfect plan, fiercely believing that she would be blessed in suffering. This became true especially after being introduced to mysticism by Fr. François La Combe, the superior of the Barnabite house in Thonon in Savoy.[3] After her husband's death, Madame Guyon initially lived quietly as a wealthy widow in Montargis, before re-establishing contact with François La Combe in 1679.[9]

After three mystical experiences, Madame Guyon felt drawn to Geneva. The Bishop of Geneva, Jean d'Arenthon d'Alex, persuaded her to use her money to set up a house for "new Catholics" in Gex, in Savoy, as part of broader plans to convert Protestants in the region. In July 1680, Madame Guyon left Montargis with her young daughter and travelled to Gex.[9]

The project was problematic, however, and Guyon clashed with the sisters who were in charge of the house. The Bishop of Geneva sent Father La Combe to intervene. At this point, Guyon introduced La Combe to a mysticism of interiority.

The mysticism of interiority refers to a spiritual approach that focuses on the inner, subjective experiences and the direct connection with the divine. It involves seeking a deep, personal relationship with God or the divine through contemplation, prayer, and inner reflection.
Madame Guyon, a French mystic and writer, became acquainted with mysticism through her encounters with Fr. François La Combe, who introduced her to these concepts. After experiencing mystical encounters, she felt a strong pull towards Geneva, where she engaged in a project to convert Protestants to Catholicism.
During this time, Guyon clashed with the sisters in charge of the house and sought the intervention of Father La Combe. It was during this period that she introduced him to a mysticism of interiority. This mysticism emphasized the importance of turning inward, seeking God's presence within oneself, and cultivating a deep interior life.
The mysticism of interiority encourages individuals to embrace solitude, silence, and stillness as a means to connect with the divine. It involves practices such as meditation, contemplative prayer, and self-examination to deepen one's spiritual understanding and experience of God.
Quietism, on the other hand, is a spiritual philosophy that advocates for a passive, receptive approach to spirituality. It emphasizes surrendering one's own will and desires to God, allowing divine grace to work through them without actively striving or seeking spiritual experiences. Quietism often involves a state of inner stillness, tranquility, and trust in the divine's guidance.
In the context of Madame Guyon's life and teachings, her mysticism of interiority and quietism can be seen as a path of seeking God's presence within oneself and surrendering to God's will. It involves cultivating an interior life of deep spiritual connection, trust, and reliance on divine grace.

ChatGPT
ChatGPT
While the philosophy of Madame Guyon and the topics we have discussed, such as mysticism and quietism, have their proponents and followers, it is important to acknowledge that there are also concerns and criticisms associated with them. Here are some potential dangers and problems that critics have raised:
Lack of External Guidance: One criticism of quietism and mysticism is that they can potentially lead individuals to rely solely on their own internal experiences and beliefs, without seeking external guidance or accountability. This may result in a detachment from community, traditional religious teachings, and established ethical frameworks.
Subjectivity and Misinterpretation: Mystical experiences and the focus on interiority can be highly subjective and open to individual interpretation. This subjectivity can lead to different understandings and conflicting interpretations, potentially resulting in spiritual confusion or misunderstandings.
Escapism and Worldly Disengagement: The emphasis on detachment and surrender to God's will can sometimes be misconstrued as a justification for disengagement from worldly responsibilities and social issues. Critics argue that this can lead to a lack of social and ethical engagement, neglect of one's duties, and a disregard for social justice concerns.
Spiritual Elitism and Exclusivity: Some critics argue that the mysticism and quietism promoted by Madame Guyon and others can create a sense of spiritual elitism, where only those who have had certain mystical experiences or reached certain spiritual heights are considered truly enlightened or advanced. This exclusivity can potentially lead to a hierarchy within religious communities and marginalization of those who do not fit into the prescribed spiritual framework.
Potential for Manipulation and Abuse: The subjective nature of mystical experiences and the emphasis on surrendering to higher powers can create an environment where individuals may be susceptible to manipulation or exploitation by charismatic leaders or self-proclaimed spiritual authorities.
It is essential to approach any philosophical or spiritual framework with critical thinking, discernment, and an awareness of these potential dangers and problems. Balancing personal experiences with external guidance, maintaining ethical responsibility, and promoting inclusivity and social engagement are important considerations in navigating the complexities of these philosophies.

Beware!

Monkey kung fu (Tai Shing) is a very powerful and wonderful artform. Only a handful of people in the entire world actually know the art. It has been kept secret and only passed on to friends and family members.

There are exceptions to the rule which include Grandmaster Matsuda learning the art. The art is only mastered by very few individuals, because they are the only ones who have endured decades of training to learn the art.

This is not an easy art to learn and 99 percent of the people who study the art only last a few years because it is so difficult.

This page was written because there are those out there attempting to teach Monkey kung fu with very little training and others claiming to be masters when they have only studied for a short period of time.

One in particular has less than a year in training and is claiming to be a master. On one site, it has a list of teachers which is not valid. Most of them listed have such little knowledge on the art all they can teach you is one form (they have to buy my DVDs to actually learn the art).

Flexibility & Yoga

Being flexible is always good. It helps you move more quickly and easily. However, I caution you to beware of those adding extreme flexibility or yoga as a primary part of the Monkey art.

Grandmaster Kou Sze, who created this art, based it on powerful moves, grabbing, pulling and striking techniques. Its foundation was the art of Tei Tong (Great Earth style).

Yoga was never part of the art. One individual added extreme yoga and taught Monkey kung fu like it was a major part of the art form, it is not. 

Being able to place your foot behind your neck or standing on your staff leaves you vulnerable and can cause damage to your body and your weapon.

Please beware of those who teach such showy antics as actual Monkey. 

The Grandmaster was furious that a specific teacher added yoga and flexibility to the art and claimed it was Monkey.

THERE IS NO EXTREME FLEXIBILITY & YOGA IN MONKEY KUNG FU. Too many people have been fooled into believing there ever was.

Investing in the Art

Those looking to learn this amazing art are making a commitment. You are paying good money to learn something that is very unique. The last thing that should be on your mind is wasting good money under someone who doesn't even know the art.

One site even lists names of people who have studied the art, but as the senior student; I can tell you exactly how long they actually studied.

I want everyone to learn this art, but I don't want people wasting their money and putting their hopes in someone who knows very little of the art.

Getting Injured

You need to have a good teacher in the art, I cannot stress that enough. Learning the art incorrectly may cause permanent damage to the knees, back, and other areas of the body.

If you don't roll right you could injure your neck and back. If you don't know how to get low, you could really damage your knees.

If you are taught correctly, you should not have any knee strain after a few weeks. Please be careful.

Techniques

Monkey kung fu techniques are extremely powerful. The strikes and the grabs are all meant to do damage. You should be able to actually see the technique and feel the power of the move. There are those who can only perform in a demonstration or tournament setting. These forms are usually quick, but they throw their arms and legs around with no power or strength.

Monkey kung fu is not a demonstration art, it is an art in which you can actually use to protect yourself. Being able to compete and win in a tournament is great, but don't let your whole training become a performance art. If you are going to learn the art, then learn it as it was meant to be taught.

Learning the Art

Don't let someone milk the art. By the end of your third year you should know all five forms of the monkey, the monkey staff and Tei Tong. Those who only studied the art for a short period of time and try to teach the art, milk the one form (lost monkey) for many years. It's because that's all they know. If they purchased my dvds, they will learn the other monkey forms.

I'm cautioning you not to be lead on by someone who knows so very little. If you study the art, you should learn the following:

1) Tei Tong form
2) Lost Monkey
3) Tall Monkey
4) Stone Monkey
5) Drunken Monkey
6) Wooden Monkey and
7) Monkey staff and basic staff.

That's it in terms of forms; you should also learn movements, drills, techniques, endurance training, low and high kicking, etc. But form-wise, those are it.

Monkey Weapons

There is only one Monkey weapon, the staff. And there are two Monkey staff forms. They are both advanced staff forms. Monkey ring is just a fun device, there is no such this as a Monkey ring form.

Special note, there is no such thing as a Monkey practitioner propping the staff straight up and balancing themself at the top of the staff; this is Wu Shu Monkey, not Tai Shing Monkey.

Monkey Screams

Ok, monkeys do like to scream. It's fun, it's annoying, it's what they do. However, in Monkey kung fu, screams are limited to certain attacks, techniques or for deception. They shouldn't be used throughout the entire form.

Screaming will cause you to lose energy and even warn the enemy you are coming at them.  A caution flag should go up if a person is screaming throughout the entire form.

Pek Kwar

People get confused about this all the time. Let me clarify. Tai Shing is the Monkey art. Pek Kwar is an axe-fist art, like Choy Li Fut. Pek Kwar is not Monkey and has nothing whatsoever to do with Monkey.

Grandmaster Ken Tak Hoi learned both arts and named his school Tai Shing Pek Kwar, meaning he taught both arts.

You do not need to learn any Pek Kwar to learn Monkey. It is not a prerequisite to Monkey.

Learning the Entire Monkey System

Michael Matsuda trained personally with his instructor, Zink, for nearly 33 years. He is the only student that ever lasted with him.

He was named successor to the art on many occasions by him. Matsuda knows every form in the Monkey system and has passed it on to his students. In addition, he has passed on the vigorous training and fighting techniques to his students as well.

Time Periods of Learning

Michael Matsuda was Zink's first student. Since then, maybe 50 students have come and gone. Matsuda knows them all, how long each of them studied and what each of them learned.

That is why you rarely or never seen anyone who is calling themselves a Monkey Kung Fu teacher list their time of study, because Matsuda knows exactly how long each person studied. 

One individual promotes himself as a teacher, but had only studied a total of seven months. So please take caution and examine the person teaching you closely.

In Conclusion

I want you to learn Monkey kung fu. It is my dream to have Monkey taught all over the world. But the last thing I want is for someone to be under the impression they are actually learning the art when they are not.

I don't want you wasting your money and I think it's very sad when someone has dedicated years to Monkey and finds out they are learning from someone who is not even qualified to teach the art.

These points listed should be considered warning signs and please, please be careful.

If you get injured, then there goes everything.

Exploring the axiology of love helps to shed light on its importance and impact on individuals and society.

Choice Theory and basic human needs: Choice Theory, developed by William Glasser, posits that humans are motivated by their basic needs: survival, love and belonging, power, freedom, and fun. According to this theory, individuals make choices and behave in ways they believe will satisfy these fundamental needs. Understanding these needs can provide insights into human behavior and guide strategies for personal growth and fulfillment.

Mysticism of interiority and quietism: The mysticism of interiority refers to the exploration of the inner self and subjective experiences. It involves practices such as meditation, introspection, and contemplation, with the goal of gaining deeper insights into the nature of consciousness and the spiritual dimensions of existence.

I think the word control has multiple meanings, sometimes it means to watch or monitor and other times to directly intervene or impact
1 / 1
ChatGPT
ChatGPT
You are correct. The word "control" can indeed have multiple meanings depending on the context in which it is used. Here are a few different interpretations:
Monitoring or overseeing: In some cases, "control" can refer to the act of monitoring or overseeing a situation without directly intervening or influencing it. For example, in the context of quality control in manufacturing, it involves observing and ensuring that products meet specific standards.
Direct intervention: On the other hand, "control" can also imply taking direct action or exerting influence over a situation or outcome. This involves actively shaping or manipulating variables to achieve a desired result. For instance, in experimental research, researchers may manipulate certain variables to study their effects on the outcome.
Self-regulation: "Control" can also pertain to self-regulation or self-control, which involves managing one's own thoughts, behaviors, and emotions. It refers to the ability to exert discipline, resist impulses, and make deliberate choices aligned with one's goals and values.
Power and authority: In a broader sense, "control" can be associated with power and authority over others or a situation. It implies having the ability to make decisions, enforce rules, and direct the actions of others.
The specific meaning of "control" can vary depending on the context in which it is used, so it is important to consider the surrounding circumstances to determine its intended interpretation.
1 / 1
What about in perceptual control theory and choice theory?
1 / 1
ChatGPT
ChatGPT
In the context of perceptual control theory and choice theory, the term "control" has specific meanings:
Perceptual Control Theory (PCT): In PCT, "control" refers to the process of maintaining and adjusting one's perceptions to achieve a desired goal or outcome. The theory proposes that individuals engage in continuous feedback loops, where they compare their desired state (reference signal) with their current state (feedback signal) and make adjustments to their behavior to bring their perceptions in line with their goals. The goal is to maintain a stable and desired internal state by regulating external variables.
Choice Theory: In Choice Theory, "control" relates to the idea that individuals have the power to make choices and take responsibility for their actions and behaviors. According to this theory, people are driven by five basic needs (survival, love and belonging, power, freedom, and fun) and make choices to fulfill these needs. The theory emphasizes that individuals have control over their own thoughts, feelings, and behaviors, and they can choose how to respond to their external circumstances.
In both theories, "control" is not about external manipulation or dominance over others but rather about personal agency and self-regulation. It involves the ability to actively engage in goal-directed behavior and make choices that align with one's needs and values. The focus is on empowering individuals to take control of their own lives and make choices that lead to personal satisfaction and well-being.

Constraint-based programming is a programming paradigm that focuses on expressing relationships between variables as constraints and solving problems by finding solutions that satisfy these constraints. It is commonly used in optimization and constraint satisfaction problems.
Here are some potential connections and considerations related to constraint-based programming:
Problem-solving and optimization: Constraint-based programming provides a powerful framework for solving complex problems by formulating them as sets of constraints. It allows programmers to define relationships and dependencies among variables, and the solver algorithms then search for solutions that satisfy these constraints. This approach is particularly useful in optimization problems where finding an optimal solution within given constraints is the goal.
Flexibility and declarative nature: Constraint-based programming offers a high level of flexibility and a declarative approach to problem-solving. Instead of explicitly specifying the algorithm or step-by-step instructions, programmers can define the constraints and let the solver handle the details of finding solutions. This abstraction allows for concise and more readable code, as well as easier modification and extension of the problem constraints.
Expressiveness and problem modeling: Constraint-based programming allows for the expression of complex relationships and dependencies among variables. It provides a rich set of constraints and operators that enable programmers to capture intricate problem structures and constraints in a natural and intuitive way. This expressiveness allows for more accurate modeling of real-world problems and can simplify the development process.
Efficiency and search algorithms: The efficiency of constraint-based programming heavily relies on the choice of search algorithms used by the solver. Different search strategies, such as depth-first search, backtracking, or constraint propagation techniques, can significantly impact the performance and scalability of the solution process. Understanding the characteristics of the problem and selecting appropriate search algorithms is crucial for achieving efficient and effective constraint solving.
Constraint satisfaction and real-world applications: Constraint-based programming finds applications in various domains, including scheduling, planning, resource allocation, logistics, and configuration problems. It provides a flexible and scalable approach to solving complex real-world problems that involve multiple constraints and dependencies. By formulating problems as constraint satisfaction problems, programmers can develop efficient and practical solutions in domains where optimization and resource allocation are critical.
Integration with other paradigms and technologies: Constraint-based programming can be integrated with other programming paradigms and technologies to enhance problem-solving capabilities. It can be combined with procedural, object-oriented, or functional programming to leverage their respective strengths and achieve more comprehensive solutions. Integration with artificial intelligence techniques, such as machine learning or expert systems, can also expand the range of problem domains and improve solution quality.
These considerations highlight the benefits and potential applications of constraint-based programming, but it's important to note that the suitability and effectiveness of this approach depend on the specific problem domain, constraints, and available solver algorithms. Understanding the trade-offs, limitations, and performance characteristics of constraint-based programming is essential for successfully applying it to different problem-solving scenarios.

Introduction
Evolutionary constraints are restrictions, limitations, or biases on the course or outcome of adaptive evolution. The term usually describes factors that limit or channel the action of natural selection. It is not equivalent to evolutionary stasis (absence of change) or even to factors that cause stasis. Evolutionary stasis may be caused by stabilizing selection, but stabilizing selection caused by the external environment is not usually considered a constraint. In a general sense all evolution is constrained. There are no Darwinian demons, immortal organisms that can reproduce infinitely fast, and the concept of constraint is most useful in relation to specific traits, selective agents or ecological contexts. Constraints occur when a trait is precluded from reaching, shifted away from, or slowed down in its approach to a (defined) selective optimum. Interest in the interplay between selection and constraints goes back to Darwin, and specifically to his concept of correlation of growth, which he used to explain how traits may change as side effects of selection on other traits. The fundamental idea is that selection acts on variation so that the structure and availability of variation may constrain what selection can do. Constraint thinking also has links to orthogenesis, the notion that evolution is driven in particular directions by some internal lineage-specific force rather than by external selection caused by interactions with the environment. Orthogenesis was rejected during the modern synthesis due to a lack of plausible mechanism, accumulating evidence for local adaptations, and an emerging understanding of macroevolution as a messy historical process rather than a rectilinear march toward perfection. The modern synthesis saw increasing emphasis on functional explanations based on external natural selection while structural explanations based on development became marginalized. This was influenced first by the realization that selection can act efficiently on minute differences, and later by the empirical findings of large amounts of genetic variation both on molecular and organismal levels. Hence, mainstream evolutionary biology increasingly took it as given that the necessary variation for selection to act was available. After a nadir in the 60s, a structuralist perspective with an emphasis on developmental constraints started to reemerge. This was manifest first in the revival of concepts such as heterochrony and allometry, which may be seen as specific constraints on evolution, and later in the emerging field of evolutionary developmental biology, or evodevo, where the study of developmental constraints is central. An important element in the modern treatment of constraints is that constraints are not just seen as limitations and explanations of last resort, but are also assigned positive explanatory roles based on channeling variation in directions that may facilitate and explain adaptation.

The concept of evolutionary constraints refers to limitations or biases that shape the course and outcomes of adaptive evolution. These constraints can restrict or direct the action of natural selection, and they play a crucial role in understanding the dynamics of evolutionary change. It is important to note that evolutionary constraints are not synonymous with evolutionary stasis, which refers to the absence of change. While stabilizing selection can cause stasis, the focus of constraints lies on factors that hinder or modify the approach of a trait towards a selective optimum.
The study of constraints in evolution traces back to Charles Darwin and his concept of correlation of growth, which explains how traits may change as byproducts of selection acting on other traits. The fundamental idea is that selection acts on existing variation, and the structure and availability of that variation can constrain the outcomes of selection. Constraints are particularly relevant when considering specific traits, selective agents, or ecological contexts.
The concept of constraints also has historical connections to orthogenesis, the idea that evolution is driven by internal forces within lineages, rather than external selection imposed by the environment. However, orthogenesis lost support during the modern synthesis as evidence for local adaptations and the recognition of macroevolution as a complex historical process emerged. The modern synthesis placed greater emphasis on functional explanations driven by external natural selection, while developmental explanations based on constraints became less prominent.
In the 1960s, a renewed interest in developmental constraints emerged, marked by the revival of concepts such as heterochrony and allometry, which are specific constraints that shape evolution. This trend continued with the establishment of evolutionary developmental biology (evo-devo), a field that centers on the study of developmental constraints. Evo-devo recognizes that constraints are not solely limitations or explanations of last resort, but can also play positive roles by channeling variation in ways that facilitate and explain adaptation.
Understanding evolutionary constraints is crucial for comprehending the diversity and patterns of life on Earth. By recognizing the interplay between selection and constraints, scientists can gain insights into the factors that shape evolutionary trajectories and the constraints that organisms face in adapting to their environments. The study of constraints provides a deeper understanding of the complex processes underlying evolutionary change.

Biological constraints are factors which make populations resistant to evolutionary change. One proposed definition of constraint is "A property of a trait that, although possibly adaptive in the environment in which it originally evolved, acts to place limits on the production of new phenotypic variants."[1] Constraint has played an important role in the development of such ideas as homology and body plans.

Biological constraints refer to factors that limit or restrict the ability of populations to undergo evolutionary change. These constraints arise from various sources, including genetic, developmental, ecological, and historical factors. They can shape the direction and pace of evolution by placing limits on the production of new phenotypic variations.
One proposed definition of constraint states that it is a property of a trait that, while potentially adaptive in the environment where it originally evolved, imposes limitations on the generation of new phenotypic variants. This definition suggests that certain traits or characteristics that were advantageous in specific ancestral environments may become constraining when organisms face novel or changing conditions.
The concept of constraint has been influential in the fields of evolutionary biology and paleontology. It has played a significant role in the development of ideas such as homology, which refers to the similarity of traits across different species due to shared ancestry. Constraints can influence the conservation and retention of certain traits, contributing to the formation of homologous structures and evolutionary patterns.
Similarly, constraints have contributed to the understanding of body plans, which are the general organizational and structural characteristics of organisms. Biological constraints can influence the range of possible body plans and shape the overall organization of organisms. By studying constraints, scientists gain insights into the factors that limit the generation of new phenotypic variations and the underlying mechanisms that shape biological form and function.
Overall, biological constraints highlight the complex interplay between adaptation and limitations in evolutionary processes. They provide a framework for understanding the boundaries and possibilities of phenotypic variation and contribute to our understanding of the diversity and patterns of life on Earth.
