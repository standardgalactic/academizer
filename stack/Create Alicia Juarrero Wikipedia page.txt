Ellis, George. How Can Physics Underlie the Mind: Top-Down Causation in the Human Context
Review of Metaphysics, 2017
ELLIS, George. How Can Physics Underlie the Mind: Top-Down Causation in the Human Context. Dordrecht: Springer, 2016. xxvi + 482 pp. Cloth, $59.99--Authored by 2004 Templeton Prize winner George F. R. Ellis, the book aims to identify those principles that make it biologically possible for the mind to emerge from the neurological activity and to exhibit genuine causal powers--top-down--on the components that make up the mental phenomena. Although the book&#39;s immediate subject is the brain and the mind, it describes how complexity and emergence manifest themselves in all sciences: from physics and mathematics, through chemistry, cell biology, and neuroscience, and beyond to psychology and ethics as well as a number of social sciences, all the while keeping its lens trained on the role of top-down causation in each of these domains. The discussion focuses on four basic questions: How does causality operate in complex systems? Is there causal room at the bottom for radical emergence ...

A Place in History
In ���From modern roots to post-modern rhizomes��� (Juarrero, 1993), I explored the alleged transition from mythology to philosophy. Supposedly, what changed with the appearance of pre-Socratic philosophy in the sixth century BC was the logic of explanation deployed to account for natural phenomena. Despite philosophy���s claim to have established a different explanatory logic, I argued in that work that there is nevertheless a unifying thread that did not change from mythology to philosophy: the belief that explanation really explains only when it grounds that which is being explained in a non-phenomenal or non-sensory���call it divine���origin, a source that is also universal, atemporal, and acontextual. The Greek miracle, I claimed, was in fact therefore a ���miracle manque.���

On the one hand, modern societies have achieved an impres-sive level of organization and welfare with their great number of highly differentiated institutions and expertise. On the other hand, we live in a world of global inequity and unfairness as well as massive human impact on the environment, including pollution, the destruction of natural habitats, and the excessive consumption of natural resources. Furthermore, even inside the apparently most successful countries, there are symptoms of distrust in the political system as well as in ...

MORENO, Alvaro and Matteo MOSSIO. Biological Autonomy: A Philosophical and, Theoretical Inquiry. Dordrecht: Springer, 2015. xiii + 221 pp. Cloth, $129.00--Without the complex internal organization of living things, &quot;the survival-of-the-fittest engine is left spinning its wheels.&quot; This is the premise of this new perspective on the life sciences, an approach which attempts to embed biology &quot;within a more general dynamical-organisational theory.&quot; Moreno and Mossio&#39;s book thus opens with the following question: &quot;What is the nature of the organisation that enables [living things] to achieve, maintain, and propagate such a high degree of complexity?&quot; Organization requires the closure of dynamical constraints. Early forms of such organization can be found in the astonishing ability of dissipative structures such as Benard cells to maintain extremely improbable configurations under far from equilibrium conditions. But dissipative structures do not produce t...

An open challenge to advance probabilistic forecasting for dengue epidemics
Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences
A wide range of research has promised new tools for forecasting infectious disease dynamics, but little of that research is currently being applied in practice, because tools do not address key public health needs, do not produce probabilistic forecasts, have not been evaluated on external data, or do not provide sufficient forecast skill to be useful. We developed an open collaborative forecasting challenge to assess probabilistic forecasts for seasonal epidemics of dengue, a major global public health problem. Sixteen teams used a variety of methods and data to generate forecasts for 3 epidemiological targets (peak incidence, the week of the peak, and total incidence) over 8 dengue seasons in Iquitos, Peru and San Juan, Puerto Rico. Forecast skill was highly variable across teams and targets. While numerous forecasts showed high skill for midseason situational awareness, early season skill was low, and skill was generally lowest for high incidence seasons, those for which forecast...

From Modern Roots to Postmodern Rhizomes
Diogenes, 1993
It has been commonplace to maintain of the phenomenon that occurred during classical times, the change from relying on myth to trusting in reason: (1 ) that the emergence of philosophy from myth was marked by an abrupt discontinuity; (2) that mythical thinking was left behind once philosophy was invented or discovered ; and (3) that the ancient Greeks were the agents of this miracle. This paper suggests that the so-called &amp;dquo;Greek miracle&amp;dquo; was, in fact, a miracle manqu�� and, more importantly, that close examination of this failed miracle offers valuable insight into the philosophical crisis facing the world today. Part I of this paper examines philosophy���s claim to have established an order of explanation and justification different from that of myth. I hope to show that Greek mythology���s preference for genealogical explanation was based on an unacknowledged assumption that philosophy did not reject: what I call the Myth of the Root, the belief that genealogy explains only because and when it terminates in a supernatural source, that is, only when an explana-

In "From Modern Roots to Postmodern Rhizomes" (1993), Alicia Juarrero challenges the conventional notion of a sharp division between myth and reason in classical times. She argues that the emergence of philosophy from myth wasn't an abrupt discontinuity and that Greek mythology's genealogical explanations share a common, often unacknowledged, assumption with philosophy. This assumption, termed the 'Myth of the Root', posits that true explanation comes from a supernatural source. Juarrero's paper critically examines this belief and its implications for understanding the philosophical crisis in the modern world, suggesting a continuity between myth and philosophy rather than a stark divide.

CHAPTER 2 
A Place in History 
Alicia Juarrero 
I 
n ���From modern roots to post-modern rhizomes��� (Juarrero, 1993), I explored 
the alleged transition from mythology to philosophy. Supposedly, what 
changed with the appearance of pre-Socratic philosophy in the sixth cen- 
tury BC was the logic of explanation deployed to account for natural phenom- 
ena. Despite philosophy���s claim to have established a different explanatory logic, 
I argued in that work that there is nevertheless a unifying thread that did not 
change from mythology to philosophy: the belief that explanation really explains 
only when it grounds that which is being explained in a non-phenomenal or 
non-sensory���call it divine���origin, a source that is also universal, atemporal, 
and acontextual. The Greek miracle, I claimed, was in fact therefore a ���miracle 
manqu��.��� 
The logic of explanation of mythological and religious narratives is charac- 
teristically the following: explaining something consists in stating its lineage 
or otherwise tracing its history or trajectory back to its beginning. For a mind- 
set embedded in a mythological culture, doing this provides an explanation 
because chronological retracing corresponds to tracking the phenomenon to 
its ontological ground. Herodotus slights the Egyptians by saying, ���They did 
not know until recently the origins of things.��� A paradigmatic example of this 
explanatory logic appears in ancient Greek references to the Ages of Man as 
golden, silver, and bronze, the underlying assumption being that the further 
back one goes in time the closer mankind is to the golden; that is, the divine. 
The same pattern reoccurs in Genesis���s ���begats.��� Genealogy therefore consti- 
tutes the first ���logic of explanation,��� its supposition being that original or foun- 
dational is either itself divine or warranted by the divine. 
Four distinct types of genealogical explanation based on temporal regression 
can be identified. These include (1) the establishment of the authority of the 
mythological hero; (2) the legitimacy or authority of any city, such as Athens; 
(3) the view that cosmology is just theogony; and (4) calling into question the 
authority of the narrator or the storyteller.

In "A Place in History," Alicia Juarrero examines the supposed transition from mythology to philosophy, particularly focusing on the logic of explanation used to account for natural phenomena. She argues that both mythology and early philosophy share a common explanatory thread: they seek to ground explanations in a divine, atemporal, and universal origin. Juarrero identifies this as the "Myth of the Root," where genealogical explanation, by tracing back to an original or divine source, is deemed sufficient. She outlines four types of genealogical explanations based on this temporal regression, touching upon mythological heroes, city legitimacy, cosmology as theogony, and the authority of the narrator.

Consider first a mythological hero���s authority. In the case of the Greeks, 
a hero���s authority is clearly due to his pedigree. The Iliad refers to elders as 
the source of law and reason because they are closer to the Golden Age, when 
things were right and gods and men mingled freely. Ajax claims that the behav- 
ior of the Achaians is justified because it is ���we who can show of all the longest 
lineage��� (Iliad 2:558.40). To qualify as a mythological hero, pedigree is there- 
fore all important. In particular, descent from a god provides the sine qua non 
for the role. Even the lethality of the hero���s weapons is directly related to their 
divine origin; just consider the provenance of Achilles��� shield or Polyphemus��� 
stake. The same is true for a city���s legitimacy or authority. For example, what 
makes Athens unique is that it was founded by Athena; Argos was founded by 
Hera; Limnos by Hephaestos; and so on. In each case, the founder is divine. 
The principle also holds true of a contemporary leader or a political figure 
in authority. There is a certain pattern that repeats in the narratives concerning 
a city���s founding, a pattern Malinowski calls a ���charter myth��� (Malinowski, 
1955). These stories commonly describe a quasi-divine hero who overthrows 
a monster that has been plaguing the hapless residents of an area. Once vic- 
torious, the savior founds or reestablishes a city, which now owes its tempo- 
ral significance to its having been founded by that redeemer in that manner. 
Perseus (who founds Mycenae) slays the Gorgon; Theseus rids Attica of the 
brigands Peripheter, Sciron, Cercyon, Anteus, and the rest, not to mention the 
Minotaur; and so on. Such a logic of explanation collapses genealogical expla- 
nation into evaluative justification by blending the role of that which has value 
with its origin. So the temporal authority of either a hero or a city derives from 
its founder���s supernatural feats and the ultimately divine lineage of both.
ChatGPT
ChatGPT
In this excerpt, Juarrero discusses how the authority of mythological heroes and cities in Greek mythology is deeply rooted in their divine lineage. She explains that heroes are revered for their descent from gods, and this lineage even extends to the power of their weapons. Similarly, the legitimacy of cities is linked to their divine founders. She references the concept of a "charter myth," where a hero's victory over a monstrous foe leads to the founding or reestablishing of a city, thereby blending genealogical explanation with evaluative justification. This demonstrates how temporal authority in these narratives is intertwined with divine origin.

Once more, explanation as genealogy reappears in tales about cosmology. 
Hesiod���s Theogony, for example, is for the most part genealogy. In reply to the 
request, ���Tell me how first gods, earth, rivers, the boundless sea . . . the shin- 
ing stars and the wide heavens above came into being��� (Th 107���110), Hesiod 
replies that first Chaos came to be, then Gaia, then Uranus, the Titans, and so 
on, until Zeus kills his father Cronos (he of the offspring-eating habits) and, in 
doing so, establishes a cosmos, an ordered universe. Order emerges out of chaos 
only through and thanks to a certain type of lineage. Similarly, for Christians 
it is not until Jesus (who can trace his lineage to David) supersedes Yahweh���s 
prescriptions that the Good News can be proclaimed. The authoritativeness of 
the transformation is due to the divinity of the founder, whether Zeus or Jesus, 
and his overthrow of the now superseded order. The undeniable implication 
is that had the revolutionary not been divine, the cosmos or teachings would 
not have been lawful. The same story reappears about Prometheus, the divine 
source of fire, reason, cognition, mind, medicine, numbers, and foresight. One 
could even say the same about Orestes��� establishment of the rule of law at the 
end of the Eumenides, the last play in the Oresteian trilogy. 
Finally, the authority of the teller of myths is itself established genealogi- 
cally: a story has meaning or significance only because the storyteller received 
it from a god. The authoritativeness of the story implies divine revelation to the 
storyteller. Here too, genealogical explanation collapses into justification: the fact that the story originates in a divine source is what confers authority (not 
only power) on both the story and the storyteller. The identity between revela- 
tion and justification is also retained in the Abrahamic religions: the reason 
why the Old and New Testaments, or the Koran, are held to be authoritative is 
because they are said to be the products of divine revelation. This latter situa- 
tion is remarkable because we know that in the case of mythology (significantly 
in Hesiod and Homer), epic storytellers would change the story slightly with 
each retelling to communicate better with their audience. The epic bard of old 
was aware that in a participatory universe the audience needs to identify with 
the story in order to render it meaningful or applicable to the present day. This 
participatory aspect of storytelling is discarded with the rise of philosophy, an 
indication that philosophy loses all awareness or appreciation of the impor- 
tance of context. How and why does this loss of appreciation of context, time, 
and natural emergence happen? 
Thales, the pre-Socratic who is often depicted as the first philosopher, 
claimed that water is the fundamental metaphysical constituent. In doing so, he 
rejects the assumption that the origin in which phenomenal reality is grounded 
must itself be divine (water is as common an element as one can find). In 
determining that water is the basic constituent of reality, Thales also rejects 
any supposition that this scientific knowledge is acquired through revelation. 
Instead, he privileges reason as the logical source of the conclusion that water 
is the fundamental building block of reality. Nevertheless, Thales follows the 
tradition of viewing chronological primacy as ontologically foundational. The 
reason water continues to serve as an alleged explanation of natural phenom- 
ena is because all other phenomena are considered derivative from it through 
various transformations such as evaporation, freezing, and so on. To explain 
something is still to trace it temporally to its origin.

ChatGPT
Juarrero, in this passage, discusses how genealogical explanations are prevalent in cosmological myths. Using Hesiod's "Theogony" as an example, she illustrates how order in the universe is ascribed to the lineage of divine beings. This pattern is also seen in Christian narratives where Jesus's divine lineage is crucial for the validity of his teachings. Similarly, in Greek mythology, the divine origins of figures like Prometheus and Orestes play a key role in their authority and the legitimacy of their actions. Juarrero also notes how the authority of mythological storytellers themselves is genealogically derived, with stories gaining significance and authority through their supposed divine origins. She contrasts this with the emergence of philosophy, highlighting a shift away from contextual and participatory understanding towards a more reason-based approach.

It's indeed fascinating how certain words in modern language, like "Music," "Museum," and "Genius," still echo their mythological roots, particularly their connection to the Muses of ancient Greek mythology. These words not only reflect the historical influence of these mythological figures but also hint at the enduring legacy of ancient cultures in contemporary times. The Muses, who were considered the source of inspiration in the arts, sciences, and literature, continue to be symbolically acknowledged in these terms, illustrating how ancient myths and their cultural significance persist in our everyday language.

There is a qualitative change with the appearance of Anaximander, a pre- 
Socratic philosopher who follows Thales. Anaximander���s thesis is that the 
fundamental constituent of reality cannot be water because it is too determi- 
nate or specific a ���stuff.��� The origin, ground, and source of all reality must 
be instead something undifferentiated, itself possessed of no characteristics or 
determinate properties. Anaximander calls this source the apeiron, the bound- 
less. All of phenomenal reality, he claims, originates in the apeiron, made spe- 
cific and determinate thanks to processes such as condensation or rarefication. 
The apeiron is eternal and therefore inquiries into its origin would constitute 
a category mistake, but its role is still to serve as the first (diffuse, amorphous) 
state of (subsequently more determinate, specified) matter. To that extent, 
Anaximander���s logic of explanation remains genealogical, the tracking back 
of everything that we now see to its origins. More importantly, the fact that 
the apeiron has no properties and is undifferentiated makes it abstract and 
therefore more akin to a logical principle, an arche, than was Thales��� water. 
The apeiron nevertheless continues to function as a temporal beginning, since 
Anaximander explicitly states that one can track the progressive results of rare- 
fication and condensation on this non-determinate stuff. In Anaximander���s 
apeiron, I submit, we find the laying down of a philosophical approach that will characterize the subsequent history of Western philosophy: a dismissal of the 
local, the contextual, the sensible, and the here and now. The only parallel with 
religion is the transition from local, animistic gods identified with specific 
trees, mountains, or locales to the abstract and universal Abrahamic God (who 
can only be defined through negation, by what it is not). Insofar as explana- 
tion consists in a tracing back to the primordial ground, however, explanation 
remains genetic. 
The philosophical emphasis on abstraction and acontextuality that begins 
with Anaximander will culminate in the foundationalist metaphysics of modern 
science, but it reaches an early apex with Socrates and Plato. In the Symposium, 
the dialogue in which Socrates asks interlocutors ���What is Love?,��� Socrates, the 
last speaker, dismisses the previous thinkers by objecting that those before him 
had merely described the origin of love���where it came from���but had failed to 
provide its definition. Earlier speakers before Socrates had characterized love���s 
lineage in various ways���as the ���oldest of the gods���; by noting its parents or 
offspring (love���s parents being such and thus, or love having no parents, or love 
being the parent of everything else); and so on. Socrates��� central objection is 
precisely that this is not the proper way to offer explanations, that the logic of 
explanation is not given by tracing the subject���s lineage but rather by articulat- 
ing its (essential) definition. And as is well known, the Platonic tradition con- 
cerning definition is that to explain something is to provide a description that 
���reflects��� the Platonic form in which the essence of that which is being defined 
���partakes.��� 
According to Socrates, Plato, Aristotle, and, in fact, according to philoso- 
phers until the middle of the twentieth century (Quine, 1970b), a constitutive 
definition must identify the metaphysical ground or essence of whatever is being 
defined, and this it must do by identifying its substance. Lurking behind the 
push for foundational definitions is the assumption that true and proper defi- 
nitions connect the phenomenal thing under investigation with the Real (by 
which is meant a non-sensible���capital R���Reality). A substance, foundation- 
alist metaphysics follows directly from such an approach: proper definitions 
must exclude inessential and secondary sensory traits, or those that refer to the 
merely contextual or local. To explain natural phenomena, definitions must 
tap into the eternal, universal, or unchanging ground; following the tradition 
established by Anaximander, the logic of all proper explanation must trace that 
natural phenomenon (now logically, if not temporally) to Reality, which itself 
is not available to the senses even though it is the source of all that exists in 
the phenomenal realm. One can call this ���the myth of the (tap) root,��� a philo- 
sophical approach that can still be seen in the widespread assumption even 
today that everything will ultimately be explicable in terms of the workings of 
subatomic particles, none of which is available to the senses, and some of which 
are only inferable by their trajectories in the Hadron Collider, for example. 
That assumption common to much of basic physical science thus continues 
to reflect the belief that phenomenal reality must somehow be derived from 
or originate in something that is neither changing, nor contextual, nor local, 
nor particular. Proper explanation, therefore, must spell out a derivation of 
A Place in History ? 21 
that which is being explained from this nonnatural ground, its metaphysical 
tap root, which penetrates deep into ontological ground. The lesson that phi- 
losophy and science both take from this metaphor is that their task is either 
to discover or to articulate the one correct method, be it scientific method, 
Cartesian innate ideas, the sensory data of the empiricists, or in ethics the 
categorical imperative or the principle of utility. In modern times, the myth of 
the tap root emerges strongly in Galileo���s claim that the book of nature is writ- 
ten in the language of mathematics; understanding this abstract, universal, a 
contextual language is the key that will allow us to tap into truth, which itself is also absolute, unchanging, and eternal.

In this passage, Juarrero explores the evolution of philosophical thought from Anaximander's concept of the apeiron, an undifferentiated and abstract principle, to the foundations of modern science and philosophy. She highlights the shift from genealogical, context-based explanations to abstract, acontextual ones that seek universal truths. This transition, she argues, reflects a broader philosophical movement towards abstraction, culminating in the Platonic and Aristotelian focus on essential definitions and metaphysical essences. This trend, Juarrero suggests, underpins modern scientific approaches that seek explanations in universal, unchanging principles, often abstracted from sensory experience.

That reminded me of a post  did Dec 19, 2022:

All languages, and None

As this story continues, I shall have to speak again, at length, of this creature and record his speech.

I confess I find it very difficult to do so because I could not say now, as I could never understand then, what language he spoke ��� Salvatore spoke all languages, and no language.

Or, rather, he had invented for himself a language which used the sinews of the languages to which he had been exposed ��� and once I thought that was his, not the Adamic language that a happy mankind had spoken, all united by a single tongue from the origin of the world to the Tower of Babel, or one of the languages that arose after the dire event of their division, but precisely the Babelish language of the first day after the divine chastisement, the language of primeval confusion.

Nor, for that matter, could I call Salvatore���s speech a language, because in every human language there are rules and every term signifies ad placitum a thing, according to a law which does not change, for man cannot call the dog once dog and once cat, or utter sounds to which a consensus of people has not assigned a definite meaning, as would happen if someone said the word ���blitiri.���

And yet, one way or another, I did understand what Salvatore meant, and so did the others.

Proof that he spoke not one, but all languages, none correctly, taking words sometimes from one and sometimes from another.

I also noticed afterward that he might refer to something first in Latin and later in Provencal, and I realized that he was not so much inventing his own sentences as using the disecta membra of other sentences, heard some time in the past, according to the present situation and the the thing he wanted to say.

This passage from Umberto Eco's "The Name of the Rose" describes the character Salvatore, who speaks in a unique, idiosyncratic manner. Salvatore's speech is depicted as a mixture of various languages, not adhering to the rules of any single language. Instead, he combines elements from different languages, creating a form of communication that is likened to the language of Babel after the divine punishment. This unique speech, while not conforming to traditional linguistic structures, is still understandable to others, illustrating the fluid and dynamic nature of language and communication.

Your observation draws a parallel between Salvatore's unique way of speaking in Umberto Eco's novel and the way Large Language Models (LLMs) like ChatGPT function. The comparison to LLMs speaking "all languages and none" highlights their capacity to generate language across various linguistic contexts while not being tied to the intrinsic rules or cultural nuances of any single language. This can lead to creative yet sometimes unreliable outputs, akin to the concept of an unreliable narrator or the fluid nature of dream investigations, where the boundaries of conventional structure and meaning are often blurred or transcended.

Eco, The Name of the Rose, and the limits of language
Posted by mitchellirons
Presented today, as a brief lesson in elementary Saussurian structuralism, and post-structuralism, is an excerpt from Umberto Eco���s 1980 novel, Il Nome Della Rosa (tr: The Name of The Rose, 1983). Any semiotician or Eco-fan will be familiar with the text, and with the excerpt, as it is one of any number of pages from the work of fiction that can be held up not only as a moment of exquisite prose, but also as an affirmation, defense or demonstration of contemporary literary theory.

Consider for a moment the voice of narrator, Adso, recollecting events that happened so many years ago in his youth. We see in the first half of the excerpt a very simple synopsis of how language and meaning appears to manifest itself. In describing Salvatore���s speech, Adso admits that he has a language of his own, but since it is incomprehensible to anyone else, it essentially is nothing but a speech of utterances and half-words ��� gibberish: ���Salvatore spoke all languages, and no language���. Adso justifies his criticism of Salvatore initially in biblical and religious terms, perhaps indicative of his initial religious training. The old monk���s gibberish is ���Adamic���, and ���Babelish���, part of humanity���s eternal scar due to the ���grand chastisement��� at the Tower of Babel. He follows this criticism, however, by shifting toward an elementary discourse on what language should be, perhaps to highlight his recent tutelage under Brother William. William, an admirer of Aquinas and Bacon, would be sure to believe in a language system based on rules and structures, where ���every term signifies . . . a thing, according to a law which does not change, for man cannot call the dog once dog and once cat��� in the same breath. To every object there would be one word to represent it in this system ��� ���cat��� for a four-legged feline animal; ���dog��� for a four-legged canine animal.
ChatGPT
ChatGPT
In this analysis, the narrator Adso reflects on Salvatore's unique speech in "The Name of the Rose." He initially describes Salvatore's language as a mix of gibberish and half-words, akin to a "Babelish" language post-Tower of Babel, symbolizing the fragmented nature of human communication. Adso then transitions to a more structured view of language, influenced by Brother William's logical and rule-based approach, where each term has a fixed and unchanging representation of an object. This shift highlights the contrast between a chaotic, rule-less form of language and a structured, rule-bound linguistic system.
You
The real fun begins, however, with Adso���s tiny admission of doubt in this structure in the very next line, ���And yet, one way or another, I did understand what Salvatore meant, and so did the others���. Eco enforces elementary, and sensible Saussurian logic which, up to now, the reader would not expect to see in such a young (and old) character as Adso. Adso admits that he can sometimes understand Salvatore���s gibberish ��� the otherwise nonsensical statements of an old monk who is always ���taking words sometimes from one and sometimes from another���. In spite of his lack of understanding, the young novice finds meaning in Salvatore���s words (his statement is important to the plot of the text but not to this entry ��� please read the book yourself to find his words) because language is in fact highly malleable and open to adjustment and re-adjustment. We understand that objects can be signified by any number of words (a book could be a ���book��� or a ���text��� or a ���novel��� or a ���manuscript��� or a ���work��� or a ���piece��� etc) in but one language, let alone Salvatore���s mishmash of all the language and dialects he has encountered in his day. A dog to Salvatore, and to Adso, could be a dog or a mutt or a puppy, or even ���un chien��� or ���canis���; similarly, ���un chat��� or ���cattus��� for ���cat���. When Adso admits to himself, and to the reader that he was able to listen to Salvatore���s nonsensical statements and find meaning, it is because meaning is not tied forever to the words themselves.

This analysis reveals Adso's realization about the fluidity and adaptability of language. Despite initially viewing Salvatore's speech as nonsensical, Adso acknowledges that he can understand it, indicating that language's meaning isn't rigidly tied to specific words. This understanding reflects Saussurian logic, where the relationship between signifier and signified is arbitrary and open to interpretation. Eco uses this to show that language, while structured, is also highly flexible, capable of conveying meaning even when traditional linguistic rules are not strictly followed. Adso's insight underscores the dynamic nature of communication, where meaning transcends rigid linguistic structures.

What we have in this excerpt is a brief, yet critical introduction on the mutability of language to a public, non-academic audience. Without speaking to Saussure���s sign-signifier-signified theory, as simple as it is, Eco expounded to a wide audience some of the first brief arguments (notwithstanding Nietzsche, of course) against self-evident and self-affirming Truths and Values. If the words that we use to define ourselves by, to codify our laws with, or to define our God with (cf. John 1:1 ���In the beginning was the Word, and the Word was with God, and the Word was God) are more malleable that we think they are, then perhaps we must question their ability to represent an object to one person, and carry that representation to others.

In this excerpt, Eco uses "The Name of the Rose" to introduce the concept of language's mutability to a broader, non-academic audience. Without delving into Saussure's theories explicitly, Eco touches upon the idea that language, and by extension, the truths and values it conveys, are not as fixed as traditionally believed. This notion challenges the idea of self-evident truths and values, suggesting that the words we use to define our laws, beliefs, and even our understanding of divinity (as in John 1:1) are more flexible than commonly thought, thus inviting a reevaluation of their representational capacity.

I find it interesting that the word terminology is the study of limits, boundaries, and ends, like the concepts associated with Hermes
ChatGPT
ChatGPT
Indeed, the word "terminology" does echo the concepts associated with Hermes, the Greek messenger god known for his boundaries-crossing role. "Terminology" essentially refers to the study or system of terms used within a particular field, often marking the boundaries of knowledge and understanding in that domain. The connection with Hermes lies in the etymological roots of "terminus," which relates to boundaries or limits, much like Hermes, who navigated and communicated across various boundaries, whether physical, divine, or mortal. This metaphorical linkage adds a mythological dimension to our understanding of language and its power to delineate and define.

ChatGPT
Yes, I'm familiar with Terrence Deacon's theory of constraints and entropy. Deacon is known for his work on the relationship between information, thermodynamics, and the emergence of complex systems. He argues that constraints play a crucial role in the self-organization of complex systems, allowing them to resist entropy and maintain stability. By constraining the possible states a system can be in, it can transmit information and maintain its integrity. This perspective provides valuable insights into how order can emerge from disorder in biological and cognitive systems. Deacon's ideas have had a significant impact on the fields of biology and cognitive science.

Do you know about the controversy between Deacon and Juarerro?
ChatGPT
ChatGPT
Yes, there has been some controversy between Terrence Deacon and Alicia Juarrero regarding their views on complex systems, constraints, and emergence. While both scholars have made significant contributions to the field, they have had different perspectives on certain aspects of these topics. Deacon has emphasized the role of constraints in self-organization, while Juarrero has critiqued this view, arguing for the importance of historical and contextual factors in understanding complex systems. The debate has led to interesting discussions in the field of philosophy of science and the study of complex systems.

Theoretical interests
Deacon's theoretical interests include the study of evolution-like processes at multiple levels, including their role in embryonic development, neural signal processing, language change, social processes, and focusing especially on how these different processes interact and depend on each other. He has long stated an interest in developing a scientific semiotics (particularly biosemiotics) that would contribute to both linguistic theory and cognitive neuroscience.[1]

Fields of research
Deacon's research combines human evolutionary biology and neuroscience, with the aim of investigating the evolution of human cognition. His work extends from laboratory-based cellular-molecular neurobiology to the study of semiotic processes underlying animal and human communication, especially language and language origins. His neurobiological research is focused on determining the nature of the human divergence from typical primate brain anatomy, the cellular-molecular mechanisms producing this difference, and the correlations between these anatomical differences and special human cognitive abilities, again, particularly language.[1]

Work
His 1997 book, The Symbolic Species: The Co-evolution of Language and the Brain is widely considered a seminal work in the subject of evolutionary cognition. His approach to semiotics, thoroughly described in the book, is fueled by a career-long interest in the ideas of the late 19th-century American philosopher, Charles Sanders Peirce. In it, he uses the metaphors of parasite and host to describe language and the brain, respectively, arguing that the structures of language have co-evolved to adapt to their brain hosts.

His 2011 book, Incomplete Nature: How Mind Emerged from Matter, explores the properties of life, the emergence of consciousness, and the relationship between evolutionary and semiotic processes. The book speculates on how properties such as information, value, purpose, meaning, and end-directed behavior emerged from physics and chemistry. Critics of the book argue that Deacon has drawn heavily from the works of Alicia Juarrero and Evan Thompson without providing full citations or references, but a UC Berkeley investigation exonerated Deacon.[2]

In contrast to the arguments presented by Juarrero in Dynamics in Action (1999, MIT Press) and by Thompson in Mind in Life (2007, Belknap Press and Harvard University Press), Deacon explicitly rejects claims that living or mental phenomena can be explained by dynamical systems approaches.[3] Instead, Deacon argues that life- or mind-like properties only emerge from a higher-order reciprocal relationship between self-organizing processes

Plagiarism Investigation Exonerates Terrence W. Deacon
Over the course of the last 13 months, UC Berkeley Professor of Anthropology Terrence W. Deacon has been the subject of a relentless email and Internet campaign alleging that in his 2012 book, Incomplete Nature: How Mind Emerged from Matter, as well as in other publications, he plagiarized ideas, theories and concepts from a 1999 book, Dynamics in Action, by Dr. Alicia Juarrero, professor emerita of philosophy at Prince George's Community College in Maryland and from articles by two of Juarrero's associates, Dr. Carl Rubino, a classics professor at Hamilton College in New York, and Michael Lissack, executive director of the Institute for the Study of Coherence and Emergence in Florida.  UC Berkeley appointed a committee of two senior members of its faculty to investigate misconduct charges brought by Juarrero, Rubino and Lissack against Deacon. The committee issued its report, finding "no evidence to support" the allegations against Deacon, which it concluded were "without foundation."

Plagiarism is one of the most serious charges that can be brought against research scholars, with the potential to destroy professional reputations and devastate careers.  Consequently, when an institution's investigation finds such misconduct allegations to be fallacious, it has an affirmative obligation to repair the damage done to the falsely accused.  That is not just a moral obligation; it is a legal one as well. The Federal regulation that governs the manner in which research misconduct investigations are conducted requires that efforts be made to restore the reputation of persons wrongly accused. 1  Consistent with that mandate, and our institutional responsibility, this web page will set the record straight regarding the background, the allegations and the University's investigation and findings.  What follows is a detailed narrative that explains how the campaign against Deacon unfolded, examines how the allegations were addressed by the University, and culminates with a summary of a recently completed investigation into the allegations.

RELEVANT UC BERKELEY POLICIES
Berkeley's research misconduct policy  is modeled on federal regulations  which define research misconduct to include plagiarism -- "the appropriation of another person's ideas, processes, results, or words without giving appropriate credit."  According to regulation, in order to constitute research misconduct, plagiarism must be a "significant departure from accepted practices of the relevant research community" and must be "committed intentionally, knowingly, or recklessly."2   Federal regulations authorize institutions to initiate an inquiry if allegations "are sufficiently credible and specific so that potential evidence of research misconduct may be identified."3  University policy establishes procedures for investigation of allegations of research misconduct, which begin by reference to the Associate Vice Chancellor for Research. When sufficiently credible and specific allegations are presented, the Associate Vice Chancellor may appoint a committee to conduct an initial inquiry to determine whether sufficient evidence exists to warrant a full investigation.

In addition to the University's policy on research misconduct, Berkeley's Faculty Code of Conduct prohibits "[v]iolation of canons of intellectual honesty, such as research misconduct and/or intentional misappropriation of the writings, research, and findings of others."

Terrence Deacon, a professor at UC Berkeley, faced allegations of plagiarism in his 2012 book, "Incomplete Nature: How Mind Emerged from Matter." These allegations were made by Dr. Alicia Juarrero and others. UC Berkeley appointed a committee to investigate these charges and concluded that there was "no evidence to support" the allegations against Deacon, finding them "without foundation." Plagiarism is considered a serious offense in academia, and the investigation aimed to clear Deacon's name and reputation. The investigation followed federal regulations and Berkeley's policies on research misconduct, which include plagiarism as a significant departure from accepted practices in the research community.

Here is a summary of the key points:

- Alicia Juarrero, Carl Rubino, and Michael Lissack made allegations of plagiarism against Terrence Deacon stemming from his book Incomplete Nature and various publications. 

- They claimed he appropriated ideas, theories, and concepts from Juarrero's 1999 book Dynamics in Action and from articles by Rubino and Lissack without proper attribution. 

- UC Berkeley appointed a committee to investigate the allegations per their research misconduct policy. 

- The committee thoroughly reviewed the materials, including a spreadsheet from Juarrero listing over 200 claimed similarities. 

- They found no evidence that Deacon plagiarized and concluded the allegations were "without foundation." There was considerable overlap in issues discussed but the works differed in focus, concepts, and conclusions. 

- Many of the claimed similarities involved standard or unoriginal ideas in the literature. Mere conceptual similarity is not evidence of plagiarism. 

- Later allegations made by Lissack against additional works by Deacon were also found to be false, as Deacon's works predated the ones he was accused of plagiarizing from.

- The investigation committee fully exonerated Deacon, finding the allegations unsupported. UC Berkeley is now correcting the damage to Deacon's reputation from the unfounded allegations.

In summary, an in-depth investigation cleared Terrence Deacon of all plagiarism allegations, but the university is taking steps to restore his reputation after the false accusations were spread so widely.

As noted above, The Cashman/Deacon 201 1article
is the subject of a second plagiarism allegation by
Juarrero.. In an email memorandum to Price,
Juarrero asserted that Deacon appropriated original
ideas that she had developed in an article published
in 2010 (in Aguilar and Buckareff, eds., Causing
Human Actions: New Perspectives on the Causal
Theory of Action).1 5 This allegation is demonstrably
false, for the chapter in which Cashman/Deacon
supposedly committed their acts of plagiarism was
actually written in 2009, a year before Juarrero's MIT
anthology article was published. We know this
because the University received the following
statement from the editor of the volume in which the
Cashman/Deacon chapter appeared: "While the
publication date of the volume is 2011, they
[Cashman/Deacon] emailed me a final draft of their
chapter on October 30, 2009. No changes were
made to their article after this date. I have email
evidence of this, should it be necessary to prove." 16
Since Deacon could not have plagiarized from a work
published a year after his chapter in question was
submitted, and since Juarrero/Rubino could not have
plagiarized from the Deacon chapter they
presumably had not seen, it would appear that there
is only one explanation for the similarities between
the two chapters; i.e., the explanation which is
rejected so vehemently by Juarrero - that the
authors are "working in the same field."
ChatGPT
ChatGPT
Alicia Juarrero accused Terrence Deacon of plagiarizing from her work in a 2010 article, but this allegation was proven false. Deacon's chapter, which was accused of plagiarism, was actually written in 2009, a year before Juarrero's article was published. The editor of the volume where Deacon's chapter appeared confirmed this with email evidence. Therefore, the similarities between the chapters can be attributed to both authors working in the same field rather than plagiarism.

Perhaps the most remarkable allegation of
plagiarism was raised by Lissack while the
committee's investigation was underway and well
after his written commitment to Deacon that he
would refrain from allegations of this sort. On
October 17, 2012, Lissack wrote to Price alleging
that Deacon had plagiarized Lissack's 2003
"Redefinition of Memes" article in a 2004 book
chapter titled "Memes as Signs in the Dynamic Logic
of Semiosis." Lissack claimed that "[a] reading of
both works will indicate that Deacon appropriated
my concept of the meme as a'sign' for an
environmental niche' and failed to provide attribution
or citation." 1 7 On October 22, Price wrote back,
asking Lissack to confirm Price's understanding that
Lissack was claiming that "concepts in the earlier
publication.. . are so unique that their use in the
later publication without attribution must constitute
plagiarism." On October 25, Lissack responded that
[y]our understanding is correct."18
Like the allegation discussed immediately above,
this allegation is demonstrably false. For as the
investigation committee found, "Lissack does not
seem to be aware that the Deacon chapter is a lightly
edited reprint of Deacon's 'Editorial: Memes as Signs,
published in 1999," four years before the appearance
of Lissack's "Redefinition of Memes" article. In other
words, Deacon's article was published first, so the
ideas in it could not have been plagiarized from an
article published years later. If one were to apply
Lissack's logic that conceptual similarity is evidence
of plagiarism, then one would have to conclude that
it was Lissack, not Deacon, who committed
plagiarism. (The University does not contend that
Lissack plagiarized Deacon, but it believes that this
example highlights the absurdity of the plagiarism
claims against Deacon).
ChatGPT
ChatGPT
A plagiarism allegation was raised by Michael Lissack, claiming that Terrence Deacon plagiarized his 2003 "Redefinition of Memes" article in a 2004 book chapter. However, this allegation was proven false as Deacon's chapter was a lightly edited reprint of his own work from 1999, published years before Lissack's article. If one were to consider conceptual similarity as evidence of plagiarism, it would suggest that Lissack, not Deacon, committed plagiarism. This example illustrates the absurdity of the plagiarism claims against Deacon.

WHAT DOES PLAGIARISM MEAN, AND CAN LISSACK, JUARRERO AND RUBINO MEET THEIR OWN STANDARDS?

UC  Berkeley policy describes plagiarism ���consistent with federal regulations ��� as the intentional, knowing or reckless appropriation of another's ideas or words without attribution and in violation of scholarly norms.  Similarly, the University's Faculty Code of Conduct prohibits the intentional misappropriation of the research or findings of others.  These standards prohibit writers from knowingly claiming the original ideas of others to be their own. They do not, however, require that writers using common concepts and terminology, standard examples, or well-known scholarly references cite every scholar who has previously employed those same terms, examples and references. Nor do they require that scholars advancing general concepts or positions that have been proposed for decades cite every other thinker who has done so. Requiring such broad citation would be impractical and would inhibit scholarship by raising fears that missing any prior scholar's writings on similar topics could result in charges of plagiarism or misconduct.

Lissack and his institute, have, however, proposed a new definition of plagiarism, which they call "plagiarism by negligence."  They claim that plagiarism extends beyond the conventional definition to include a failure to cite any preceding works that make use of similar concepts, explore similar ideas, or recapitulate similar, even if unoriginal, arguments.  They ask rhetorically, does "an academic have an affirmative obligation to cite or make reference to those who preceded him or her in working on similar ideas?"  They assert that ignorance of similar preceding work does not excuse lack of citation, for in the age of Google access to preceding work is easy and thus ignorance of such work represents negligence���the lack of citation constitutes "plagiarism by negligence."  "There is no excuse," declares Lissack in a recent paper, "to even tolerate the idea that in the Internet Age it is acceptable ��� to fail to see what others have written before publishing his own work. . .  Plagiarism by negligence is still plagiarism." [emphasis added]. 19

To adopt this novel standard for defining plagiarism would create some "interesting" situations. Take, for example, the intellectual arena of human thermodynamics, a topic that both Deacon and Juarrero address in their respective books. Hmolpedia: An Encyclopedia of Human Thermodynamics, Human Chemistry and Human Physics maintains a webpage, "HT pioneers," which lists scientists and writers who over the years have contributed theory and logic to the understanding of the thermodynamics of human existence.  At the moment the page lists some 505 individuals.20  How many of these authors would Deacon and Juarrero have to cite to avoid a charge of plagiarism under Lissack's novel definition?   Note that this list does not include either Juarrero or Deacon, both of whom have written on the thermodynamics of human existence.  So even the encyclopedic Encyclopedia of Human Thermodynamics may not meet Lissack's standards of complete citation  committee properly rejected this attempt to redefine plagiarism, concluding that "failure to cite an earlier work with the same subject matter, even an important one, is not by itself research misconduct."  Furthermore, the report demonstrates that the standard that Lissack and his institute  would apply to Deacon is not one that Juarrero, Rubino and Lissack have always met in their own scholarship. The committee described Juarrero's and Rubino's failure to cite Brian McLaughlin's "well known and comprehensive 1992 treatment of the history of emergentism" in their "Introduction to Emergence" paper.  Despite his claim that the similarity between the two papers could be explained only by plagiarism, Lissack failed to cite Deacon's 1999 "Memes as Signs" essay in his own 2003 "Redefinition of Memes" article.   Practice varies among scholars, and some are more exhaustive than others in citing prior authors.  Thus, it can certainly be argued that it would have been an improvement for Deacon to find and cite Juarrero's Dynamics in Action, or for Juarrero and Rubino to find and cite Brian McLaughlin, or for Lissack to find and cite Deacon.  But that is a discussion about academic style and comprehensiveness, not plagiarism or academic misconduct.
ChatGPT
ChatGPT
Plagiarism, as defined by UC Berkeley policy and scholarly norms, involves intentionally appropriating another's ideas or words without attribution. However, Lissack and his institute proposed a broader definition, including "plagiarism by negligence," suggesting that failure to cite preceding works with similar concepts could be considered plagiarism. This novel standard could create complex situations, such as when scholars address well-established topics. The committee investigating Terrence Deacon found that failure to cite earlier works with similar subject matter, even if important, is not research misconduct. They also noted instances where Juarrero, Rubino, and Lissack themselves did not fully meet this standard in their own scholarship.

Alicia Juarrero, along with Carl Rubino and Michael Lissack, alleged plagiarism against Terrence Deacon regarding his book "Incomplete Nature." UC Berkeley conducted an investigation and found no evidence of plagiarism. The allegations were based on conceptual overlap, but the works differed in focus and conclusions. Lissack later accused Deacon of plagiarizing his work, but it was proven that Deacon's article predated Lissack's. The debate centered on differing definitions of plagiarism, with Lissack proposing a novel "plagiarism by negligence" concept.
