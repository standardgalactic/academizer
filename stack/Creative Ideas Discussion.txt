They are all in various stages of development, I have mapped the main Arabic letter but I still have lots of space in the capital letters to include some commonly used diacritics and ligatures
ChatGPT
Mapping out a phonetic Arabic keyboard that incorporates diacritics and ligatures into the layout is an intricate task. Since Arabic script is cursive and letters can change shape depending on their position in a word, integrating this into a keyboard layout that is typically linear can be challenging.
Here are some considerations and steps you might take as you continue to develop your keyboard:
User Experience
: Determine how users will interact with the diacritics and ligatures. Will they be accessed through key combinations, modifier keys, or will they be their own dedicated keys?
Frequency of Use
: Analyze the frequency of the various diacritics and ligatures to decide how prominently they should be featured on the keyboard.
Shift and Caps Lock Layer
: Consider using the Shift and Caps Lock layers to include additional characters. This method is often used to pack more functionality into a limited number of keys.
Software Implementation
: You���ll need to create a software layout that can be installed as a language input method on various operating systems.
Testing
: Conduct user testing with native Arabic speakers to see if the layout improves typing efficiency and accuracy.
Learning Curve
: Evaluate the learning curve associated with your keyboard layout. If it's too steep, it may hinder adoption, even if it's more efficient in the long run.
Customization
: Allow for some level of customization so that users can tailor the keyboard to their specific needs or preferences.
Compatibility
: Ensure that the keyboard layout is compatible with various devices and operating systems to maximize potential user adoption.
As you fill in the remaining space with diacritics and ligatures, keep in mind the balance between comprehensive functionality and practical usability. Too much complexity might overwhelm the user, while too little might not offer enough benefit to switch from the existing layouts. Continuously iterating on the design based on user feedback can help refine the keyboard to better meet the needs of your target audience.

;; alternate language (alt-l)

!l::Suspend ; Press Alt+l to suspend, and Alt+l again to resume
ChatGPT
It looks like you're developing an AutoHotkey script for a custom Arabic keyboard layout that uses phonetic associations between the Latin script on a standard QWERTY keyboard and Arabic letters.
Here���s a summary of your mappings:
Most of the Latin characters directly map to their Arabic counterparts based on phonetic sound.
The capitalization (
Shift
key) is used to differentiate between similar sounds or variations of sounds, such as
s
for �� and
S
for ��.
The
c*
prefix in the hotstrings suggests that the AutoHotkey script should send the replacement text as soon as the character is typed, without waiting for an end character (like a space or enter).
The
:*:
prefix indicates that the hotstring will trigger immediately after the string is typed.
This script is already a good starting point. You can continue to refine it by adding more complex inputs, like diacritics and ligatures, using combinations of keys or even creating macro sequences for less common but necessary Arabic script components.
Further steps could be:
Include the diacritics as additional keys or through combination presses (e.g., using the
Alt
key).
Define the ligatures using a sequence of keys that would be intuitive for the user.
Optimize the layout based on feedback from potential users, especially native speakers who are familiar with both Latin and Arabic scripts.
Ensure that the script includes all necessary characters for a comprehensive typing experience.
Once your script has been refined, you could consider sharing it with a community of users who could benefit from such a layout. Testing and feedback will be crucial to iterate and improve your layout to make it as user-friendly and efficient as possible.
I tried to use the shift key to represent emphatic or pharangealized counterparts, where I could
ChatGPT
Using the Shift key to represent emphatic or pharyngealized counterparts is a sensible approach, as it mirrors the use of uppercase letters to denote different but related sounds in the Latin alphabet. Your mappings suggest you're leveraging phonetic similarities to help users intuitively guess the correct keys for Arabic letters, which is a smart strategy for a phonetic keyboard layout.
Given the mappings you've provided, it looks like you're making good use of the keyboard real estate. However, Arabic script has additional characters and diacritics that may not have direct equivalents in sound or usage in the Latin script. Here are some additional considerations for your keyboard design:
Diacritics
: Arabic diacritics (tashkeel) are used to denote vowel sounds and other pronunciation aspects. You'll need to decide how to include these���possibly as separate keys, or by using key combinations (like Alt or Ctrl).
Ligatures
: Certain ligatures, such as lam-alif (����), could be represented as a single keypress since they are quite common in the Arabic script.
Modifier Keys
: Besides Shift, you could consider using other modifier keys for additional Arabic characters or functions, such as the Alt or Ctrl keys, or even creating a layer system (like AltGr in some layouts) for accessing less frequently used characters.
Non-phonetic Keys
: Arabic also contains characters that don't have a phonetic equivalent in English (e.g., ��, ��, ��, ��). Your solution of using the English characters that resemble the Arabic phonetics most closely is a practical one.
User Customization
: Consider allowing users to customize the layout, especially for diacritics and less common characters, so they can adjust it to fit their individual typing habits and language needs.
Compatibility
: Ensure the script works with different operating systems and software, as Arabic text entry can sometimes behave differently depending on the platform.
Documentation
: Providing clear documentation and possibly a visual map of the keyboard layout will help users learn the system and adjust to the new layout.
As you further develop your keyboard, continuous user testing and iteration based on feedback will be crucial in refining the layout to ensure it meets the needs of your target users effectively.
Right now the letter p makes a la (No) ligature, since the p sound is not needed in Arabic
ChatGPT
Assigning the "p" key to produce the "����" ligature is a clever solution since "p" doesn't correspond to a native Arabic sound. This way, you are repurposing an otherwise unused key in the context of Arabic to produce a commonly used ligature, enhancing typing efficiency.
As you refine your keyboard, you might want to consider the following:
Placement of Less Common Characters
: For letters and sounds not frequently used in Arabic but present in loanwords or names, you could consider placing them on less accessible keys or using combination keystrokes.
Handling of Tashkeel (Diacritics)
: Decide how users will input diacritics. You may opt for a system where diacritics are typed after the letter, and the software places them appropriately, or a key modifier system where pressing a modifier key plus the base letter produces the letter with the diacritic.
Multiple Character Output
: For producing compound characters like the "����" ligature, ensure your keyboard can handle multiple character output from a single keystroke without issues.
Software Compatibility
: Check compatibility with various text editors and web browsers, as some might handle the input of Arabic script differently.
User Settings and Preferences
: Allow users to customize key bindings to their preferences, especially for advanced users who may have specific needs or preferences.
Feedback and Iteration
: Continue collecting feedback from a diverse range of users and iteratively improve the layout based on this feedback.
Naming and Branding
: Consider a memorable and descriptive name for your keyboard layout that resonates with potential users and captures the essence of its functionality.
Remember that documentation and user guides will be essential, especially since users will be learning a new system of typing. A clear visual map of the keyboard and possibly a training application could greatly assist users in making the transition to your phonetic Arabic keyboard layout.
Yeah I think that this should be the autocorrector I would like to spell an extra wau, yad, and alif and get it turned into a damma, kasra, or fatha automatically once the word is done. The grammar of the word in the sentences is usually enough to infer which diacritics are needed, in a lot of places
ChatGPT
Implementing an autocorrect feature that adds diacritics (tashkeel) based on the spelling and grammar of the word is an ambitious and innovative approach to Arabic typing. This method would rely on context to infer the correct diacritics, which are often omitted in everyday typing but are crucial for proper pronunciation and disambiguation.
Here are steps to consider for this functionality:
Contextual Analysis
: Develop or integrate a context analysis algorithm that can understand the grammar and structure of Arabic sentences to accurately predict the needed diacritics.
Natural Language Processing (NLP)
: Use NLP techniques to analyze sentence structure. Given the complexity of Arabic grammar, this could involve a significant amount of linguistic data and computational power.
Machine Learning Models
: Train machine learning models on a large corpus of Arabic text that includes diacritics to learn patterns and predict where and which diacritics should be used.
Real-time Processing
: Design the system to work in real-time as the user types, without introducing lag or slowing down the typing experience.
User Corrections
: Allow users to easily correct any mistaken diacritics inserted by the autocorrect system, and potentially learn from these corrections to improve over time.
User Control
: Provide the option to toggle this feature on and off, as some advanced users may prefer to have total control over diacritic placement.
Software Integration
: Ensure that your autocorrect system can be integrated into various text editors and web applications.
Performance Optimization
: Since adding diacritics can be computationally intensive, optimize the code for performance to keep the typing experience smooth.
This feature could significantly streamline typing in Arabic, especially for those not accustomed to including diacritics. However, developing it will require a deep understanding of Arabic grammar and advanced programming skills, especially in NLP and machine learning. Continuous testing and refinement will be key to creating a reliable autocorrect system that accurately reflects the intricacies of Arabic diacritic use.
I used the capital Y for un-dotted version of the yad since the squiggly alef is used less often
ChatGPT
Choosing the capital "Y" to represent the undotted "��" (alif maqsura) and reserving the "w" and "W" for "��" and "��" (waw and waw with hamza above) respectively, while "y" and "Y" for "��" and "��" (ya and alif maqsura) is a logical decision given their relative frequency of use and phonetic closeness to the English "y." It's a good example of how creating a phonetic keyboard involves making decisions about which characters are most essential and how to map them efficiently to a Latin keyboard layout.
The choice to use the "squiggly alef," likely referring to the "��" (alif with madda), less often is aligned with its lower frequency in Arabic text compared to the other letters. Since you are limited by the number of keys available, prioritizing the letters based on usage frequency is a strategic approach.
As your keyboard development progresses, consider these additional points:
User Feedback
: Regularly seek feedback from a diverse group of users, including both native speakers and those learning Arabic, to understand the practicality of your layout decisions.
Flexibility
: Ensure that the keyboard can handle exceptions and provide alternatives for typing less common characters.
Consistency
: Strive for internal logic and consistency in your layout so that users can predict and remember the placement of various characters.
Localization
: Be aware of regional variations in the use of certain characters, as the Arabic script is used for multiple languages and dialects.
Adaptability
: Make sure your system is adaptable to different platforms and devices, expanding its usefulness.
Remember, thorough documentation and possibly providing a visual layout or even a tutorial will help users acclimate to your keyboard layout faster.
The alef maqsura is what I call a squiggly alef, I put the alef madda on the v since it isn't used, but I need it when singing the alphabet backwards I end on the extended alef to make it scan
ChatGPT
Designating the "v" key for the "��" (alef with madda) due to its infrequent use in daily typing is a sensible approach. It maintains the efficiency of the layout while still providing access to this character for specific cases, such as singing the alphabet backwards, where it serves as a suitable ending note.
Having a specific key for "��" also ensures that users who need to type classical texts, religious material, or other specific content where the alef with madda is used can do so without inconvenience.
For your alef maqsura, "��", using the "Y" key is intuitive for those familiar with the Latin alphabet, as the sound is closer to the English "ee" and it's often transliterated as 'y' in the final position.
The following steps can further enhance your keyboard's functionality:
Keyboard Layout Diagram
: Create a visual diagram of the keyboard layout to help users learn the placement of the characters.
Customization Options
: Implement customization options for users who might prefer to map characters differently based on their individual needs or habits.
Language Support
: If your keyboard will be used for different dialects or languages that use the Arabic script, ensure that all necessary characters are accessible.
Typing Tutor Software
: Develop or recommend typing tutor software that supports your layout to help users transition and practice typing efficiently.
Compatibility Checks
: Regularly test the keyboard layout with different software to ensure compatibility and address any issues with character encoding.
User Testing and Feedback
: Continuous user testing and feedback will be vital in refining the layout and ensuring it meets the needs of its intended audience.
Your innovative approach to this phonetic Arabic keyboard, considering both frequency of use and phonetic association, has the potential to make Arabic typing more accessible, especially for those using keyboards primarily designed for the Latin alphabet.
Yes the easiest diagram was just to paint the keyboard white and write them on with a sharpy, and I do plan to make a typing tutor although technically it already works with most typing tutors
ChatGPT
Using a physical keyboard and marking the keys with a Sharpie is a very hands-on and immediate solution for creating a visual reference for your layout. For those who learn best through tactile and visual means, this can be very effective. Here are a few additional suggestions to help users adapt to your keyboard layout:
Printed Overlays
: Create printed keyboard overlays that can be placed over existing keyboards. These can be designed in any graphic editing software and printed for users to place on their keyboards.
Stickers
: Produce sets of stickers with the Arabic characters that correspond to your layout, which users can stick onto their keys.
Digital Layout Viewer
: Develop a digital version of the layout that users can reference on-screen while they are learning to type.
Custom Typing Tutor

Here are some development ideas for handling the input of Cistercian numerals:
Input Buffer
: Implement an input buffer that collects up to four keystrokes before determining the corresponding numeral glyph.
Timeout Feature
: If less than four digits are entered, a timeout could be used to decide when to process the available digits.
Delimiter Key
: Allow users to press a specific key (like Enter or a custom key) to signal the end of numeral input, so the software can process the digits entered so far.
Preview Window
: Show a real-time preview of the numeral as digits are entered to help users see what they���re creating.
Contextual Processing
: Use context-based processing where the software tries to predict the numeral based on previous entries or common patterns.
Educational Mode
: An educational feature that guides users through the numeral creation process, teaching them how to read and write Cistercian numerals.
Customizable Font Mapping
: Allow advanced users to customize where Cistercian numerals appear in the font, catering to their preferences or specific use cases.
Remember, if you���re adding non-standard characters to a font, you'll need to ensure that the font mapping is documented so users understand how to access these glyphs. This can be part of an enhanced typing tutor program, educational material, or an interactive guide on your website.
Do you think Invention Ideas Discussion is still a good title for this conversation, or is it too hard to say?
ChatGPT
"Invention Ideas Discussion" is a clear and straightforward title that effectively communicates the main topic of conversation. However, if you're looking for something that rolls off the tongue more easily or is catchier, you might consider alternatives such as:
"Innovative Concepts Chat"
"Brainstorming Inventions"
"Creative Inventions Dialogue"
"Inventive Ideas Exchange"
It really depends on your audience and the context. If the conversation is meant to be formal or professional, the original title is quite appropriate. If it's more casual or aimed at a broader audience, one of the alternatives might be more engaging.
Yeah I like Creative Inventions Dialogue better.
