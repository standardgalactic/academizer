Sorry that was written by someone else. The book he wrote was called Good Enough
ChatGPT
ChatGPT
"Good Enough: The Tolerance for Mediocrity in Nature and Society" is a book by Daniel S. Milo. In this work, Milo challenges the widespread belief that nature does everything as efficiently and effectively as possible. Contrary to the notion that natural processes exemplify optimization and excellence, Milo argues that nature often settles for 'good enough' solutions rather than optimal ones.
The book explores examples from various natural phenomena, demonstrating how many biological processes and structures are not necessarily the best that they could be, but are merely sufficient for survival and reproduction. This concept is then extended to human society, where Milo suggests that a similar principle of 'good enough' often applies in cultural, economic, and technological contexts.
Milo's argument questions the perfection often attributed to natural selection and evolutionary processes, offering a fresh perspective on how we understand both nature and our own human endeavors. This approach encourages a rethinking of excellence and efficiency, not only in the natural world but also in our personal and societal ambitions.

An exhilarating, genre-bending exploration of curiosity���s powerful capacity to connect ideas and people.

Curious about something? Google it. Look at it. Ask a question. But is curiosity simply information seeking? According to this exhilarating, genre-bending book, what���s left out of the conventional understanding of curiosity are the wandering tracks, the weaving concepts, the knitting of ideas, and the thatching of knowledge systems���the networks, the relations between ideas and between people. Curiosity, say Perry Zurn and Dani Bassett, is a practice of it connects ideas into networks of knowledge, and it connects knowers themselves, both to the knowledge they seek and to each other.

Zurn and Bassett���identical twins who write that their book ���represents the thought of one mind and two bodies������harness their respective expertise in the humanities and the sciences to get irrepressibly curious about curiosity. Traipsing across literatures of antiquity and medieval science, Victorian poetry and nature essays, as well as work by writers from a variety of marginalized communities, they trace a multitudinous curiosity. They identify three styles of curiosity���the busybody, who collects stories, creating loose knowledge networks; the hunter, who hunts down secrets or discoveries, creating tight networks; and the dancer, who takes leaps of creative imagination, creating loopy ones. Investigating what happens in a curious brain, they offer an accessible account of the network neuroscience of curiosity. And they sketch out a new kind of curiosity-centric and inclusive education that embraces everyone���s curiosity. The book performs the very curiosity that it describes, inviting readers to participate���to be curious with the book and not simply about it.

I thought it was interesting how gifts to children were said to be to encourage curiosity about certain topics or to discourage it.
ChatGPT
ChatGPT
The idea that gifts to children can be used to either encourage or discourage curiosity about certain topics is indeed fascinating and ties in well with the themes explored in both "Curious Minds: The Power of Connection" and "Good Enough: The Tolerance for Mediocrity in Nature and Society".
Encouraging Curiosity
: Gifts that encourage curiosity often involve open-ended, explorative elements. These can include science kits, art supplies, books on various subjects, or puzzles. Such gifts align with the notion in "Curious Minds" that curiosity is about forming connections and networks of knowledge. They stimulate children to explore, ask questions, and make connections between different ideas and concepts.
Discouraging Curiosity
: On the other hand, gifts that discourage curiosity are typically more restrictive and may focus on rote learning or have a single, unchangeable outcome. These types of gifts might include more prescriptive toys or games with rigid rules and limited scope for imagination. This concept resonates with the ideas in "Good Enough", where the focus is not necessarily on achieving perfection or optimal outcomes but on what is functional and satisfactory.
Impact on Child Development
: The nature of gifts given to children can significantly influence their developmental trajectory. Encouraging curiosity can foster creativity, problem-solving skills, and a love of learning. In contrast, discouraging curiosity can lead to a more limited view of the world and a reluctance to explore or challenge existing knowledge.
Reflection of Societal Values
: The types of gifts adults choose for children also reflect broader societal values and beliefs about education, success, and the nature of learning. Societies valuing innovation and creativity may lean towards gifts that encourage exploration and questioning. In contrast, societies emphasizing conformity and rote learning might prefer more structured, less explorative gifts.
In summary, the selection of gifts for children can be a subtle yet powerful tool in shaping their approach to learning and curiosity. It reflects and reinforces the ideas presented in both "Curious Minds" and "Good Enough" about the nature of learning, exploration, and the value (or lack thereof) placed on perfection and optimal outcomes.

I thought it was interesting how the word curiosity comes the word "care". The expression "curiosity killed the cat" was originally "care killed the cat" as in "worry"
ChatGPT
ChatGPT
The etymology of the word "curiosity" and the evolution of the expression "curiosity killed the cat" are indeed intriguing aspects of language and culture. The connection to "care" offers a different perspective on the concept of curiosity.
Etymology of 'Curiosity'
: The word "curiosity" stems from Latin "curiositas", meaning "carefulness" or "inquisitiveness". It is related to "curiosus" ("careful, diligent, curious"), which itself is derived from "cura" meaning "care". This origin underscores the aspect of curiosity that involves careful consideration, attention, and a desire to know or learn.
Original Expression "Care Killed the Cat"
: The phrase "care killed the cat" is an older version of "curiosity killed the cat". In this context, "care" refers to worry or sorrow. This older version suggests that excessive worry or overthinking could be harmful, a caution against being overly concerned or anxious.
Evolution to "Curiosity Killed the Cat"
: Over time, the phrase evolved into "curiosity killed the cat", shifting the focus from worry to a warning about the potential dangers of unnecessary investigation or exploration. This modern interpretation suggests that being too inquisitive can lead to trouble or harm.
Cultural Interpretation
: These phrases reflect cultural attitudes towards curiosity and caution. While "curiosity" is generally seen as a positive trait that drives learning and discovery, there's also an acknowledgment of its potential downsides when it leads to meddling in dangerous or unknown areas.
Relation to "Curious Minds" and "Good Enough"
: In the context of "Curious Minds: The Power of Connection", curiosity is celebrated as a connective and creative force. In contrast, "Good Enough: The Tolerance for Mediocrity in Nature and Society" might imply a more cautious approach to curiosity, suggesting that seeking perfection (or complete knowledge) is not always necessary or desirable.
The transition from "care killed the cat" to "curiosity killed the cat" illustrates how the perception of curiosity has evolved over time, from a focus on the dangers of worry to the risks of excessive inquisitiveness, yet always acknowledging its fundamental role in human behavior and thought.

The earliest printed reference to the original proverb appears in the 1598 play, Every Man in His Humour, written by the English playwright Ben Jonson:[1]

Helter skelter, hang sorrow, care 'll kill a cat, up-tails all, and a louse for the hangman.

The play was first performed by Shakespeare's playing company, the Lord Chamberlain's Men. Shakespeare used a similar quote in his circa 1599 play, Much Ado About Nothing:

What, courage man! what though care killed a cat, thou hast mettle enough in thee to kill care.

The proverb remained the same until at least 1898. Ebenezer Cobham Brewer included this definition in his Dictionary of Phrase and Fable:

Care killed the Cat.
It is said that "a cat has nine lives," yet care would wear them all out.

Abstract
Intelligence is a central feature of human beings��� primary and interpersonal experience. Understanding how intelligence originated and scaled during evolution is a key challenge for modern biology. Some of the most important approaches to understanding intelligence are the ongoing efforts to build new intelligences in computer science (AI) and bioengineering. However, progress has been stymied by a lack of multidisciplinary consensus on what is central about intelligence regardless of the details of its material composition or origin (evolved vs. engineered). We show that Buddhist concepts offer a unique perspective and facilitate a consilience of biology, cognitive science, and computer science toward understanding intelligence in truly diverse embodiments. In coming decades, chimeric and bioengineering technologies will produce a wide variety of novel beings that look nothing like familiar natural life forms; how shall we gauge their moral responsibility and our own moral obligations toward them, without the familiar touchstones of standard evolved forms as comparison? Such decisions cannot be based on what the agent is made of or how much design vs. natural evolution was involved in their origin. We propose that the scope of our potential relationship with, and so also our moral duty toward, any being can be considered in the light of Care���a robust, practical, and dynamic lynchpin that formalizes the concepts of goal-directedness, stress, and the scaling of intelligence; it provides a rubric that, unlike other current concepts, is likely to not only survive but thrive in the coming advances of AI and bioengineering. We review relevant concepts in basal cognition and Buddhist thought, focusing on the size of an agent���s goal space (its cognitive light cone) as an invariant that tightly links intelligence and compassion. Implications range across interpersonal psychology, regenerative medicine, and machine learning. The Bodhisattva���s vow (���for the sake of all sentient life, I shall achieve awakening���) is a practical design principle for advancing intelligence in our novel creations and in ourselves
