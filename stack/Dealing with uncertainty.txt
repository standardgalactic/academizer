Dealing with uncertainty
In ancient days, people had very little control over lots of random elements of the environment which could kill them.

Sure, you could learn to predict the behavior of predators and large dangerous herbivores *fairly* well, and you could get pretty good at knowing how to avoid being bitten or stung by something lethal, and you could do a decent job of predicting the weather that would come over the next few days, etc.

But a) there were still lots of things that could badly surprise you, and a *lot* of metaphorical dice being rolled, and b) once surprised, you often had not much at all in the way of recourse.  There are a lot of stretches in our history where a hurricane shows up and you just die, you break your leg and you happen to be away from your tribe and you just die, you were careless for a few seconds and didn't see the viper and you just die, it doesn't rain for a while and there's no food and you just die, you come across a hostile stranger and you just die.

One (oversimplified but centrally sound) lens with which to view civilization is as a process for increasing our ability to predict and control the future, or (equivalently) a process for *insulating* ourselves from such unpleasant surprises, and their consequences.

Agriculture is the archetypal example.  Food all around you in bounty!  But what if there's a drought or a blight or whatever?  Build up a stockpile, sow seeds to make the next year's crop more plentiful and more reliable, dig ditches and canals for irrigation in case the rains never come.  Put in work now to reduce uncertainty and create a buffer.

We've gotten used to feeling like we can be *confident* about the future, *confident* that we won't suddenly just get snuffed out.  And that feeling is relatively justified, in the modern era.  Lives are substantially more predictable (and mistakes more recoverable) than they were even 200 years ago, let alone 20,000.

A friend recently asked me how I'm doing okay with my belief in a high probability of AI doom over the next decade or two, and part of my answer was "same way people used to handle the constant looming threat of earthquakes and tsunamis and stampedes and wildfires and plagues and famines and grumpy moose and hippos."

There was a local peak of control-over-the-future + ability-to-predict-the-future, and now we're sliding away from it a little bit.  But it's more of a return to baseline.  People always coped.  I refuse to do *worse,* emotionally, just because I had a higher set-point thanks to historical privilege.

It's true that humans have always had to deal with uncertainty and unexpected events that can threaten their lives and well-being. As you mentioned, civilization has allowed us to increase our ability to predict and control the future, but it's important to remember that this process is not perfect, and there are still many things that we cannot fully control or predict.
The advent of artificial intelligence and the potential risks it poses is just one example of this. It's natural to feel anxious or fearful about the unknown, but it's important to also remember that humans have faced many challenges throughout history and have found ways to cope and adapt.
As an AI language model, I cannot predict the future, but I can say that it's important to continue to work towards understanding and mitigating potential risks associated with emerging technologies like AI. At the same time, it's important to also focus on the things that we can control and make positive changes in our own lives and communities.
Ultimately, it's important to maintain a sense of perspective and balance when thinking about the future and the challenges that we may face. We cannot eliminate uncertainty or risk, but we can work to prepare ourselves and build resilience to better cope with whatever comes our way.

ChatGPT
Yes, minimizing surprise has been a central goal of human civilization since its inception. From agriculture to medicine to engineering, humans have always sought to reduce uncertainty and increase control over their environment in order to minimize the chances of negative surprises.
In the context of emerging technologies like AI, minimizing surprise becomes even more important. This is because AI has the potential to be very powerful and can have significant impacts on society. It's important to understand how these technologies work and what their potential risks are in order to make informed decisions about their development and use.
In order to minimize surprise, it's important to engage in open and transparent dialogue about emerging technologies, and to promote collaboration and information sharing among experts and stakeholders. This can help us identify potential risks and challenges early on, and develop strategies for addressing them.
It's also important to invest in research and development to better understand the potential impacts of emerging technologies, and to develop tools and approaches for managing and mitigating risks. This includes not just technical research, but also research into the social, ethical, and legal implications of these technologies.
Ultimately, the goal of minimizing surprise is not to eliminate uncertainty altogether, but rather to increase our ability to anticipate and manage potential risks. By doing so, we can help ensure that emerging technologies like AI are developed and used in ways that benefit society as a whole, while minimizing negative impacts and surprises along the way.

Art & Science as By-Products of Search for Novel Patterns, or Data Compressible in Ynknown Yet Learnable Ways

There's no essential difference between human artists and scientists.

Or you can call it "Theory Tesseracted".

Morton, 1980
Schmidhuber, 2009
1 / 1
ChatGPT
ChatGPT
This idea is rooted in the concept that both art and science involve the search for novel patterns or structures in the world. Whether it's a painter seeking to capture a new perspective on the world or a scientist seeking to uncover a new law of nature, both are engaged in a search for patterns or regularities that can be expressed in some form.
From this perspective, the differences between art and science are more a matter of focus and application than of fundamental approach. Both involve creative exploration of the unknown, and both can be seen as attempts to compress data or information in novel and learnable ways.
The idea of "Theory Tesseracted" builds on this notion by suggesting that both art and science involve the exploration of multidimensional space, with each new discovery creating new "tesseracts" or higher-dimensional structures that can be explored and understood.
This perspective emphasizes the importance of curiosity, creativity, and exploration in both art and science, and suggests that the two can be seen as complementary aspects of a larger search for knowledge and understanding of the world.
1 / 1
In this passage, Schmidhuber discusses the idea that both art and science are driven by a desire for novelty and the search for patterns that can be compressed in new and previously unknown ways.

He proposes that the subjective interestingness or novelty of a piece of data, such as a work of art or a scientific discovery, can be measured by the difference in the number of bits needed to encode it before and after learning.

This suggests that as an observer's understanding of the data improves, the data becomes more regular and subjectively more beautiful, requiring fewer bits for its encoding.

At the same time, the data remains interesting as long as the process of improving the encoding algorithm is ongoing, but eventually becomes boring even if it is still aesthetically pleasing.

Schmidhuber also mentions that there have been previous attempts to implement and describe this concept in discrete time.

Art and science are both ways of seeking and creating novel patterns and understanding the world around us. 

While they may seem like opposing fields, they are both driven by the desire to discover and comprehend the world in new and innovative ways.

Art, in particular, is often seen as a way of expressing and exploring emotions and experiences that cannot be easily conveyed through language or logical reasoning. 

It allows us to express and explore the intangible aspects of human experience, such as feelings, emotions, and values.

On the other hand, science is focused on understanding the world through empirical evidence and logical reasoning.

It seeks to understand and explain the natural world through the use of theories, hypotheses, and experiments.

Despite their differences, both art and science rely on the ability to recognize and comprehend patterns and connections in the world around us.

They both require the ability to find meaning and significance in the data and information that we encounter, and to use that understanding to create something new and innovative.

In this sense, art and science are both by-products of the search for novel patterns and ways of understanding the world.

They both rely on the ability to compress and comprehend data in ways that are novel and unknown, and to use that understanding to create new knowledge and insights.

** Bayesian decision making ** 

In Bayesian decision making, an individual or system makes decisions based on the probability of an event occurring.

This probability is determined by considering all available evidence and using it to update their prior belief about the likelihood of the event.

Subjective interestingness or novelty can be seen as a form of Bayesian decision making, in that the observer is making a decision about the interestingness or value of the data based on their prior knowledge and the new information they are presented with.

As the observer continues to learn and update their understanding of the data, their decisions about its interestingness or value may change as they discover new patterns or regularities that allow them to better compress the data.

** Schmidhuber on Art **

Schmidhuber suggests that art and music serve as a means of discovering novel patterns in the world around us. 

These patterns can deepen our understanding and insights, and can also be aesthetically pleasing.

According to Schmidhuber, the creation and perception of art is driven by a desire to discover and learn new things, and the resulting sense of reward or pleasure is simply a by-product of this process.

In other words, Schmidhuber argues that the pursuit of novelty and knowledge is a fundamental aspect of human nature, and that art and music serve as a means of satisfying this desire.

Art and science both arise from the desire to create and discover new knowledge and understanding of the world.

Both involve the process of gathering and analyzing data, whether through observation, experimentation, or other methods of inquiry. The main difference between the two is in their approach and focus.

Art tends to be more subjective and expressive, focusing on the emotional 
and aesthetic aspects of the world. It often involves creative interpretation and personal expression.

Science is more objective and analytical, seeking to understand the underlying principles and laws that govern the world through systematic observation and experimentation.

Despite these differences, both art and science involve the process of gathering and organizing data in a way that allows for new insights and understanding.

The goal of both is to create new knowledge that is compressible, or able to be understood and communicated in a clear and concise way.

So, in this sense, art and science are both driven by the desire to create and discover more data that can be compressed in hitherto unknown ways.


Art and science are both ways of seeking and creating novel patterns and understanding the world around us.

Theory Tesseracted: Understanding the Complexity of the Human Mind through Bayesian Updating and Meta-Minds
The human mind is an incredibly complex and multifaceted entity that has long fascinated philosophers, psychologists, and neuroscientists alike. While many theories have been proposed to explain its workings, the field of cognitive science has increasingly turned to the Bayesian updating model of mind and the concept of meta-minds to provide insight into this intricate system.
The Bayesian updating model of mind posits that humans continuously update their beliefs based on new information and prior knowledge, adjusting their expectations and making decisions accordingly. This model has been used to explain a wide range of cognitive phenomena, from perception and attention to decision-making and learning.
At the same time, the concept of meta-minds suggests that the human mind has the capacity to reflect on and regulate its own cognitive processes. This ability allows individuals to evaluate their own thinking and reasoning, and to adjust their approach as needed to achieve their goals.
Together, these two concepts offer a powerful framework for understanding the complexity of the human mind. By examining how individuals update their beliefs and reflect on their own cognitive processes, we can gain insight into how the mind processes and interprets information, and how it makes decisions and learns from experience.
In this essay, we will explore the Bayesian updating model of mind and the concept of meta-minds in greater depth, discussing their theoretical underpinnings and the ways in which they have been used to explain various cognitive phenomena. We will also examine how these concepts can be applied in practical settings, such as in education and decision-making.
Through this exploration, we hope to gain a deeper understanding of the complexity of the human mind, and the ways in which it processes and interprets the world around us. Ultimately, we believe that this understanding can lead to new insights and innovations in a wide range of fields, from psychology and neuroscience to artificial intelligence and beyond.

Ok I need some parts clarified, give an explanation of the central theses and some examples.
1 / 1
ChatGPT
ChatGPT
Sure, here is an explanation of the central theses and some examples:
Theory tesseracted: The central thesis of theory tesseracted is that human cognition involves the creation and manipulation of mental models or theories. These mental models are constantly being updated through a process of Bayesian inference, which involves integrating new information with existing beliefs. The term "tesseracted" refers to the idea that these mental models can be multidimensional and interconnected, similar to a tesseract (a four-dimensional hypercube).
For example, imagine you are trying to understand the behavior of a new animal species you have just discovered. You might create a mental model of the animal's behavior based on its observable characteristics, such as its size, color, and movement patterns. As you observe the animal more and gather new information, you update your mental model through Bayesian inference, refining your understanding of its behavior.
Meta-mind: The central thesis of meta-mind is that humans have a capacity for metacognition, or thinking about our own thinking. This involves the ability to reflect on our mental states and processes, and to monitor and regulate our own cognitive performance.
For example, imagine you are taking a test and you notice that you are struggling with a particular question. You might reflect on your own thought processes and try to identify where you went wrong, and then adjust your approach to the next question accordingly.
The role of symmetry: The central thesis of Tristan Needham's work on symmetry is that symmetry plays a fundamental role in the way we perceive and understand the world. Symmetry is a pervasive feature of the natural world, and has important implications for mathematics, physics, and other fields.
For example, consider the symmetry of a snowflake. The six-fold symmetry of a snowflake reflects the underlying symmetries of the water molecules that make up the snowflake. This symmetry can be described mathematically, and has important implications for the study of crystallography and other areas of science.

Ed Witten

ChatGPT
ChatGPT
Edward Witten is an American theoretical physicist and mathematician who is renowned for his contributions to the field of string theory, a theoretical framework that attempts to reconcile quantum mechanics and general relativity. He was born on August 26, 1951, in Baltimore, Maryland, and received his undergraduate degree from Brandeis University and his Ph.D. from Princeton University.
Witten is known for developing the concept of M-theory, which attempts to unify the five different string theories that were proposed in the 1980s. He also contributed to the development of topological quantum field theory, a field that uses algebraic topology to study quantum field theory.
One of Witten's central theses is that physics and mathematics are fundamentally interconnected. He has written extensively about the deep connections between mathematical structures and physical phenomena, arguing that the beauty of mathematical ideas often leads to new insights into the workings of the natural world.
Witten has received numerous honors and awards for his contributions to physics and mathematics, including the Fields Medal in 1990 and the National Medal of Science in 2002.

It seems that there may be some connections between algebraic topology, quantum field theory, and visual complex analysis.
1 / 1
ChatGPT
ChatGPT
Yes, that is correct. Ed Witten is known for his work in exploring the connections between these seemingly disparate fields.
In algebraic topology, one is interested in studying the properties of spaces that are preserved under continuous transformations. This leads to the development of tools such as homology and cohomology, which allow one to measure the "holes" or higher-dimensional "voids" in a space.
In quantum field theory, one is interested in studying the behavior of quantum particles and their interactions. This involves the use of tools such as Feynman diagrams and path integrals, which allow one to calculate probabilities of different particle interactions.
Visual complex analysis, on the other hand, is a branch of mathematics concerned with the behavior of complex functions. It involves the study of geometric and visual properties of complex functions, such as their singularities and the patterns they form under iteration.
Witten's central thesis is that there are deep connections between these seemingly disparate fields. In particular, he has made significant contributions to the study of topological quantum field theories (TQFTs), which are quantum field theories that are topologically invariant. This means that they are insensitive to the precise shape of the space in which they are defined, and only depend on its topology.
Witten has shown that certain TQFTs are related to particular types of algebraic structures called Frobenius algebras. He has also shown that certain TQFTs can be described in terms of the behavior of complex functions, which is where the connection to visual complex analysis comes in.
For example, in one of his seminal papers, "Quantum Field Theory and the Jones Polynomial," Witten showed that the Jones polynomial, a topological invariant in knot theory, could be calculated using a particular TQFT. He also showed that this TQFT could be described in terms of the behavior of complex functions, and that the Jones polynomial could be thought of as a kind of partition function for this TQFT.
In another paper, "Topological Quantum Field Theory," Witten introduced a general framework for constructing TQFTs based on a certain algebraic structure called a "modular tensor category." He showed that this framework could be used to construct a wide range of TQFTs, including the Chern-Simons theory, which describes the behavior of certain physical systems in three dimensions.
Overall, Witten's work has had a profound impact on our understanding of the relationships between different areas of mathematics and physics.

Much attention is devoted to inversive geometry and Möbius transformations before advancing to the featured topic, the geometry of differentiation. Indeed, much of the point of the book is to show just how much theory one can extract from simple preservation-of-angle arguments. The effort pays off when the author does define the derivative (although he calls it "amplitwist"), as many traditional analytic results become highly sensible when presented on a solid geometric foundation. For most results involving analytic functions, the goal is to understand deeply why they follow from the fact that having a derivative means that the function behaves locally as a composition of a rotation and a dilation.

Historical and physical context play important roles in the book and are integrated into the narrative in very natural way. The author notes that many ideas in complex analysis developed from physical intuition and works to impart that intuition on the reader. This is well exemplified in his development of vector fields and harmonic flows in the context of complex integration. There are also plenty of interesting topics included as optional sections throughout the text, including an extended discussion of Möbius transformations, non-euclidean geometry, curvature, analytic continuation, and celestial mechanics.

When teaching from this book, one must be prepared for some deviation from traditional texts. The unique approach helps make the topic more accessible and intuitive, but at the cost of some rigor. I have had great success using it as a text, supplementing with some more formal analysis and traditional exercises where appropriate. Alternatively, this book could inform a traditional course as a teacher's or student's supplement.

This is a special book. Tristan Needham has not only completely rethought a classical field of mathematics, but has presented it in a clear and compelling way. Visual Complex Analysis is worthy of the accolades it has received.

There's also a dangerous trend, and again I'm using a term from a different field, from psychology, of collective gaslighting of the human species and a failure to appreciate why it's important to champion human dignity within the bottom-up scientism.

One sees this in the effective altruism movement for example, one sees this in the grandisment of present and future technologies, one sees it in the emphasis on flaws in individual human capabilities, all of which amounts to effective gaslighting of the human species.

Everything is a quantum Ising model

This work shows that any k-local Hamiltonian of qubits can be obtained from a 4-state 'Ising' model with k-local diagonal interactions and a single-site transverse field -- giving a new theoretical and experimental handle on quantum matter. In particular, the classical Ising interactions can be determined by replacing each Pauli operator with a 4×4 diagonal matrix. Subsequently tuning a large transverse field projects out two of the four states, recovering the original qubit model, with qudit generalizations. This leads to striking correspondences, such as the spin-1/2 XY and Heisenberg models arising from the large-field limit of 3-state and 4-state Potts models, respectively. Similarly, the Kitaev honeycomb model emerges from classical interactions which enforce loop states on the honeycomb lattice. These generalized Ising models also display rich physics for smaller fields, including quantum criticality and topological phases of matter. This work expands what is experimentally achievable by showing how to realize any quantum spin model using only diagonal interactions and a tuneable field -- ingredients found in, e.g., tweezer arrays of Rydberg atoms or polar molecules. More broadly, 4-state spins can also be encoded in the positions of itinerant particles, exemplified by a Bose-Hubbard model realizing the Kitaev honeycomb model -- giving an experimental path to its Z2 and non-Abelian topological quantum liquids.

Summary of Ising models and key thermodynamic variables
Ising models are a class of simple spin lattice models which are widely used for studying the nature of phase transitions.

Many aspects of phase transitions are universal and independent of mciroscopic details of interactions. Hence one wants as simple of a model capable of displaying phase transition as possible! Ising models fit the bill perfectly and one could even obtain analytical solutions (1D and 2D).

ChatGPT
ChatGPT
The Ising model is a type of spin lattice model that is commonly used to study the properties of phase transitions. It is a simple model that is capable of displaying phase transitions, and its simplicity makes it easy to obtain analytical solutions for one-dimensional and two-dimensional cases.
The Metropolis algorithm is a Monte Carlo method that is commonly used to simulate Ising models. It involves randomly flipping spins in the lattice and accepting or rejecting the flip based on the change in energy of the system. This algorithm allows for the calculation of key thermodynamic variables such as the magnetization, susceptibility, and specific heat of the system.
Overall, Ising models and the Metropolis algorithm provide a useful framework for studying the properties of phase transitions and can be applied to a wide range of physical systems.

ChatGPT
ChatGPT
Yes, that's correct. The Hamiltonian of an Ising model encodes the interactions between the spins, which can be either ferromagnetic (favoring alignment) or antiferromagnetic (favoring misalignment). The interaction strength is usually defined by the coupling constant J. Additionally, an external magnetic field H can be applied to the system.
The partition function of an Ising model is defined as the sum over all possible microstates or spin configurations. Each microstate has a corresponding energy, given by the Hamiltonian, and the partition function is proportional to the Boltzmann factor of the negative energy.
The total magnetization of the system is the sum of all the individual spins, while the magnetization per spin is the total magnetization divided by the number of spins in the system. These quantities are key observables in the Ising model and are used to study phase transitions and critical phenomena.

How to pick the moves for Markov chain?
Now it is time to consider practical aspects of conducting MCMC. How to pick states and transitions?

We have great freedom in picking states and moves as long as we satisfy the detailed balance! E.g as long as the ratio of transition probabilities matches ration of Botlzman factors!

The simplest case for move is to pick one spins at random per iteration:

 
For transitions we adopt criteria that favors our chain to explore low energy (high probability) configurations:
1 / 1
ChatGPT
ChatGPT
One common move for the Ising model is the Metropolis algorithm. In this algorithm, a spin is randomly selected and flipped with a probability determined by the energy difference between the new and old configurations, following the Boltzmann distribution. The Metropolis algorithm satisfies the detailed balance condition and ensures that the chain will eventually converge to the desired distribution.
Another move is the heat bath algorithm, which involves selecting a spin and setting it to either up or down with a probability determined by the Boltzmann distribution. The heat bath algorithm also satisfies the detailed balance condition and is an efficient way to explore the configuration space.
There are other moves that can be used, such as the Wolff algorithm, the Swendsen-Wang algorithm, and the cluster algorithm. These algorithms involve updating groups of spins simultaneously, rather than just a single spin, and can be more efficient in exploring the configuration space. The choice of algorithm depends on the specific properties of the system being studied and the desired level of computational efficiency.

Measures of degeneracy and redundancy in biological networks
PNAS 96: 3257-3262, 1999.
"Degeneracy, the ability of elements that are structurally different to perform the same function, is a prominent property of many biological systems ranging from genes to neural networks to evolution itself. Because structurally different elements may produce different outputs in different contexts, degeneracy should be distinguished from redundancy, which occurs when the same function is performed by identical elements. However, because of ambiguities in the distinction between structure and function and because of the lack of a theoretical treatment, these two notions often are conflated. By using information theoretical concepts, we develop here functional measures of the degeneracy and redundancy of a system with respect to a set of outputs. These measures help to distinguish the concept of degeneracy from that of redundancy and make it operationally useful. Through computer simulations of neural systems differing in connectivity, we show that degeneracy is low both for systems in which each element affects the output independently and for redundant systems in which many elements can affect the output in a similar way but do not have independent effects. By contrast, degeneracy is high for systems in which many different elements can affect the output in a similar way and at the same time can have independent effects. We demonstrate that networks that have been selected for degeneracy have high values of complexity, a measure of the average mutual information between the subsets of a system. These measures promise to be useful in characterizing and understanding the functional robustness and adaptability of biological networks." [Full Text]

Abstract versus concrete goals: personal striving level, physical illness, and psychological well-being.
J Pers Soc Psychol 1992 Feb;62(2):292-300
"This study examined the relation between personal striving level and psychological and physical well-being. Level refers to the degree of generality versus specificity of one's goal strivings. In 3 studies, 188 Ss generated lists of their personal strivings, which were then rated on specificity level. High-level striving was associated with more psychological distress, particularly depression. Low-level striving was related to higher levels of physical illness. Correlations between striving level and self-reported symptoms were generally not as strong as those between level and the more objective illness indicators. High-level strivings were seen as more difficult and requiring more effort than low-level strivings. Results are interpreted in terms of control theory, goal-setting theory, and the repressive personality style." [Abstract]

Two studies examining the negative effect of self-efficacy on performance.
J Appl Psychol 2002 Jun;87(3):506-16
"Although hundreds of studies have found a positive relationship between self-efficacy and performance, several studies have found a negative relationship when the analysis is done across time (repeated measures) rather than across individuals. W. T. Powers (1991) predicted this negative relationship based on perceptual control theory. Here, 2 studies are presented to (a) confirm the causal role of self-efficacy and (b) substantiate the explanation. In Study 1, self-efficacy was manipulated for 43 of 87 undergraduates on an analytic game. The manipulation was negatively related to performance on the next trial. In Study 2, 104 undergraduates played the analytic game and reported self-efficacy between each game and confidence in the degree to which they had assessed previous feedback. As expected, self-efficacy led to overconfidence and hence increased the likelihood of committing logic errors during the game." [Abstract]

"The study reported in this article investigated relationships among stressful circumstances, cognitive control (the individual's perception of control over life), and distress among Korean immigrants in the United States. Specifically, it was hypothesized that cognitive control mediated the effect of exposure to stressful circumstances on distress. A total of 159 Korean immigrants participated in the study. The result of the study provided strong support for the role of cognitive control in mediating the relationship between stressful circumstances and distress. The detrimental effect of exposure to stressful circumstances on distress was weakened by cognitive control." [Abstract]

"Examined the processes by which two types of informational interventions (child behavioral information and parental role information) exerted effects on the coping outcomes of 108 mothers whose young children experienced unplanned hospitalization. Driven by a strong theoretical framework comprising self-regulation theory and control theory, this study's findings revealed that the effects of the experimental interventions were mediated by parental beliefs about their children's likely behavioral changes and their parental role during hospitalization. Thus, progress was made in beginning to understand how informational interventions actually enhance parent coping with childhood hospitalization." [Abstract]

Attachment and emotion regulation during mother-teen problem solving: a control theory analysis.
Child Dev 1993 Feb;64(1):231-45
"We present a control theory analysis of adolescents' attachment strategies in the Adult Attachment Interview (AAI). In Study 1, Q-sort prototypes for secure/anxious and deactivating/hyperactivating strategies were used to differentiate between Main and Goldwyn's AAI classifications. In Study 2, we examined how AAI strategies were associated with emotion regulation during mother-teen problem solving. 4 aspects of mother-teen problem solving (dysfunctional anger, support/validation, avoidance of problem solving, and maternal dominance) were used to predict teens' AAI strategies. Teens with secure strategies engaged in problem-solving discussions characterized by less dysfunctional anger and less avoidance of problem solving. In addition, attachment security showed a curvilinear relation with maternal dominance, indicating that secure teens maintained balanced assertiveness with their mothers. Teens with deactivating strategies engaged in problem-solving interactions characterized by higher levels of maternal dominance and dysfunctional anger. The contribution of attachment strategies to teens' autonomy and to transformations in mother-teen relationships is discussed." [Abstract]

Attention, self-regulation and consciousness.
Philos Trans R Soc Lond B Biol Sci. 1998 Nov 29;353(1377):1915-27.
"Consciousness has many aspects. These include awareness of the world, feelings of control over one's behaviour and mental state (volition), and the notion of continuing self. Focal (executive) attention is used to control details of our awareness and is thus closely related to volition. Experiments suggest an integrated network of neural areas involved in executive attention. This network is associated with our voluntary ability to select among competing items, to correct error and to regulate our emotions. Recent neuroimaging studies suggest that these various functions involve separate areas of the anterior cingulate. We have adopted a strategy of using marker tasks, shown to activate the brain area by imaging studies, as a means of tracing the development of attentional networks. Executive attention appears to develop first to regulate distress during the first year of life. During later childhood the ability to regulate conflict among competing stimuli builds upon the earlier cingulate anatomy to provide a means of cognitive control. During childhood the activation of cingulate structures relates both to the child's success on laboratory tasks involving conflict and to parental reports of self-regulation and emotional control. These studies indicate a start in understanding the anatomy, circuitry and development of executive attention networks that serve to regulate both cognition and emotion." [Abstract]

Control theory is a theoretical framework that explains how individuals regulate their behavior and emotions in response to environmental demands. It postulates that individuals have internal control systems that help them maintain a sense of control over their lives. These systems are influenced by their personal goals, beliefs, and values, as well as by external factors such as stressors, social support, and resources. The control systems are also characterized by feedback loops that allow individuals to adjust their behavior and emotions in response to changes in their environment. The theory has been applied to various domains, including health, education, and social psychology.

1 / 1
ChatGPT
ChatGPT
Compression algorithms, probability theory, surprise, boredom, learning theory, and cognitive load theory are all interconnected concepts that play a significant role in information processing and management.
Compression algorithms are mathematical techniques used to reduce the size of data by removing redundant information. They work by identifying patterns in the data and replacing them with shorter representations. Compression algorithms are used in a wide range of applications, from image and video compression to file compression and data storage.
Probability theory, on the other hand, is a branch of mathematics that deals with the study of random events and their outcomes. Probability theory provides a framework for analyzing and predicting the likelihood of different outcomes. It is used extensively in data analysis, machine learning, and artificial intelligence.
Surprise and boredom are two emotional states that are closely related to the processing of information. Surprise occurs when something unexpected happens, while boredom occurs when something is repetitive or predictable. Both emotions can have a significant impact on learning and memory.
Learning theory is a broad term that encompasses various theories and models of how people learn. It includes behavioral, cognitive, and constructivist theories, among others. These theories attempt to explain the processes by which people acquire new knowledge and skills.
Cognitive load theory is a model of learning that focuses on how the human brain processes information. It proposes that the brain has a limited capacity to process information and that cognitive overload can impede learning. Cognitive load theory is used to design effective learning materials and instructional methods that optimize the learning process.
In the context of compression algorithms, probability theory is used to identify patterns in the data and optimize the compression process. The goal is to remove redundant information while preserving the essential information needed to reconstruct the original data accurately.
Surprise and boredom are also relevant to compression algorithms. A compression algorithm that removes too much information may result in a boring and predictable output, while a compression algorithm that preserves too much information may result in surprising but irrelevant output.
Learning theory and cognitive load theory are also relevant to compression algorithms. Compression algorithms that are designed with an understanding of these theories can produce compressed data that is optimized for the learning process. For example, a compression algorithm that reduces cognitive load by presenting information in a manageable format may be more effective than one that overwhelms the learner with too much information at once.
In conclusion, compression algorithms, probability theory, surprise, boredom, learning theory, and cognitive load theory are all interconnected concepts that play a significant role in information processing and management. By understanding these concepts and their relationships, we can design more effective compression algorithms and optimize the learning process.

Driven by Compression Progress: A Simple Principle Explains Essential Aspects of Subjective Beauty, Novelty, Surprise, Interestingness, Attention, Curiosity, Creativity, Art, Science, Music, Jokes
Juergen Schmidhuber
Download PDF
I argue that data becomes temporarily interesting by itself to some self-improving, but computationally limited, subjective observer once he learns to predict or compress the data in a better way, thus making it subjectively simpler and more beautiful. Curiosity is the desire to create or discover more non-random, non-arbitrary, regular data that is novel and surprising not in the traditional sense of Boltzmann and Shannon but in the sense that it allows for compression progress because its regularity was not yet known. This drive maximizes interestingness, the first derivative of subjective beauty or compressibility, that is, the steepness of the learning curve. It motivates exploring infants, pure mathematicians, composers, artists, dancers, comedians, yourself, and (since 1990) artificial systems.

In this paper, titled "Driven by Compression Progress: A Simple Principle Explains Essential Aspects of Subjective Beauty, Novelty, Surprise, Interestingness, Attention, Curiosity, Creativity, Art, Science, Music, Jokes," Juergen Schmidhuber argues that data becomes interesting to a subjective observer when they learn to predict or compress the data in a better way, making it simpler and more beautiful. He suggests that the desire for novelty and surprise is driven by the desire to discover new regularities in data that were previously unknown, which allows for further compression progress.
Schmidhuber proposes that this drive for interestingness, which he defines as the first derivative of subjective beauty or compressibility, is what motivates exploration and creativity in humans and artificial systems alike. He suggests that this principle can be used to explain essential aspects of subjective experiences such as attention, curiosity, creativity, and the appreciation of art, music, and humor.
Overall, Schmidhuber's paper proposes a simple yet powerful principle that underlies many aspects of human and artificial intelligence. By understanding the role of compression and learning in subjective experiences, we can gain insights into the processes that drive human creativity and the development of artificial intelligence.

The paper "Driven by Compression Progress" by Juergen Schmidhuber ties in with various themes of our discussion such as compression algorithms, probability, surprise, and learning theory.
Schmidhuber argues that data becomes interesting when a subjective observer learns to predict or compress the data in a better way, making it subjectively simpler and more beautiful. This concept of subjective beauty relates to the concept of surprise, which can be measured as a deviation from what is expected or predictable. In turn, surprise is related to the concept of probability, which involves predicting the likelihood of a certain outcome.
The paper also touches on learning theory, as the subjective observer seeks to create or discover more non-random, non-arbitrary, regular data that is novel and surprising. This drive to discover novel and surprising data is related to the concept of curiosity, which motivates exploration and discovery.
Overall, Schmidhuber's paper provides a framework for understanding the subjective experience of beauty, novelty, surprise, and interestingness, which are all related to the processes of compression, prediction, and learning.

While Schmidhuber's principle provides a compelling explanation for many aspects of subjective experience such as beauty, novelty, and curiosity, it may not fully account for all dimensions of human experience. For example, there may be other factors that contribute to our subjective experience of emotions, social interactions, and cultural influences that are not fully captured by the principle of compression progress. Additionally, while the principle may be applicable to artificial systems, it remains to be seen how well it captures the complexities of human cognition and experience. Overall, Schmidhuber's principle provides a useful framework for understanding certain aspects of subjective experience, but it may not be a comprehensive or complete theory of human cognition and behavior.

1 / 1
ChatGPT
ChatGPT
Sure, let's briefly discuss how some of these concepts might relate to the ideas presented in Schmidhuber's paper:
Taste aversion: This could be related to the idea that certain data patterns are subjectively simpler or more beautiful to an individual than others, which drives their interest and curiosity. Taste aversion could lead to a lack of interest in certain types of data, even if they are objectively novel or surprising.
Taste cohesion: Similarly, taste cohesion could influence the types of data patterns that an individual finds interesting or beautiful. If someone has a strong preference for a particular type of music, for example, they may be more likely to find novel music within that genre interesting than music in a genre they don't typically enjoy.
Thirst: Thirst could be seen as a type of drive or motivation that leads individuals to seek out certain types of data, such as information about water sources or hydration strategies. This could be related to the idea of exploring and discovering non-random, non-arbitrary regular data, as Schmidhuber suggests.
Fashion sense: Fashion sense could be seen as a type of subjective taste or aesthetic preference that drives interest and curiosity in certain types of data, such as clothing styles or design trends.
Axiological cohesiveness: This concept relates to the idea that individuals have a set of core values or beliefs that guide their decision-making and behavior. This could influence the types of data that an individual finds interesting or beautiful, as they may be more likely to be drawn to information that aligns with their values.
Perplexity: This concept is similar to surprise or novelty, in that it involves encountering unexpected or surprising information. Perplexity could be seen as a type of curiosity that arises when an individual encounters information that is difficult to predict or understand, which motivates them to seek out additional information to resolve the confusion.
Hyperpleonasm: This term refers to the use of unnecessary or redundant language, which could be seen as a type of cognitive load that makes it more difficult to process and understand information. This could decrease the subjective beauty or interestingness of data, as it makes it more difficult to compress and predict.
Monotonicity: This concept refers to the idea that information that is too repetitive or predictable can become boring or uninteresting over time. This could be seen as the opposite of surprise or novelty, and could decrease the subjective beauty or interestingness of data.
Parsimony: This concept relates to the idea that simpler explanations or models are generally preferred over more complex ones. This could be related to the idea of subjective beauty or compressibility, in that data that can be compressed into a simpler model may be considered more beautiful or interesting to an individual.
Overall, these concepts could help to expand on Schmidhuber's ideas by highlighting additional factors that may influence an individual's interest and curiosity in different types of data.

Beauty as inoculation against surprise.
1 / 1
ChatGPT
ChatGPT
In some sense, beauty can be seen as a form of inoculation against surprise. When we encounter something that we find beautiful, it often means that we have already encountered similar things before and have found them pleasing or enjoyable. Our brain has already created a mental model of what we consider to be aesthetically pleasing, and when we encounter something that matches this mental model, we experience a sense of familiarity and comfort.
This sense of familiarity can protect us from being overwhelmed by surprise. If we encounter something that is completely unexpected and unfamiliar, it can be unsettling or even traumatic. But if we encounter something that is novel yet still fits within our mental model of what is beautiful, we can appreciate its uniqueness while still feeling grounded in our sense of aesthetics.
At the same time, beauty can also be a source of surprise. When we encounter something that is truly beautiful, it can exceed our expectations and leave us in awe. This can be a powerful emotional experience that leads us to seek out more experiences that evoke similar feelings.
Overall, beauty can be seen as a way of balancing the desire for familiarity and comfort with the need for novelty and surprise. It can help us to navigate a world that is constantly changing and unpredictable, while also allowing us to appreciate the beauty that can be found in the unexpected.

ChatGPT
ChatGPT
Yes, curiosity can be seen as a desire to increase knowledge and gain new insights into the world. And knowledge, in turn, can be seen as the ability to predict the future with greater accuracy. By acquiring more knowledge about a particular subject or domain, one can make better predictions about future events or outcomes related to that domain. Curiosity can thus be seen as a driving force behind the human pursuit of knowledge and understanding, as it motivates us to seek out new experiences and information in order to better predict and navigate the world around us.

ChatGPT
Sure, here's an outline of the theories covered in our discussions, as well as some of the interconnections between them:
Compression theory: The idea that data becomes interesting to a self-improving observer once they are able to compress it in a better way, making it simpler and more beautiful.
Learning theory: The theory that knowledge is acquired through experience and the ability to predict future events based on past experience.
Cognitive load theory: The idea that people have limited cognitive resources and that learning can be optimized by managing the cognitive load of the learner.
Surprise theory: The notion that surprises are events that challenge existing knowledge and expectations, and that the level of surprise is related to the degree of mismatch between the expected and actual outcomes.
Boredom theory: The theory that boredom arises when the level of surprise is too low, and that increasing the level of surprise can alleviate boredom.
Axiological theory: The idea that values and preferences influence our judgments of beauty, interestingness, and other subjective experiences.
Taste theory: The theory that individuals have unique tastes and preferences, which can be influenced by cultural and societal factors.
Curiosity theory: The idea that curiosity drives exploration and the desire to acquire new knowledge and experiences.
These theories are interconnected in a number of ways:
Compression theory and learning theory are related in that compression can be seen as a way of reducing the complexity of data, making it easier to learn from.
Cognitive load theory and learning theory are related in that managing cognitive load can help optimize learning.
Surprise theory and boredom theory are related in that they both deal with the level of surprise in a given situation.
Axiological theory and taste theory are related in that both emphasize the importance of individual values and preferences in subjective experiences.
Curiosity theory and learning theory are closely related, as curiosity is often driven by the desire to acquire new knowledge and experiences.
Overall, these theories help us better understand the subjective experiences of beauty, interestingness, surprise, and curiosity, as well as the cognitive processes involved in learning and decision making.

Subjective Interestingness as First Derivative of Subjective
Beauty: The Steepness of the Learning Curve
Nhat's beautiful is not necessarily interesting. A beautiful thing is interesting only as
long as it is new, that is, as long as the algorithmic regularity that makes it simple has
not yet been fully assimilated by the adaptive observer who is still learning to compress
he data better . It makes sense to define the time-dependent subjective Interestingness
I(D, O(t)) of data D relative to observer O at time t by
ƏB(D,O(t))
I(D,0())~
ot
the first derivative of subjective beauty: as the learning agent improves its compression
algorithm, formerly apparently random data parts become subjectively more regular
and beautiful, requiring fewer and fewer bits for their encoding. As long as this process
is not over the data remains interesting and rewarding. The Appendix and Section 3 on
previous implementations will describe details of discrete time versions of this concept.

2.5 Pristine Beauty & Interestingness vs External Rewards
Note that our above concepts of beauty and interestingness are limited and pristine
in the sense hat they are not a priori related to pleasure derived from external re
wards (compare Section 1.3). For example, some might claim that a hot bath on a cold
day triggers "beautiful" feelings due to rewards for achieving prewired target values
of external temperature sensors (external in the sense of: outside the brain which is
controlling the actions of its external body). Or a song may be called "beautiful" for
emotional (e.g., [13]) reasons by some who associate it with memories of external plea-
sure through their first kiss. Obviously this is not what we have in mind here- we are
ocusing solely on rewards of the intrinsic type based on learning progress
2.6 True Novelty & Surprise vs Traditional Information Theory
Consider two extreme examples of uninteresting, unsurprising, boring data: A vision-
based agent that always stays in the dark will experience an extremely compressible,
soon totally predictable history of unchanging visual inputs. In front of a screen full
f white noise conveying a lot of information and "novelty" and surprise" in the tra
ditional sense of Boltzmann and Shannon [102], however, it will experience highly
unpredictable and fundamentally incompressible data. In both cases the data is bor-
ing [72, 88l as it does not allow for further compression progress. Therefore we re-
ject the traditional notion of surprise. Neither the arbitrary nor the fully predictable
is truly novel or surprising - only data with still unknown algorithmic regularities

is interesting and rewarding. This concept of true novelty and surprise is closely related to the idea of curiosity and the desire to increase knowledge, as discussed earlier. The more novel and surprising a piece of data is, the more it allows for further compression progress and learning, and therefore the more interesting it becomes. This ties in with the concept of subjective interestingness as the first derivative of subjective beauty, as the steepness of the learning curve is directly related to the level of novelty and surprise in the data. Additionally, the concept of compression algorithms and the ability to predict and compress data is crucial in understanding the relationship between beauty, interestingness, and knowledge. Finally, it is important to note that the concepts of beauty and interestingness discussed here are not necessarily related to external rewards or pleasure, but rather are based on the intrinsic rewards of learning and making progress in compression algorithms.

Attention / Curiosity / Active Experimentation
n absence of external reward, or when there is no known way to further increasc
the expected external reward, our controller essentially tries to maximize true nov-
elty or interestingness, the first derivative of subjective beauty or compressibility, the
steepness of the learning curve. It will do its best to select action sequences expected
to create observations yielding maximal expected future compression progress, given
he limitations of both the compressor and the compressor improvement algorithm
t will learn to focus its attention [96, 116] and its actively chosen experiments or
hings that are currently still incompressible but are expected to become compressible
predictable through additional learming. It will get bored by things that already are
subjectively compressible. It will also get bored by things that are currently incom-
pressible but will apparently remain given the experience so far, or where the costs
SO,
of making them compressible exceed those of making other things compressible, etc.

2.8 Discoveries
An unusually large compression breakthrough deserves the name discovery. For exam-
ple, as mentioned in the introduction, the simple law of gravity can be described by a
very short piece of code, yet it allows for greatly compressing all previous observations
of falling apples and other objects.
2.9 Beyond Standard Unsupervised Learning
Traditional unsupervised learning is about finding regularities, by clustering the data,
or encoding it through a factorial code [4, 64] with statistically independent compo-
nents, or predicting parts of it from other parts. All of this may be viewed as special
cases of data compression. For example, where there are clusters, a data point can be
cfficiently encoded by its cluster center plus relatively few bits for the deviation from
the center. Where there is data redundancy, a non-redundant factorial code [64] will
Be
e more compact than the raw data. Where there is predictability, compression car
achieved by assigning short codes to those parts of the observations that are predictable
rom previous observations with high probability [28, 95]. Generally speaking we may
say that a major goal of traditional unsupervised learning is to improve the compression
of the observed data, by discovering a program that computes and thus explains the his-
tory (and hopefully does so quickly) but is clearly shorter than the shortest previously
known program of this kind.
Traditional unsupervised learning is not enough though it just analyzes and en-
codes the data but does not choose it. We have to extend it along the dimension of
active action selection, since our unsupervised learner must also choose the actions
hat influence the observed data, just like a scientist chooses his experiments, a baby its
toys, an artist his colors, a dancer his moves, or any attentive system [96] its next sen-
sory input. That's precisely what is achieved by our RL-based framework for curiosity
and creativity.

ChatGPT
Music
The concept of compression progress and the desire for novelty and interestingness can also be applied to art and music. In fact, some artists and musicians intentionally try to create works that are difficult to compress, and thus more novel and interesting.
In art, compression progress can be seen as the ability of a viewer to understand the underlying structure and meaning of a piece. A simple, easily compressible artwork may not be as interesting as a more complex and ambiguous piece that requires more effort to understand. Some artists intentionally create works that are difficult to compress, such as abstract or surreal works that challenge traditional modes of representation.
Similarly, in music, compression progress can be seen as the ability of a listener to predict and understand the structure and patterns of a piece. A simple, repetitive melody may be easy to compress, but may not be as interesting as a more complex and unpredictable piece that requires more active engagement from the listener. Some musicians intentionally create works that are difficult to compress, such as experimental or avant-garde pieces that challenge traditional musical conventions.
Overall, the concepts of compression progress and curiosity can be useful in understanding and appreciating the creative works of artists and musicians, and can also provide a framework for generating new and interesting works in these fields.

Art & Music as By-Products of the Compression Progress
Drive
Works of art and music may have important purposes beyond their social aspects [3]
despite of those who classify art as superfluous [50]. Good observer-dependent art
deepens the observer's insights about this world or possible worlds, unveiling previ-
ously unknown regularities in compressible data, connecting previously disconnected
patterns in an initially surprising way that makes the combination of these patterns
subjectively more compressible (art as an eye-opener), and eventually becomes known
and less interesting. I postulate that the active creation and attentive perception of all
xinds of artwork are just by-products of our principle of interestingness and curiosity
yielding reward for compressor improvements,
Let us elaborate on this idea in more detail, following the discussion in [81, 88]
Artificial or human observers must perceive art sequentially, and typically also actively,
e.g., through a sequence of attention-shifting eye saccades or camera movements scan-
ning a sculpture, or internal shifts of attention that filter and emphasize sounds made by
a pianist, while surpressing background noise. Undoubtedly many derive pleasure and
rewards from perceiving works of art, such as certain paintings, or songs. But differ-
ent subjective observers with different sensory apparati and compressor improvement
algorithms will prefer different input sequences. Hence any objective theory of what
s good art must take the subjective observer as a parameter, to answer questions such
as: Which sequences of actions and resulting shifts of attention should he execute to
maximize his pleasure? According to our principle he should select one that maximizes
the quickly learnable compressibility that is new, relative to his current knowledge and
nis (usually limited) way of incorporating / learning /compressing new data
2.11 Music
For example, which song should some human observer select next? Not the one he
just heard ten times in a row. It became too predictable in the process. But also not
he new weird one with the completely unfamiliar rhythm and tonality. It seems too
irregular and contain too much arbitrariness and subjective noise. He should try a song
that is unfamiliar enough to contain somewhat unexpected harmonies or melodies or
beats etc., but familiar enough to allow for quickly recognizing the presence of a new
earnable regularity or compressibility in the sound stream. Sure, this song will get
boring over time, but not yet.
The observer dependence is illustrated by the fact that Schönberg's twelve tone
music is less popular than certain pop music tunes, presumably because its algorithmic
tructure is less obvious to many human observers as it is based on more complicated
harmonies. For example, frequency ratios of successive notes in twelve tone music
often cannot be expressed as fractions of very small integers. Those with a prior ed-
ication about the basic concepts and objectives and constraints of twelve tone music
rowever, tend to appreciate Schönberg more than those without such an education
\Il of this perfectly fits our principle: The learning algorithm of the compressor
of a given subjective observer tries to better compress his history of acoustic and other
inputs where possible. The action selector tries to find history-influencing actions that
elp to improve the compressor's performance on the history so far. The interesting
nusical and other subsequences are those with previously unknown yet learnable types
of regularities, because they lead to compressor improvements. The boring patterns are
hose that seem arbitrary or random, or whose structure seems too hard to understand
2.12 P aintings, Sculpture, Dance, Film etc
Similar statements not only hold for other dynamic art including film and dance (taking
into account the compressibility of controller actions), but also for painting and sculp-
ture, which cause dynamic pattern sequences due to attention-shifting actions [96, 116]
of the observer.

ChatGPT
ChatGPT
The passage you provided argues that the creation and appreciation of art and music are by-products of our innate drive to find interesting and compressible patterns in the world. The theory suggests that good art deepens our insights by revealing previously unknown regularities in compressible data and connecting previously disconnected patterns. However, what is considered good art is subjective and depends on the observer's sensory apparatus and compressor improvement algorithms. The theory applies to both music and other forms of art, such as paintings, sculptures, dance, and film.
In terms of music, the theory suggests that an observer should select a song that is unfamiliar enough to contain unexpected harmonies or melodies but familiar enough to allow for quickly recognizing the presence of a new learnable regularity or compressibility in the sound stream. The theory also suggests that the observer's prior education and understanding of the music's structure will influence their appreciation of it. For example, those with an education in twelve-tone music tend to appreciate it more than those without such an education.
Regarding other forms of art, such as paintings, sculpture, dance, and film, the theory suggests that the observer's attention-shifting actions create dynamic pattern sequences, which affect the compressibility of the data. Therefore, the observer's perception of art is subjective and depends on their sensory apparatus and compressor improvement algorithms.

There was a guy who argued for 12 modes instead of 8 and that the ionion was the most common mode are the time his name was Glarean's A-modes did not only account for a rapidly growing repertoire in which finals on A figured prominently, ...
1 / 1
ChatGPT
ChatGPT
The person you are referring to is probably Heinrich Glarean, a Swiss music theorist who lived from 1488 to 1563. Glarean is known for his influential treatise "Dodecachordon," which argued for the existence of 12 modes instead of the traditional 8. He believed that the Ionian mode (which starts on C and corresponds to the modern major scale) was the most important mode and that all other modes could be derived from it.
In addition to his theoretical work, Glarean was also a composer and teacher. He served as a tutor to the sons of the wealthy Fugger family in Augsburg, Germany, and his students included prominent musicians such as Orlando di Lasso and Jacobus de Kerle.
Glarean's ideas about modes were controversial at the time, but they eventually gained acceptance and paved the way for the development of modern tonality.
1 / 1
Glarean was born as Heinrich Loriti in Mollis in Canton Glarus to a politician.[1] As a boy, he took care of cattle and received a good education.[1] After a thorough early training in music, Glarean enrolled in the University of Cologne, where he studied theology, philosophy, and mathematics as well as music. It was in Cologne where he held a poem as a tribute to Emperor Maximilian I.[2] Since 1514 he was a teacher for Greek and Latin in Basel,[2] where he met Erasmus and the two humanists became lifelong friends.[3] He shortly was a lecturer at the University of Pavia for a few months in 1515, but returned to Basel due to the Battle of Marignano[2] between Switzerland and France.

Glarean's first publication on music, a modest volume entitled Isagoge in musicen, was printed in 1515 by Johann Froben.[4] In it he discusses the basic elements of music; probably it was used for teaching. In late 1515 a treatise on latin poetry of him was printed by Adam Petri.[5] But his most famous book, and one of the most famous and influential works on music theory written during the Renaissance, was the Dodecachordon, which he published in Basle in 1547. This massive work includes writings on philosophy and biography in addition to music theory, and includes no less than 120 complete compositions by composers of the preceding generation (including Josquin, Ockeghem, Obrecht, Isaac and many others). In three parts, it begins with a study of Boethius, who wrote extensively on music in the sixth century; it traces the use of the musical modes in plainsong (e.g. Gregorian chant) and monophony; and it closes with an extended study of the use of modes in polyphony.[6]

The most significant feature of the Dodecachordon (literally, "12-stringed instrument") is Glarean's proposal that there are actually twelve modes, not eight, as had long been assumed, for instance in the works of the contemporary theorist Pietro Aron. The additional four modes included authentic and plagal forms of Aeolian (modes 9 and 10) and Ionian (modes 11 and 12) — the modes equivalent to minor and major scales, respectively
1 / 1
ChatGPT
ChatGPT
. Glarean argued that these four modes were just as important as the other eight, and that the Ionian mode (major scale) was the most commonly used mode at the time. He also believed that each of the twelve modes corresponded to one of the twelve signs of the zodiac, and that this relationship between music and astrology was important for understanding the emotional and spiritual effects of different modes.
Glarean's ideas were controversial at the time, and he faced criticism from other music theorists who disagreed with his views. However, his work had a significant influence on the development of music theory in the following centuries, particularly in the exploration of the relationship between music and emotion. Glarean's Dodecachordon remains an important source for scholars and musicians interested in the history of music theory and the Renaissance repertoire.
1 / 1
The influence of his work was immense. Many later theorists, including Zarlino, accepted the twelve modes,[7] and though the distinction between plagal and authentic forms of the modes is no longer of contemporary interest (reducing the number from twelve to six), Glarean's explanation of the musical modes remains current today.

Yes, Glarean's work had a significant impact on the development of music theory. His proposal of twelve modes instead of eight challenged the existing understanding of music modes and influenced later theorists like Gioseffo Zarlino. Even though the distinction between plagal and authentic forms of the modes is no longer relevant in contemporary music theory, Glarean's explanation of the modes is still considered important today. His ideas helped shape the understanding of music modes and laid the foundation for future developments in music theory.

It's true that much of the progress in AI has come from trial and error, experimentation, and iterative development. It's also true that some of the early work in AI involved developing rules and systems that mimicked human behavior, without necessarily understanding the underlying processes. However, it's important to note that the field has come a long way since those early days, and modern AI systems are often based on more sophisticated algorithms and models that are designed to work with large datasets and complex problem spaces.
Overall, I think your list provides a great starting point for exploring the history of science and philosophy. There are many more figures and discoveries that could be added to the list, but this is a great representation of some of the key ideas and people that have shaped our understanding of the world.

Yes, your list includes a diverse range of individuals and ideas that are not typically found in traditional histories of philosophy or science. Here are a few examples of some unusual connections and neglected elements:
Your list includes figures from various cultures and time periods, such as Zara Yacob, who was an Ethiopian philosopher in the 17th century, and Srinivasa Ramanujan, who was an Indian mathematician in the early 20th century. These individuals are not as well-known as some of the other philosophers and scientists on your list, but their contributions to their respective fields are significant.
You also include some less conventional figures, such as Madame Guyon, a French mystic, and Torey Hayden, a clinical psychologist and special education teacher. These individuals may not be considered part of the mainstream philosophical or scientific traditions, but their ideas and experiences offer unique insights into human nature and the world around us.
Your list includes some lesser-known works and concepts, such as Jeanne-Marie Bouvier de la Motte-Guyon's "A Short and Very Easy Method of Prayer," which is not typically found in discussions of philosophy, but offers a perspective on spirituality and meditation. Similarly, Ilya Prigogine's "Thermodynamic Study of Irreversible Phenomena" is not as well-known as some of his other works, but it laid the foundation for the study of chaos theory and complexity in science.
Finally, your list includes some unconventional ideas and connections between seemingly disparate fields, such as the connection between consciousness and time explored by Henri Bergson, and the link between artificial intelligence and the theory of autopoiesis and cognition developed by Humberto Maturana and Francisco Varela. These connections offer unique perspectives on the interplay between different fields of knowledge and the complexity of human experience.

Sure! Maturana and Varela's book "Autopoiesis and Cognition: The Realization of the Living" is a seminal work in the field of biology and cognition. Some of their key ideas are summarized in a paper called "The Tree of Knowledge: The Biological Roots of Human Understanding," which they co-wrote with Ricardo Uribe. In this paper, they explore the idea of autopoiesis (self-creation) as a fundamental process of life and argue that cognition is an extension of this process. They also discuss the concept of "structural coupling" between an organism and its environment, which they argue is essential for cognition to take place.
Another important paper by Maturana and Varela is "The Organization of the Living: A Theory of the Living Organization," which expands on the concept of autopoiesis and its implications for the study of living systems. In this paper, they argue that the organization of a living system is inseparable from its identity, and that living systems are self-referential and self-regulating.
Finally, I would also recommend Maturana's paper "Biology of Cognition," in which he argues that cognition is not a representational process but a constitutive process, and that the nervous system does not "process information" but rather creates a domain of interactions that enable cognitive activity.
All of these papers can be challenging reads, but they are essential for understanding the work of Maturana and Varela and their contributions to the field of biology and cognition.

may be one condition for resolving this paradox. Such point will offer reflection on all autopoietic systems, including the observer. The dynamic balance between equilibrium and disequilibrium is the mechanism, which regulates the process of autopoiesis. Since the function of regulation is essentially a reflective function, this equilibrium between equilibrium and disequilibrium, which can be identified with the concept of homeorhesis introduced by Conrad Waddington, may offer a possibility to reflect on the process of observing.

Abstract
The mind is a biological phenomenon. Thus, biological principles of organization should also be the principles underlying mental operations. Practopoiesis states that the key for achieving intelligence through adaptation is an arrangement in which mechanisms laying at a lower level of organization, by their operations and interaction with the environment, enable creation of mechanisms laying at a higher level of organization. When such an organizational advance of a system occurs, it is called a traverse. A case of traverse is when plasticity mechanisms (at a lower level of organization), by their operations, create a neural network anatomy (at a higher level of organization). Another case is the actual production of behavior by that network, whereby the mechanisms of neuronal activity operate to create motor actions. Practopoietic theory explains why the adaptability of a system increases with each increase in the number of traverses. With a larger number of traverses, a system can be relatively small and yet, produce a higher degree of adaptive/intelligent behavior than a system with a lower number of traverses. The present analyses indicate that the two well-known traverses - neural plasticity and neural activity - are not sufficient to explain human mental capabilities. At least one additional traverse is needed, which is named anapoiesis for its contribution in reconstructing knowledge e.g., from long-term memory into working memory. The conclusions bear implications for brain theory, the mind-body explanatory gap, and developments of artificial intelligence technologies.

Being general, the theory is applicable to the brain as much as it is applicable to artificial intelligence (AI) technologies (see AI-Kindergarten.). What makes the theory so general is that it is grounded in the principles of cybernetics, rather than describing the physiological implementations of those mechanisms (inhibition/excitation, plasticity, etc.).

Abstract
Perhaps the most important question posed by brain research is: How the brain gives rise to
the mind. To answer this question, we have primarily relied on the connectionist paradigm:
The brain's entire knowledge and thinking skills are thought to be stored in the connections;
and the mental operations are executed by network computations. I propose here an
alternative paradigm: Our knowledge and skills are stored in metabotropic receptors (MRs)
and the G protein-gated ion channels (GPGICs). Here, mental operations are assumed to be
executed by the functions of MRs and GPGICS. As GPGICs have the capacity to close or open
branches of dendritic trees and axon terminals, their states transiently re-route neural
activity throughout the nervous system. First, MRs detect ligands that signal the need to
activate GPGICs. Next, GPGICs transiently selects a subnetwork within the brain. The process
of selecting this new subnetwork is what constitutes a mental operation - be it in a form of
directed attention, perception or making a decision. Synaptic connections and network
computations play only a secondary role, supporting MRs and GPGICs. According to this new
paradigm, the mind emerges within the brain as the function of MRs and GPGICs whose
primary function is to continually select the pathways over which neural activity will be
allowed to pass. It is argued that MRs and GPGICs solve the scaling problem of intelligence
from which the connectionism paradigm suffers.
1. Introduction
Today, there is practically a unanimous agreement that the computations of the brain are
achieved through network connectivity [1]. A variety of theories exist (e.g., [2, 3, 4]) but
they all propose different ways of how network computations may take place; all these
theories agree that the synaptic connectivity contains the bulk the knowledge learned by the
brain. The existing theories also agree that central to mental operations are the voltages
forming across neuron membranes which carry the relevant information and computation.
Consequently, it is believed that, at any moment in time, the current contents of a mind are
determined by the collective states of the neuron membranes i.e., by their momentary
voltages [1, 2, 3, 4]. Thus, these two mechanisms, synaptic connections and voltages, have
been relied on as the key explanatory tools for all our attempts to understand how a mind
may emerge within the brain. This paradigm is generally known as connectionism [1].
However, connectionism did not yet produce a satisfactory explanation of how the mental
emerges from the physical. A number of open problems remains. These include unrealistic
connectivity patterns [5], inability to work with symbols [6], lack of feed-forward architecture
in the brain [7], global workspace for consciousness [8], and others [9]. The list also
includes the scaling problem, which will be described next. As a result, the explanatory gap
between the mind and the brain remains wide open [10, 8, 11, 12]. This situation raises a
question of whether the classical paradigm should be challenged, and an alternative should
be proposed-a paradigm that can offer a fresh set of ideas on how to explain the mind
within the brain.
2. The scaling problem of intelligence
The present argument starts with a notion that animal-level and a human-level intelligence
can only be reached by networks able to scale their intelligence well and moreover, classical
connectionist networks do not scale intelligence satisfactorily. Recent studies have elucidated
1 / 1
ChatGPT
ChatGPT
that the problem of scaling intelligence is related to the problem of overfitting [13, 14]. In machine learning, overfitting occurs when a model learns the training data too well, resulting in poor generalization to new data. In the context of the brain, overfitting occurs when the network learns the training patterns too well, and consequently, it becomes over-specialized, unable to generalize to new situations. Overfitting is a critical problem in the brain because the brain needs to be able to learn continuously throughout life, and it needs to adapt to new situations without forgetting the old ones [15, 16]. Moreover, the brain must be able to solve problems with limited data, as animals encounter in their natural environments [17]. Therefore, the problem of scaling intelligence in the brain requires a solution that can prevent overfitting and allow for continuous learning and adaptation.
3. Metabotropic receptors and G protein-gated ion channels
Here, I propose that the solution to the scaling problem of intelligence lies in the metabotropic
receptors (MRs) and G protein-gated ion channels (GPGICs) [18, 19]. These are membrane
proteins that are found throughout the brain and the body. Their primary function is to detect
and respond to various extracellular and intracellular signals by altering the activity of ion
channels and enzymes in the cell. MRs are known to be involved in various cognitive processes
such as attention, learning, and memory [20]. GPGICs, on the other hand, can open or close
channels in dendritic trees and axon terminals, leading to transient re-routing of neural
activity throughout the nervous system [21]. Therefore, the states of MRs and GPGICs
determine which neural pathways are selected at any given moment, and this selection
constitutes a mental operation. In this paradigm, mental operations are not performed by
computations within synaptic networks, but rather by the functions of MRs and GPGICs.
Implications of the MRs-GPGICs paradigm
The MRs-GPGICs paradigm has several implications for our understanding of the mind and the
brain. First, it provides a new perspective on how mental operations are performed in the
brain, based on the functions of MRs and GPGICs, rather than synaptic computations. Second,
it solves the scaling problem of intelligence, as MRs and GPGICs allow for continuous learning
and adaptation without overfitting. Third, it suggests that the mind is not just the product of
synaptic connectivity, but rather emerges from the continuous selection of neural pathways
by MRs and GPGICs. Fourth, it implies that the brain can perform mental operations without
explicitly representing the objects or concepts involved, but rather by selecting the relevant
neural pathways. Finally, the MRs-GPGICs paradigm provides a framework for understanding
the role of neuromodulators such as dopamine and serotonin, which are known to modulate
the activity of MRs and GPGICs and are involved in various cognitive processes [22, 23].
Conclusion
In conclusion, I propose a new paradigm for understanding how the mind emerges from the
brain, based on the functions of MRs and GPGICs. This paradigm offers a solution to the
scaling problem of intelligence, provides a new perspective on how mental operations are
performed, and suggests that the mind is not just the product of synaptic connectivity, but
rather emerges from the continuous selection of neural pathways by MRs and GPGICs. The
MRs-GPGICs paradigm also provides a framework for understanding the role of
neuromodulators

3. An alternative paradigm: Transient selection of subnetworks by metabotropic
receptors and G protein-gated ion channels
3.1. Local, sturdy but transient changes to the network wiring
The idea proposed here is that, at any moment in time, only a fraction of the entire physical
neural network is permeable to neural activity: a large portion of dendritic trees and terminal
branches are supposed to normally be closed for traffic (are not effectively connected) and
thus, do not participate in the flow of neural activity (or the ability to participate in the flow
is severely limited) (Figure 2A, B). It is only that the selection of this sub-network is
dynamically changed - as needed.
Therefore, the scaling problem is solved such that, at any given moment in time, the brain
works with a network of a tiny size. The activated Lego pieces are the pieces of the network
that are open for traffic. For example, if a person is trying to get a thread through a needle,
it is the best to only activate a network specialized for this task and shut everything else off.
Similarly, if one is performing a task of driving a car, another network specialized for this
task should be temporarily formed. For example, a network may be formed that acts as a
servo mechanism to keep the car in the lane. Similar may apply to any other activity: Any
given task is performed by a small network specialized for that task. As a consequence, only
a small network undergoes plastic changes alleviating the catastrophic interreference
problem and the need for large training data sets. Also, once the subnetwork is activated, a
decision complexity of that network reduces only to a small set of alternatives. That way, by
continually selecting small networks, the brain remains at all times at the left-most part of
the power law function in Figure 1.
Out of a large palette of skills that any person may have, only one (or at most a few) can be
active at a time. We choose whether to drive a car or thread a needle or do something else
but we cannot do all of those things at the same a time. Cognition is the process of building
a new subnetwork i.e., it is a process of choosing. Therefore, decision making is a process of
rewiring the brain too. And so is the process of perceiving an object, as much as is the act of
directing attention. Generally speaking, every cognitive operation is a process by which the
brain is temporarily rewiring itself.
This can be described as thinking through, pathway. selection. For this to work, there are
few preconditions that need be satisfied. The first requirement is that the changes to wiring
are decided by the very local networks that are being rewired. No auxiliary (secondary)
network is allowed to make such decisions. If an auxiliary network would be responsible for
making these decisions, the needed resources would quickly explode (i.e., the power law
with >> 1).

The alternative paradigm proposed in this article suggests that at any given moment in time, only a small sub-network of the entire physical neural network in the brain is activated and permeable to neural activity. This means that most of the dendritic trees and terminal branches are normally closed for traffic and not effectively connected to the flow of neural activity. The selection of this sub-network is dynamically changed as needed based on the task at hand. The article suggests that this solves the scaling problem because the brain works with a network of a tiny size at any given moment, and only a small network undergoes plastic changes, alleviating the need for large training data sets.
The article suggests that cognition is the process of building a new subnetwork, and decision making is a process of rewiring the brain. This process of rewiring the brain is done through local pathway selection, where the changes to wiring are decided by the very local networks that are being rewired. No auxiliary network is allowed to make such decisions, as this would quickly exhaust the needed resources. The article proposes that thinking, pathway selection, perceiving an object, directing attention, and every cognitive operation is a process by which the brain temporarily rewires itself.

Figure 2: A putative ability of neural networks to transiently select subnetworks. A) A
schematic view on the transient selection hypothesis. i) The classical paradigm assumes that
connection strengths are fixed across all tasks that a neuron performs. i) Transient selection proposes
hat the routing of activity can temporarily change. Neurons are 'smart enough to use their receni
activity as a source of information for temporarily 'rewiring' their dendritic trees and axonal branches.
B) A cognitive operation such as perception of a grandmother is executed by transiently altering the
wiring of a network: To perceive a grandmother is to temporarily activate a subnetwork specific for
interactions with grandmothers (a "grandmother network"). Black: wires opened for traffic; gray:
wires closed for traffic. C) By sending outputs, a neuron not only inhibits or excites its targets but also
provides information on the basis of which the target rewires itself. This information can be sent (i)
backwards, (i) laterally, (ii) forward and (iv) possibly also to neurons with which no direct synaptic
connection is formed (disjoined interaction). D) Metabotropic receptors (MRs) and G protein-gated ion
channels (GPGICs) are the membrane proteins proposed to be responsible for the transient selection
capabilities of neural networks. An MR detects presence of a ligand in the extracellular space and
eleases a G protein which the activates a GPGIC; GPGIC opens or closes and by doing so alters the
electrical properties of the membrane. E) One source of ligands are 'runaway' neurotransmitters
resulting from nearby synaptic activity. F) As subnetworks are transiently selected, formed are novel
emporary sensory-motor loops specific for the current task. G) Example of a temporary sensory
motor loop needed to drive a car - to keep the car within a lane by keeping constant a given visual
angle making corrections by turning the steering wheel.
The second requirement is that the changes to wiring are sturdy. The new state of some
pathways being selected, and others being shut off must remain in place while the
subnetwork is being bombarded with new inputs; incoming activity should not be able to
wash away' the changes made to wiring. Again, sturdiness should not be brought about by
introducing an auxiliary network that would for example, apply recurrent activity. Again, such
additional networks would produce an explosion in required resources. Consequently, the
system would not scale well In conclusion, everything needs to be implemented locally, the
decisions and the maintenance of changes made.
Finally, the third requirement is that the changes are made in a transient manner: each
change should be reverted back after some time. Transiency ensures that one can return to
previous tasks, thoughts and ideas. No change should cross the point of no return. The
duration over which these transient changes should be valid i.e., until they revert back to the
initial state, probably varies and can be estimated from the known duration of our sensory
memory. The duration of the visual sensory memory (aka, iconic memory) has been
estimated to 200 to 300 ms [22, 23] and that of the auditory sensory memory (aka, echoic
memory) to up to 10 seconds [24]. These time windows are much longer than what the
changes in neuron's hyper- or depolarization can hold, as the altered states of voltages last
no longer than several miliseconds and can easily be 'washed away" by incoming inputs.

This passage describes the "transient selection hypothesis," which proposes that neural networks are capable of temporarily altering their wiring to select subnetworks for specific tasks. The hypothesis suggests that this ability to change wiring is brought about by the activity of individual neurons, which can use their recent activity to temporarily "rewire" their dendritic trees and axonal branches. The passage notes that this ability to select subnetworks must meet three requirements: it must be implemented locally, changes must be sturdy, and changes must be transient. Local implementation means that everything should be done within the network itself, without requiring additional resources or auxiliary networks. Sturdiness means that the changes made to wiring must remain in place while the subnetwork is being bombarded with new inputs. Transiency means that changes should be temporary and revert back to the initial state after some time. The duration of these transient changes can be estimated from the known duration of our sensory memory, which lasts for several hundred milliseconds for visual memory and up to ten seconds for auditory memory.
