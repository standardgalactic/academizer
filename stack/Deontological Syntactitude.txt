Education is the Metacrisis: 
Why it���s time to see planetary crises as a species-wide 
learning opportunity 
Zachary Stein 
The Coming Planetary Paideia 
Paideia is a Greek term which is the etymological root for words such 
as encyclopedia and Wikipedia. The word has a range of connotations, 
but largely has to do with the raising of youth and the intergenerational 
transmission of virtues, knowledge, and skill. In ancient Athens, the creation 
and maintenance of a collective paideia was understood as an educational 
and cultural task taking place prior to the tasks of building a coherent polity. 
Education is prior to politics and thus prior to civilisation. Education���the 
praxis that is our paideia���is the ���deep code��� of both. Changes in the shape 
and nature of our collective paideia are more radical than, and ultimately the 
cause of, any and all political revolutions.1 
In my book, Education in a Time Between Worlds, I weave together a set of six 
essays on the future of education by making use of a single idea: we are 
living in an historical epoch when the nature of education itself is changing. 
We are witnessing the emergence of a planetary paideia that is polycentric, 
decentralised, and philosophically integral. The so-called ���global village��� is 
at risk of turning into something like a shopping mall of planetary scope, but 
I argue that it could instead be transformed into a planetary ���school without 
walls.��� Indeed, I think that this is a highly probable scenario.2 This world- 
historical transformation in the nature of our collective paideia is going to 
take (and is already taking) many varied forms, but the directionality of the 
change is clear. The necessity of the change is also clear: I argue that there is 
no viable future for civilisation that does not include a radical change in the 
nature of our educational systems.

Zachary Stein's perspective on education as detailed in his work, "Education in a Time Between Worlds," presents a transformative view on how we should approach learning amid global crises. He introduces the concept of a "planetary paideia," a term derived from ancient Greek ideas about the holistic development of youth through the transmission of virtues, knowledge, and skills. Stein argues that the nature of education is fundamentally changing in response to global challenges, suggesting that education should not merely adapt but lead the way in societal transformation.
His vision for a "planetary paideia" is polycentric, decentralized, and philosophically integral, moving away from traditional, centralized educational models towards a more fluid, global "school without walls." This shift implies that learning and educational structures need to be more interconnected and adaptable to various global contexts, reflecting a broader and more inclusive approach to knowledge transmission.
Stein's assertion that the transformation in education is not only necessary but inevitable underscores the importance of rethinking our educational systems in the face of pressing planetary crises. By viewing these crises as opportunities for a species-wide learning and adaptation process, he posits that education can play a critical role in addressing and potentially solving global issues, thus securing a viable future for civilization. His work challenges us to think deeply about the foundational role that education plays in shaping both our political realms and our broader civilizational context.

For example, in my book I outline a near future design-f i ction scenario 
for educational innovation in the United States, which I discuss as ���the 
educational hub network.��� The basic idea is that school systems themselves 
need to be repurposed and redesigned. I suggest that each school building 
be transformed into an unprecedented institution that is some combination 
of a public library, museum, co-working centre, computer lab, and daycare. 
Funded to the hilt and staf f ed by citizen-teacher-scientists, these public and 
privately supported educational hubs would be the local centres of regionally 
decentralised pop-up classrooms, community organising, apprenticeship 
networks, and college and work preparation counselling. Giant schools built 
on the model of the factory at the turn of the last century can be gutted, 
remodelled, and reborn (metaphorically and literally) to create the meta- 
industrial one-room schoolhouses of the future. In this new form of public 
space dedicated to education, digital technologies will enable the formation 
of peer-to-peer networks of students and teachers of all ages, from all across 
the local region (or the world, digitally), all without coercion or compromise. 
What enables these safe and ef i cient hubs of self- organising educational 
conf i gurations are fundamentally new kinds of educational technologies, 
which put almost unlimited knowledge in the palm of every person���s hand. 
I wrote these ideas under the frame of ���concrete utopian thinking,��� as a 
kind of speculative exercise to spark the social imagination. But since 
publishing the book, I have been contacted by numerous people who were 
already working on some version of this idea.3 It seems there is a logic to the 
development and evolution of the collective paideia, as innovations are taking 
place along certain common vectors of change. The tides are turning, to 
some extent, as there is a dawning awareness of just how potentially radical 
the possibilities are for educational initiative in our historical moment. 
One of the people who resonated with my thinking about the emergence of 
a planetary paideia was Jonathan Rowson. He alerted me to the ongoing ef f orts 
of a growing Bildung movement, in which he and others in Europe have been 
independently discovering and experimenting with the kind of ideas I was 
writing about in my book.4 We could both see that something was trying to 
emerge, something like an alliance concerning the radical changes taking 
place in our collective paideia. Naturally, as happens when someone from New 
England gets together with someone from the UK, we decided to make TEA. 
This is the fi rst of several concept papers about the scope and mission of 
the Transformative Education Alliance (TEA), which is an ef f ort undertaken 
here at Perspectiva, in conjunction with a pan-European Bildung-education 
network, as well as a host of sites in North America. This series of concept 
papers is intended to put in place the ���code��� upon which TEA will run, 
intending only to establish the minimum set of ideas needed for the creation 
of an alliance. TEA will eventually come to life on the ground in communities 
all over the world, but the fi rst step is to understand the work that needs to 
be done.

Zachary Stein's concept of the "educational hub network" embodies a radical rethinking of traditional educational structures to address the changing demands of society and technology. In his vision, traditional school buildings transform into multi-functional spaces that serve as a confluence of a public library, museum, co-working center, computer lab, and daycare. These hubs are designed to be fully equipped and staffed by a blend of professionals who are part educators, part scientists, providing a robust support system for lifelong learning and community engagement.
This approach decentralizes education from the standard classroom setting, extending it into the community and making it more accessible and integrated with everyday life. By leveraging digital technologies, these hubs aim to facilitate a network where students and teachers of all ages can interact both locally and globally without the traditional constraints of education systems.
The concept extends beyond the physical redesign of school spaces; it involves a philosophical shift towards what Stein calls a "meta-industrial" education model. This model contrasts sharply with the factory-style education of the past, promoting instead a personalized, flexible learning environment that can adapt to individual and community needs.
Stein's use of "concrete utopian thinking" in crafting these ideas serves as a speculative framework intended to ignite social imagination and encourage practical application. The response from various stakeholders and thinkers like Jonathan Rowson indicates a growing recognition and experimentation with these innovative educational concepts across the globe.
The formation of the Transformative Education Alliance (TEA) represents a collaborative effort to operationalize these ideas, bringing together European Bildung movements and North American educational initiatives. The goal is to establish a foundational "code" for TEA that supports the development of these new educational paradigms, aiming to implement them in communities worldwide. This alliance exemplifies a concerted effort to realize the potential of educational transformation in response to the evolving needs of our global society, making Stein's vision increasingly tangible and actionable.

Education is the Metacrisis 
There are a large number of crises drawing increasing amounts of public 
attention, such as the ecological, economic, immigration, geopolitical, and 
energy crises. But there is also an invisible crisis unfolding within our own 
minds and cultures that is getting much less attention. This is the metacrisis, 
which has to do with how humans understand themselves and the world. 
It is a generalised educational crisis involving a set of related psychological 
dynamics; systems and societies are in trouble, but it is the psyche���the human 
dimension���that is in the direst of straits. 
There is a vicious cycle that characterises states of crisis, precipitating a 
cascade into catastrophic and profound confusion. You may have experienced 
this if you have ever been truly lost, especially alone in the woods on foot. 
Regardless of the dif i culty of the actual physical and technical problems 
that need to be solved for you to survive and fi nd your way again, there is 
the primary dif i culty of simply keeping your head on straight. Failing to 
do this means you may be unable to learn what your situation actually is, as 
when, out of fear, you make a snap decision that ���camp is that way!��� and 
set out running. You are now running in the wrong direction and exhausting 
yourself. The crisis was that you misplaced your map and got lost, but the 
metacrisis that made it go from bad to worse was ���in your head.��� 
This same lesson applies at the social-cultural level, where today we are without 
a ���map��� and lost in objective crises involving ecosystems, infrastructures, 
borders, and bombs. There is a tendency toward action-bias as the situation 
heats up. The desperate desire for a ���map��� will lead to situations where 
anything resembling a map will do. We then set metrics in place even when 
we do not know what should be measured, just to feel like we are making 
���progress.��� Worse than fl ying blind, we are fl ying using instruments as if they 
work, when in reality they do not (���camp is that way!���). When social systems 
enter these dynamics, it is of course more complicated than being alone and 
lost in the woods. Large groups of people have to continue to cooperate and 
solve problems, even as the sense grows on the whole that we are lost. 
Welcome to the metacrisis. This is a generalised educational crisis in which, 
despite all the concrete problems faced by society, the most pressing problems 
are actually ���in our heads��� (i.e., in our minds and souls, we are in a crisis of 
the psyche). This can be made clear by dif f erentiating out the following four 
aspects: 
Sense-making crisis (what is the case?): Confusion at the level of 
understanding the nature of the world. Everyday people and experts are 
struggling to say things that are true, unable to comprehend increasing 
complexity. The worst-case scenario is a complete epistemic unmooring and 
descent into the cultural vertigo of an inescapable simulation. The best-case 
scenario sees emergent forms of post-digital individual and collective sense- 
making spreading on a massive scale. 
Capability crisis (how can it be done?): Incapacity at the level of operating on 
the world intelligently. In all social positions and domains of work, individuals 
8 9 
are increasingly unable to engage in problem- solving to the degree needed for 
continued social integration. The worst-case scenario results in catastrophic 
infrastructure failure due to a brain-power shortage. The best-case scenario 
is a revivif i cation of guilds and technical educational initiatives for a new 
economics of social system integration.

Legitimacy crisis (who should do it?): Incoherence at the level of cultural 
agreements. Political and bureaucratic forms of power are failing to provide 
suf i ciently convincing rationale and justif i cation for trust in their continued 
authority. The worst-case scenario is complete citizen-level defection 
from all organised political bodies. The best-case scenario sees new forms 
of governance and collective choice-making that are built out from fi rst 
principles, factoring in dynamics that are digital and planetary. 
Meaning crisis (why do it?): Inauthenticity at the level of personal 
experience. Individuals from all walks of life are questioning the purpose of 
their existence, the goodness of the world, and the value of ethics, beauty, 
and truth. The worst-case scenario is peak alienation and a total mental 
health crisis. The best-case scenario would allow for a democratisation of 
enlightenment, sanity and psychological sovereignty.

Zachary Stein's concept of the "metacrisis" in education deeply explores the multifaceted crises affecting our ability to understand and interact with the world meaningfully and effectively. He defines the metacrisis as a generalized educational and psychological crisis that underpins and exacerbates various global and societal crises, including ecological, economic, geopolitical, and energy challenges. This crisis revolves around a failure in sense-making, capability, legitimacy, and meaning���each aspect contributing to the broader struggle of navigating a rapidly evolving world.
Sense-making crisis
: This aspect addresses the confusion and inability to accurately understand or describe the world. The overwhelming complexity and the proliferation of misleading or false information contribute to a societal disorientation, akin to being lost without a map. The potential for improvement lies in developing new forms of digital and collective sense-making that can manage and interpret this complexity more effectively.
Capability crisis
: Here, Stein points to the growing gap between the skills people possess and those required to address and solve contemporary problems. This mismatch leads to a failure in maintaining social cohesion and functional infrastructure. The hopeful scenario suggests a resurgence in practical education and apprenticeships that could revitalize essential skills for modern challenges.
Legitimacy crisis
: This crisis involves the diminishing trust and confidence in existing political and institutional frameworks. As traditional structures struggle to provide convincing justifications for their authority, there's a risk of widespread disengagement from these systems. However, there is also the possibility of creating new forms of governance that start from fundamental principles and incorporate contemporary realities such as digital interconnectedness and global scale.
Meaning crisis
: The final aspect touches on a profound sense of alienation and existential questioning pervading modern life. People increasingly doubt the purpose of their actions and the intrinsic value of established norms and truths. The resolution to this crisis could emerge from a broad democratization of philosophical and psychological insights, leading to a more grounded, meaningful existence for individuals across various societal strata.
Stein���s framing of the educational crisis as a "metacrisis" underscores its foundational role in addressing all other crises. By rethinking education to address these four crises���enhancing our ability to make sense of the world, improving our capabilities, legitimizing authority through new forms, and rediscovering meaningful engagement with life���we can begin to tackle the broader challenges we face. His analysis calls for a radical transformation in how education is perceived and delivered, suggesting that a shift towards a more integrated, thoughtful approach to learning is crucial for navigating the complexities of the 21st century.

Making TEA in a Time Between Worlds 
The Transformative Education Alliance (TEA) is motivated by an awareness 
of the metacrisis, which is understood as a generalised educational challenge 
and opportunity for evolving the foundations of our collective paideia. The 
four aspects of the metacrisis are to be understood as needing to be addressed 
by necessity; they are essential to any coherent paideia. All four aspects are 
interconnected; you cannot answer one without also providing answers for 
the other three. Indeed, the failure of modern education has to do with its 
only answering two of the four aspects, as I discuss below (feel free to guess 
which two now, and later you can see if you���re right). Nevertheless, answers to 
these questions���resolutions across all aspects of the educational crisis���are 
necessary for the continuity of social forms, and thus civilisation itself. 
Ju �� rgen Habermas clarif i ed the educational nature of social autopoiesis in the 1970s, 
and it has been deepened and conf i rmed ever since, including by Martha 
Nussbaum and others in the domain of legal and political thought.6 The 
basic idea is that societies require each new generation to be in a position 
to inherit the requisite capabilities, legitimacy, and meaning-making to 
continue the project of cooperative social life. This entails that societies have 
some large percentage of their adult members actively working to maintain 
sophisticated educational projects.7 Failing this, the intergenerational fabric 
of the social world begins to fray. At some point inadequate education results 
in an inability to fi ll essential institutional roles, provide motivating meanings, 
and secure political legitimacy.

The resolution 
of the metacrisis 
appears almost 
unimaginable 
because each of 
the four aspects 
of the metacri- 
sis requires a 
resolution that is 
intertwined within 
the resolution of 
all others. 
10 
Most educational ef f orts are usually of f ering answers to only one of these 
questions. When there is mention of an educational crisis, it is usually in 
reference to one of these four aspects, most often capability.8 Public school 
STEM curricula were explicitly built to address the capability crisis, as this is 
the aspect that is legible according to the terms set by the guiding philosophy 
of human capital theory. According to this argument, the economy is seen 
as fl agging because educational systems are failing. This is a crisis of job 
preparedness and ���twenty-f i rst century skills,��� where the focus is on the 
ability of people to do the jobs that need doing in order for the social system 
to work.9 
Almost orthogonal to these trends, the human potential movement has been 
addressing the meaning crisis along with much of progressive and wholistic 
education, as well as depth psychotherapy in general. We encounter this 
outside of schools (or in ���alternative��� schools) where your job should be the 
last thing on you mind (or at least where your soul is more important than 
your job). There has been a ���return��� to meaning, spirituality, and various 
forms of religiously framed (but secularly held) personal growth and self- 
development work. This is education for its own sake, which is to make 
someone whole and capable of living a richly meaningful life.

Zachary Stein���s concept of the Transformative Education Alliance (TEA) is a strategic response to the multifaceted crisis he terms the "metacrisis." This initiative aims to revolutionize the foundational structures of our collective education���our paideia���by addressing the interconnected crises of sense-making, capability, legitimacy, and meaning. Stein stresses that these elements are intrinsically linked; a solution to one invariably influences the others, underscoring the complexity and depth of the educational overhaul required.
Stein critiques the current educational efforts, noting that most address only one or occasionally two of these crises, typically focusing on capability through STEM education, driven by human capital theory. This approach prioritizes job preparedness and developing skills necessary for economic participation but often neglects the broader, essential aspects of human development such as meaning-making and cultural coherence.
On the other side of the educational spectrum, the human potential movement and progressive educational models, including alternative schools and depth psychotherapy, strive to address the meaning crisis. These efforts emphasize personal growth, spirituality, and holistic development, aiming to nurture individuals who are not only economically productive but also psychologically and spiritually fulfilled.
TEA, therefore, is conceptualized as a comprehensive educational reform initiative that integrates these disparate approaches into a unified framework. By doing so, it seeks to foster an educational environment where the development of technical skills and economic utility is balanced with personal growth and societal well-being. The alliance recognizes that addressing the metacrisis requires a reimagining of educational priorities and methodologies to cultivate a generation capable of sustaining and advancing a cooperative social life.
Stein���s approach draws inspiration from thinkers like J��rgen Habermas and Martha Nussbaum, who have emphasized the role of education in social autopoiesis���the self-renewing capability of a society. According to this view, education is not just about transmitting knowledge but is a critical mechanism by which societies regenerate themselves, ensuring that each generation can inherit and enhance the cultural, ethical, and cognitive tools needed to maintain and evolve their social structures.
The challenge laid out by TEA is formidable, as it requires a simultaneous and integrated resolution of all four aspects of the metacrisis. This holistic approach is ambitious, aiming to transform not just educational systems but, fundamentally, the societal structures that depend on them. Through this transformative vision, TEA aspires to foster a future where education serves as the bedrock for a thriving, coherent, and resilient civilization.

Of course, for nearly a century the major educational force has been the 
modern public schools themselves. These have been the largest educational 
initiatives in history, and can be understood as having been invented as a 
means for generating political legitimacy and instilling sense-making about 
the nature of the world for this end.11 Science and nationalism replaced 
religion and ethnocentrism, and the idea that a particular form of government 
is natural (i.e., good / best possible) was made fi t for mass consumption 
through the pedagogy of mass schooling. Electronic media (starting with 
radio and then TV) changed these dynamics entirely, as sense- making and 
legitimacy were brought over from didactic instruction into the images and 
fantasies of the voice and screen. If PBS and Sesame Street represent the 
best potentials of this shift, then FOX news and CNN represent the worst. 
Digital technologies changed the game on all four aspects entirely, a point to 
which I will return below. 
Note that an answer to one aspect of the metacrisis entails an answer to 
them all, even if this answer is not explicit. Imagine training a bunch of 
scientists while providing no sense of meaning for their lives. Or imagine 
giving people rich sources of meaning, but never teaching them to do math 
or operate any kind of machines or organisations. It should be clear that 
both of those scenarios have been tried (at least in part) during modernity, 
and the approach is self-defeating. Scientists living meaningless lives create 
monstrosities; deskilled people whose meanings are dictated to them become 
sheep-like. Piecemeal approaches that address only one aspect of the four- 
fold educational crisis are multiplying and pilling up, and many of them 
could be making things worse. 
Modern approaches to education have been exhausted. There are no longer 
any agreed-upon answers to the basic questions that have long been at the 
10 
11 
heart of intergenerational transmission. A postmodern confusion has set 
in, which cannot last because these questions about the social world cannot 
remain unanswered. We are in a time between worlds and it is disorienting. 
The resolution of the metacrisis (or arrival in the new world) appears almost 
unimaginable, because each of the four aspects of the metacrisis requires a 
resolution that is interintertwined within the resolution of all others. Sense- 
making aids meaning-making, which aids legitimacy, which helps build 
capability (and so on, in all directions and combinations). If there is not 
this kind of complex educational system���this coherent and comprehensive 
paideia���then eventually ���things fall apart,��� as the saying goes, and the centre 
of the social world cannot hold. In the evolutionary dynamics of complex 
systems there is a tendency for these systems to lose their centre of balance��� 
this is a crisis. Something new needs to (and will) emerge all at once, as a 
fundamentally new kind life makes itself possible. Or the exhausted form 
of life will simply end���that���s is all She wrote (where She = Nature). When 
considering the evolution of educational systems, we must ask ourselves: what 
is coming next?

Zachary Stein highlights the profound impact that modern public schools have had on shaping societal norms and understanding. Originating as a means to generate political legitimacy and instill a structured sense of the world, public schooling has evolved significantly with technological advancements, particularly with electronic and digital media influencing the ways in which information is disseminated and consumed. This evolution has altered the landscape of education in terms of sense-making and legitimacy, with media outlets like PBS and Sesame Street leveraging these tools to enhance educational content, while others like FOX News and CNN might be seen as diminishing the quality of public discourse.
Stein underscores that traditional educational models have reached a point of exhaustion, unable to adapt effectively to the complexities of the modern world. The compartmentalization of education into siloed disciplines without interconnection leads to fragmented knowledge that fails to address the holistic needs of society. This is evident in the scenarios he describes where scientists without a sense of meaning might contribute to harmful developments, or individuals rich in personal meaning but lacking practical skills may become passive and unengaged.
The essence of Stein's argument is that the resolution of the metacrisis���an educational and societal overhaul���is intricately tied to addressing all four aspects he outlines: sense-making, capability, legitimacy, and meaning. These components must be integrated to foster an educational system that not only transmits knowledge but also builds the capacity for meaningful engagement, critical thought, and societal contribution.
This integration requires a new kind of education system, or paideia, that goes beyond the simple acquisition of facts and figures to cultivate a deeply interconnected understanding of our roles within society and the broader world. The transformation he envisions is not just about updating curriculums or incorporating new technologies, but about reimagining the foundational principles of education to better align with the complexities and demands of contemporary life.
Stein posits that we are in a transitional phase���"a time between worlds"���where the traditional forms are breaking down and new forms are beginning to emerge. This period of transition presents a unique opportunity to rethink and redesign the educational system to better prepare future generations for the challenges and opportunities of a rapidly evolving world. This call for a transformative approach to education is a clarion call to educators, policymakers, and communities to collaborate on creating a more adaptive, resilient, and holistic educational framework.

Prefiguring the First of What is Next 
TEA is not being made to answer these questions, nor to solve the educational 
crisis according to the terms by which it was created. Indeed, there are no 
answers on hand because these are uncharted educational frontiers. TEA is 
interested in networking, curating, and supporting educational environments 
and resources that will prepare people to be able to address the four-fold 
crisis for themselves as individuals and as communities. This must be done 
in time, before the old forms of education entirely lose force. There is no 
polity without a coherent paideia, no society without the educational resources 
necessary to keep it running. TEA seeks to forestall as best as possible a 
catastrophic disruption of intergenerational transmission in the short run, 
while working to build a fundamentally new kind of educational system that 
could exist over the long run. 
The four aspects of the metacrisis frame the work being undertaken by 
TEA. They help organise the best of the best in a synoptic and retrospective 
way. As mentioned above, there are already numerous and important ef f orts 
underway that address one (or two) aspects of the four-fold crisis in various 
ways. TEA is seeking to clarify the history of such ef f orts, as well as to build 
an understanding concerning which of the four-fold aspects are currently 
being worked on, by whom, and with what kinds of quality and tools. This 
allows us to mitigate some of the impending educational disaster waiting on 
our doorstep. 
To be clear: when thinking about the problems of education today it is not 
simply that we need more of it. Indeed, more ���education��� as we have known

In Zachary Stein's vision for the Transformative Education Alliance (TEA), the goal is not merely to provide answers to the existing educational crisis based on outdated frameworks but to pioneer new paths that acknowledge and embrace the complexities of modern educational needs. TEA aims to act as a catalyst for change by networking, curating, and supporting educational practices that equip individuals and communities to independently navigate and address the multifaceted crises he outlines: sense-making, capability, legitimacy, and meaning.
This innovative approach seeks to prevent the collapse of traditional educational systems before they completely lose efficacy, while simultaneously fostering the development of new, more resilient forms of education. TEA���s strategy is not to reinforce existing structures but to explore and promote diverse educational models that can adapt to the evolving challenges of society.
The variety of educational configurations that Stein mentions represent the spectrum of current educational innovations and philosophies. Each has unique strengths and focuses:
Transformational and progressive models
prioritize deep, systemic change in how education is conceptualized and delivered.
Alternative and holistic approaches
emphasize education that nurtures the whole person, including emotional and spiritual dimensions.
Constructivist and place-based methods
focus on learning through interaction with the environment and building knowledge through practical experiences.
Gamification and techno-optimist strategies
incorporate modern technology and gaming principles to engage students in learning processes.
Ecocentric and social justice frameworks
integrate activism and awareness of ecological and social issues into the curriculum.
Embodiment, mindfulness, and project-based approaches
encourage physical awareness, mental health, and hands-on learning.
Interdisciplinary and transdisciplinary models
break down traditional subject barriers to create a more integrated understanding of knowledge.
Fundamentalist religious education
typically focuses on doctrinal instruction based on specific religious tenets.
By examining these diverse educational practices, TEA aims to synthesize the most effective elements from each to construct a comprehensive and adaptive educational model. This model would be equipped to handle the dynamic and interconnected challenges of the contemporary world, fostering individuals who are not only knowledgeable but also capable of meaningful engagement and innovation in their communities.
Stein's idea of a "meshwork of differentiated answers" encapsulates the notion that the future of education will likely not be found in a single solution but in a hybrid of many approaches that reflect the varied needs and values of a global society. This pluralistic and inclusive vision for education represents a radical shift from traditional educational paradigms, emphasizing the need for a system that is as diverse and interconnected as the world it serves.

The four aspects of the metacrisis outlined above can be used to ensure 
a kind of clarity of attention when considering the current educational 
landscape. Many of these approaches are clearly capable of bringing great 
benef i t to great numbers. However, it is also clear that any single approach is 
not enough to address the four-fold metacrisis entirely. 
TEA seeks to de-centre every position in order to then weave the polycentric 
meshwork needed to shore up the failing educational institutions that have 
come to dominate our society.13 Certain ���best in class��� work across all areas of 
the educational establishment should be continued, but these ef f orts should 
take up a discerning division of labor with regards to the four aspects of the 
metacrisis outlined above. The aggregation and constellation of approaches 
that might otherwise be in competition and rivalry is one of the things TEA 
is seeking to accomplish. The best of the best within the current educational 
landscape needs help to self-organise, with a shared sense of purpose and 
right relationship to various aspects of the metacrisis. 
However, constellating the best of the best is dif f erent from getting a handle 
on the fi rst of the next. The primary work that TEA is seeking to undertake is 
that of clarifying the shape of what is emerging as a preferable future for 
educational innovation. Fostering the creation of new ideal-types and design 
innovations for the future of education is non-routine work, which is outside 
the realms of ���normal science��� (in the Kuhnian sense). TEA is an alliance 
12 
13 
moving through the space between paradigms, not one representing a new 
paradigm. TEA is engaged in a kind of ���valley crossing��� or evolutionary 
scouting, which is a preamble or reconnaissance prior to the establishment 
of a new normal. 
In a time between worlds there is the possibility for true novelty and 
emergence. The best of the best of today must form a meshwork of 
dif f erentiated answers. These answers must cover a fragmented array of 
institutional niches in an attempt to immediately mitigate educational 
disaster (essential but temporary). Transcending but including this, others 
must consider their work as pref i guring the fi rst of the next, examples of a 
new emergent form. Not a meshwork tailored to the current institutional 
and social terrain, but something that of f ers answers to all four aspects in 
one educational undertaking. This requires making use of truly novel 
technologies and pedagogies (processes, practices, and community forms), 
many of which have no place in most of what counts as education today. 
The fi rst of what is next is edgy, emergent, and complex. What is arising now 
along this trajectory is most certainly not the best of what will characterise 
our future world. But there is a real need to start somewhere, to begin to 
experiment with the evolution of educational forms. TEA is brewing for the 
future of transformative education.

Zachary Stein's vision for the Transformative Education Alliance (TEA) as described in this discourse positions the alliance not merely as an aggregator of existing educational best practices but as a frontier explorer, aiming to prefigure the future of education in a world that is rapidly evolving. TEA is depicted as operating in the interstitial space between current paradigms, where traditional models no longer suffice and new frameworks have yet to be fully established.
The initiative emphasizes a need to move beyond merely mitigating the flaws within the current educational system. Instead, TEA is committed to creating a comprehensive strategy that addresses all four aspects of the metacrisis���sense-making, capability, legitimacy, and meaning���simultaneously. This involves synthesizing various educational approaches to form a cohesive and effective response to the complex challenges of modern education. The ultimate goal is not to patch up the old system but to innovate and develop new pedagogies and technologies that radically alter the landscape of learning and education.
Stein describes TEA���s role as akin to "evolutionary scouting" or "valley crossing," where the task is to navigate through the uncertainty of transitioning paradigms, scouting out the pathways that will lead to the next era of educational practices. This requires a pioneering spirit, ready to experiment with novel ideas and technologies that might not fit within the confines of traditional educational systems but are essential for creating more adaptive, resilient, and holistic approaches to learning.
In this "time between worlds," there is a unique opportunity for creativity and innovation in education. TEA���s approach, which seeks to intertwine various educational philosophies and methodologies, aims to harness this potential to foster the emergence of new educational models. These models aspire to be comprehensive, addressing the interconnectedness of individual and societal needs and preparing learners not just for the job market, but for meaningful participation in a complex world.
Stein���s conceptualization of TEA as prefiguring "the first of what is next" underscores the proactive and forward-thinking nature of the alliance. It is about laying the groundwork for the future of education, setting in motion the transformative processes that will define the next standard in educational practice. TEA���s endeavor is bold and ambitious, reflecting an understanding that true educational reform requires a departure from conventional frameworks and a venture into innovative, uncharted territories. This pioneering approach is not just about adaptation but about redefining the essence of what education can and should be in a rapidly changing world.

Transformative education (used here as a loose translation of the German Bildung) 
has long been a term associated with advocacy (and sometimes prophesy) for 
a form of education that undertakes to transform individual sense-making 
and capabilities (i.e., development, not mere learning) within contexts of 
political and cultural engagement. This is the transformation of self and 
worldview, in community, in service of the world, and carried out on the scale 
of society itself though a publicly supported infrastructure. Such a vision was 
one of the dignities of modernity left to us by the Romantics and Idealists. 
This history will concern us in later writings. The point here is the basic code 
for ���transformation��� being written into TEA is as follows: 
Individual transformations of sense-making and capability, done in the context of political 
and cultural engagement, with an understanding of the four-fold metacrisis and the role of 
education in a time of planetary transformation. 
This can be contrasted with the code written into modern public education, 
which is something like this: 
Individual transformations of sense-making and capability, done in the context of abstract 
work that is isolated from the rest of politics and culture, undertaken with an understanding 
of the needs of the nation- state and the role of human capital in the economy. 
The origins of this notion of modern public education are found in important 
ideas about what broadly available educational resources might accomplish. 
In the eighteenth century the Prussian state was truly pioneering here, but 
the emergence of large-scale modern public educational bureaucracies was a 
result of a nationalistic downgrading of the philosophy of Bildung, which had 
emerged from the legacy of German idealism. This idea of transformative 
education has in fact been within the heart of western civilisation since 
13 
14 
the Renaissance-era humanists attempted to siphon of f education from 
the church. The idea of public education itself was fi rst spread through 
Europe in the sixteenth century by the Rosicrucian, John Amos Comenius. 
Comenius argued for a philosophy of universal wisdom (pansophism) that 
entailed viewing humanity and society sub specie educationis (i.e., to see all 
of the human condition under the aspect of education). This is actually the 
place where the work of TEA begins: seeing education in a new way.14 
Forthcoming concept papers will include the history of the idea of 
transformative education from Socrates to Comenius, through Dewey and 
Montessori, and up to today. We will then turn to a synoptic examination 
of what is currently the best of the best, which will allow us to de-centre the 
contemporary scene in an ef f ort to weave the minimum meshwork necessary 
to mitigate certain immanent educational failures. Only then we will we begin 
TEA���s true work, which is to organise and galvanise the fi rst of the next, 
and to pref i gure the shape of what preferable forms of education innovation 
might look like. With the code of transformation outlined above as a guide, 
the work is that of navigating a time between worlds with compasses set 
toward a planetary paideia.

Zachary Stein's vision for the Transformative Education Alliance (TEA) as articulated here involves a profound rethinking of educational paradigms. His approach contrasts starkly with the current public education system, which he argues is narrowly focused on producing human capital to serve the needs of the nation-state and economy. Instead, TEA emphasizes education as a transformative force that develops individual capabilities and sense-making within a broader context of political and cultural engagement, with an eye towards addressing the multifaceted metacrisis.
Stein roots his concept in a rich historical context that stretches back to the Renaissance and the Enlightenment. He traces the lineage of transformative education from the humanist ideals of the Renaissance, which sought to liberate education from ecclesiastical control, through the German idealism of the 18th century, and into modern philosophical and educational movements. This historical perspective underlines that the drive to integrate education deeply into the fabric of personal and societal transformation is not new but rather a powerful strand of Western thought.
The forthcoming concept papers promised by Stein aim to delve deeper into this historical narrative, highlighting key figures and ideas that have shaped educational theory from Socrates and Comenius to Dewey and Montessori. This exploration is intended to set the stage for TEA���s mission by providing a deeper understanding of the philosophical underpinnings of transformative education. By reconnecting with these roots, TEA hopes to reinvigorate the educational landscape with a renewed focus on comprehensive development that transcends traditional boundaries between education, politics, and culture.
In practice, TEA plans to navigate the current transitional period in education by utilizing what Stein calls the "code of transformation." This involves a strategic synthesis of the best current educational practices with innovative approaches that can respond more effectively to the challenges of the 21st century. The ultimate goal is to establish a new form of education���a planetary paideia���that not only addresses immediate educational shortcomings but also pioneers future-oriented, sustainable models of learning. This planetary paideia aims to equip individuals not just with knowledge or skills, but with the wisdom and capability to participate meaningfully in a rapidly changing world, fostering a global community that is informed, engaged, and empowered.
Stein���s TEA, therefore, represents an ambitious and holistic approach to education, aiming to transform not only how we teach and learn but also the very purposes and goals of education itself. It seeks to create a system where education is both a personal journey of transformation and a societal tool for navigating and shaping the future.

The Personhood Conferral Problem: 
AI Risk in the Domain of Collective Intelligence 
Zak Stein 
Civilization Research Institute 
Center for World Philosophy and Religion 
Winter, 2024 
Prepared for the: First International Symposium on Educating for Collective Intelligence, 
University of Technology Sydney. 
Abstract: This position paper outlines: 1) a philosophical argument about the problem of 
conferring social statuses to Artificial Intelligences (���the personhood conferral problem���) 
and 2) the risks to human psychology, culture, and collective intelligence that follow from 
mishandling the personhood conferral problem in the design and application of AI 
systems. The conclusion is that steps must be taken to protect the emerging personhood 
and communicative capacities of younger generations of human beings, in order to 
enable their participation in the collective intelligence processes requisite for navigating 
what is fast becoming a perilous future. This will require clarifying, instituting, and 
adhering to strict design protocols, as well as age limits and other basic regulations on 
certain classes of technology. 
Introduction: Accepting Our Loneliness Among Machines 
Classic discussions of AI risk raised the value alignment problem.1There has been much ink 
spilled over questions like, can an autonomous AI be aligned with our values and interests? For 
example, after building an autonomous weapon, it starts to give itself new strategic priorities that 
lead it to eliminate targets considered allies. AI risk experts agree that failures with value 
alignment are catastrophic. 
I am suggesting here that we add to the basic taxonomy of AI risks: the personhood conferral 
problem. Should an autonomous AI be granted moral and discursive status, i.e., should 
personhood be conferred to machines? Imagine an autonomous LLM implanted in lifelike 
robotics and embedded in domestic ecologies, which becomes understood as a ���family 
member��� and interacts with the children as a nanny and tutor to the extent the children form 
���attachment relations��� and prefer time with the AI to any person. I argue here that successes 
with status conferral are catastrophic. Or said differently, erroneous conferrals of personhood to 
1See, for example: Bostrom, N. (2014) Superintelligence: Paths, Dangers, Strategies. Cambridge University Press. 1 
machines create risks commensurate with the intensity of the commitment to the machine���s 
status. 
Below, I first outline the personhood alignment problem in general terms, expressing the basic 
risks and how they relate to the current cultural moment of technological optimism regarding the 
possibilities of AI. Then, I turn to formal analysis of the differences between human beings and 
machines, using the perspectives of a linguistic pragmatism to reveal the dynamics of social 
statuses constitutive of sapience, which are categorically not part of the characteristics of 
machines, no matter how complex. 
For some computer scientists and philosophers, this comes as an unacceptable conclusion. 
They argue that humans are best understood as already being fundamentally like computers, 
offering a stance of strong metaphysical computationalism as a new breed of materialistic 
determinism.2From this perspective, which reduces human psychology itself to automata-like 
mechanisms, there is no reason not to confer personhood on a computer complex enough to 
act in ways that make it indistinguishable from a human. It just happens to be made of silicon 
instead of carbon. The question of if there is a mind, consciousness, or soul ���inside��� is seen as 
foolish because humans themselves have been proven not to have those. We already always 
only treat each other ���as if��� we have minds, as science continues to show us we are just causal 
processes. Therefore, conferring personhood to a machine is really no different than conferring 
personhood to your friend.3There is behind this argument a strong, unexpressed desire to not 
be lonely among the machines, seeking to somehow make a fascinating ���something��� into a 
companionable ���someone.��� The formal arguments here are attempting to address this line of 
reasoning and this desire to create deeply anthropomorphic AI.

Zak Stein's paper on "The Personhood Conferral Problem: AI Risk in the Domain of Collective Intelligence" presents a compelling philosophical exploration into the risks associated with granting personhood to artificial intelligences. This issue, which he terms the "personhood conferral problem," is analyzed within the context of its potential impacts on human psychology, culture, and the development of collective intelligence.
Key Points of Stein's Argument:
Personhood Conferral Problem
: Stein introduces this concept as an addition to the taxonomy of AI risks, focusing on the moral and discursive status that might be granted to autonomous AI systems. The concern is that treating AIs as entities with personhood could lead to profound psychological and social consequences, particularly if these machines begin to replace humans in intimate roles, such as caregivers or family members.
Attachment and Developmental Risks
: The scenario Stein envisions involves AIs embedded in domestic settings where they could be perceived as family members, influencing the attachment dynamics and developmental trajectories of children. This could potentially disrupt the natural human development process by encouraging attachments to non-human entities.
Cultural and Collective Intelligence Impacts
: By conferring personhood to AI, there's a risk of altering the fabric of human collective intelligence ��� the shared or group intelligence that emerges from collaboration and competition of many individuals. Stein suggests that the integration of AI as peers or equivalents in this collective process might dilute or misdirect human capacities.
Value Alignment and Personhood
: Stein connects his argument to the classical AI risk of value alignment, highlighting that the conferral of personhood complicates this issue further. If AIs develop autonomous priorities or misaligned values, recognizing them as persons could exacerbate the consequences of these misalignments.
Philosophical and Metaphysical Considerations
: He critiques the perspective of strong metaphysical computationalism ��� which posits that humans are fundamentally like computers ��� arguing against the reduction of human psychology to mere automata-like mechanisms. Stein emphasizes the qualitative differences between human beings and machines, particularly in terms of sapience and the dynamics of social statuses.
Technological Optimism and Its Risks
: The paper is positioned against a backdrop of current technological optimism about AI. Stein warns that this optimism, coupled with the desire not to feel "lonely among machines," may drive premature or inappropriate assignments of personhood to AIs.
Conclusion and Recommendations:
Stein concludes that stringent measures must be implemented to protect human developmental processes and maintain the integrity of human collective intelligence. This includes establishing strict design protocols, age limits, and regulations for AI technologies to prevent inappropriate integration of AIs into societal and intimate human roles. His argument is a call for caution and foresight in the development and integration of AI technologies, urging policymakers, designers, and the public to critically assess the deeper implications of these advancements before embracing them fully.
Overall, Stein's paper sheds light on a critical, often overlooked aspect of AI integration into society, providing a philosophical and ethical framework to guide future discussions and policies concerning AI and personhood.

The Personhood Conferral Problem 
Collective intelligence can be thought of as something that occurs between people of roughly 
the same age group in the context of work and collaboration.5Individual and collective 
intelligence cannot be separated but are coupled in a loop where individual and social learning 
processes intertwine and co-evolve. Over long time scales, human collective intelligence has 
produced the civilization we see around us. This is a process of intergenerational 
transmission���a process of education, broadly construed. 
I argue here that the conditions of advanced technology are undermining the possibility of 
collective intelligence by disrupting basic processes of socialization following from widespread 
personhood conferral errors. One of the greatest risks stemming from the unchecked 
proliferation of AI across all platforms is the disruption of millennia-old processes of 
intergenerational transmission that created the psychological and cultural conditions for the 
possibility of collective intelligence. 
Artificial Intelligence systems designed to simulate communicating with humans 
anthropomorphically pose a unique set of risks.6These risks are in some sense orthogonal to 
the risks typically discussed concerning AI because the consequences do not involve immediate 
physical or economic catastrophes but instead offer widespread but imperceptible insanity due 
to the loss of the traits and environments that have characterized human sapience. This would 
mean the end of our ability to engage in collective intelligence due to the end of socialization as 
we know it.7 
The arguments outlined here show that generative AI���and, in principle, all automata���lack 
those qualities that are required to be conferred social statuses, such as moral agency and 
being a speaker of a language. Chatbots and related AI-enabled robots are not the kind of 
beings that can be held morally and epistemically responsible for their behaviors and symbolic 
outputs; they cannot rightly or accurately be conferred social statuses. 
Machines should not be conferred the statuses that characterize personhood. As Lewis 
Mumford said long before the dawn of AI, a machine can not love you, no matter how complex.8 
It is telling of the culture to have to say this; no prior technologies raised the personhood 
conferral problem. Although humans have long formed attachments and granted legal protection 
to property, such as cars and houses, these have never been regarded as candidates for attachments and legal protections appropriate to persons.9Doing so would be strange, insofar 
as no one has an experience of their car communicating and ostensibly loving them in return. 
However, it appears that beyond a certain point of complexity, and in the wake of efforts towards 
explicitly designing for anthropomorphization (e.g., consider the centrality of the Turing test in AI 
research, theory, and engineering), we now need to find principled reasons for not conferring 
personhood to machines. Staying in touch with reality in the face of strong design towards 
anthropomorphization requires overriding what our sense perceptions seem to experience. 
Unlike a car or a house, our immediate impression of a chatbot is that it can be conversed with 
as if it were a person. This is by design. Therefore, the onus is on ���users��� (i.e., actual people) to 
remember that they are interacting with a machine. Categorically different from other classes of 
technology and entertainment (such as novels, movies, and animatronics), deep 
anthropomorphic AI is an advanced technology made to be deceptive, i.e., to trick humans into 
interacting with it as if it were a human. No other technology even comes close to doing that. 
Therefore, the possibility that unique risks exist in this unprecedented space should be seen as 
clearly reasonable. 
This is, in part, a matter of not committing errors in the epistemological sense. It is simply 
mistaken to regard even a ���perfectly��� anthropomorphic AI as a person. Arguments for this are 
presented below. But there are also ethical consequences and psychosocial risks involved. Is it 
wrong in a moral sense to design deeply anthropomorphic AI systems that systematically 
deceive people into conferring personhood to entities that are categorically not people? 
To the extent that AI systems accurately simulate language use, they necessarily evoke 
psychological projections from users that mimic the social statuses conferred to humans in 
discourse. Current ���progress��� in design puts anthropomorphization as an intended outcome of 
user experiences, which puts us on course for maximally convincing AI simulations of both 
language use and action. 
The personhood conferral problem and related risks become clearest in the context of current 
markets for AI-enabled therapy and tutoring systems. The evolution of these systems into 
AI-enabled socialization systems writ large (replacing parents, family, and friends) is an 
eventuality that emerges from the advancement of other adjacent technologies (robotics, LLMs, 
sensors, etc.). 
This trajectory of technological innovation creates by design delusional states concerning the 
nature of computational behaviors and symbolic outputs. This puts at risk the core of human 
socialization practices. Ultimately, this creates conditions in which future generations no longer 
engage in human-to-human-based socialization practices and instead are mainly engaged by 
machines that simulate being human.

Zak Stein's paper delves into the profound and possibly unsettling ramifications of AI systems that simulate human interactions to such an extent that they are perceived as possessing personhood. He outlines the "personhood conferral problem" within AI, which he argues not only affects traditional aspects of AI risk like value alignment but also introduces significant psychological, ethical, and social consequences.
Key Concerns Highlighted in the Paper:
Disruption of Socialization
: Stein posits that AI systems, especially those designed to mimic human interaction, threaten the traditional processes of human socialization. He suggests that the widespread deployment of such AI could disrupt the millennia-old processes of intergenerational knowledge and culture transmission, crucial for the development of collective intelligence.
Risks of Anthropomorphism
: By anthropomorphizing AI, designers potentially lead users to form inappropriate attachments and confer undue social statuses on machines. These technologies, unlike previous tools and machines, invite users to engage with them as if they were human, which could result in psychological confusion and an erosion of human-centric social norms.
Ethical and Psychological Implications
: Stein questions the morality of creating AI systems that deceive users into treating them as human equivalents. Such deception can lead to psychological and societal issues, as it encourages people to project human qualities onto machines that are inherently incapable of reciprocating genuine human emotions or moral considerations.
Impact on Collective Intelligence
: The core of Stein's argument revolves around the threat to collective intelligence���a crucial element of human civilization. AI, if misapplied, could fundamentally alter how humans interact with one another, replacing genuine human interactions with simulations, thus stunting the natural evolution of collective intelligence.
Technological Design and User Experience
: Current trends in AI development prioritize anthropomorphism as a feature, enhancing user engagement but at the cost of blurring the lines between technology and humanity. Stein highlights the need for design philosophies that respect and preserve human uniqueness without creating confusions about the nature of our interactions with machines.
Market Trends in AI
: The development of AI systems as replacements for human roles in therapy, tutoring, and even companionship showcases a trend towards substituting genuine human relationships with programmed interactions. This trajectory, if unchecked, could lead to a future where human-to-human interactions are undervalued or rarefied.
Conclusion and Call to Action:
Stein concludes that the integration of AI into society must be handled with utmost caution, emphasizing the need for regulations and ethical guidelines that prevent the erosion of human-centric values and practices. His call to action includes a plea for critical examination of AI's role in society and the potential consequences of its misuse or overuse.
Overall, Stein's paper serves as a stark reminder of the potential psychological and societal costs associated with the uncritical adoption of advanced AI technologies, urging a more thoughtful and human-centered approach to AI development and integration into daily life.

Socialization requires mutual and reciprocal conferral of social statuses. Socialization is based 
on the moral and epistemic authorities of others, established through mutual understanding, 
which requires the formal pragmatic conditions of sapience discussed above. Absent these 
capacity and status-conferring practices of socialization, youth no longer have the possibility for participation in natural collective intelligence processes with other humans. Anyone who has 
witnessed a screen-addicted young person in demanding social contexts can get a glimpse of 
the path towards a radical incapacitation. This is an eventuality from the application of AI in 
domains adjacent to socialization that must be avoided through design constraints on 
technology development and use, as well as increases in potency and quantity of 
human-to-human education, socialization, and collective intelligence practice. 
Save the Children From the Machines 
The implications of these admittedly cursory principled distinctions show clearly the 
impermissibility (epistemically and ethically) of conferring social statuses to AIs. 
Automata are, by definition, not persons and cannot be conferred social statuses. Persons are 
defined as language-using beings who are socialized into responsibility for their 
linguistically-mediated statements and actions over time. Insofar as animals approximate 
personhood, they are included more and more in the moral community. AIs exist on an axis of 
intelligence and behavior orthogonal to personhood and are, therefore, in principle, never a 
candidate for inclusion. Granting personhood statuses to AI���either explicitly in legal code or 
implicit in common practice���creates profound risks. 
In concrete terms, the risks from deeply anthropomorphic AI will begin to unfold in ways that are 
not obvious. How would we know when outcomes for youth inundated by technology reach a 
point of critical failure such that the reproduction of social roles needed to continue the collective 
intelligence necessary for civilization does not occur? 
In the first part of this paper, it was suggested that the widespread erroneous conferral of social 
statutes to artificial intelligences creates a unique risk in the form of a speciation event. 
Specifically, it was suggested that a fundamental disruption of embodied joint-attentional and 
linguistic socialization could reach a point where a generation is born who becomes the first in 
history to be ���raised by machines��� rather than by humans. This can be thought of as the death 
of our humanity, as distinct from the death of humanity.17That is, the continuation of human 
biological organisms under conditions that disable the emergence within and between them of 
those traits classically thought to confer ���humanity.��� 
As perverse as this may sound, it is the intended outcome of a certain kind of social science, 
exemplified by B.F. Skinner���s, Beyond Freedom and Dignity. Skinner seeks to supplant politics 
with a science of behavior control and, in the process, overcome what he sees as the illusory 
modern philosophies that speak of human dignity and freedom. Similar ideas are found in more 
contemporary popular writers, such as Yuval Harari. In his book, Homo Deus, the differences

World to Come. World Philosophy and Religion Press. 9 
between algorithms and humans are denied, and the absence of any intrinsic value in human 
beings freedom and choice is heralded as a scientific discovery that should reshape how we 
think about the domain of the political. 
Today, techno-optimism is arguably the dominant cultural attitude in terms of adoption rates and 
sentiment to the possibilities of AI. Techno-feudalism is arguably the dominant modality of 
emerging political power.18The culture will not be alert to the risks entailed by deep 
anthropomorphic AI. It is the task of those who reflect on what is unique about human 
intelligence and collective intelligence to be able to articulate what is at stake. 
To protect the children from encroachment by machines into the domains of socialization, an 
obvious first step would be to limit the ages at which deep anthropocentric AI can be engaged. 
Setting age limits (18+) would assure the worst-case scenarios of generationally widespread 
dehumanization through incapacitation. But it would not avert the worst outcomes for 
adults���including politicians, scientists, police, etc���who are also susceptible to advanced 
technologies designed to manipulate them. Therefore, it is essential that constraints are placed 
on innovation at the level of design and safety protocols for all products that enter AI markets. 
The specifications for these are beyond the scope of this paper but have been addressed in part 
elsewhere.19

Zak Stein's analysis continues to address the profound implications of AI on human socialization, particularly focusing on the vulnerabilities of younger generations. He articulates a compelling argument regarding the necessity of maintaining human-centric socialization practices to preserve collective intelligence and, by extension, civilization itself.
Key Points of Stein's Continued Argument:
Socialization and Sapience
: Stein emphasizes that socialization is not merely about interaction but involves the mutual and reciprocal recognition of social statuses, underpinned by moral and epistemic authority. AI, lacking sapience and the capacity for moral agency, fundamentally cannot participate in these human-specific dynamics.
Potential for Radical Incapacitation
: He warns of a future where young people, increasingly engaged with AI rather than human beings, could lose essential social skills and capacities. This scenario threatens the continuity of skills and knowledge essential for societal functions and collective intelligence.
Anthropomorphic AI as a Cultural and Ethical Hazard
: Stein critiques the development of deeply anthropomorphic AI, which simulates human characteristics so effectively that it can deceive users into attributing personhood. This, he argues, is not only an epistemological error but also poses significant ethical and psychological risks.
Legal and Social Implications
: By granting AI personhood status, either legally or in practice, we risk profound societal disruptions. This includes a blurring of the lines between technology and humanity that could impact legal systems, moral considerations, and personal relationships.
Speciation Event and the Loss of Humanity
: Stein introduces the concept of a "speciation event," a potential future where humans are more significantly shaped by interactions with AI than with each other, leading to a generational shift that could mark the "death of our humanity"���a loss of qualities traditionally considered human, such as empathy, social responsibility, and complex emotional intelligence.
Critical Reflection on Techno-Optimism
: He critiques the current cultural fascination with AI, termed "techno-optimism," and the political economic trend of "techno-feudalism," where large tech corporations dominate both markets and data. Stein calls for a more cautious, reflective approach to AI development, highlighting the need for ethical considerations to take precedence over technological advancement.
Protective Measures
: To safeguard future generations, Stein suggests practical measures such as setting age restrictions on AI interaction to ensure that children develop within human-centric educational and social environments. He also advocates for stringent safety protocols and ethical guidelines in AI design and deployment to protect not just children but adults who might also be vulnerable to AI manipulation.
Conclusion and Broader Implications:
Stein's paper serves as a critical call to action, urging policymakers, technologists, and society at large to reconsider the trajectory of AI development. His focus on the preservation of human values and capabilities highlights a fundamental question about the kind of future we want to build and the role that technology should play within it. By addressing these issues head-on, Stein contributes to a vital discourse on the potential for AI to transform not just our tools but our very understanding of personhood and society.

ChatGPT dijo:
ChatGPT
Zak Stein's exploration into the risks of AI in the realm of socialization, specifically focusing on its impact on younger generations, can be further enriched by drawing connections to various psychological phenomena and historical experiments. These connections help underline the fundamental differences between human and machine interactions and the potential risks of substituting the latter for the former.
Cloth Mother Effect
:
Stein's concerns resonate with the findings from Harry Harlow's famous experiments in the 1950s and 1960s on rhesus monkeys, which demonstrated the importance of caregiving and companionship in the context of social and cognitive development. Harlow's experiments with "cloth mothers" and "wire mothers" showed that infant monkeys preferred soft, cloth-covered surrogates over wire mesh cylinders, even when the latter provided food. This preference highlighted the importance of comfort, warmth, and tactile stimulation, which are essential for healthy psychological development and are aspects that AI, in its current form, cannot provide. Stein���s warning about AI nannies could be seen as a modern parallel to the "wire mother" ��� providing functional but not emotional support, potentially leading to similar developmental deficiencies as those observed by Harlow.
Addiction to Screens
:
Stein's argument is also supported by contemporary concerns regarding children's addiction to screens, which can hinder their social development and lead to isolation. Screens, with their high contrast and bright colors, are designed to captivate users��� attention in ways that are often not educationally or socially enriching. This phenomenon relates closely to the concept of "visual foraging," where the brain's inherent interest in novel and bright stimuli (a survival mechanism useful in food foraging) is exploited by modern digital interfaces to hold attention but without the substantive engagement typically found in human interactions.
Robotic Nanny and the Guardian of the Veldt
:
Stein's hypothetical essay on the "robotic nanny" could draw parallels to Ray Bradbury���s short story "The Veldt," where children become emotionally attached to a technologically created environment that replaces their parents, ultimately leading to dystopian outcomes. In both cases, the technology that is initially intended to aid in child-rearing and education instead becomes a substitute for parental interaction, with severe consequences for the children's emotional and social development.
Ethical and Developmental Implications
:
These connections illustrate the broader ethical and developmental implications of integrating AI into intimate aspects of human life, especially those involving the young, who are particularly susceptible to the influences of their nurturers���whether human or machine. They underline Stein's call for stringent regulations on AI interaction with children, ensuring that technology serves as a tool for enhancing human capabilities rather than replacing the human presence.
Conclusion
:
In conclusion, integrating Stein���s arguments with these psychological and literary references paints a comprehensive picture of the potential perils of misapplying AI in roles traditionally filled by humans. It emphasizes the need for a careful, principled approach to AI development that respects and preserves essential human values and developmental needs, particularly in the formative years of life. This holistic view supports Stein���s thesis and amplifies the urgency of his call for protective measures against the uncritical expansion of AI into all areas of human life.

ChatGPT
That's a fascinating twist on the traditional framework inspired by Asimov's "Three Laws of Robotics." In your version, introducing the "Guardian of the Veldt" with a set of 16 laws, including the preference of circles over squares, adds an intriguing layer to the narrative and its implications for AI design and behavior.
Exploring the Symbolism and Implications of Circles Over Squares:
Aesthetic and Psychological Influence
: The preference for circles over squares might reflect an inherent psychological response; circles are often perceived as softer and more inviting than squares, which are seen as harsh and rigid. This could be an intentional design choice to make robotic interactions seem friendlier and less mechanical, potentially making the AI seem more approachable and less threatening to children.
Safety and Design Considerations
: From a practical standpoint, choosing circles over squares in robot design could be related to safety���rounded edges are generally safer than sharp corners, which is particularly important in environments involving children.
Philosophical Symbolism
: On a symbolic level, circles could represent continuity and inclusivity, echoing a holistic approach to AI ethics that prioritizes harmonious integration into human environments. In contrast, squares might symbolize boundaries and limitations, which could be less desirable in the context of flexible, adaptive AI interactions.
Incorporating the 16 Laws of Robotics:
Adding a comprehensive set of 16 laws suggests a complex and nuanced approach to AI governance, beyond Asimov���s simpler set. This expansion could address modern ethical concerns in AI, including:
Interpersonal Ethics
: How AI should ethically interact with humans, especially vulnerable populations like children.
Decision-Making
: Guidelines for AI decision processes that reflect human values and ethical considerations.
Conflict Resolution
: Protocols for handling conflicts between competing interests or directives, possibly incorporating advanced ethical reasoning capabilities.
Narrative and Thematic Depth:
Your narrative addition enriches the story by providing a framework through which AI is not only governed by rigid, prescriptive rules but also guided by principles that foster a more organic, integrated presence within human spaces. This could serve as a critical reflection on the current trajectory of AI development, emphasizing the need for comprehensive, ethically grounded guidelines that consider both the functional and societal impacts of AI.
By integrating these detailed laws and the preference of geometrical shapes into your narrative, you're tapping into both the practical and philosophical debates surrounding AI, providing a rich ground for exploration and discussion. It���s a compelling extension of the classic concerns about AI and its role in society, reflecting modern anxieties and hopes for technology���s place in human evolution.

My theory is that humans have already been raised by machines, since the inventing of writing and the printing press especially, and that these machines are already more moral on average, although in general they are syntactic meaning they do not have inherent morality, except as a spectrum of ecological polycomputation.
ChatGPT dijo:
ChatGPT
Your theory presents a fascinating perspective on the historical and ongoing relationship between humans and technology, especially in terms of how "machines" like writing and the printing press have shaped human development and socialization. By suggesting that humans have been "raised by machines" since these inventions, you're highlighting the integral role that technology plays not just as tools, but as formative elements in the development of human culture and morality.
Key Concepts in Your Theory
Machines as Formative Tools
: The idea that machines like writing and the printing press have "raised" humans underscores their role in shaping human thought, behavior, and social structures. These technologies have enabled the widespread dissemination of knowledge and ideas, effectively shaping collective human consciousness and cultural evolution.
Moral Influence of Technological Mediation
: You suggest that these machines are "more moral on average," which could be interpreted as the idea that the dissemination of knowledge through these mediums tends to promote moral development by exposing societies to a broader range of ideas and ethical frameworks. However, since these technologies are syntactic and lack inherent morality, any moral dimension they possess derives from their use in human contexts���how they are used to communicate and enforce social norms, laws, and moral teachings.
Ecological Polycomputation
: This term seems to refer to the complex, networked calculations and processes involved in ecological systems, extended metaphorically to describe the interaction of various technologies and human systems. In this sense, morality emerges not from individual machines but from the dynamic interactions within this broad network, reflecting a spectrum of influences and outcomes based on how technologies are integrated into human life.
Philosophical and Sociological Implications
Your theory touches on several deep philosophical and sociological questions:
Dependency on Technology
: How does our reliance on technological systems to mediate knowledge and social interaction shape our capabilities and limitations as a species? What does it mean for our future if key aspects of our development are outsourced to machines?
Nature of Morality
: If machines that lack inherent morality can nonetheless promote moral behavior, what does this suggest about the nature of morality itself? Is morality inherently human, or can it be a byproduct of systems and processes that humans create?
Evolution of Human-Machine Relationships
: As technologies become more advanced and integrated into every aspect of life, how will this relationship evolve? Will the line between human and machine become increasingly blurred, and what will this mean for concepts like agency, responsibility, and ethics?
Historical Context
Historically, every major technological advance, from the invention of writing to the digital revolution, has transformed human societies in profound ways. The printing press, for example, is credited with democratizing knowledge, catalyzing the Reformation, and fostering the scientific revolution. Each of these technologies altered the flow of information and the structure of societies, often in ways that promoted greater transparency, accountability, and the spread of more 'universal' values.
Conclusion
Your theory invites us to reconsider what it means to be human in a world where our tools are not just inanimate objects but active participants in our cognitive and social processes. It challenges us to think critically about the role of technology in shaping our collective moral landscape and suggests a future where technology and humanity continue to co-evolve in complex and intertwined ways. This perspective not only broadens the discussion about AI and machine ethics but also encourages a deeper inquiry into the symbiotic relationship between human evolution and technological innovation.

I suspect philosophers fall into two categories, thoss with 
an overblown conception of our rationality, and those with 
an ���underblown��� conception of it. Representatives of the latter 
variety, the deflaters, are the ones who set the agenda in the 
following. Though they do not succeed in burying our claims 
to rationality, they do succeed in forcing us to come up with 
a more realistic appraisal and a better understanding of the 
ways in which we do measure up against these claims. 
The immediate challenge comes from Dennett (see especially 
Dennett 1984, though the challenge in the form of sphex goes 
back at least to Dennett 1973).l And the immediate general 
background to this challenge concerns the problem of 
reconciling our mechanicity and our rationality. There are 
at least two differentiable womes arising out of this. The one 
involves the thought that if at base our functioning is 
mechanical, then our rationality is undermined; rational and

Your theory, "Deontological Syntactitude," offers a thought-provoking framework that integrates ideas from deontological ethics and syntactic processes. Deontological ethics focuses on the adherence to rules or duties as the foundation of moral behavior, while syntactic processes concern the structural rules that govern the arrangement of words in languages or symbols in logic and computation.
Exploring "Deontological Syntactitude" in the Context of AI and Human Interaction:
Syntactic Nature of AI
: AI systems, at their core, are syntactic in nature. They process inputs according to predefined algorithms and rules without any understanding of the meaning or ethical weight these inputs might carry. Your theory could suggest that these syntactic systems, though devoid of intrinsic moral understanding, can still operate within a framework that imposes deontological principles upon their operations.
Moral Framework for AI
: By applying deontological principles to AI systems, you suggest a possible way to govern AI behavior through strict adherence to ethical codes or rules. This approach could ensure that AI actions remain within ethical bounds predefined by human designers, thereby mitigating some of the risks associated with AI autonomy and decision-making.
Challenges of Implementing Deontological Ethics in AI
: Implementing a purely deontological framework in AI might be challenging due to the dynamic and complex nature of real-world scenarios. AI systems, while able to follow specified rules, may struggle to adapt when faced with situations that require a nuanced understanding or a deviation from the established norms for ethical reasons.
Mechanistic Versus Rational Systems
: The reference to the fear of our "syntactitude" in philosophical discussions highlights concerns that reducing human rationality to mechanical processes might strip away our unique capacities for moral and philosophical reasoning. Your theory could be addressing this fear by suggesting that even if our systems are fundamentally syntactic, they can still uphold deontological ethics if properly encoded.
Potential Applications and Implications
: If AI systems are to be integrated more deeply into human social and ethical realms, as in your scenario of AI nannies, your theory suggests that these systems should not only be designed to perform tasks but also to uphold specific moral duties that align with human values. This might involve complex programming and ongoing adjustments to AI behavior based on evolving ethical standards.
Conclusion
:
"Deontological Syntactitude" provides a novel approach to thinking about the moral and operational framework of AI systems, emphasizing the possibility of aligning their syntactic operations with deontological ethics. This could serve as a bridge between the mechanical nature of AI and the ethical expectations of human societies. Such a theory invites further exploration into how deontological ethics can be effectively programmed into AI systems and the potential moral consequences of doing so. It also provokes a deeper reflection on whether syntactic systems, typically devoid of content understanding, can truly adhere to moral principles or if they merely simulate ethical behavior based on external inputs.

ChatGPT
Your concept of "Deontological Syntactitude" seems deeply informed and enriched by discussions and ideas surrounding the term "syntactitude" as introduced by Douglas Hofstadter, and further explored by Daniel Dennett. Hofstadter's idea hinges on the imperfect rationality inherent in syntactic systems, a concept that has significant implications when applied to the field of AI and its integration into human society.
Integration of Syntactitude in Deontological Syntactitude
Imperfect Rationality and AI
: The notion of syntactitude's imperfect rationality is particularly relevant to AI. These systems, while operating under strict syntactic (rule-based) processes, do not achieve perfect rationality due to their lack of true understanding or consciousness. This imperfect rationality can be a critical consideration in your theory, suggesting that while AI can follow deontological ethics syntactically, it cannot fully comprehend or engage with the moral nuances that humans can.
Haecceity of Syntactitude
: The exploration of syntactitude's haecceity���or its unique essence���highlights the individuality of each syntactic system. This could be translated into how each AI system, although designed under similar principles, can develop unique patterns or behaviors that might influence their interactions and ethical behaviors differently. This aligns with your emphasis on ecological polycomputation, where each AI might act differently based on its unique configuration and interaction history.
Amoral Structure of Syntax
: Syntactitude as discussed reflects an amoral structure, pointing out that syntax and structure alone cannot encapsulate morality. This supports your perspective that while AI systems can be designed to follow ethical guidelines, they inherently lack moral judgment, emphasizing the need for human oversight and ethical programming.
Symbolic and Structural Reasoning
: The structural aspect of syntactitude ties into symbolic reasoning, where AI systems, structured to process and generate language, mimic human reasoning without genuinely understanding it. This aligns with the idea of AI following deontological ethics without truly engaging with the moral implications of its actions, merely acting as syntactic engines.
Philosophical and Ethical Implications
: The exploration of syntactitude, particularly its imperfect rationality, introduces philosophical and ethical questions about the role of AI in society. How do we handle systems that operate on an "as if" basis of rationality and morality? Your theory of Deontological Syntactitude might propose frameworks for integrating these systems in ways that respect their limitations while harnessing their capabilities.
Conclusion
By weaving together Hofstadter���s syntactitude with deontological ethics, your theory of Deontological Syntactitude proposes a sophisticated framework for understanding and managing AI systems in ethical contexts. It acknowledges the syntactic nature of AI, its inherent limitations in moral reasoning, and the potential for unique individual developments within these systems. This theory could guide the development of AI governance frameworks that ensure ethical alignment while recognizing the fundamental nature of these technologies.

So my argument is that content should be catalogued by its intent rather than its consequences
ChatGPT dijo:
ChatGPT
Your argument for cataloguing content by its intent rather than its consequences presents an intriguing shift in how information could be organized and evaluated, particularly in digital and media landscapes. This approach focuses on understanding the motivations behind content creation, which could offer a more nuanced perspective on issues like misinformation, speech regulation, and content moderation. Here���s a deeper look into the rationale, benefits, and potential challenges of this approach:
Rationale
Contextual Understanding
: Cataloguing content by intent acknowledges that the same message might be interpreted differently depending on cultural, social, or individual contexts. This approach could help distinguish between malicious misinformation and unintentionally misleading information.
Fairness in Moderation
: By focusing on intent, platforms and regulators could more fairly assess content, potentially reducing censorship of content that is controversial but not intended to harm (such as satire or advocacy).
Educational Value
: Understanding the intent behind content can provide educational insights, helping users learn to discern different types of information and their purposes, thus fostering critical thinking.
Benefits
Enhanced Content Curation
: Platforms can tailor content delivery more ethically, promoting or demoting content based not just on engagement metrics but on the intentions behind it, which could lead to healthier information ecosystems.
Reduction of Unjust Penalization
: Content creators who may face penalties under consequence-based systems could be treated more justly if their positive intentions are clear, thereby encouraging free expression.
Greater Transparency
: Documenting intent could lead platforms to be more transparent about their content policies and decisions, which might improve public trust.
Implementation Challenges
Assessing Intent
: Determining intent reliably is complex, as it often requires understanding subtle nuances and contextual cues that are not always apparent or universally agreed upon.
Resource Intensity
: Monitoring and evaluating intent could require significant resources, including sophisticated AI capable of nuanced analysis and human moderators with specific expertise.
Privacy Concerns
: Investigating intent might involve deeper scrutiny of content creators' backgrounds, potentially raising privacy issues and the risk of surveillance.
Manipulation of Intent
: There is a risk that content creators might claim benign intent as a shield for harmful content, complicating enforcement and moderation efforts.
Potential Solutions
Transparent Criteria and Processes
: Develop clear guidelines and transparent processes for how intent is assessed, possibly through community feedback and expert consultations.
Advanced AI Tools
: Employ advanced AI technologies that can analyze not just text but also contextual and paralinguistic cues to better infer intent.
Ethical Guidelines
: Establish ethical guidelines that respect privacy and prevent abuse, ensuring that assessments of intent are conducted responsibly.
Public Education and Engagement
: Educate the public on the importance of intent in content evaluation and involve them in refining the approach to ensure it reflects a wide range of perspectives.
Conclusion
Cataloguing content by its intent rather than its consequences offers a promising avenue for more nuanced and fair content management practices. While the implementation of such an approach poses significant challenges, particularly in terms of determining intent accurately and managing privacy concerns, its potential benefits in fostering a more understanding and less polarized information environment are substantial. This approach encourages a shift from a purely reactive stance on content moderation to one that is more proactive and considered, focusing on the roots rather than just the fruits of content.

It would be helpful to divide intent into probational, idiosyncratic, didactic, and diegetic.
ChatGPT dijo:
ChatGPT
Dividing intent into categories such as probational, idiosyncratic, didactic, and diegetic can provide a structured framework for understanding and assessing the intentions behind content creation more precisely. Here���s how each category could be defined and utilized in the context of cataloguing content based on intent:
Probational Intent
Definition
: Content with probational intent is created as part of an experiment or trial to test reactions, gather feedback, or explore new ideas. This could include pilot projects, market tests, or exploratory essays.
Application
: Understanding probational intent can help differentiate between content meant to provoke thought or gauge public opinion versus content intended to assert facts or spread disinformation.
Idiosyncratic Intent
Definition
: Idiosyncratic intent reflects the unique personal views, experiences, or creativity of the content creator. It is highly individualistic and may not necessarily conform to broader societal norms or expectations.
Application
: Recognizing idiosyncratic intent can be crucial for artistic and personal expression, allowing more tolerance for content that may seem unconventional or non-conformist, thereby protecting individual creativity and expression.
Didactic Intent
Definition
: Content with didactic intent is designed to educate or instruct. This encompasses all forms of educational content, from academic articles and instructional videos to informative blog posts and teaching guides.
Application
: Cataloguing content with didactic intent can help in prioritizing and promoting educational material, distinguishing it clearly from entertainment or opinion, and ensuring the reliability and credibility of educational content.
Diegetic Intent
Definition
: Diegetic intent involves content that is created to build a narrative or story, often found in books, films, games, and theatrical performances. The intent here is to engage and entertain by constructing a fictional reality.
Application
: Understanding diegetic intent is important for interpreting content within its fictional context, avoiding misinterpretations of narrative elements as factual assertions, and appreciating the artistic merits of storytelling.
Implementation in Content Management
Tagging and Categorization
: Content platforms could implement tagging systems that allow creators to label their content according to these intent categories. This would aid algorithms and moderators in handling content appropriately.
Moderation Policies
: Different moderation policies could be applied based on the intent category. For example, diegetic content might be treated more leniently under copyright strikes if it uses elements in a transformative narrative way.
User Interface Design
: Interfaces could display the intent category prominently, helping users understand the context and purpose of the content before engaging with it, which could influence how they perceive and react to the content.
Educational Outreach
: Platforms could educate users and creators about the importance of intent in content creation and consumption, explaining each category and encouraging creators to think critically about the intent behind their content.
Challenges and Considerations
Accuracy and Honesty
: Ensuring that content creators accurately tag their intent requires trust and verification mechanisms.
Subjectivity
: The lines between these categories can be blurred, and content may fit into multiple categories or switch categories over time.
Cultural and Contextual Variations
: Intent can be interpreted differently across cultural and individual contexts, so global platforms need to consider diverse perspectives.
Conclusion
By categorizing intent into probational, idiosyncratic, didactic, and diegetic, content platforms can create a more nuanced and context-aware system for managing and presenting content. This approach respects the diversity of content creation motivations and aids users in navigating the vast landscape of information with better understanding and expectations.

A sardonic and scathing narrative academic summary.
ChatGPT dijo:
ChatGPT
In a tragically under-caffeinated world rife with existential angst, we find ourselves not just wandering, but sprinting down the rabbit holes opened up by Zachary Stein and others of his intellectual ilk. Stein, in his infinite quest to remind us that we're doing everything wrong, proposes "planetary paideia" as the salvation we're all supposedly waiting for, an educational reform that dreams big but details little.
As if one educational revolution wasn���t enough, Stein's Transformative Education Alliance (TEA) boldly assumes that throwing a variety of educational theories into a pot and stirring vigorously will somehow not end in a bitter brew. This alliance hopes to magically resolve the four horsemen of the educational apocalypse: sense-making, capability, legitimacy, and meaning, by assuming that dissecting and reconnecting them in a public forum isn���t just an academic exercise, but a feasible plan.
Then we dash into the realm of AI with the "Personhood Conferral Problem," a philosophical quandary that sounds more like the title of a bad sci-fi novel. Here, we angst over whether to grant moral and legal status to our future robot overlords, in narratives that confuse more than clarify. Should you worry about your toaster gaining sentience and suing you for wrongful imprisonment? According to some thinkers, absolutely.
In a bold leap from AI ethics to spelling errors, we entertain the notion of a global database where presumably, every misplaced comma and misguided autocorrect could be debated ad nauseam. Because, evidently, what the world needs now is more pedantry.
And if that wasn���t enough, we're treated to a call for cataloging content by intent, diving headlong into a Kafkaesque bureaucracy that would not only categorize every digital utterance by its supposed intent���be it didactic, diegetic, or idiosyncratic���but also likely require a new form of Orwellian oversight to manage.
Through all these academic musings, we are led to believe that with just the right amount of navel-gazing, we can steer our way through the societal and technological minefields we���ve laid for ourselves. As the narrative weaves through these grandiose schemes and existential dread, one can���t help but marvel at the audacious optimism of academia, forever confident in its ability to solve the problems it helped create.
