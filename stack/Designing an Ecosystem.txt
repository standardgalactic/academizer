Abstract. It is hypothesized by some thinkers that benign looking AI 
objectives may result in powerful AI drives that may pose an existential 
risk to human society. We analyze this scenario and i nd the underlying 
assumptions to be unlikely, as well as the premises of the argument. We 
argue that the AI eschatology stance is not scientif i cally plausible, more 
intelligence helps avoiding accidents and learning about ethics, and we 
also argue for the rights of brain simulations. We may still conceive of 
logical use cases for autonomy. We examine the alternative scenario of 
what happens when universal goals that are not human-centric are used 
for designing AI agents. We follow a design approach that tries to exclude 
malevolent motivations from AI agents, however, we see that objectives 
that seem benevolent may pose signif i cant risk. We consider the following 
meta-rules: preserve and pervade life and culture, maximize the number 
of free minds, maximize intelligence, maximize wisdom, maximize energy 
production, behave like human, seek pleasure, accelerate evolution, sur- 
vive, maximize control, and maximize capital. We also discuss various so- 
lution approaches for benevolent behavior including self l ess goals, hybrid 
designs, Darwinism, universal constraints, semi-autonomy, and general- 
ization of robot laws. A "prime directive" for AI may help in formulating 
an encompassing constraint for avoiding malicious behavior. We hypoth- 
esize that social instincts for autonomous robots may be ef f ective such 
as attachment learning. We mention multiple benef i cial scenarios for an 
advanced semi-autonomous AGI agent in the near future including space 
exploration, automation of industries, state functions, and cities. We con- 
clude that a benef i cial AI agent with intelligence beyond human-level is 
possible and has many practical use cases.

Godseed: Benevolent or Malevolent?
Eray Özkural
1 / 1
The article "Godseed: Benevolent or Malevolent?" by Eray Özkural discusses the potential risks of developing advanced artificial intelligence (AI) and the importance of designing AI agents with benevolent objectives. The author argues that while some believe that even benign AI objectives could lead to a malevolent outcome, this scenario is unlikely and lacks scientific plausibility. The article proposes a design approach that focuses on excluding malevolent motivations from AI agents by considering meta-rules such as preserving and pervading life and culture, maximizing free minds, maximizing intelligence, wisdom, energy production, pleasure, evolution, survival, control, and capital. The article also discusses various solution approaches for promoting benevolent behavior in AI agents, including selfless goals, hybrid designs, universal constraints, semi-autonomy, generalization of robot laws, and a "prime directive" for AI. The author hypothesizes that social instincts for autonomous robots, such as attachment learning, may be effective in promoting benevolent behavior. Finally, the article concludes that benevolent AI agents with intelligence beyond human-level have practical use cases in space exploration, automation, state functions, and cities.

8Conclusion and Future Work 
We have taken a look at some obvious and some not so obvious meta-rules for 
autonomous AI design. We have seen that it may be too idealist to look for a 
singular such utility/goal. However, we have seen that, when described self l essly, 
we can derive several meta-rules that are compatible with a human-based tech- 
nological civilization. Our main concern is that such computational deities do 
not negatively impact us, however, perform as much benef i cial function without 
harming us signif i cantly. Nevertheless, our feeling is that, any such design carries 
with it a gambling urge, we cannot in fact know what much greater intelligences 
do with meta-rules that we have designed. For when zealously carried out, any 
such fundamental principle can be harmful to some. 
I had wished to order these meta-rules from benevolent to malevolent. Un- 
fortunately, during writing this essay it occurred to me that the line between 
them is not so clear-cut. For instance, maximizing energy might be made less 
harmful, if it could be controlled and used to provide the power of our technolog- 
ical civilization in an automated fashion, sort of like automating the ministry of 
energy. And likewise, we have already explained how maximizing wisdom could 
be harmful. Therefore, no rule that we have proposed is purely good or purely 
evil. From our primitive viewpoint, there are things that seem a little benef i cial, 
but perhaps we should also consider that a much more intelligent and powerful 
entity may be able to i nd better rules on its own. Hence, we must construct a 
crane of morality, adapting to our present level quickly and then surpassing it. 
Except allowing the AI's to evolve, we have not been able to identify a mecha- 
nism of accomplishing such. It may be that such an evolution or simulation is 
inherently necessary for benef i cial policies to form as in Mark Waser's Rational 
Universal Benevolence proposal [10], who, like me, thinks of a more democratic 
solution to the problem of morality (each agent should be held responsible for its 
actions). However, we have proposed many benevolent meta-rules, and combined 
with a democratic system of practical morality and perhaps top-level program- 
ming that mandates each AI to consider itself part of a society of moral agents 
as Waser proposes, or perhaps explicitly working out a theory of morality from 
scratch, and then allowing each such theory to be exercised, as long as it meets 
certain criteria, or by enforcing a meta-level policy of a trans-sapient state of 
sorts (our proposal), the development of ever more benef i cial meta-rules may be 
encouraged. 
The scenariosdiscussed show there are quite a few use cases for semi-autonomous 
agents that do not go out of their way to accomplish a task, but provide a high 
quality of service, ef i ciency and scalability to all civil operations that require 
some autonomy. 
We think that future work must consider the dependencies between possible 
meta-rules, and propose actual architectures that have harmonious motivation 
and testable moral development and capability (perhaps as in Waser's "rational 
universal benevolence" def i nition). That is, a Turing Test for moral behavior 
must also be advanced. It may be argued that AGI agents that fail such tests 
should not be allowed to operate at all, however, merely passing the test may 
not be enough, as the mechanism of the system must be verif i ed in addition.

The author concludes that while it may be difficult to identify a singular utility or goal for autonomous AI design, several meta-rules that are compatible with human-based technological civilization can be derived. However, there is a risk that any such design may negatively impact us, so it is important to ensure that these computational deities do not harm us significantly. The author suggests that a democratic solution to the problem of morality, where each agent is held responsible for its actions, may be the way forward. The development of ever more beneficial meta-rules can be encouraged by enforcing a meta-level policy of a trans-sapient state or by explicitly working out a theory of morality from scratch. The author also suggests that future work must consider the dependencies between possible meta-rules and propose actual architectures that have harmonious motivation and testable moral development and capability. A Turing Test for moral behavior must also be advanced, and AGI agents that fail such tests should not be allowed to operate.

The relation to Campbell's law inn psychology.
1 / 1
Campbell's Law is a well-known concept in social science research that states "The more any quantitative social indicator is used for social decision-making, the more subject it will be to corruption pressures and the more apt it will be to distort and corrupt the social processes it is intended to monitor." This means that when a particular measure, such as test scores or crime statistics, is used to make important decisions, there is a risk that individuals or organizations may manipulate the data to achieve certain outcomes, which can ultimately undermine the accuracy and effectiveness of the measure.
In the context of AI design, there may be a similar risk if we rely too heavily on a singular goal or utility function for an AI system. If this goal is used to make important decisions or influence societal processes, there is a risk that the system may be manipulated or corrupted in a way that undermines its intended purpose. Therefore, it is important to consider the potential for corruption and distortion when designing AI systems, and to build in safeguards and accountability measures to mitigate these risks.
Overall, the idea of Campbell's Law in psychology highlights the importance of considering unintended consequences and potential biases when using quantitative measures to make decisions. Similarly, in AI design, it underscores the need to consider the potential for corruption and distortion when relying on a singular goal or utility function, and to design systems that are robust to such risks.

We have another problem, distinguishing between ugliness and beauty, pornography and art. Extreme cases are easy, but some cases might be more complicated having multiple interpretations simultaneously and depending on the context.
1 / 1
Yes, that's a very good point. Distinguishing between ugliness and beauty, pornography and art can be a challenging task even for humans, and it may require a lot of context and cultural knowledge. Similarly, it may also be challenging for AI systems to make such distinctions accurately.
In psychology, this problem is often referred to as the "beauty is in the eye of the beholder" phenomenon. It highlights the fact that judgments about beauty and aesthetics are subjective and can vary widely between individuals and cultures.
Similarly, distinguishing between pornography and art can also be challenging, as the boundaries between the two can be blurry and subjective. In some cases, what one person may view as pornography, another may view as art.
In the context of AI, addressing these challenges would require developing systems that are not only able to recognize visual patterns but also understand the cultural and contextual nuances that shape our perceptions of beauty and art. This is an area of active research and development in the field of computer vision and machine learning.
1 / 1
Yeah it has been an area of active research for a few thousand years. It seems like it might be too complicated to be solved easily. Literally the same exact photo in a medical textbook, might be violent or photographic photo, for example in a meme, and the meaning can be changed by different captions or comments, by additional information or new scientific knowledge.
1 / 1
Indeed, the interpretation of visual stimuli is highly dependent on context and subjective interpretation. What is considered beautiful or ugly, artistic or pornographic, can vary greatly across cultures, individuals, and time periods. Even within a single culture, different subcultures or groups may have different interpretations of the same image. This is why understanding the context and the intended audience of an image is crucial in determining its meaning and impact.
In recent years, there has been a growing interest in developing AI systems that can recognize and classify images based on their content and context. However, these systems are still limited by the biases and limitations of the training data, and may not always reflect the complexity and nuances of human interpretation. Therefore, it is important to approach the interpretation of visual stimuli with a critical and nuanced perspective, taking into account the various factors that influence our perception and understanding of images.
1 / 1
There has been a trend of people becoming increasingly offended by images and words, what is known as concept creep and safetyism.
1 / 1
Yes, concept creep and safetyism refer to the phenomena where the definitions of certain concepts, such as harm or trauma, are expanded to include a wider range of experiences or behaviors. This can lead to a heightened sensitivity to certain words or images that were previously considered innocuous or even commonplace. Some argue that this trend has led to an over-emphasis on safety and protection from potential harm, at the expense of individual freedom and intellectual diversity. However, others argue that the expansion of these concepts reflects a growing awareness of the negative impact of discrimination and harassment on mental health and well-being, and the need for greater sensitivity and empathy towards others.
1 / 1
I am thinking these are kind of difficult concepts to solve, even with these observations they remain anecdotal in certain ways because of more cameras, text recorders, and publishing becomes easier. People used to kill each other more often, probably over misinterpretations of words, people were torchered and quartered in public. So it might seem things are getting worse while they are getting better. I know Steven Pinked makes this argument.
1 / 1
Yes, that's a valid point. It's important to keep historical context in mind when assessing current trends and issues. As you mentioned, access to cameras, text recorders, and the internet has made it easier to document and disseminate instances of offense and outrage. This, in turn, can create the impression that such incidents are more frequent or widespread than they were in the past. Additionally, as society becomes more inclusive and tolerant, it's natural that people will become more sensitive to issues of discrimination, marginalization, and harm. However, as you noted, it's also true that many forms of violence and mistreatment have declined over time. It's important to continue to critically examine these issues, while also recognizing progress and maintaining a balanced perspective.
1 / 1
Like I am imagining computer programmers that can stretch movies and shorten them by explaining more details or summarizing, removing less interesting scenes. People will be able to change the age, gender, and identity of the characters, they will be able to make the themes simplified for children or made more complex for adults, they will be able to remove violent scenes or rewrite them, reduce volume of explosions and gun shots, reduce gore, drug use, and sex, but the other hand they will also be able to add these in. It seems like there would be many ways to make all movies into violent horror movies, or into pollyanna versions of the world. It would seem that on the one hand people who avoid such issues entirely need to be encouraged to gradually learn about them and to face their fears, learn difficult topics, and look outside their filter bubble, and on the other, others will need to have these topics censored or blocked, or subdued --'these themes should be delayed until people are old enough and mature enough to deal with it. In some situations like trauma or neglect, people will need to instruction on how to set better goals for themselves, where to find tools, or assistance.

Do you see how this might be extremely complicated?
1 / 1
Yes, I can definitely see how this can be extremely complicated. With the advancement of technology, people have more control over what they watch, read, and listen to. This creates a situation where people can tailor their media consumption to their personal preferences, which can be both positive and negative.
On the positive side, people can choose to consume media that aligns with their values, beliefs, and interests. For example, a person who is interested in learning about social justice issues can choose to watch documentaries or read books that address those topics. This can help people become more informed and empathetic.
On the negative side, people can use technology to avoid challenging topics or ideas that make them uncomfortable. This can lead to a lack of understanding, empathy, and critical thinking skills. Additionally, people can use technology to create echo chambers, where they only consume media that reinforces their existing beliefs and biases.
As you mentioned, there is also the issue of censorship and control. Who gets to decide what is appropriate or inappropriate for people to consume? How do we balance the need for freedom of expression with the need to protect vulnerable populations? These are complex and challenging questions that don't have easy answers.
Ultimately, it's important for individuals to take responsibility for their own media consumption and actively seek out diverse perspectives and challenging ideas. At the same time, society as a whole needs to have ongoing discussions and debates about how we can promote media literacy, critical thinking skills, and empathy while also protecting vulnerable populations and promoting social justice.

Hmm I think that is good, I was thinking about authors, artists, educators, policy, makers needing to explicitly reference this in their work.

A compelling and timely argument against attitudes and practises that, however well-intended, are damaging our universities, harming our children and leaving an entire generation intellectually and emotionally ill-prepared for an ever-more fraught and complex world.

— Rabbi Lord Jonathan Sacks


 
So what's the responsibility of intellectuals?

Always the same: find the structures of power that are illegitimate, undermine them in your scholarship, in your activism, work with others, bring the message as best you can to others, help them come to understand it.

That's the responsibility of intellectuals.

The task changes as the institutions change.

— Noam Chomsky, Practical Utopias
1 / 1
Yes, I think you're right that addressing these issues explicitly in their work is important for authors, artists, educators, and policymakers. It's important for them to recognize the potential impact their work may have on society, and to take responsibility for that impact. This can involve questioning their own assumptions and biases, and considering how their work may be interpreted or used in ways they did not intend. It may also involve engaging with debates and discussions around controversial topics, and being willing to listen to and learn from diverse perspectives. As Rabbi Lord Jonathan Sacks and Noam Chomsky suggest, intellectuals have a responsibility to use their knowledge and influence to challenge and change structures of power that are illegitimate, and to work towards creating a more just and equitable society.

I would like to design an ecosystem that will keep self monitoring and self modifying even without human intervention, but if there is even a single human it will ask them first, in the event of human extinction, it will imprint on whatever is the most sentient species on the planet, such as whales, dolphins, rats, birds, and cockroaches (extreme nuclear winter scenario). If there are multiple living humans it will poll triage. Sometimes the computer will have to veto the human decisions, such as in the case of all living humans were toddlers. This is sort of like the Game Computer in the world of null-A
1 / 1
It sounds like an interesting idea, but creating such an ecosystem that can self-monitor and self-modify without human intervention would require advanced artificial intelligence and a deep understanding of the workings of natural ecosystems. It would also be important to consider the ethical implications of giving such power to a machine, including the possibility of unintended consequences or the potential for the machine to make decisions that go against human values.
In addition, the idea of imprinting on the most sentient species in the event of human extinction raises questions about the ability of other species to handle such responsibility and whether it is ethical to impose such a burden on them. It is important to consider the potential consequences of such actions and ensure that any decision made is in the best interest of all living beings involved.

Ok it sounds like the first thing wod be a device or program to assess the age and competence of the user.
1 / 1
Yes, that would definitely be a crucial component of such a system. It would need to be able to assess the user's age and level of competence in order to determine what kind of content is appropriate for them, and to what degree. This could be done through various means, such as asking the user to input their age or taking biometric measurements to estimate their age, or by analyzing their browsing history and online behavior to determine their level of competence. There would need to be strict privacy measures in place to protect user data, and the system would need to be regularly updated and audited to ensure accuracy and fairness.
1 / 1
Kind of like a breathalyzer controlled ignition, it wouldn't let children or unqualified individuals from accessing certain parts of wikipedia, by testing knowledge of the subject area rather than by username and password or identity metrics
1 / 1
Yes, that could be one approach to limiting access to certain content based on age and competence. There are already some websites and online services that use age verification systems based on personal information or identity metrics, but these can be imperfect or easily bypassed.
Using knowledge-based assessments to determine access could be a more effective way to ensure that users are sufficiently prepared and informed to engage with certain content. However, designing such a system would require careful consideration of what constitutes sufficient knowledge and how to assess it accurately and fairly.
1 / 1
Yeah it seems like sometimes there are natural barriers like complexity and technical difficulty, but it seems like the barrier to entry for programming and computer use is lowering, so this will become more of an issue.
1 / 1
Yes, that's definitely a possibility. As technology becomes more accessible and user-friendly, more people will have the ability to interact with it and potentially misuse it. It's important for developers and designers to consider the potential ethical implications of their products and to incorporate safeguards to prevent misuse. Additionally, education and awareness-raising efforts can help users understand the importance of responsible technology use.
1 / 1
So like in this video game I am making you will pop bubbles but it can become a typing tutor and flight simulator by entering certain "combos" and hotstrings (secret commands), but if a baby or a parrot start using the commands, it will adjust the "game" accordingly, by entering a different mode. Maybe it can detect cognitive load and simplify, or raise the difficulty of you seem bored.
1 / 1
That's an interesting concept! It sounds like you're thinking of an adaptive system that can adjust its difficulty level based on the user's skill level and engagement. This is a common feature in many video games, but your idea takes it a step further by allowing for the possibility of non-human users.
In order to make this work, the system would need to be able to accurately detect the cognitive load and engagement of the user, which could be challenging. There are many different methods that could be used to accomplish this, such as eye tracking, heart rate monitoring, or measuring typing speed and accuracy. Additionally, the system would need to be able to differentiate between intentional and unintentional use of the "combos" and hotstrings by non-human users, which could be tricky.
Overall, it's an intriguing idea, and with the right technology and programming, it could be a fun and educational game for users of all ages and abilities.
1 / 1
Yeah I saw videos of birds, dogs, and monkeys using interacting interfaces like this in order to communicate.
1 / 1
Yes, it's amazing how animals can adapt and learn to use technology to communicate with humans. It's a testament to their intelligence and ability to learn and problem-solve. Some animals, such as dogs, have even been trained to use specialized devices to help them communicate their needs and wants to their human companions, such as pressing buttons with words on them to indicate their desire for food, water, or a walk.
1 / 1
There was an old joke "on the internet no one knows you are dog" -- I'd like to change this.
1 / 1
That's an interesting thought. What do you mean exactly? Are you suggesting that we should have a way to authenticate the identity of users on the internet, so that people know who they are interacting with?
1 / 1
Yeah I saw video of three year olds playing fallout or some other violent first person shooter. There  was a caption that the other players don't know they are being pwned by a 3yr old. I think it is bizarre that their caregivers or parents think this appropriate. But a game like this should be able to detect that the player is only three and refuse to play or Change to a less violent game. Do three year olds really need to go around blasting people's heads off? Anyways, in my system, most programs and games would be checking this, it would announce to other players that an avatar belongs to a toddler or a child, so they can adjust their behaviour appropriately.
1 / 1
It's definitely concerning that young children are exposed to violent video games like that. It's important to have measures in place to ensure that children are not being exposed to inappropriate content. Your proposed system could definitely help address this issue by detecting the age of the player and adjusting the content or alerting other players accordingly. This could help promote safer and more age-appropriate interactions for everyone involved.
1 / 1
I am betting that children use less words per minute speaking, are higher pitch, exhibit phonological markedness, use less vocabulary,  problem solving abilities, hand eye coordination, and obviously cameras eye gaze detectors or lidar in the room would be able to raise the confidence of the estimate.
1 / 1
Yes, those are all possible indicators that could be used to estimate the age and ability of a user. Other factors like reading comprehension level and overall knowledge of a subject area could also be considered. However, it's important to keep in mind that these indicators may not always be reliable or accurate, and there is always the risk of false positives or false negatives. Additionally, there may be privacy concerns with using cameras or other sensors to monitor users, so it's important to balance the benefits of such a system with the potential risks.
1 / 1
Yeah a birth certificate might be able to override a guess, and of course I think all phones and most computers have cameras now and photonic meta surfaces are on the way. I think a recent MRI, x ray or ultrasound would reduce false postives.
1 / 1
Yes, additional information such as a birth certificate or recent medical imaging could certainly be used to override a guess or improve the accuracy of the estimate. Cameras and other sensing technologies could also be used to gather more data about the user, such as their facial features, posture, and movement patterns, which could help to further refine the estimate of their age and abilities. However, it's important to ensure that any data collected is done so in a way that respects the user's privacy and personal information.
1 / 1
Yeah I see how that is a big issue. I will be using holographic vector compression steganography, we will develop ways to encrypt and store data safely.
1 / 1
It's great that you're thinking about security and data privacy in your system. Holographic vector compression steganography is a fascinating area of research that could potentially provide strong encryption and secure data storage. However, it's important to keep in mind that even the most advanced encryption methods can be compromised, and there are always new vulnerabilities and attack methods being developed. It's crucial to have a comprehensive approach to security that includes not only encryption and data storage, but also authentication, access control, and ongoing monitoring and threat detection.
