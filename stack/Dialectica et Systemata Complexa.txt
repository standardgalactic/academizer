Rephrase and summarize in Latin: to where science explicitly deals with different contexts, processes, relationships 
and systems-in-transformation. A number of science textbooks are entirely devoted to 
understanding systems and related phenomena in a diversity of fields. However, on closer 
examination it is evident that the attempts made by mainstream science to deal with 
complex systems have largely been limited to developing analytical, rational models of 
them. These systems textbooks are filled with linear, reductionist, mechanical diagrams and 
models of systems. What passes for systems thinking in mainstream science is rarely 
dialectical thinking. Nearly always it is merely analytical, rational thinking about systems and 
processes. And analytical, rational models of systems-in-transformation are inadequate and 
unable to provide a comprehensive understanding of complex phenomena. Hence the 
8 
undeniable fact that mainstream science has failed to make significant contributions to our 
understanding of the complex phenomena dealt with by the humanities and social 
���sciences���. 
��� Some people who are introduced to dialectical thinking conclude that they already have this 
capacity to a high degree. When their attention is drawn to the moments of dialectic and the 
thought forms, they suggest that these are already reflected in their thinking. This position 
is particularly common amongst people who see some of the limitations of reductionist, 
linear, rational thinking, and who consider they have moved on from it. They consider they 
now take a more holistic perspective, and see that ���everything is connected to everything 
else���. However, it is one thing to see that everything is connected. It is another thing 
entirely to see the particular ways in which things are connected, their particular inter- 
relationships and the particular ways in which the systems they constitute are organized and 
transform through time. It is this detailed mental modelling of systems-in-transformation 
that is essential if the thinker is to be able to see how complex phenomena will unfold and 
how they can be managed and influenced to produce particular outcomes. Seeing that 
everything is connected but failing to see the detailed consequences of the particular forms 
of connectedness that exist in the world will just get humanity into a bigger mess. The 
ultimate test of whether a person is thinking dialectically is whether they can in fact build 
complex mental models that equip them to understand and manage complex phenomenon 
in the real world. In my experience, very few people have yet developed this capacity to a 
high degree. 
��� It requires an enormous effort to develop oneself vertically in any domain, even if the 
development is supported by social scaffolding and if life conditions demand and reward it. 
Like other aspects of vertical development, the acquisition of dialectical thinking requires 
new capacities and skills, not just new knowledge. It cannot be acquired merely by reading 
words in a book, just as a person cannot learn to ride a bicycle by reading a manual. The 
individual has to undergo experiences and processes that reorganize their mind. A large part 
of this involves working internally on their own mental processes and movements-in- 
thought. Readers may understand everything in the Primer and be able to pass a detailed 
exam on its contents. But they will not be able to think dialectically until they have 
developed the mental processes and models that were used to generate the 
Primer. Fortunately, the Primer is designed and structured to help the reader to do this. 
For these reasons we can expect the take-off of dialectical thinking to be slow. But it is likely that 
these sources of resistance will be swept aside eventually as the enormous benefits of dialectical 
thinking are demonstrated in practice. Otto Laske���s work in general, and his Primer more 
specifically, are major contributions to the great step forward in human evolution that will occur 
with the spread of dialectical thinking.
