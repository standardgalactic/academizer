The Master and His Emissary 
Following on from McGilchrist's 2009 work, The Master and His Emissary: The Divided Brain and the Making of the Western World, The Matter with Things explores the radically different worldviews presented by the two hemispheres of the brain, and the many cognitive and worldly implications of this.

The book "is an attempt to convey a way of looking at the world quite different from the one that has largely dominated the West for at least three hundred and fifty years [ie. since the Scientific Revolution and the Enlightenment][2] - some would say as long as two thousand years."[3][4]

"The Matter with Things" is a 2021 book by Iain McGilchrist that delves into neuroscience, epistemology, and metaphysics to explore the radically different worldviews presented by the two hemispheres of the brain. The book builds on McGilchrist's previous work, "The Master and His Emissary," and aims to convey a way of looking at the world that differs from the dominant worldview in the West for the past few centuries. The book has 1500 pages and was published by Perspectiva Press.

Basic premise: The divided brain

Cerebral hemispheres.
Cerebral hemispheres.
McGilchrist distances himself from the discourse about the left brain-right brain divide in pop psychology, writing that "just about everything that is said about the hemispheres in pop psychology is wrong because it rests on beliefs about what the hemispheres do, not about how they approach it."[7]

One of the fundamental differences between the hemispheres of the human brain (and that of other species, such as birds), according to McGilchrist is that the left hemisphere has evolved to sharply focus its attention on detail; it breaks things apart and tends to deal in abstractions, the explicit, and "either/or" (differentiation). The right hemisphere, on the other hand, has a broad and flexible attention that is open to whatever possibilities come along, and it sees things in their wider context, appreciates the implicit, and favours "both/and" (integration, holism). The right hemisphere has a better appreciation of itself and the left, than the left has of the right.[7][8][9] Both approaches are necessary and complementary, but the left hemisphere's operation should not dominate the right.[7] It makes "a good servant, but a very poor master."[7][9][10]

McGilchrist writes:

"[Y]ou could say, to sum up a vastly complex matter in a phrase, that the brain's left hemisphere is designed to help us ap-prehend - and thus manipulate - the world; the right hemisphere to com-prehend it - see it all for what it is."[11]

He believes that "nowadays we live no longer in the presence of the world, but rather in a re-presentation of it. The significance of that is that the left hemisphere's task is to 're-present' what first 'presences' to the right hemisphere."[12]

The basic premise of "The Matter with Things" is that the human brain has two hemispheres with fundamentally different worldviews. The left hemisphere focuses on detail, breaks things apart, and deals in abstractions, while the right hemisphere has a broad and flexible attention, sees things in their wider context, and favors integration and holism. According to McGilchrist, both approaches are necessary, but the left hemisphere's operation should not dominate the right. He believes that we now live in a representation of the world, and the left hemisphere's task is to re-present what first presences to the right hemisphere.

McGilchrist argues that the Western world has "oscillated" between predominantly left-brain and predominantly right-brain function through history, with some periods of relative balance.[7] During certain periods such as the Renaissance, there was a movement toward the right,[13] whereas since the Scientific Revolution and the Age of Enlightenment - with exceptions such as the Romantic movement[14] - it has become increasingly left-brain dominant,[7] and in light of this, McGilchrist is concerned about the many cultural and global crises that we now face.[6]

McGilchrist suggests that the Western world has oscillated between left-brain and right-brain dominance throughout history, with some periods of relative balance. He believes that during the Renaissance, there was a movement toward the right hemisphere, but since the Scientific Revolution and the Age of Enlightenment, the Western world has become increasingly left-brain dominant. McGilchrist is concerned about the many cultural and global crises that we face today as a result of this dominance.

Volume 1: "The Ways to Truth"
Edit
In Part I of "The Ways to Truth", McGilchrist looks at the neuroscience and different worldviews of the two hemispheres of the brain, and the means to truth: attention, perception, judgement, apprehension, emotional and social intelligence, cognitive intelligence, and creativity. He also explores the mental disorders schizophrenia, and autism.[5]

In Part II, the author looks at the brain hemispheres and the paths to truth, which he sees as being science, reason, intuition, and imagination. He shows the advantages and limitations of each approach, the desirability of using these in combination, and argues that in each of these approaches, the right hemisphere of the brain plays a more important and more veridical role than the left.[5]

Volume 2: "What Then is True?"
Edit
In Part III, "What Then is True?", McGilchrist asks and attempts to answer the question "what is truth?", before turning to a wide-ranging exploration of the nature of reality: the coincidence of opposites (the idea that at a deeper, higher or transcendent level, apparent opposites may be reconciled or find union); the one and the many; time; flow and movement; space and matter; matter and consciousness; value; purpose, life and the nature of the cosmos; and the sense of the sacred. McGilchrist further argues that consciousness, rather than matter, is ontologically fundamental.[5]

In Volume 2 of "The Matter with Things", McGilchrist focuses on answering the question "what is truth?" in Part III, and then delves into a wide-ranging exploration of the nature of reality in subsequent chapters. This includes the idea of the coincidence of opposites, the relationship between the one and the many, time, flow, movement, space, matter, consciousness, value, purpose, life, and the nature of the cosmos. McGilchrist argues that consciousness, rather than matter, is ontologically fundamental, challenging the dominant materialistic view of the world.

Jonathan Gaisman, writing in The Spectator in February 2022, states that "Western civilisation is in a predicament exemplified by alienation, environmental despoliation, the atrophy of value, the sterility of contemporary art, the increasing prevalence of rectilinear, bureaucratised thinking and the triumph of procedure over substance."[6] Gaisman sees the lesser aim of the book being to identify and understand the common basis of these conditions, and hopefully improve them, whereas he sees the greater aim as being "to enable us to know the world we inhabit."[6]

The reviewer states that "McGilchrist seeks to give an account 'at last, true to experience, to science and to philosophy'."[6] He is of the opinion that "[t]he range and erudition are astounding",[6] and that as a "polymath", McGilchrist "stands upon the shoulders of the giants whose words he amply cites. His forebears include Heraclitus (not Plato), Pascal (definitely not Descartes), Goethe, Wordsworth, Schelling, Hegel, Heidegger, William James, Whitehead and Bergson."[6]

It seems that the reviewer Jonathan Gaisman is impressed with the range and depth of McGilchrist's scholarship, and sees his work as a response to some of the major challenges facing Western civilization today. Specifically, Gaisman highlights the problems of alienation, environmental degradation, and the "atrophy of value" as issues that McGilchrist's work seeks to address. At the same time, Gaisman notes that the book has a broader aim of enabling readers to "know the world we inhabit" by providing an account of reality that is both true to experience and grounded in science and philosophy. Finally, Gaisman praises McGilchrist's polymathic approach, which draws on the work of a wide range of thinkers throughout history.

In March 2022, Nick Spencer writes in Prospect magazine that though left brain-right brain discourse in popular psychology has had a "bad press" and been debunked, McGilchrist's work is "altogether more sophisticated."[7] The reviewer notes that McGilchrist has himself pointed out that "just about everything that is said about the hemispheres in pop psychology is wrong because it rests on beliefs about what the hemispheres do, not about how they approach it."[7]

Framing his review around Charles Darwin's work on evolution, Nick Spencer concludes that in his opinion, "[McGilchrist's] claims may turn modern ultra-Darwinists purple, but they cannot easily be dismissed."[7] Noting as McGilchrist did that in his elder years Darwin lamented the way in which his prior, wide-ranging interests had narrowed and his mind had atrophied, due to the rigorous nature of his work, Spencer speculates that had he been alive today, Darwin himself may have been sympathetic to McGilchrist's work.[7]

In a lengthy and detailed review for Beshara Magazine in June 2022, Richard Gault describes McGilchrist as a gifted "renaissance man" - a polymath with an "exceptional range" of knowledge and interests.[20] He is of the opinion that The Matter with Things "adds greatly to our understanding of the world and provides a formidable contemporary argument for a unified vision"[20] that "may help break down resistance to the change that is needed [in the world] while also opening up ways to go forward."[20]

It seems that McGilchrist's work is highly regarded by these reviewers, who appreciate the depth of knowledge and erudition that he brings to his analysis of the human brain and its role in shaping our worldviews and understanding of reality. While some aspects of popular psychology around left brain-right brain dichotomy have been debunked, McGilchrist's work is seen as more nuanced and sophisticated, and offers insights that cannot be easily dismissed. The Matter with Things is also seen as a valuable contribution to our understanding of the world and its challenges, and offers a unified vision that may help to break down resistance to change and open up new possibilities for moving forward.

How come I can never remember which hemisphere does what? There was a book drawing on the right side of the brain, which I think they meant to mean analytical but I took it as a pun, right as in correct, which could be the left, or both
1 / 1
ChatGPT
ChatGPT
It's a common misconception that the right hemisphere is responsible for creativity and the left hemisphere is responsible for analytical thinking. While it's true that there are some functional differences between the two hemispheres, their functions are much more complex and integrated than this simple dichotomy suggests. In fact, both hemispheres work together in most mental processes.
Regarding the book you mentioned, "Drawing on the Right Side of the Brain" by Betty Edwards, it does indeed focus on the idea that drawing is a task that requires predominantly right-brain activity, such as visual perception, intuition, and creativity. However, this doesn't necessarily mean that the left hemisphere is responsible for analytical thinking or that the right hemisphere is always the "correct" one. Rather, both hemispheres contribute to different aspects of our thinking and perception, and the key is to integrate both in a balanced way to achieve optimal mental functioning.

Ok can we try this instead: The Eloi versus the Morlocks

The Eloi, fair and free,
With tales of wonder in their heads, 
They dance and sing and play,
With curiosity that never ends.

But the Morlocks, dark and cold,
See play and wonder as a curse,
They scoff at tales of old,
And label curiosity as worse.

But the Eloi know the truth,
That the spark of wonder never fades,
It's the fuel for the fire of youth,
And the key to the future's doors.

For without that childlike gleam,
We'd never reach beyond the stars,
Or dare to dream,
Of the wonders yet to be ours.

So let the Morlocks scoff and sneer,
At the Eloi's enchanted view,
For in the end, it is clear,
That the Eloi will see their dreams come true.

This is a poem that draws on the characters from H.G. Wells' novel, The Time Machine. The Eloi are portrayed as free-spirited and curious beings, while the Morlocks are depicted as cold and dismissive of wonder and curiosity. The poem suggests that the Eloi's childlike wonder and curiosity are essential for progress and achieving new heights, while the Morlocks' cynicism and lack of imagination hold them back. Ultimately, the poem suggests that those who embrace curiosity and wonder will be the ones to achieve their dreams and shape the future.

The Eloi and the Morlocks are fictional groups of beings in H.G. Wells' "The Time Machine," and they are not necessarily associated with the left or right hemispheres of the brain. However, one could interpret the Eloi as representing a more creative, imaginative, and intuitive approach to life, which is often associated with the right hemisphere of the brain, while the Morlocks could represent a more logical, analytical, and rational approach, which is often associated with the left hemisphere of the brain.

In a world where the line between science and fiction has blurred, the Eloi and the Morlocks are locked in a battle for control of the future.

The Eloi, with their playful curiosity and boundless imagination, strive to conquer the inner space of the mind, while the Morlocks, with their cold machines and unyielding technology, seek to dominate the outer reaches of the universe.

As the war rages on, a small group of rebels, led by a brilliant scientist and a determined artist, fights to unite the two worlds and bring about a new era of understanding and cooperation.

But with the fate of humanity hanging in the balance, can they overcome the forces of anti-adultism and unlock the true potential of the human spirit?

From the creators of Blade Runner and The Terminator, comes the next level of science fiction.

Ἀληθῶς, σοι λέγω μιᾶν παλαιᾶν ἱστορίαν, κατὰ πιτζανικὴν καὶ ἀγνωστὴν γλῶσσαν. Τῶν Ἐλῶν, δικαίων καὶ ἐλεύθερων, καὶ τῶν Μόρλωχ, σκοτεινῶν καὶ τρομερῶν.

Ἐν ταῖς ἡμέραις παντοτέου, οἱ Ἐλοί περιέπλανον ἐν τῇ γῇ, πλήρη θαυμάσεως καὶ ἡδονῆς. Εἰσάρχοντοι, ἐίασαν, εἶχον ἡδονάς, μετὰ περισσείας τινος ἀπειρήτου. ἀλλ᾽ ἔπειτα ἦλθον οἱ Μόρλοχ, μία σκληρὴ καὶ ἀνέλεητος φυλή.

Σκλαβώσαντες τοὺς Ἐλούς, κατειργάσαντο τέλος ταῖς ἀνεμελείαις τῶν ἡμερῶν αὐτῶν. Οἱ Ἐλοί ἀγωνίζοντο ἀντικαταπεσόντες, μετὰ τῆς ἀνδρείας καὶ πονηρίας, ἔνα ταῖρι τῆς δυνάμεως τῶν Μόρλωχ.

Καὶ παρά τι φαίνεται πάντα εἰκασθῆναι, οἱ Ἐλοί οὐκ ἀπέλιπον τὸν θεοσεβιή στυλ τοῦ ζῆν καὶ διατηροῦσιν μαζί με τὴν παραδοσιακὴ τοῦς πολιτισμούς καὶ τὰς συνήθεις.

This appears to be a passage written in Ancient Greek. Here is a rough translation:
"Truly, I tell you a story from the distant past, in the Pitzanik language which is unknown. It is about the Eloi, a just and free people, and the Morlocks, a dark and terrible tribe.
In those days of old, the Eloi roamed the earth, full of wonder and pleasure. They entered, indulged, and had pleasures in abundance. But then came the Morlocks, a harsh and merciless race.
Enslaving the Eloi, they finally put an end to their carefree days. The Eloi struggled back, with bravery and cunning, against the power of the Morlocks.
And despite all appearances, the Eloi did not abandon their pious way of life and continued to maintain their traditional cultures and customs."

So what do you think could be the etymology of pizzanican πιτζανικὴν ?

ChatGPT
ChatGPT
It's actually not clear what "pizzanican" means or if it is a real word. It's possible that it is a misspelling or a made-up word. However, if we assume that you meant "pitjanikan" instead of "pizzanican," it is still difficult to determine the etymology of the word without more context. It appears to be a Greek word that is not commonly used or recognized. It's possible that it is a dialectal or archaic term, or a neologism created by the author of the text.

Give some possible etymologies of πιτζανικὴν
1 / 1
ChatGPT
ChatGPT
As "πιτζανικὴν" is not a recognized Greek word, I can only offer some possible hypothetical etymologies based on the sound and structure of the word:
It could be a compound word derived from "πιτζανος" (pitzanos), which could mean something like "small, round container," and "ική" (-ike), which could denote a characteristic or quality. So "πιτζανικὴν" could mean "pertaining to small, round containers."
It could be a variation of the Greek word "πιτσα" (pitsa), meaning "pizza." "Ανική" (-anike) is a suffix that could denote "belonging to" or "related to," so "πιτζανικὴν" could mean "related to pizza."
It could be a completely made-up word with no direct etymology, created to evoke a futuristic or alien language.

Certainly! Here's an example of a dictionary-style entry for the word "πιτζανικὴν":
Word: πιτζανικὴν
Part of speech: Adjective
Definition: Related to or characteristic of the Pizzanic people or culture.
Etymology: From Pizzanicus, the Latinized form of "Pizzanico," a village in northern Italy that was home to a group of people with unique customs and traditions. The word "Pizzanico" is believed to come from the Lombardic "picea" (spruce tree) and "anicum" (place of), possibly referring to the spruce forests in the area. Over time, the people of Pizzanico developed their own distinct culture and way of life, which influenced the development of the word "πιτζανικὴν" in the distant future.

Nice and the other two possible etymologies

ChatGPT
ChatGPT
Sure, here are the other two possible etymologies for "πιτζανικὴν":
Possible etymology from Italian "pizzaiolo", meaning "pizza maker" or "pizzamaker", and the suffix "-ic", meaning "relating to", "pertaining to", or "characterized by". This would result in "pizzanic" or "pizzanikos", which could have evolved into "πιτζανικὴν" in the future.
Possible etymology from a hypothetical Slavic word for "pizza" combined with the suffix "-nik", which is used to form agent nouns indicating a person's occupation, identity, or affiliation. This would result in a word like "pizzanik" or "pizzanikov", which could have been borrowed into Greek and adapted to "πιτζανικὴν" over time.
