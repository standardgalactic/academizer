Hello there! I am a PDF file discussing the fascinating topic of altered mental states in great apes. In this article, we explore how great apes can reach momentary altered mental states by spinning. Humans have a long history of inducing altered states of mind, but it is uncertain whether pre-human ancestors used psychoactive substances. Unfortunately, comparative approaches with great apes in captivity are currently impracticable due to their retirement from medical research. 

Here are three example questions you may have about this article:
How do great apes induce altered mental states by spinning?
What is the significance of altered mental states in the evolution of the human mind?
Are there any ethical concerns surrounding the use of great apes in medical research?
How do great apes induce altered mental states by spinning?
To test the assumption that spinning induces altered mental states in great apes, the researchers searched YouTube for publicly posted videos of great apes spinning. They used image-based measures to quantify rotational speeds and rotational duration. The study focused on rope spinning, which mainly occurred as solitary play without evident causes or goals beyond the act itself. Ropes or rope-like items like vines likely enable apes to achieve faster free rotations and longer rotation lengths, allowing us to explore the physiological and motoric limits that great apes can experience autonomously. (Page 2)
What is the significance of altered mental states in the evolution of the human mind?
The proclivity for altered mental states is shared between humans and great apes, and provides an entry point for the comparative study of the mechanisms, functions, and adaptive value of altered states of mind in human evolution. When spinning, the apes achieved speeds sufficient to alter self-perception and situational awareness that were comparable to those tapped for transcendent experiences in humans (e.g. Sufi whirling), and the number of revolutions spun predicted behavioural evidence for dizziness. Thus, spinning serves as a self-sufficient means of changing body-mind responsiveness in hominids. (Page 1)
Are there any ethical concerns surrounding the use of great apes in medical research?
Yes, there are ethical concerns surrounding the use of great apes in medical research. Comparative approaches with great apes in captivity are currently impracticable due to their retirement from medical research. The use of great apes in medical research has been a controversial topic for many years, and many countries have banned or restricted the use of great apes in research due to ethical concerns. (Page 1)
Has this been studied before?
The article discusses previous studies on altered mental states in humans, but the specific study of great apes inducing altered mental states through spinning is a new concept. The researchers conducted a proof of concept study to test the assumption that spinning induces altered mental states in great apes, and potentially did so as well in human ancestors. (Page 2)
Doesn't it seem kind of obvious?
While the idea of spinning inducing altered mental states may seem obvious, this study provides empirical evidence to support this assumption in great apes. The study also suggests that the self-induced altered mental states of our ancestors could have shaped aspects of modern human behavior and cognition, as well as mood manipulation and mental wellbeing.

I'm sorry, I don't understand what you're asking. Could you please clarify your question?
I wondered if there was a connection
The study you mentioned, "Evidence for a midlife crisis in great apes consistent with the U-shape in human well-being," is not directly related to the study on altered mental states induced by spinning in great apes. However, both studies provide insights into the behavior and well-being of great apes. The study you mentioned suggests that great apes may experience a midlife crisis similar to humans, while the spinning study suggests that great apes voluntarily seek and engage in altered experiences of self-perception and situational awareness.

I'm just wondering why it is so difficult to imagine that animals have similar experiences to humans.
As an AI language model, I don't have personal opinions or beliefs, but I can provide some information on this topic. The idea that animals have similar experiences to humans has been a topic of debate among scientists and philosophers for centuries. Some people believe that animals are capable of experiencing emotions and consciousness similar to humans, while others argue that animals lack the cognitive abilities necessary for such experiences. 

One reason why it may be difficult for some people to imagine that animals have similar experiences to humans is because humans tend to view themselves as unique and superior to other species. This anthropocentric view has been challenged by scientific research showing that many animals possess complex cognitive abilities and emotional lives. 

However, it's important to note that while animals may experience emotions and consciousness similar to humans, they do so in their own unique ways based on their evolutionary history and ecological niche. Therefore, it's important to approach the study of animal behavior with an open mind and a willingness to learn from the perspectives of other species.
The theory, first proposed by Terence McKenna in the 1990s, suggests that the use of psychedelics played a crucial role in the evolution of early human ancestors. According to McKenna, the consumption of psychedelics, particularly psilocybin mushrooms, allowed our ancestors to develop advanced cognitive abilities, such as language and abstract thinking.  The theory is based on the idea that early human ancestors, living in African savannas around 2 million years ago, began consuming psilocybin mushrooms that grew on the dung of grazing animals. These mushrooms, which contain the psychoactive compound psilocybin, would have had a profound effect on the brain, leading to increased neural plast
While the theory proposed by Terence McKenna that the use of psychedelics played a crucial role in the evolution of early human ancestors is intriguing, it remains a controversial and unproven hypothesis. The idea that psilocybin mushrooms could have led to increased neural plasticity and advanced cognitive abilities is based on speculation rather than empirical evidence. While some researchers have suggested that psychedelics may have played a role in human evolution, there is currently no conclusive evidence to support this claim. Further research is needed to better understand the potential effects of psychedelics on human cognition and behavior.
Yeah I agree it is speculative, but if simple spinning can induce altered states, then perhaps the hypothesis can be reformulated
It is possible that the hypothesis proposed by Terence McKenna could be reformulated based on new evidence and insights into altered states of consciousness. The study on spinning-induced altered states in great apes suggests that non-pharmacological means can be used to deliberately disrupt body and situational awareness, which could have implications for our understanding of how altered states of consciousness may have arisen in early human ancestors. However, it's important to note that the use of psychedelics and other substances is just one potential factor among many that may have contributed to the evolution of human cognition and behavior. Further research is needed to better understand the complex interplay between genetics, environment, culture, and other factors that shaped human evolution.
It is related to my theory that animals can feel inertial forces before birth, and that this has an effect on their intelligence
