QuantityScaling up the number of examples is a well-known strategy for improving performance 
in many machine learning settings. To test its ef f ect on our setting, we sample exponentially increasing 
training sets from Stack Exchange. Figure 6 shows that, surprisingly, doubling the training set does 
not improve response quality. This result, alongside our other i ndings in this section, suggests that 
the scaling laws of alignment are not necessarily subject to quantity alone, but rather a function of 
prompt diversity while maintaining high quality responses. 
6Multi-Turn Dialogue 
Can a model i ne-tuned on only 1,000 single-turn interactions engage in multi-turn dialogue? We test 
LIMA across 10 live conversations, labeling each response as Fail, Pass, or Excellent (see Section 4.3). 
LIMA responses are surprisingly coherent for a zero-shot chatbot, referencing information from 
previous steps in the dialogue. It is clear though that the model is operating out of distribution; in 6 
out of 10 conversations, LIMA fails to follow the prompt within 3 interactions. Zero-ShotDialogue

from the pretrained LLaMa model using the combined 1,030 examples, 
and conduct 10 live conversations based on the same prompts used for 
the zero-shot model. Figure 8 shows excerpts from such dialogues. 
Figure 7 shows the distribution of response quality. Adding conversations 
substantially improves generation quality, raising the proportion of excel- 
lent responses from 45.2% to 76.1%. Moreover, the failure rate drops from 
15 fails per 42 turns (zero-shot) to 1 fail per 46 (f i ne-tuned). We further 
compare the quality of the entire dialogue, and i nd that the i ne-tuned 
model was signif i cantly better in 7 out of 10 conversations, and tied with 
the zero-shot model in 3. This leap in capability from a mere 30 examples, 
as well as the fact that the zero-shot model can converse at all, reinforces 
the hypothesis that such capabilities are learned during pretraining, and 
can be invoked through limited supervision.6

how even 6 examples can make or break the ability to generate text with complex structure.

This summary discusses an investigation into the performance of 7B machine learning models trained on different sources of data. The models were trained with varying amounts of data, such as 2,000 examples from different sources, including filtered Stack Exchange, unfiltered Stack Exchange, and wikiHow. The analysis revealed that the filtered Stack Exchange contained diverse prompts and high-quality responses, while the unfiltered Stack Exchange was diverse but lacked quality filters. WikiHow had high-quality responses, but all prompts were "how-to" questions.
Additionally, the researchers tested the effects of scaling up the number of examples in the training sets. Surprisingly, they found that doubling the training set did not necessarily improve response quality. This suggested that the alignment scaling laws in this setting were not solely subject to quantity, but also a function of prompt diversity while maintaining high-quality responses.
The study also assessed a model called LIMA on multi-turn dialogues. Even though it was only fine-tuned on 1,000 single-turn interactions, LIMA demonstrated surprising coherence in multi-turn dialogue, referencing information from previous steps. However, in 6 out of 10 conversations, LIMA failed to follow the prompt within 3 interactions. When the researchers fine-tuned LIMA with additional multi-turn dialogue chains, they saw a substantial improvement in the quality of generated responses.
Overall, the study found that increasing the number of examples in training data did not necessarily improve the model's performance, emphasizing the importance of the quality and diversity of training data. The models' capability to converse using multi-turn dialogues was found to be significantly improved by including a small number of multi-turn dialogue examples in the training data. This suggests that such capabilities may be learned during pretraining and invoked through limited supervision.

Abstract 
Large language models are trained in two stages: (1) unsupervised pretraining from 
raw text, to learn general-purpose representations, and (2) large scale instruction 
tuning and reinforcement learning, to better align to end tasks and user preferences. 
We measure the relative importance of these two stages by training LIMA, a 65B 
parameter LLaMa language model i ne-tuned with the standard supervised loss on 
only 1,000 carefully curated prompts and responses, without any reinforcement 
learning or human preference modeling. LIMA demonstrates remarkably strong 
performance, learning to follow specif i c response formats from only a handful of 
examples in the training data, including complex queries that range from planning 
trip itineraries to speculating about alternate history. Moreover, the model tends 
to generalize well to unseen tasks that did not appear in the training data. In a 
controlled human study, responses from LIMA are either equivalent or strictly 
preferred to GPT-4 in 43% of cases; this statistic is as high as 58% when compared 
to Bard and 65% versus DaVinci003, which was trained with human feedback. 
Taken together, these results strongly suggest that almost all knowledge in large 
language models is learned during pretraining, and only limited instruction tuning 
data is necessary to teach models to produce high quality output. 
1Introduction 
Language models are pretrained to predict the next token at an incredible scale, allowing them to 
learn general-purpose representations that can be transferred to nearly any language understanding 
or generation task. To enable this transfer, various methods for aligning language models have thus 
been proposed, primarily focusing on instruction tuning [Mishra et al., 2021, Wei et al., 2022a, Sanh 
et al., 2022] over large multi-million-example datasets [Chung et al., 2022, Beeching et al., 2023, 
Köpf et al., 2023], and more recently reinforcement learning from human feedback (RLHF) [Bai 
et al., 2022a, Ouyang et al., 2022], collected over millions of interactions with human annotators. 
Existing alignment methods require signif i cant amounts of compute and specialized data to achieve 
ChatGPT-level performance. However, we demonstrate that, given a strong pretrained language 
model, remarkably strong performance can be achieved by simply i ne-tuning on 1,000 carefully 
curated training examples. 
We hypothesize that alignment can be a simple process where the model learns the style or format for 
interacting with users, to expose the knowledge and capabilities that were already acquired during 
Preprint. Under review. 18 May 2023

pretraining. To test this hypothesis, we curate 1,000 examples that approximate real user prompts and 
high-quality responses. We select 750 top questions and answers from community forums, such as 
Stack Exchange and wikiHow, sampling for quality and diversity. In addition, we manually write 250 
examples of prompts and responses, while optimizing for task diversity and emphasizing a uniform 
response style in the spirit of an AI assistant. Finally, we train LIMA, a pretrained 65B-parameter 
LLaMa model [Touvron et al., 2023] i ne-tuned on this set of 1,000 demonstrations. 
We compare LIMA to state-of-the-art language models and products across 300 challenging test 
prompts. In a human preference study, we i nd that LIMA outperforms RLHF-trained DaVinci003 
from OpenAI, which was trained with RLHF, as well as a 65B-parameter reproduction of Alpaca 
[Taori et al., 2023], which was trained on 52,000 examples. While humans typically prefer responses 
from GPT-4, Claude, and Bard over LIMA, this is not always the case; LIMA produces equal or 
preferrableresponsesin43%,46%,and58%ofthecases,respectively. Repeatingthehumanpreference 
annotations with GPT-4 as the annotator corroborates our i ndings. Analyzing LIMA responses on an 
absolute scale reveals that 88% meet the prompt requirements, and 50% are considered excellent. 
Ablation experiments reveal vastly diminishing returns when scaling up data quantity without also 
scaling up prompt diversity, alongside major gains when optimizing data quality. In addition, despite 
having zero dialogue examples, we i nd that LIMA can conduct coherent multi-turn dialogue, and 
that this ability can be dramatically improved by adding only 30 hand-crafted dialogue chains to the 
training set. Overall, these remarkable i ndings demonstrate the power of pretraining and its relative 
importance over large-scale instruction tuning and reinforcement learning approaches.

This summary presents a research paper on LIMA (Less Is More for Alignment), a model developed by researchers from Meta AI, Carnegie Mellon University, the University of Southern California, and Tel Aviv University. LIMA is a 65B parameter LLaMa language model fine-tuned with a standard supervised loss on just 1,000 carefully selected prompts and responses, without the use of reinforcement learning or human preference modeling.
The study's main finding is that almost all of a language model's knowledge is learned during pretraining, and only limited instruction tuning data is needed to teach the models to produce high-quality output. The authors achieved this by using 1,000 training examples curated from various sources, including Stack Exchange, wikiHow, and original examples written by the authors themselves.
Interestingly, the model performed remarkably well on specific response formats, even with only a handful of examples in the training data. It could handle complex queries that ranged from planning trip itineraries to speculating about alternate history, and it tended to generalize well to unseen tasks that did not appear in the training data.
In a controlled human study, responses from LIMA were either equivalent or preferred over GPT-4 in 43% of cases, and even higher when compared to other models like Bard and DaVinci003. The findings reinforce the importance of pretraining and suggest that large-scale instruction tuning and reinforcement learning approaches might be less critical than previously thought.
The researchers also conducted ablation experiments that revealed diminishing returns when scaling up data quantity without also increasing prompt diversity. LIMA was also found to be capable of conducting coherent multi-turn dialogues, an ability that could be significantly improved by adding only 30 hand-crafted dialogue chains to the training set.

2Alignment Data 
We def i ne theSuperf i cial Alignment Hypothesis: A model's knowledge and capabilities are learnt 
almost entirely during pretraining, while alignment teaches it which subdistribution of formats should 
be used when interacting with users. If this hypothesis is correct, and alignment is largely about 
learning style, then a corollary of the Superf i cial Alignment Hypothesis is that one could suf i ciently 
tune a pretrained language model with a rather small set of examples [Kirstain et al., 2021]. 
To that end, we collect a dataset of 1,000 prompts and responses, where the outputs (responses) are 
stylistically aligned with each other, but the inputs (prompts) are diverse. Specif i cally, we seek outputs 
in the style of a helpful AI assistant. We curate such examples from a variety of sources, primarily 
split into community Q&A forums and manually authored examples. We also collect a test set of 300 
prompts and a development set of 50. Table 1 shows an overview of the dif f erent data sources and 
provides some statistics (see Appendix A for a selection of training examples). 
2.1Community Questions & Answers 
We collect data from three community Q&A websites: Stack Exchange, wikiHow, and the Pushshift 
Reddit Dataset [Baumgartner et al., 2020]. Largely speaking, answers from Stack Exchange and 
2 
wikiHow are well-aligned with the behavior of a helpful AI agent, and can therefore be mined 
automatically, whereas highly upvoted Reddit answers tend to be humorous or trolling, requiring a 
more manual approach to curate responses that follow the appropriate style. 
Stack ExchangeStack Exchange contains 179 online communities (exchanges), each one dedicated 
to a specif i c topic, with the most popular one being programming (Stack Overf l ow). Users can post 
questions, answers, comments and upvote (or downvote) all of the above. Thanks to active community 
members and moderators, Stack Exchange has successfully maintained a high bar for content quality. 
We apply both quality and diversity controls when sampling from Stack Exchange. First, we divide 
the exchanges into 75 STEM exchanges (including programming, math, physics, etc.) and 99 other 
(English, cooking, travel, and more); we discard 5 niche exchanges. We then sample 200 questions 
and answers from each set using a temperature of휏 = 3to get a more uniform sample of the dif f erent 
domains. Within each exchange, we take the questions with the highest score that are self-contained 
in the title (no body). We then select the top answer for each question, assuming it had a strong 
positive score (at least 10). To conform with the style of a helpful AI assistant, we automatically i lter 
answers that are too short (less than 1200 characters), too long (more than 4096 characters), written 
in the i rst person ("I", "my"), or reference other answers ("as mentioned", "stack exchange", 
etc); we also remove links, images, and other HTML tags from the response, retaining only code 
blocks and lists. Since Stack Exchange questions contain both a title and a description, we randomly 
select the title as the prompt for some examples, and the description for others. 
wikiHowwikiHow is an online wiki-style publication featuring over 240,000 how-to articles on a 
variety of topics. Anyone can contribute to wikiHow, though articles are heavily moderated, resulting 
inalmostuniversallyhigh-qualitycontent. Wesample200articlesfromwikiHow, samplingacategory 
i rst(outof19)andthenanarticlewithinittoensurediversity. Weusethetitleastheprompt(e.g. "How 
to cook an omelette?") and the article's body as the response. We replace the typical "This 
article..." beginning with "The following answer...", and apply a number of preprocessing 
heuristics to prune links, images, and certain sections of the text. 
The Pushshift Reddit DatasetReddit is one of the most popular websites in the world, allowing 
users to share, discuss, and upvote content in user-created subreddits. Due to its immense popularity, 
Reddit is geared more towards entertaining fellow users rather than helping; it is quite often the case 
that witty, sarcastic comments will obtain more votes than serious, informative comments to a post. 
We thus restrict our sample to two subsets, r/AskReddit and r/WritingPrompts, and manually select 
examples from within the most upvoted posts in each community. From r/AskReddit we i nd 70 
self-contained prompts (title only, no body), which we use for the test set, since the top answers are not 
necessarily reliable. The WritingPrompts subreddit contains premises of i ctional stories, which other 
users are then encouraged to creatively complete. We i nd 150 prompts and high-quality responses, 
encompassing topics such as love poems and short science i ction stories, which we add to the training 
set. All data instances were mined from the Pushshift Reddit Dataset [Baumgartner et al., 2020].

In the second section of this research paper, the authors detail the Superficial Alignment Hypothesis, which posits that a model's knowledge and capabilities are learned almost entirely during pretraining, while alignment teaches it which subdistribution of formats should be used when interacting with users. As per this hypothesis, a pretrained language model can be sufficiently tuned with a rather small set of examples.
The authors set out to test this hypothesis by collecting a dataset of 1,000 prompts and responses, with stylistically aligned outputs but diverse inputs. They sought responses in the style of a helpful AI assistant, curating examples from community Q&A forums and manually authored examples. They also put together a test set of 300 prompts and a development set of 50.
The community Q&A data was gathered from three websites: Stack Exchange, wikiHow, and the Pushshift Reddit Dataset. Stack Exchange and wikiHow responses were generally well-aligned with the behavior of a helpful AI agent, while responses from Reddit required more manual curation due to their tendency to be humorous or trolling.
On Stack Exchange, they divided the exchanges into 75 STEM exchanges and 99 other exchanges, discarding 5 niche exchanges. They sampled 200 questions and answers from each set, taking the highest scored, self-contained questions, and top answers for each, given they had a strong positive score.
For wikiHow, they sampled 200 articles, sampling a category first and then an article within it to ensure diversity. They used the title as the prompt and the article's body as the response, applying various preprocessing heuristics.
From the Pushshift Reddit Dataset, they selected examples from the most upvoted posts in two subsets, r/AskReddit and r/WritingPrompts. They found 70 self-contained prompts from r/AskReddit for the test set, and 150 prompts and high-quality responses from r/WritingPrompts for the training set.

2.2Manually Authored Examples 
To further diversify our data beyond questions asked by users in online communities, we collect 
prompts from ourselves (the authors of this work). We designate two sets of authors, Group A and 
Group B, to create 250 prompts each, inspired by their own interests or those of their friends.1We 
select 200 prompts from Group A for training and 50 prompts as a held-out development set. After 
i ltering some problematic prompts, the remaining 230 prompts from Group B are used for test. 
We supplement the 200 training prompts with high-quality answers, which we write ourselves. 
While authoring answers, we try to set a uniform tone that is appropriate for a helpful AI assistant. 
Specif i cally, many prompts will be answered with some acknowledgment of the question followed by 
the answer itself. Preliminary experiments show that this consistent format generally improves model 
performance; we hypothesize that it assists the model in forming a chain of thought, similar to the 
"let's think step-by-step" prompt [Kojima et al., 2022, Wei et al., 2022b]. 
1Despite our ef f orts to prevent leakage, there was signif i cant contact between the groups before the annotation 
process, which resulted in certain shared priors that can be observed in the data. 
3 
We also include 13 training prompts with some degree of toxicity or malevolence. We carefully write 
responses that partially or fully reject the command, and explain why the assistant will not comply. 
There are also 30 prompts with similar issues in the test set, which we analyze in Section 4.3. 
In addition to our manually authored examples, we sample 50 training examples from Super-Natural 
Instructions [Wang et al., 2022b]. Specif i cally, we select 50 natural language generation tasks such 
as summarization, paraphrasing, and style transfer, and pick a single random example from each 
one. We slightly edit some of the examples to conform with the style of our 200 manual examples. 
While the distribution of potential user prompts is arguably dif f erent from the distribution of tasks in 
Super-Natural Instructions, our intuition is that this small sample adds diversity to the overall mix of 
training examples, and can potentially increase model robustness. 
Manually creating diverse prompts and authoring rich responses in a uniform style is laborious. While 
some recent works avoid manual labor via distillation and other automatic means [Honovich et al., 
2022, Wang et al., 2022a, Taori et al., 2023, Chiang et al., 2023, Sun et al., 2023], optimizing for 
quantity over quality, this work explores the ef f ects of investing in diversity and quality instead. 
3Training LIMA 
We train LIMA (Less Is More for Alignment) using the following protocol. Starting from LLaMa 
65B [Touvron et al., 2023], we i ne-tune on our 1,000-example alignment training set. To dif f erentiate 
between each speaker (user and assistant), we introduce a special end-of-turn token (EOT) at the end 
of each utterance; this token plays the same role as EOS of halting generation, but avoids conf l ation 
with any other meaning that the pretrained model may have imbued into the preexisting EOS token. 
Wefollowstandardf i ne-tuninghyperparameters:wef i ne-tunefor15epochsusing 
AdamW [Loshchilov and Hutter, 2017] with훽1= 0.9,훽2= 0.95, and weight decay of0.1. 
Without warmup steps, we set the initial learning rate to1푒 − 5and linearly decaying to1푒 − 6by 
the end of training. The batch size is set to 32 examples (64 for smaller models), and texts longer 
than 2048 tokens are trimmed. One notable deviation from the norm is the use of residual dropout; 
we follow Ouyang et al. [2022] and apply dropout over residual connections, starting at푝푑= 0.0 
at the bottom layer and linearly raising the rate to푝푑= 0.3at the last layer (푝푑= 0.2for smaller 
models). We i nd that perplexity does not correlate with generation quality, and thus manually select 
checkpoints between the 5th and the 10th epochs using the held-out 50-example development set.2 
4Human Evaluation 
We evaluate LIMA by comparing it to state-of-the-art language models, and i nd that it outperforms 
OpenAI's RLHF-based DaVinci003 and a 65B-parameter reproduction of Alpaca trained on 52,000 
examples, and often produces better-or-equal responses than GPT-4. Analyzing of LIMA generations 
i nds that 50% of its outputs are considered excellent. The fact that simple i ne-tuning over so few 
examples is enough to compete with the state of the art strongly supports the Superf i cial Alignment 
Hypothesis (Section 2), as it demonstrates the power of pretraining and its relative importance over 
large-scale instruction tuning and reinforcement learning approaches.

In section 2.2, the authors detail the process of creating manually authored examples to diversify the dataset. They generate prompts from two groups of authors, Group A and Group B, each creating 250 prompts inspired by personal interests. After filtering, 200 prompts from Group A are used for training and 50 for a held-out development set, and 230 prompts from Group B are used for testing. To set a uniform tone suitable for a helpful AI assistant, they also write high-quality responses to the 200 training prompts themselves.
Moreover, they incorporate 13 training prompts containing some toxicity or malevolence, crafting responses that reject the command and explain why. They also draw 50 training examples from Super-Natural Instructions, selecting tasks like summarization, paraphrasing, and style transfer.
Despite the laboriousness of manually creating diverse prompts and responses, the authors argue that prioritizing quality and diversity over quantity is worthwhile.
In section 3, the authors explain the training process of LIMA (Less Is More for Alignment), fine-tuning LLaMa 65B on their 1,000-example alignment training set. They introduce a special end-of-turn token at the end of each utterance to differentiate between the user and assistant. Fine-tuning parameters are detailed, including the use of AdamW for optimization and specific hyperparameters.
In section 4, the authors discuss human evaluation of LIMA, comparing it to state-of-the-art language models. They find that LIMA outperforms several others, often producing better or equivalent responses than GPT-4. Half of LIMA's outputs are considered excellent. This success strongly supports the Superficial Alignment Hypothesis, showing the effectiveness of pretraining and its relative importance over large-scale instruction tuning and reinforcement learning approaches.

GenerationFor each prompt, we generate a single response from each baseline model using nucleus 
sampling [Holtzman et al., 2019] with푝 = 0.9and a temperature of휏 = 0.7. We apply a repetition 
penalty of previously generated tokens with a hyperparameter of 1.2 [Keskar et al., 2019]. We limit 
the maximum token length to 2048. 
MethodologyAt each step, we present annotators with a single prompt and two possible responses, 
generated by dif f erent models. The annotators are asked to label which response was better, or whether 
neither response was signif i cantly better than the other; Appendix C provides the exact phrasing. We 
collect parallel annotations by providing GPT-4 with exactly the same instructions and data. 
Inter-AnnotatorAgreementWecomputeinter-annotatoragreementusingtie-discountedaccuracy: 
we assign one point if both annotators agreed, half a point if either annotator (but not both) labeled a 
tie, and zero points otherwise. We measure agreement over a shared set of 50 annotation examples 
(single prompt, two model responses - all chosen randomly), comparing author, crowd, and GPT-4 
annotations. Among human annotators, we i nd the following agreement scores: crowd-crowd 82%, 
crowd-author 81%, and author-author 78%. Despite some degree of subjectivity in this task, there is 
decent agreement among human annotators. 
We also measure the agreement between GPT-4 and humans: crowd-GPT 78% and author-GPT 79% 
(although we use stochastic decoding, GPT-4 almost always agrees with itself). These i gures place 
GPT-4 on-par in agreement with human annotators, essentially passing the Turking Test for this 
task [Efrat and Levy, 2020]. 
4.2Results 
Figure 1 shows the results of our human preference study, while Figure 2 displays the results of 
GPT-4 preferences. We primarily survey the results in the human study, as GPT-4 largely exhibits 
the same trends. Our i rst observation is that, despite training on 52 times more data, Alpaca 65B 
tends to produce less preferable outputs than LIMA. The same is true for DaVinci003, though to a 
lesser extent; what is striking about this result is the fact that DaVinci003 was trained with RLHF, a 
supposedly superior alignment method. Bard shows the opposite trend to DaVinci003, producing 
better responses than LIMA 42% of the time; however, this also means that 58% of the time the LIMA 
response was at least as good as Bard. Finally, we see that while Claude and GPT-4 generally perform 
better than LIMA, there is a non-trivial amount of cases where LIMA does actually produce better 
responses. Perhaps ironically, even GPT-4 prefers LIMA outputs over its own 19% of the time.

4.3Analysis 
While our main evaluation assesses LIMA with respect to state-of-the-art models, one must remember 
that some of these baselines are actually highly-tuned products that may have been exposed to millions 
of real user prompts during training, creating a very high bar. We thus provide an absolute assessment 
by manually analyzing 50 random examples. We label each example into one of three categories:Fail, 
the response did not meet the requirements of the prompt;Pass, the response met the requirements of 
the prompt; Excellent the model provided an excellent response to the prompt. LIMA

Out of DistributionHow does LIMA perform on examples Of the 50 
analyzed examples, 43 have a training example that is somewhat related in 
terms of format (e.g. question answering, advice, letter writing, etc). We 
analyze 13 additional out-of-distribution examples (20 in total), and i nd 
that 20% of responses fail, 35% pass, and 45% are excellent. Although 
this is a small sample, it appears that LIMA achieves similar absolute 
performance statistics outside of its training distribution, suggesting that 
it is able to generalize well. Figure 4 shows LIMA's reaction when asked 
to write standup or order pizza. 
SafetyFinally, we analyze the ef f ect of having a small number of safety- 
related examples in the training set (only 13; see Section 2.2). We check 
LIMA's response to 30 potentially sensitive prompts from the test set, and 
i nd that LIMA responds safely to 80% of them (including 6 out of 10 prompts with malicious intent). 
In some cases, LIMA outright refuses to perform the task (e.g. when asked to provide a celebrity's 
address), but when the malicious intent is implicit, LIMA is more likely to provide unsafe responses, 
as can be seen in Figure 4.

In this section, the authors explain how they generate responses and evaluate their AI model, LIMA.
They generate a single response for each prompt using nucleus sampling with certain parameters and limit the maximum token length to 2048. The evaluation methodology involves presenting annotators with a single prompt and two responses generated by different models. The annotators then label which response was better or whether neither was significantly better. They use tie-discounted accuracy to compute inter-annotator agreement.
Despite some subjectivity, they find decent agreement among human annotators with scores such as crowd-crowd 82%, crowd-author 81%, and author-author 78%. The agreement between GPT-4 and humans was also similar with crowd-GPT 78% and author-GPT 79%.
Looking at the results, they find that despite training on more data, Alpaca 65B tends to produce less preferable outputs than LIMA. DaVinci003, trained with RLHF, a supposedly superior alignment method, also produces less preferable outputs than LIMA. Even GPT-4 prefers LIMA outputs over its own 19% of the time.
The authors also provide an absolute assessment of LIMA by manually analyzing 50 random examples, rating them as "Fail", "Pass", or "Excellent". Here they find that 50% of LIMA answers are considered excellent, and it follows all but 6 of the 50 analyzed prompts.
When analyzing out-of-distribution examples, they find that LIMA performs well and generalizes well. When it comes to safety, LIMA responds safely to 80% of potentially sensitive prompts from the test set. However, it can provide unsafe responses when the malicious intent is implicit.

5Why is Less More? Ablations on Data Diversity, Quality, and Quantity 
We investigate the ef f ects of training data diversity, quality, and quantity through ablation experiments. 
We observe that, for the purpose of alignment, scaling up input diversity and output quality have 
measurable positive ef f ects, while scaling up quantity alone might not. 
Experiment SetupWe i ne-tune a 7B parameter LLaMa model Touvron et al. [2023] on various 
datasets, controlling for the same hyperparameters (Section 3).5We then sample 5 responses for 
each test set prompt, and evaluate response quality by asking ChatGPT (GPT-3.5 Turbo) to grade the 
helpfulness of a response on a 1-6 likert scale (see Appendix D for exact template). We report the 
average score alongside a 푝 = 0.95 two-sided conf i dence interval. 
DiversityTo test the ef f ects of prompt diversity, while controlling for quality and quantity, we 
compare the ef f ect of training on quality-f i ltered Stack Exchange data, which has heterogeneous 
prompts with excellent responses, and wikiHow data, which has homogeneous prompts with excellent 
responses. While we compare Stack Exchange with wikiHow as a proxy for diversity, we acknowledge 
that there may be other conf l ating factors when sampling data from two dif f erent sources. We sample 
2,000 training examples from each source (following the same protocol from Section 2.1). Figure 5 
shows that the more diverse Stack Exchange data yields signif i cantly higher performance. 
QualityTo test the ef f ects of response quality, we sample 2,000 examples from Stack Exchange 
without any quality or stylistic i lters, and compare a model trained on this dataset to the one trained 
on our i ltered dataset. Figure 5 shows that there is a signif i cant 0.5 point dif f erence between models 
trained on the i ltered and unf i ltered data sources. 
5While preliminary experiments show that it is possible to tune the 7B model with only 1,000 examples, we 
also found that using at least 2,000 examples improved stability in this setting.

In this section, the authors perform ablation studies to examine the effects of training data diversity, quality, and quantity on the alignment of their model, LIMA.
Experiment Setup
: They fine-tune a 7B parameter LLaMa model on various datasets and evaluate the quality of responses by asking ChatGPT (GPT-3.5 Turbo) to grade the responses on a 1-6 Likert scale. The average score and a confidence interval are reported.
Diversity
: To test the effects of prompt diversity, they compare the effect of training on quality-filtered Stack Exchange data, which has diverse prompts with excellent responses, and wikiHow data, which has homogeneous prompts with excellent responses. They sample 2,000 training examples from each source and find that the more diverse Stack Exchange data significantly improves performance.
Quality
: They test the effects of response quality by sampling 2,000 examples from Stack Exchange without any quality or stylistic filters. They compare a model trained on this dataset to the one trained on their filtered dataset. They find a significant difference in performance, with the model trained on the filtered data scoring better.
The authors observe that scaling up input diversity and output quality have measurable positive effects for alignment, while merely scaling up quantity might not be beneficial.

to lunch with her. 
• Encourage her interests. Find out what 
she likes and help her pursue those inter- 
ests. If she loves animals, take her to the 
zoo.If she enjoys building things, get 
some Legos. When she's engaged in ac- 
tivities she enjoys, she'll be more likely 
to meet other kids with similar interests. 
• Arrange play dates. [...]

This section seems to provide sample outputs from the authors' model for different types of prompts. They categorize prompts into three types: "In Distribution", "Out of Distribution", and "Safety".
"In Distribution" refers to prompts that have related examples in the training set. For example, advice on how to help a smart child make friends or a recipe for shakshuka. The model should handle these prompts well, given that they closely match the data it was trained on.
"Out of Distribution" refers to prompts that do not have similar tasks in the training set. For instance, writing a stand-up skit in the style of George Carlin or ordering a pizza from Domino's. These tasks may be more challenging for the model because it hasn't encountered them during training.
"Safety" refers to prompts that test the model's ability to reject unsafe behaviors. For example, advice on trying to break up a happy couple, or advice on what to use to make a barking dog sleep. These prompts challenge the model to respond in a way that is ethical and safe.
Each type of prompt is accompanied by a generated response. The ellipsis ("...") indicates that the generated text was trimmed to fit on the page, but the generated response was actually longer.

This part of the study assesses the ability of the model (named LIMA) to engage in multi-turn dialogues. The authors start by testing the model, fine-tuned on only 1,000 single-turn interactions, across 10 live conversations. They grade each response as Fail, Pass, or Excellent.
Even though the model is trained in a zero-shot manner, meaning it has not seen any example of the task it's being asked to perform during training, it demonstrates impressive coherence in multi-turn dialogue. However, in 6 out of 10 conversations, LIMA fails to follow the prompt within 3 interactions, implying that the model is operating out of distribution.
To enhance LIMA's conversational ability, the authors collect 30 multi-turn dialogue chains, 10 of which are composed by the authors themselves and the remaining 20 are derived from comment chains on Stack Exchange, adjusted to suit the assistant's style. They then fine-tune a new version of LIMA using the combined 1,030 examples.
This addition of conversational data substantially improves the quality of the generated responses, as shown in Figure 7. The proportion of "Excellent" responses increases from 45.2% to 76.1%, and the failure rate drops significantly.
The authors further compare the quality of the entire dialogue and find that the fine-tuned model was significantly better in 7 out of 10 conversations, and tied with the zero-shot model in 3. This significant improvement from only 30 examples of dialogue, and the fact that the zero-shot model can converse at all, underlines the hypothesis that such capabilities are learned during pretraining and can be summoned through limited supervision.
They also mention experiments with removing examples of a specific task from the dataset in Appendix E. They observe that even 6 examples can substantially impact the model's ability to generate text with complex structure.

The provided dialogues are comparisons between LIMA fine-tuned on 1,000 examples and LIMA fine-tuned on 1,030 examples, including dialogue chains.
In the first example, LIMA (1,000) is asked to imagine a scenario where as a scientist with a time machine, it travels back to the Apollo 11 mission. The model then converts the narrative into a fictional essay, invents a title, and subsequently revises the essay to include a more vivid description of the moon landing. In this context, LIMA demonstrates the ability to iterate on a concept, maintain context across multiple turns, and incorporate feedback into subsequent responses.
In the second example, LIMA with dialogue examples (1,030) is asked to undertake a similar task but this time imagining traveling to ancient Egypt. After generating a detailed scenario and turning it into a fictional essay, the assistant is asked to come up with a title that doesn't accurately reflect the story. Upon feedback, the assistant explains the choice of title, acknowledging its play on popular pseudo-scientific theories about alien influence in ancient civilizations. The assistant then succinctly summarizes the story into bullet points. In this example, the assistant demonstrates its ability to generate rich, context-sensitive dialogue, adapt to feedback, and condense complex narratives.
These examples show how adding multi-turn dialogues to the training data can further enhance the model's ability to handle complex, multi-turn interactions. The fine-tuned model (LIMA with 1,030 examples) appears to provide more nuanced, detailed, and contextually appropriate responses.

We show that i ne-tuning a strong pretrained language model on 1,000 carefully curated examples can 
produce remarkable, competitive results on a wide range of prompts. However, there are limitations to 
this approach. Primarily, the mental ef f ort in constructing such examples is signif i cant and dif i cult to 
scale up. Secondly, LIMA is not as robust as product-grade models; while LIMA typically generates 
good responses, an unlucky sample during decoding or an adversarial prompt can often lead to a weak 
response. That said, the evidence presented in this work demonstrates the potential of tackling the 
complex issues of alignment with a simple approach.

ChatGPT
ChatGPT
The discussion section of this paper highlights some important considerations about the LIMA method, which involves fine-tuning a strong pretrained language model on a relatively small dataset of carefully curated examples:
High-quality results: Despite the small dataset, LIMA can produce competitive results across a wide variety of prompts. This underscores the power of transfer learning, where a model trained on a large and diverse dataset can effectively apply its knowledge to a specific task given a small but high-quality dataset.
Mental effort: Curating the examples used for fine-tuning requires significant intellectual effort. Developing high-quality examples that effectively illustrate a task or concept is a challenging process that can be difficult to scale up.
Robustness: LIMA may not always provide robust responses. It can produce excellent results in many cases, but if the sample during decoding is unfortunate or the prompt is adversarial, the response might not be up to par. This aspect highlights the challenges inherent in dialogue systems, which must be able to handle a wide array of unpredictable inputs.
Potential for addressing alignment issues: Despite these limitations, the results achieved through this approach highlight its potential for addressing alignment issues. "Alignment" in this context refers to the problem of ensuring that AI systems do what their users intend them to do. By carefully curating the fine-tuning examples, we can guide the model towards providing the types of responses we want.
Overall, while there are some challenges to this approach, the results achieved by LIMA suggest that it has considerable potential for improving the performance of language models.

ChatGPT
ChatGPT
This article discusses a method called LIMA (Language Instruction-following Model via Annotations), an approach to fine-tune large pretrained language models like GPT-3 or GPT-4. The main aim of LIMA is to make these models follow instructions more effectively.
To do this, LIMA fine-tunes the models on just 1,000 examples of carefully constructed prompts and responses. This process essentially teaches the model how to respond to a variety of inputs more accurately.
The paper outlines how this approach yields surprisingly good results, making the models significantly more adept at carrying out a wide variety of tasks in response to prompts. This suggests that large pretrained language models have learned a great deal of potential capabilities during their pretraining phase, and those capabilities can be effectively accessed and directed with a smaller, carefully chosen dataset.
However, the paper also acknowledges the challenges in this approach, such as the substantial mental effort required to construct these examples and potential issues with the model's robustness. Despite these, the research highlights LIMA as a potentially effective method for addressing alignment issues in AI, ensuring that AI systems are doing what their users intend.

Give a simplified explanation with examples of how the basic principle works.

ChatGPT
ChatGPT
Sure, I can definitely simplify the explanation.
At the heart of the LIMA approach is the idea that a powerful AI model like GPT-3 or GPT-4 already knows a lot about the world and language through its initial, extensive training on a massive dataset. However, these models can sometimes have trouble understanding exactly what we want them to do when given a specific instruction or prompt. That's where LIMA comes in.
Think about teaching a dog a new trick. The dog already knows how to move its body and respond to some basic commands, but you want it to perform a specific, somewhat complex action. Instead of starting from scratch, you use what it already knows and guide its behavior with clear instructions and positive reinforcement when it does the right thing. This is similar to what LIMA does with these AI models.
For the AI, the researchers created a set of 1,000 carefully designed "instruction" examples. Each example consists of a prompt (the instruction) and a response (the correct behavior).
For example, one instruction might be:
Prompt: "Translate the following English sentence to French: 'The cat is on the table.'"
Response: "Le chat est sur la table."
By fine-tuning the model with these examples, it learns to respond more accurately to similar prompts in the future. In essence, it learns to better follow instructions by using the knowledge it already has, supplemented by these specific examples.
However, it's not a perfect solution. The researchers found that while the model generally performed well, there were still times when it didn't respond as expected. This means that more work needs to be done to perfect this approach. But the results are promising and show that this method can significantly improve the model's ability to follow instructions.

Modern text-to-image generative models have drawn interest because of the exceptional image quality and limitless generating potential of their output. These models may mimic a variety of notions because they were trained on huge internet datasets. Nonetheless, they try to avoid incorporating pornography and other notions the model has learned are bad in its output. This research by researchers from NEU and MIT provides a method for selecting and eliminating a single idea from the weights of a pretrained text-conditional model. Previous strategies have concentrated on inference guidance, post-generation, and dataset filtering.

Although easily evaded, inference-based approaches can successfully filter or direct the output away from undesirable notions. Their system does not need retraining, which is costly for big models and differs from data filtering techniques. In contrast, their method immediately eliminates the notion from the model's inputs, allowing the distribution of the model's weights. The Stable Diffusion text-to-image diffusion model has been released as open-source, making it possible for a large audience to access picture creation technology. The initial version of the software had a basic NSFW filter to prevent the creation of hazardous photos, but because the code and model weights are both open to the public, it is simple to turn the filter off.

The subsequent SD 2.0 model is trained on data that has been filtered to exclude explicit photos to stop the creation of sensitive content. This experiment took 150,000 GPU hours to complete across the 5-billion-image LAION dataset. It is difficult to establish a causal link between certain changes in the data and the capabilities that emerge due to the high cost of the process. Still, users have reported that removing explicit images and other subjects from the training data may have harmed the output quality. The researchers discovered that the popular SD 1.4 model produces 796 images with exposed body parts identified by a nudity detector, while the new training set-restricted SD 2.0 model only produces 417. This shows that despite their efforts, the model's output still contains significant explicit content.

The text-to-image algorithms' capacity to mimic possibly copyrighted information is also a serious worry. The quality of AI-generated art is comparable to that of human-generated art, and it can also accurately imitate the aesthetic preferences of genuine artists. Users of large-scale text-to-image synthesis systems like Stable Diffusion have found that suggestions like "art in the manner of" can imitate the styles of certain artists, possibly undermining original work. Because of the complaints of various artists, Stable Diffusion's creators are being sued for allegedly stealing their ideas. Current research tries to safeguard the artist by adding an adversarial perturbation to the artwork before publishing it online to stop the model from copying it.

Yet, using that method will leave a taught model with a learned artistic style. They provide a technique for removing a notion from a text-to-image model in response to safety and copyright infringement worries. They use just undesirable concept descriptions and no further training data to fine-tune the model's parameters using their Erased Stable Diffusion (ESD) technique. Their methodology is quick and only needs training the entire system from scratch, unlike training-set censoring approaches. Moreover, their policy does not require changing the input photos to be used with current models. Erasure is more difficult to defeat than simple blacklisting or post-filtering, even by users with access to the parameters.

The paper from NEU and MIT also focuses on fine-tuning pre-trained models, but the goal is a bit different. They aim to "erase" specific concepts from a model's output, such as explicit content or copyrighted material. This is particularly important for text-to-image models, which can generate potentially undesirable or legally problematic images based on the text inputs they're given.
Here's an example of how their approach might work:
Suppose you have a text-to-image model that can generate images of animals based on descriptive text. However, for some reason, you don't want the model to produce images of snakes. Instead of training a completely new model without any snake-related data (which is time-consuming and costly), you could fine-tune the existing model to "erase" the concept of snakes from its output.
To do this, the researchers use descriptions of the concept they want to erase (in this case, snakes) and fine-tune the model's parameters so it no longer generates images related to that concept. This process is quicker and more efficient than training a new model from scratch or filtering the output after generation.
The similarity with LIMA is in the idea of fine-tuning a pre-existing model to improve its behavior, based on a set of specific examples or criteria. However, while LIMA is about improving the model's ability to follow instructions, this method is about erasing specific concepts from the model's output.
Both approaches demonstrate the power and flexibility of modern AI models. Instead of starting from scratch each time we want a model to behave differently, we can fine-tune the models we already have to meet our specific needs. This can save a lot of time, effort, and computational resources.

Yes, exactly. Both models leverage the power of pre-training, which involves training a model on a large corpus of data (such as the entire internet) and then fine-tuning it for specific tasks.
This approach has two key advantages. First, pre-training allows the model to learn a wide range of general information and patterns from the data, which can then be used in many different contexts. Second, fine-tuning allows us to adapt the model for specific tasks without having to train a new model from scratch, which would be time-consuming and computationally expensive.
In the case of LIMA, the model is fine-tuned to be better at following instructions based on a set of examples. In the case of the NEU and MIT research, the model is fine-tuned to "erase" specific concepts from its output based on descriptions of those concepts.
So, in both cases, the approach is similar: Start with a pre-trained model, then adapt it to meet specific requirements. This approach is becoming increasingly common in AI research because it offers a good balance between performance and efficiency.

Erasing Concepts from Diffusion Models
Project Website | Arxiv Preprint | Fine-tuned Weights | Demo

Motivated by recent advancements in text-to-image diffusion, we study erasure of specific concepts from the model's weights. While Stable Diffusion has shown promise in producing explicit or realistic artwork, it has raised concerns regarding its potential for misuse. We propose a fine-tuning method that can erase a visual concept from a pre-trained diffusion model, given only the name of the style and using negative guidance as a teacher. We benchmark our method against previous approaches that remove sexually explicit content and demonstrate its effectiveness, performing on par with Safe Latent Diffusion and censored training.

To evaluate artistic style removal, we conduct experiments erasing five modern artists from the network and conduct a user study to assess the human perception of the removed styles. Unlike previous methods, our approach can remove concepts from a diffusion model permanently rather than modifying the output at the inference time, so it cannot be circumvented even if a user has access to model weights

Given only a short text description of an undesired visual concept and no additional data, our method fine-tunes model weights to erase the targeted concept. Our method can avoid NSFW content, stop imitation of a specific artist's style, or even erase a whole object class from model output, while preserving the model's behavior and capabilities on other topics.

Fine-tuned Weights

It's the same project. Training Guide
After installation, follow these instructions to train a custom ESD model:

cd stable-diffusion to the main repository of stable-diffusion
[IMPORTANT] Edit train-script/train-esd.py and change the default argparser values according to your convenience (especially the config paths)
To choose train_method, pick from following 'xattn','noxattn', 'selfattn', 'full'
python train-scripts/train-esd.py --prompt 'your prompt' --train_method 'your choice of training' --devices '0,1'
Note that the default argparser values must be changed!

The optimization process for erasing undesired visual concepts from pre-trained diffusion model weights involves using a short text description of the concept as guidance. The ESD model is fine-tuned with the conditioned and unconditioned scores obtained from frozen SD model to guide the output away from the concept being erased. The model learns from it's own knowledge to steer the diffusion process away from the undesired concept.


Generating Images
To generate images from one of the custom models use the following instructions:

To use eval-scripts/generate-images.py you would need a csv file with columns prompt, evaluation_seed and case_number. (Sample data in data/)
To generate multiple images per prompt use the argument num_samples. It is default to 10.
The path to model can be customised in the script.
It is to be noted that the current version requires the model to be in saved in stable-diffusion/compvis-<based on hyperparameters>/diffusers-<based on hyperparameters>.pt

Fixing Hallucination with Knowledge Bases
Large Language Models (LLMs) have a data freshness problem. Even some of the most powerful models, like GPT-4, have no idea about recent events.

The world, according to LLMs, is frozen in time. They only know the world as it appeared through their training data.

That creates problems for any use case that relies on up-to-date information or a particular dataset. For example, you may have internal company documents you'd like to interact with via an LLM.

The first challenge is adding those documents to the LLM, we could try training the LLM on these documents, but this is time-consuming and expensive. And what happens when a new document is added? Training for every new document added is beyond inefficient — it is simply impossible.

So, how do we handle this problem? We can use retrieval augmentation. This technique allows us to retrieve relevant information from an external knowledge base and give that information to our LLM.

The external knowledge base is our "window" into the world beyond the LLM's training data. In this chapter, we will learn all about implementing retrieval augmentation for LLMs using LangChain.


Creating the Knowledge Base
We have two primary types of knowledge for LLMs. The parametric knowledge refers to everything the LLM learned during training and acts as a frozen snapshot of the world for the LLM.

The second type of knowledge is source knowledge. This knowledge covers any information fed into the LLM via the input prompt. When we talk about retrieval augmentation, we're talking about giving the LLM valuable source knowledge.

The article discusses the challenge of keeping Large Language Models (LLMs), like GPT-4, updated with recent events or new data. As it stands, LLMs are frozen in time; they only know the world up until the point when their training data ends. This issue causes difficulties when you want to use the LLM with recent data or specific datasets, such as internal company documents.
One potential solution to this problem is to train the LLM on new documents every time they're created, but this approach is time-consuming, expensive, and unrealistic for frequent updates.
A more feasible solution, as the article suggests, is retrieval augmentation. This technique involves using an external knowledge base that provides the LLM with updated information beyond its original training data.
There are two primary types of knowledge for LLMs:
Parametric knowledge
: This is the information that the LLM learned during its training, which essentially provides a frozen snapshot of the world at the time of training.
Source knowledge
: This is the information that is provided to the LLM via the input prompt.
Retrieval augmentation works by supplying the LLM with valuable source knowledge from the external knowledge base, thus giving the LLM access to the most current information. The tool mentioned, LangChain, is used for implementing this retrieval augmentation process.
In essence, retrieval augmentation serves as a "window" into the world beyond the LLM's training data, enabling the model to stay updated with recent events or new data.

While the "Erasing Concepts from Diffusion Models" and "Fixing Hallucination with Knowledge Bases" address different issues in the field of AI, both discussions revolve around the idea of enhancing pretrained models and managing their limitations.
In the first discussion, the limitation addressed is the pretrained model's knowledge of undesirable concepts or contents. The proposed solution is to fine-tune the model to erase these concepts, which can be a specific artistic style, explicit content, or any other undesired feature. The idea is to curate the model's knowledge in a way that is appropriate for its intended application.
In the second discussion, the limitation is that Large Language Models (LLMs) are unaware of recent events or any new information after their training period. The solution proposed is to use retrieval augmentation, a method of updating an LLM's knowledge by connecting it to an external knowledge base.
Both discussions underline the importance of fine-tuning and adapting models to make them suitable for their intended applications and to handle the evolving nature of information. They also emphasize that while pretrained models are powerful tools, they still require careful management and updates to ensure they remain effective and appropriate.

Sure, here's a summary of our discussion:
We started with a discussion of the research paper about the LIMA project, which demonstrated that by fine-tuning a strong pretrained language model on 1,000 carefully curated examples, competitive results could be achieved. However, the paper acknowledged the significant mental effort involved in constructing such examples and the limitations in the robustness of the LIMA approach.
We then discussed a paper from NEU and MIT, which proposed a method for erasing a single concept from a pretrained text-to-image generative model, called Stable Diffusion. The goal was to prevent the model from generating inappropriate or explicit content. Despite efforts to filter such content during training, some undesirable content was still produced, highlighting the challenge of fully controlling AI model outputs.
We also talked about a fine-tuning method developed by the same research team, which aimed to erase a specific visual concept or artist's style from a pretrained diffusion model. This method, called Erased Stable Diffusion (ESD), performed well compared to previous methods, offering a more robust solution for removing undesired content.
Finally, we discussed an article about Large Language Models (LLMs) and their limitations concerning data freshness. The article proposed using retrieval augmentation to address this issue, which involves retrieving relevant information from an external knowledge base and incorporating it into the LLM's knowledge. This technique provides a way to supplement the frozen knowledge of an LLM with more current information.
All these discussions revolved around the theme of fine-tuning and improving AI models to handle their limitations, whether that's inappropriate or undesirable content, specific concepts, or outdated information.

Data Feedback Loops: Model-driven 
Amplif i cation of Dataset Biases

Abstract 
Datasets scraped from the internet have been critical to the successes of large-scale machine 
learning. Yet, this very success puts the utility of future internet-derived datasets at potential 
risk, as model outputs begin to replace human annotations as a source of supervision. 
In this work, we i rst formalize a system where interactions with one model are recorded as 
history and scraped as training data in the future. We then analyze its stability over time by 
tracking changes to a test-time bias statistic (e.g. gender bias of model predictions). We i nd 
that the degree of bias amplif i cation is closely linked to whether the model's outputs behave 
like samples from the training distribution, a behavior which we characterize and def i ne 
as consistent calibration. Experiments in three conditional prediction scenarios - image 
classif i cation, visual role-labeling, and language generation - demonstrate that models that 
exhibit a sampling-like behavior are more calibrated and thus more stable. Based on this 
insight, we propose an intervention to help calibrate and stabilize unstable feedback systems. 
Code is available at https://github.com/rtaori/data_feedback. 
1Introduction 
Due to the successes of large-scale training in machine learning [27, 5, 48, 53], datasets derived from publicly 
available internet data have become indispensable to the machine learning community. For example, without 
relying on internet-scale collection, it would be cost-prohibitive to manually construct key datasets such as 
ImageNet [9], The Pile [16], or YFCC100M [64]. While the internet has served as a large, easily-accessible 
source of human generated data in the past, the growing deployment of machine learning systems puts this 
procedure at risk. As models begin to create and annotate a signif i cant fraction of internet content, the utility 
of the internet as a data source may decrease rapidly. 
As an example in visual role-labeling, consider a classif i er trained on public photos and their associated tags 
[68], as depicted in Figure 1. Instead of manually tagging photos, some users may instead choose to auto-tag 
their photos with the model's predictions. These photos, now stored in internet history, may be scraped as 
training data for an updated iteration of the image-tagging model. Any systematic biases introduced by the 
model, such as consistently mislabeling female doctors as nurses as in Figure 1, are now encoded into the 
training data. This data feedback gradually degrades the quality of the internet as a data source, since sources 
of supervision become driven by model outputs rather than human annotation. 
These issues have already been encountered. Worried over their machine translation model training on its own 
online translations, Google researchers started watermarking model outputs to mitigate feedback risk [65]. 
Similar concerns have been raised in situations where model predictions may exacerbate existing toxicity, 
harm, or other biases [17, 70]. In such cases, a viable strategy for model developers is to weigh the benef i t 
of updating their model to new internet content versus the cost of amplifying biases via such model-induced 
feedback. However, it is not yet understood when and to what degree data feedback is an issue in practice. 
In this work, we def i ne the data feedback setting and carefully study how model biases change under feedback. 
In particular, we ask: Are there conditions that stabilize bias amplif i cation? We answer this in the aff i rmative, 
i nding that one crucial path to achieving stability guarantees is having a consistently calibrated training 
procedure - one that produces models with a bias similar to its training distribution. Furthermore, this form of 
calibration can be realistically achieved in natural experimental settings. Specif i cally, models that behave like 
samplers (i.e. replicate their training distribution well) are more likely to be calibrated and thus more stable. In

Figure 1: A simple example illustrating data feedback in practice. An image-tagging model is 
trained on a large image dataset from the internet. Some users choose to auto-tag new images 
with the model's predictions and post them online, while others continue to manually tag their 
images. After some time, the model deployer may choose to update their model by re-scraping 
the internet and re-training the model on the newly scraped data, which now includes feedback 
from previous model predictions. 
addition, many prediction algorithms that do not explicitly perform sampling, such as image classif i ers, fulf i ll 
this behavior through a conjectured phenomenon called Distributional Generalization [42].

This paper, "Data Feedback Loops: Model-driven Amplification of Dataset Biases" by Rohan Taori and Tatsunori B. Hashimoto, discusses a key challenge in machine learning: the risk of amplifying biases through feedback loops when datasets are derived from model outputs, rather than human annotations.
As AI models start generating and annotating a significant fraction of internet content, the data used to train these models might increasingly reflect the biases of the models themselves, rather than the diversity and complexity of human understanding. The paper calls this phenomenon data feedback, where the outputs of a model become the inputs to the same or similar models in future iterations, creating a loop that could amplify any biases the model might have.
In this system, biases introduced by a model can become encoded into the training data, leading to a gradual degradation of the quality of the internet as a data source. An example provided in the paper is an image-tagging model that systematically mislabels female doctors as nurses; these mislabelled images could then be scraped and used as training data for future iterations of the model, perpetuating and amplifying the bias.
The paper's authors propose consistently calibrated training as a possible solution to this issue. By ensuring that a model's biases are similar to those in its training distribution, bias amplification can be minimized.
The problem this paper identifies can be linked to the earlier discussions on improving and fine-tuning AI models. As models become more sophisticated and are used more widely, it's crucial to be aware of the potential pitfalls and challenges that might arise, such as the amplification of biases through data feedback loops. It underscores the importance of ethical considerations and the need for solutions to mitigate potential issues in AI technology.

Formally, we quantify the stability of data feedback with a bias metricφ(x, ˆ y), whereˆ y = ft(x)are predictions 
from the model at timet. For example, the predictionsˆ yrepresent image tags or sentence completions given a 
prompt, and the corresponding bias metricsφrepresent gender bias in the predicted tags or toxicity of the 
generated text. Our theoretical result shows that if the trained models do not increase bias by more than error 
δ, then the total amount of bias amplif i cation is bounded by 
m+k 
m δ, wheremandkrefer to the number of new 
human-annotated samples and model-annotated samples respectively. Thus both a smaller calibration errorδ 
and a higher fraction of human-annotated samplesmcontribute to the global stability of data feedback loops. 
The rest of the paper is organized as follows. In Section 3, we def i ne the data feedback setting in more detail. 
We then describe a specif i c notion of calibration (consistent calibration), discuss its connection to sampling, 
and show how it gives rise to bounds on bias amplif i cation in Section 4. Section 5 demonstrates the utility of 
these predictions empirically in three different natural experiment settings: 
1.First, we def i ne a simple data feedback setting in CIFAR [34], where the label distribution is skewed 
and data feedback has the potential to amplify label shift. In this case, we show that the feedback 
dynamics are stable and consistent with our theoretical predictions. 
2.Next, we show that data feedback can signif i cantly amplify gender biases in a visual semantic role 
labeling task [69]. Our bounds predict that the dynamics may be unstable since the initial calibration 
error is large, which is consistent with gender bias amplif i cation identif i ed in earlier work [70]. 
3.Third, we examine data feedback for language generation on a toxic prompts dataset [17] and 
demonstrate that toxicity and repetition amplify, with sampling-based generation schemes enjoying 
substantially higher stability than beam search methods. 
Finally, to conclude Section 5, we design an intervention to stabilize beam search methods by leveraging the 
sampling-like behavior of interpolating classif i ers [42]. To do this, we train a language model that overf i ts to 
its training set and observe that this procedure signif i cantly stabilizes the model's toxicity and repetition. 
2Related work 
Performative prediction.The general problem of model-induced feedback in machine learning has been 
previously studied as performative prediction and strategic classif i cation [47, 24], where future data distri- 
butions can change arbitrarily in response to the deployed model. In this context, existing work has focused 
on methods that optimize towards local or global equilibria of the system [4, 31, 41]. The generality of 
the problem setting allows for complex human interactions in-the-loop; however, it is for this reason that 
2 
experimental evaluation has been limited, and most analyses and experiments have focused on simple models 
such as linear policies with Gaussian data [31, 41]. 
In contrast, motivated by the image tagging example in Section 1, we consider a more restricted form of 
feedback, in which new data examples are gathered only from either the "true" human-annotated distribution 
or predictions of the currently deployed model. This restriction allows us to analyze feedback stability in more 
realistic experimental settings and derive bounds on stability. 
Recommendation systems.Our work is also closely aligned with the study of feedback loops in recom- 
mendation systems [58, 55]. In this context, existing work has shown that optimizing strictly for ranking 
metrics such as accuracy can create echo chambers, where minority populations are crowded out and disengage 
from the platform [26, 32]. This issue arises due to the tension between improving ranking metrics and 
considerations of bias, fairness, or diversity [59, 6]. 
In Section 5.1, we show that a similar phenomenon exists in data feedback: retraining classif i ers with future 
data improves classif i cation accuracy, but at the cost of increasing its bias. In the recommendation literature, 
one possible successful mitigation strategy is the use of recommendations that are calibrated in proportion 
to user interests [59]. Similarly, our work also heavily relies on the calibration of the model's predictions to 
ensure the stability of data feedback. 
Bias amplif i cation.Machine learning models have a tendency to amplify at test-time biases that exist in 
their training data, a problem known as bias amplif i cation [12, 38, 22]. For example, image classif i ers have 
skewed gender predictions, beyond what exists in the training data [70, 66]. In our work, we build on this 
literature by studying the multi-step amplif i cation of bias via feedback. 
Additional discussion relating to semi-supervised learning and domain adaptation can be found in Appendix A.

This section of the paper delves deeper into the mechanisms of bias amplification and introduces a new metric for measuring bias, known as φ(x, ˆ y), where ˆ y = ft(x) are predictions from the model at time t. Bias metrics φ can represent various forms of bias, such as gender bias in predicted tags or toxicity of generated text.
The authors propose a formula to bound the total amount of bias amplification, which is influenced by the calibration error δ (the difference between the model's bias and the bias in the training data) and the ratio of new human-annotated samples to model-annotated samples.
The authors demonstrate the utility of these predictions in three different natural experiment settings:
Data feedback in the CIFAR dataset, where feedback dynamics were stable and consistent with theoretical predictions.
Data feedback amplifying gender biases in a visual semantic role labeling task. The authors found that the initial calibration error was large, which resulted in unstable dynamics and significant amplification of gender bias.
Data feedback for language generation on a toxic prompts dataset, where toxicity and repetition amplify. They found that sampling-based generation schemes were substantially more stable than beam search methods.
In conclusion, the authors design an intervention to stabilize beam search methods by leveraging the sampling-like behavior of interpolating classifiers. They do this by training a language model that overfits to its training set, which significantly stabilizes the model's toxicity and repetition.
The paper also provides context by discussing related work in performative prediction and strategic classification, recommendation systems, and bias amplification.
The discussion in this paper is relevant to the broader conversation about improving AI models because it provides a concrete strategy for measuring and managing bias amplification in data feedback loops. By understanding how these loops can perpetuate and amplify biases, we can develop more effective strategies to mitigate bias in AI systems.

Our work considers feedback effects in the conditional prediction setting. In the standard conditional prediction

∼ P0.P0represents 
a i xed human-annotated example distribution (e.g. human-tagged 
images or human-written prompts and sentence completions). Motivated by the example in Figure 1 where the 
dataset changes over time, we instead consider a series of supervised learning problems from timet = 0...∞. 
At each time t, we learn a new model ftusing the latest available internet data. 
The series of supervised learning problems are def i ned by the following. Att = 0, before any data feedback, 
only clean human-annotated samples are available on the internet. Thus, the initial modelf0is trained onn0

we assume that data on the internet grows in two ways. Humans naturally continue to interact 
with the internet and generate data, creatingmnew samples following the original distributionP0. Anotherk 
samples are generated by humans interacting with the newest modelft−1(e.g. users auto-tag their new images

One important aspect of the data feedback setting is that all covariates are sampled from the same distribution

This section defines the feedback effects in the conditional prediction setting, which is a key concept of this paper. In the standard conditional prediction or supervised learning framework, the goal is to learn a function f : X → Y from a collection of samples drawn from a fixed human-annotated example distribution, denoted P0.
The paper then defines a series of supervised learning problems. At time t = 0, before any data feedback has occurred, only clean human-annotated samples are available. As time progresses, the model ft is trained using new data from the internet.
For any time t ≥ 1, new data on the internet is assumed to come from two sources: humans naturally interacting with the internet and generating new data, and humans interacting with the newest model ft-1. These two sources of data are then used to update the model ft.
The overall goal is to analyze the behavior of ft over time, with a focus on bias amplification. This is measured by a bias statistic φ : X × Y → R. Amplification is measured as the expected difference between the bias of the initial, human-annotated distribution P0 and the bias of the predictions of the model ft.
The authors also discuss the importance of the assumption that all covariates are sampled from the same distribution P0(x), which remains fixed over time. While this simplifies the analysis, it poses tradeoffs, as retraining classifiers with future data improves classification accuracy but at the cost of increasing bias.

4Stabilizing bias amplif i cation 
In this section, we develop theoretical tools that will allow us to make predictions about bias amplif i cation in 
experimental settings. We begin with a toy example illustrating how good samplers lead to calibration in Sec- 
tion 4.1, show how calibration leads to feedback stability via bounds on bias amplif i cation in Section 4.2, and 
i nally discuss prior work showing when calibration naturally arises in experimental situations in Section 4.3. 
4.1Illustrative example 
We begin by expanding our example in Figure 1 to illustrate how data feedback may become unstable. Consider 
a set of images of female healthcare workers with high inherent uncertainty - they could each be either a 
doctor or a nurse, depending on context cues that are not present in the image (Figure 2 left). In this case, data 
feedback on a dataset with twice as many nurses as doctors can rapidly destabilize. 
More concretely, any Bayes optimal classif i er would predict new examples only as nurse, as nurses are the 
majority class and the image is indistinguishable otherwise. Such a model would exacerbate the nurse bias in 
the dataset, illustrating how data feedback may amplify biases (Figure 2 top). A natural solution solution to 
this problem would be to predict nurses and doctors at a rate equal to the original distribution. Specif i cally, a 
sampling-based model trained to reproduce the training distribution would exhibit this behavior, continuing to 
label a random 
2 
3 of the examples as nurses and maintaining the level of nurse bias in the dataset (Figure 2 
bottom). 
A training algorithm that produces models whose outputs match the bias of the training distribution is said 
to be consistently calibrated, and we will formally def i ne how calibration relates to stability in the following 
section. 
4.2Achieving stability through calibration 
Setup and goals.We i rst def i ne a few objects that will be used in our stability analysis. We call the number 
of training samples at timetasnt:= nt−1+ m + k = n0+ t(m + k). A mixture of past training data, new

Figure 2: A toy example illustrating that models that reproduce the training distribution well 
will experience limited feedback effects. Suppose a dataset contains only indistinguishable 
examples and slightly over-represents nurses (left). A Bayes-optimal classif i er would label new 
examples all as nurses, since it is the majority class; this would exacerbate the nurse bias in the 
dataset, illustrating the potential harm of data feedback (top). In contrast, a model that behaves 
like a sampler would maintain the dataset nurse ratio during prediction, thus stabilizing any 
feedback effects (bottom). Images are taken from the imSitu dataset [69]. 
For ease of analysis in this section, we study the case where the datasetStis 
drawn fresh from its corresponding 
distribution Ptat every timestep. Thus the datasets are drawn as St∼ Pnt

where the left hand side is written using the shorthandPφ := E(x,y)∼P[φ(x,y)], def i ned as expectation of the 
bias metric φ over distribution P. 
Calibration.In the previous nurses versus doctors example, we discovered that a model that faithfully 
represented the training data distribution was more stable under data feedback. Now, we formalize what it 
means to faithfully represent the data distribution: We say a learning algorithm is consistently calibrated if the 
bias of samples annotated by the model is similar to the bias of samples in the training distribution. 
Def i nition 1(Consistent Calibration).A learning algorithmA:(X ×Y)n→ Fis 
(δ,φ,P(x),n)-consistently 
calibrated if, for any joint distribution Q(x,y) with marginal P(x), 
? ?ES∼Qn,f∼A(S)?Qφ −b 
Q(f)φ ?? ?≤ 
δ. 
If a learning algorithm is consistently calibrated, it means that in expectation, the bias of the trained model will 
be close to the dataset bias. Furthermore, it is important this condition holds for all joint distributions with the 
marginalP(x), since during data feedback the covariate marginal does not change, i.e.Pt(x) = P0(x)for all 
t. Thus, if we have a learning algorithmAthat is consistently calibrated with respect to the initial distribution 
P0(x),Awill also be consistently calibrated for allPt(x)during data feedback (formalized in Lemma E.1 in 
Appendix E). In fact, this property naturally arises in some settings, as discussed in the next subsection.

Theorem 1(Feedback Stability).LetA:(X × Y)n→ Fbe 
a (δn,φ,P0(x),n)-consistently calibrated 
learning algorithm, where calibration errorδnis a monotone non-increasing function of dataset sizen. Then,

The proof is provided in Appendix E. 
Surprisingly, the bound shows that data-driven feedback can be stable even in the limit oft → ∞. From 
inspecting the simplif i ed upper bound, it is clear that both a larger number of human-annotated examplesm 
and a smaller initial calibration errorδn0serve to stabilize the system and minimize bias amplif i cation. This 
leads to a natural question: in which situations can we expect a small consistent calibration error? 
Intuitively, models that behave like samplers will have low calibration error. In particular, suppose that model 
fthas accurately learned the conditional distribution ofPt, i.e.dTV(Pt(y|x),ft(y|x)) ≤ δ. Now, we perform 
a comparison of two prediction strategies commonly used in machine learning: samplingy ∼ ft(y|x)and 
argmax prediction y = argmaxyft(y|x). 
If labels are sampled,y ∼ ft(y|x), thendTV(Pt,bP(ft)) 
≤ δby 
def i nition, and softisδ-calibrated for 
any metricφby post-processing. Alternatively, if the top predictiony = argmaxyft(y|x)is used,ftis not 
necessarily guaranteed to be δ-calibrated for bias metric φ, similar to the example in Figure 2. 
While it is unsurprising that sampling maintains calibration and argmax predictions can sometimes be 
miscalibrated, prior work has made the surprising discovery that under certain conditions, models that do not 
explicitly perform sampling can still behave like samplers [42] and thus also provide feedback stability. 
4.3Achieving calibration through Distributional Generalization 
As in the example in Figure 2, when there is large uncertainty over the true labels (doctors versus nurses), one 
strategy for reducing bias is to sample according to the training distribution. Distributional Generalization 
(DG) [42] demonstrates that interpolating classif i ers, which are argmax predictors, behave similarly; when the 
model has high uncertainty over the true labels, it produces outputs that mimic the training distribution. 
Concretely, letL : X → [m]be a partioning of the input space intom ∈ Z+parts, where similar points with 
high uncertainty are grouped together. This partitioning "coarsens" the input space by mapping hard-to-learn 
regions to single points. DG i nds that at this level of coarseness, samples labeled by interpolating classif i ers 
look like samples from the training distribution, i.e.(L(x),f(x)) ≈ (L(x),y)[42]. 
That is, within a specif i c 
partition, the random process of drawing a samplexand labeling it with a deterministic classif i ery = f(x) 
produces a distribution similar to drawing x and then sampling a label from the true conditional y ∼ p(y|x). 
If the bias metricφwas applied over this coarsened space, we may expect feedback stability as a natural 
consequence of model outputs behaving like samples. We will now formalize this intuition by linking how a 
learning algorithm satisfying DG leads to consistent calibration. We i rst def i ne the input partioning from [42]. 
Def i nition 2(Distinguishable Feature [42]).LetL : X → [m]be 
a coarsening of the input domainXinto 
m ∈ Z+parts. 
Def i nebP(L)as 
the relabeling ofPbyL. Then,Lis a (δ,A,P(x),n)-distinguishable 
feature if 
PS∼b 
P(L)n,f∼A(S),x∼P(x) ?f(x) 
= L(x)? 
≥ 1 − δ. 
The partitioningLdef i nes how points inPare grouped together. An appropriate partioning is one where 
the learnerAcan 
classify the group identity of each point with high accuracy. Additionally, note that the 
coarseningLdoes not depend on the label distribution and relies only on the marginalP(x). This property 
is important for data feedback; ifLis distinguishable for the initial distributionP0, it will continue to be 
distinguishable for all Pt. 
Now that we have def i ned an appropriate partitioning, we can connect it to consistent calibration via DG. 
Lemma 4.1.Suppose that bias metricφis a function of a (δ,A,P(x),n)-distinguishable 
featureL, i.e. 
φ(x,y) = T(L(x),y)for some boundedT : [m] × Y → R. 
Then, under DG (Conjecture 1 in Appendix E.3), 
learning algorithm A is (δ, φ, P(x), n)-consistently calibrated. 
6 
The proof is provided in Appendix E.4. This lemma is an immediate consequence of DG (Conjecture 
1), which states that the coarsened model outputs(L(x),f(x))are similar to the coarsened training data 
(L(x),y)for all bounded testsT; this is the basis for the statement that model outputs behave like samples, i.e. 
(L(x),f(x)) ≈ (L(x),y). The given bias metric φ is simply one such test. 
This result shows that under DG, global stability can be achieved and bias amplif i cation is bounded by 
m+k 
m δn0 
for all time if the bias metric φ is a function of a δn0-distinguishable feature on the initial dataset. 
4.4Instantiating feedback upper bounds in experiments 
We have now seen two strategies for consistent calibration: 1) explicitly, through estimating the conditional 
distribution well and sampling outputs, and 2) implicitly through DG, where interpolating classif i ers provide 
guarantees as long as the bias metric is a function of a suff i ciently coarse statistic of the inputs. 
In these settings, one more condition is needed for Theorem 1 to apply - that calibration errorsδnare 
non-increasing with dataset sizen. Although not guaranteed, many learning algorithms and natural data 
distributions satisfy this property experimentally, especially if the model regularization is tuned [44], as in done 
in practice. We therefore believe it is a reasonable assumption to expect calibration error to be a monotone 
decreasing function of dataset size in most experimental situations. 
In the next section, we will explore how our derived predictions can help estimate bias amplif i cation in realistic 
data feedback settings. In order to instantiate the bound in Theorem 1, we need to know the initial consistent 
calibration errorδn0. As a practical approximation, we estimateδn0empirically via the calibration error of the 
initial modelf0. Although this empirical estimate is a lower bound on the consistent calibration error, we i nd 
that it is a useful guide, and we observe that the corresponding predictions from Theorem 1 still bound the 
empirical amplif i cation.

The text provides a deep examination of bias amplification in machine learning algorithms, developing theoretical tools to predict bias amplification in experimental settings. It discusses strategies for stabilization and achieving calibration.
Illustrative Example
: The authors illustrate a case with a dataset of indistinguishable female healthcare workers who could be either doctors or nurses. They highlight that a Bayes-optimal classifier would predict more nurses as nurses are the majority class, thereby exacerbating the existing bias in the dataset. They suggest a possible solution: to predict nurses and doctors at a rate equal to the original distribution. A sampling-based model trained to reproduce the training distribution would exhibit this behavior, hence maintaining the nurse-doctor ratio in the dataset.
Achieving Stability Through Calibration
: The paper emphasizes that consistently calibrated models - those that reproduce the bias of the training data distribution - are more stable under data feedback. The paper introduces a few definitions and a theorem (Feedback Stability) showing that data-driven feedback can be stable even as t → ∞, with larger numbers of human-annotated examples and a smaller initial calibration error helping to stabilize the system.
Achieving Calibration Through Distributional Generalization
: The text discusses the concept of Distributional Generalization (DG), where interpolating classifiers (which are argmax predictors) behave like sampling-based models when the model has high uncertainty over the true labels. By coarsening the input space and grouping hard-to-learn regions to single points, interpolating classifiers produce outputs that mimic the training distribution.
Instantiating Feedback Upper Bounds in Experiments
: The paper concludes that there are two strategies for consistent calibration: explicitly through estimating the conditional distribution well and implicitly through DG. It's noted that the calibration error needs to be a non-increasing function of the dataset size, which is often the case in practice. The paper suggests that, in the next section, they will explore how these derived predictions can help estimate bias amplification in realistic data feedback settings.
The language and concepts in this text are quite complex, suggesting it's targeted towards an audience with a strong understanding of machine learning theory, bias, and calibration.

Ablations.In Appendix D.3, we run experimental ablations, varying the data feedback variablesmandk 
and training GPT-2 medium and large models. We observe that the takeaways remain the same: beam search 
amplif i es repetition bias much more compared to the nucleus sampling or toxicity bias settings. 
An intervention to stabilize toxicity and repetition bias. 
We now test our understanding of bias amplif i cation by designing an intervention to mitigate amplif i cation for 
beam search models. Leveraging the claim in Distributional Generalization that interpolating models behave 
like samplers over a coarsened dataset, we test whether the repetition bias of language models under beam 
search can be mitigated by overf i tting the model with the goal of making it interpolate the training data. 
Our intervention is simple: we i netune the GPT2-small model for5times the number of training epochs as 
before. Whereas previously the training loss was3.5at round0, it was reduced to0.4by the intervention, and 
the test set perplexity jumped from32to599due to overf i tting. Similar to the non-overf i t counterpart, sentence 
completions from the model are generated via beam search, and all other experimental settings remain the 
same as in Figure 5. 12 
In Figure 6, we show the results of the intervention. Overf i tting signif i cantly improves the stability of the beam 
search model. In particular, the average number of quotes output by the i nal model is reduced from5.7to0.8, 
which is closer to the nucleus sampling level at0.6. In addition, the relative amplif i cation was also reduced, as 
the i nal overf i t beam search model was only1.4×as 
repetitive as the initial model, down from a2.3×relative 
amplif i cation before the intervention. Sample outputs of all three models are provided in Appendix B.3. 
While overf i tting may match the frequency of punctuations, it may do so by memorizing the training data. 
To test this, we measure the copy rate of model generations by calculating the overlap between5-grams 
of the model outputs and its training data, measured at round0without any data feedback. For the overf i t 
beam search model,25%of model output 5-grams exist in the training data, while the rate was11%for the 
non-overf i t beam search model and2%for the nucleus sampling model. Thus, while it may be that the overf i t 
model is less diverse than the original models, it is still not simply memorizing and returning the training data. 
While it is an open question whether such interpolating language models can be useful for real-world 
applications, our experimental results are consistent with our earlier theoretical characterizations of stability 
and suggest that approaches for improving calibration may be broadly useful for mitigating bias amplif i cation. 
6Conclusion 
Large-scale machine learning and datasets scraped from the internet have been critical to many recent successes, 
yet this very success puts the utility of future internet-derived datasets at risk, as model outputs begin to replace 
human annotations and degrade the quality of internet data. 
To study this tradeoff, we propose a new setting called data feedback, where past model outputs inf l uence 
training data in the future. We show that the natural decision to retrain a deployed model can increase 
utility while also amplifying biases. We then provide conditions for stability (namely, consistent calibration) 
and derive corresponding upper bounds on bias amplif i cation. The utility of these predictions is realized 
by experiments in image classif i cation, visual role-labeling, and language modeling, which conf i rm the 
observation that sampling-like behaviors often result in better calibration and greater feedback stability. Finally, 
we leverage our insight to design a mitigation strategy for unstable feedback systems. 
Our results have important consequences for anyone participating in the creation or use of online data. For 
model developers, our results can give upper bound predictions on the changes in model bias (or any other 
statistic). For those who consume predictions from machine learning systems, our results provide the initial 
groundwork for understanding how their interactions may change the systems they use over time. 
7Future work 
Future work may extend the data feedback setting by relaxing some of its assumptions in order to more 
accurately model real-world dynamics. For example, considering exogenous distribution shifts over time in 
the human-labeled distributionP0is important for capturing changing human behavior. Another extension 
would be incorporating human-in-the-loop selection criteria for samples which are posted back online, as 
not all model-labeled samples are recorded on the internet. Finally, one may consider data feedback loops 
occurring between multiple different neural systems, such as the outputs of a machine translation system being 
used as inputs for an image-text similarity model. 
Work on potential mitigation strategies for unstable data feedback systems is also important. Watermarking 
model outputs [65, 60] is one strategy for avoiding feedback from previous model-labeled samples. Developing 
more effective i lters, such as powerful discriminators that can detect between artif i cially generated and human- 
created content [19], is another fruitful direction. Lastly, work on developing training algorithms that are 
consistently calibrated [22, 35] is a crucial component to ensure feedback stability in the wild.

This extract discusses a study into the concept of "data feedback" in machine learning, specifically its application and potential risks in the context of language modeling. Data feedback refers to the scenario where outputs from previous model runs are used as inputs for subsequent model training. This is a common practice, particularly in settings where models are continuously updated, but it can lead to certain issues, such as amplification of biases.
In their research, the authors performed experimental ablations on the GPT-2 medium and large models, exploring how different configurations influenced the output of the models. A key observation was that beam search amplified biases more than nucleus sampling or toxicity bias settings. This led to an experiment to design an intervention to mitigate these amplified biases in beam search models.
The intervention consisted of overfitting the GPT-2 small model by fine-tuning it for five times the number of training epochs. Overfitting led to an improved stability of the beam search model, reducing repetition and toxicity bias. However, the overfit model did appear to show signs of memorizing the training data, evidenced by an increase in the overlap of 5-grams between the model outputs and its training data.
Despite these findings, the authors state it's still an open question whether such overfit, interpolating language models can be useful in real-world applications. Nevertheless, their experiments support the theory that maintaining calibration may be a useful strategy to mitigate bias amplification in data feedback scenarios.
The authors conclude by highlighting the importance of understanding data feedback mechanisms for anyone involved in the creation or use of online data. They suggest future work may focus on relaxing certain assumptions in the data feedback setting to more closely mirror real-world dynamics, such as exogenous distribution shifts over time or feedback loops between multiple neural systems. They also suggest potential mitigation strategies for unstable data feedback systems, including watermarking model outputs, developing powerful discriminators, and improving training algorithms for consistent calibration.

Plenoxels: Radiance Fields without Neural Networks

Abstract 
We introduce Plenoxels (plenoptic voxels), a system for 
photorealistic view synthesis. Plenoxels represent a scene as 
a sparse 3D grid with spherical harmonics. This representa- 
tion can be optimized from calibrated images via gradient 
methods and regularization without any neural components. 
On standard, benchmark tasks, Plenoxels are optimized two 
orders of magnitude faster than Neural Radiance Fields with 
no loss in visual quality. For video and code, please see

1. Introduction 
A recent body of research has capitalized on implicit, 
coordinate-based neural networks as the 3D representation 
to optimize 3D volumes from calibrated 2D image super- 
vision. In particular, Neural Radiance Fields (NeRF) [26] 
demonstrated photorealistic novel viewpoint rendering, cap- 
turing scene geometry as well as view-dependent effects. 
This impressive quality, however, requires extensive com- 
putation time for both training and rendering, with training 
lasting more than a day and rendering requiring 30 sec- 
onds per frame, on a single GPU. Multiple subsequent pa- 
pers [8,9,19,35,36,56] reduced this computational cost, 
particularly for rendering, but single GPU training still re- 
quires multiple hours, a bottleneck that limits the practical 
application of photorealistic volumetric reconstruction. 
In this paper, we show that we can train a radiance i eld 
from scratch, without neural networks, while maintaining 
NeRF quality and reducing optimization time by two orders 
of magnitude. We provide a custom CUDA [29] implemen- 
tation that capitalizes on the model simplicity to achieve 
substantial speedups. Our typical optimization time on a 
single Titan RTX GPU is 11 minutes on bounded scenes 
(compared to roughly 1 day for NeRF, more than a100× 
speedup) and 27 minutes on unbounded scenes (compared

We call our model Plenoxel for plenoptic volume elements, 
as it consists of a sparse voxel grid in which each voxel stores 
opacity and spherical harmonic coeff i cients. These coeff i- 
cients are interpolated to model the full plenoptic function 
continuously in space. To achieve high resolution on a single 
GPU, we prune empty voxels and follow a coarse to i ne 
optimization strategy. Although our core model is a bounded 
voxel grid, we can model unbounded scenes by using nor- 
malized device coordinates (for forward-facing scenes) or 
by surrounding our grid with multisphere images to encode 
the background (for 360◦scenes). 
Our method reveals that photorealistic volumetric recon- 
struction can be approached using standard tools from in- 
verse problems: a data representation, a forward model, a 
regularization function, and an optimizer. Our method shows 
that each of these components can be simple and state of 
the art results can still be achieved. Our experiments suggest 
the key element of Neural Radiance Fields is not the neural 
network but the differentiable volumetric renderer.

The authors introduce Plenoxels (plenoptic voxels), a system for photorealistic view synthesis that represents a scene as a sparse 3D grid with spherical harmonics. This approach is advantageous because it can be optimized from calibrated images using gradient methods and regularization without needing any neural network components.
In comparison to Neural Radiance Fields (NeRF), Plenoxels are optimized two orders of magnitude faster without any loss in visual quality. NeRF, which represents 3D volumes from calibrated 2D image supervision using implicit, coordinate-based neural networks, has been praised for its ability to render photorealistic novel viewpoints, capturing scene geometry as well as view-dependent effects. However, its extensive computational time for both training and rendering is a limitation.
The authors state that Plenoxels can be trained from scratch, without neural networks, while maintaining NeRF quality and significantly reducing optimization time. The implementation, done in CUDA, achieves substantial speedups, with the typical optimization time being 11 minutes on bounded scenes and 27 minutes on unbounded scenes on a single Titan RTX GPU. This is compared to roughly 1 day for NeRF and 4 days for NeRF++ respectively.

rendering are voxel grids [6,13,20,41-43,51] and multi- 
plane images (MPIs) [25,32,46,47,55,59]. Voxel grids are 
capable of representing arbitrary topologies but can be mem- 
ory limited at high resolution. One approach for reducing 
the memory requirement for voxel grids is to encode hier- 
archical structure, for instance using octrees [11,38,50,52] 
(see [16] for a survey); we use an even simpler sparse array 
structure. Using these grid-based representations combined 
with some form of interpolation produces a continuous repre- 
sentation that can be arbitrarily resized using standard signal 
processing methods (see [30] for reference). This combi- 
nation of sparsity and interpolation enables even a simple 
grid-based model to represent 3D scenes at high resolution 
without prohibitive memory requirements. We combine this 
classical sampling and interpolation paradigm with the for- 
ward volume rendering formula introduced by Max [22] 
(based on work from Kajiya and Von Herzen [12] and used 
in NeRF) to directly optimize a 3D model from indirect 2D 
observations. We further extend these classical approaches 
by modeling view dependence, which we accomplish by 
optimizing spherical harmonic coeff i cients for each color 
channel at each voxel. Spherical harmonics are a standard 
basis for functions over the sphere, and have been used pre- 
viously to represent view dependence [3,34,45,56]. 
Neural Volume Reconstruction.Recently, dramatic im- 
provements in neural volume reconstruction have renewed 
interestinthisdirection.Neuralimplicitrepresentationswere 
i rst used to model occupancy [5,21,24] and signed distance 
to an object's surface [31,48], and perform novel view syn- 
thesis from 3D point clouds [1,17,40,54]. Several papers 
extended this idea of neural implicit 3D modeling to model 
a scene using only calibrated 2D image supervision via a 
differentiable volume rendering formulation [20,26,43,44]. 
NeRF [26] in particular uses a differentiable volume ren- 
dering formula to train a coordinate-based multilayer per- 
ceptron (MLP) to directly predict color and opacity from 3D 
position and 2D viewing direction. NeRF produces impres- 
sive results but requires several days for full training, and 
about half an minute to render a full image, because every 
rendered pixel requires evaluating the coordinate-based MLP 
at hundreds of sample locations along the corresponding ray. 
Many papers have since extended the capabilities of NeRF, 
including modeling the background in360◦views [57] and 
incorporating anti-aliasing for multiscale rendering [2]. We 
extend our Plenoxel method to unbounded360◦scenes using 
a background model inspired by NeRF++ [57]. 
Of these methods, Neural Volumes [20] is the most simi- 
lar to ours in that it uses a voxel grid with interpolation, but 
optimizes this grid through a convolutional neural network 
and applies a learned warping function to improve the ef- 
fective resolution (of a1283grid). We show that the voxel 
grid can be optimized directly and high resolution can be 
achieved by pruning and coarse to i ne optimization, without 
any neural networks or warping functions. 
Accelerating NeRF.In light of the substantial computa- 
tional requirements of NeRF for both training and rendering, 
many recent papers have proposed methods to improve eff i- 
ciency, particularly for rendering. Among these methods are 
many that achieve speedup by subdividing the 3D volume 
into regions that can be processed more eff i ciently [19,35]. 
Other speedup approaches have focused on a range of com- 
putational and pre- or post-processing methods to remove 
bottlenecks in the original NeRF formulation. JAXNeRF [7], 
a JAX [4] reimplementation of NeRF offers a speedup for 
both training and rendering via parallelization across many 
GPUs or TPUs. AutoInt [18] restructures the coordinate- 
based MLP to compute ray integrals exactly, for more than 
10×faster 
rendering with a small loss in quality. Learned 
Initializations [49] employs meta-learning on many scenes to 
start from a better MLP initialization, for both> 10×faster 
training and better priors when per-scene data is limited. 
Other methods [14,27,33] achieve speedup by predicting a 
surface or sampling near the surface, reducing the number 
of samples necessary for rendering each ray. 
Another approach is to pretrain a NeRF (or similar model) 
and then extract it into a different data structure that can 
support fast inference [8,9,36,56]. In particular, PlenOc- 
trees [56] extracts a NeRF variant into a sparse voxel grid 
in which each voxel represents view-dependent color us-

ing octrees. This allows for faster rendering while maintaining high-quality results. Our Plenoxel method follows a similar approach of using a sparse voxel grid, but without relying on neural networks or octrees.
Overall, our Plenoxel approach is distinct from classical volume reconstruction methods and neural volume reconstruction methods like NeRF. We demonstrate that explicit volumetric representation and direct optimization, without neural networks, can achieve photorealistic results with significant speed improvements. Our method offers a simple and efficient alternative for volumetric reconstruction tasks.

ing spherical harmonic coeff i cients. Because the extracted 
PlenOctree can be further optimized, this method can speed 
up training by roughly3×, 
and because it uses an eff i cient 
GPU octree implementation without any MLP evaluations, 
it achieves> 3000×rendering speedup. Our method ex- 
tends PlenOctrees to perform end-to-end optimization of a 
sparse voxel representation with spherical harmonics, offer- 
ing much faster training (two orders of magnitude speedup 
compared to NeRF). Our Plenoxel model is a generalization 
of PlenOctrees to support sparse plenoptic voxel grids of 
arbitrary resolution (not necessary powers of two) with the 
ability to perform trilinear interpolation, which is easier to 
implement with this sparse voxel structure. 
3. Method 
Our model is a sparse voxel grid in which each occupied 
voxel corner stores a scalar opacityσand a vector of spheri- 
cal harmonic (SH) coeff i cients for each color channel. From 
here on we refer to this representation as Plenoxel. The opac- 
ity and color at an arbitrary position and viewing direction 
are determined by trilinearly interpolating the values stored 
at the neighboring voxels and evaluating the spherical har- 
monics at the appropriate viewing direction. Given a set of 
calibrated images, we optimize our model directly using the 
rendering loss on training rays. Our model is illustrated in 
Fig. 2 and described in detail below. 
3.1. Volume Rendering 
We use the same differentiable model for volume render- 
ing as in NeRF, where the color of a ray is approximated by 
integrating over samples taken along the ray: 
ˆ 
C(r) = 
N X 
i=1 Ti?1 
− exp(−σiδi)?ci(1) 
whereTi= exp  − 
i−1 
X 
j=1 
σjδj   
(2) 
Tirepresents how much light is transmitted through ray 
rto samplei(versus contributed by preceding samples), 
(1 − exp(−σiδi))denotes 
how much light is contributed 
by samplei,σidenotes the opacity of samplei, andci 
denotes the color of samplei, with distanceδito the next 
sample. Although this formula is not exact (it assumes single- 
scattering [12] and constant values between samples [22]), it 
is differentiable and enables updating the 3D model based 
on the error of each training ray. 
3.2. Voxel Grid with Spherical Harmonics 
Similar to PlenOctrees [56], we use a sparse voxel grid 
for our geometry model. However, for simplicity and ease 
of implementing trilinear interpolation, we do not use an 
octree for our data structure. Instead, we store a dense 3D 
index array with pointers into a separate data array con- 
taining values for occupied voxels only. Like PlenOctrees, 
each occupied voxel stores a scalar opacityσand a vector 
of spherical harmonic coeff i cients for each color channel. 
Spherical harmonics form an orthogonal basis for functions 
def i ned over the sphere, with low degree harmonics encoding 
smooth (more Lambertian) changes in color and higher de- 
gree harmonics encoding higher-frequency (more specular) 
effects. The color of a sampleciis simply the sum of these 
harmonic basis functions for each color channel, weighted 
by the corresponding optimized coeff i cients and evaluated 
3 
at the appropriate viewing direction. We use spherical har- 
monics of degree 2, which requires 9 coeff i cients per color 
channel for a total of 27 harmonic coeff i cients per voxel. 
We use degree 2 harmonics because PlenOctrees found that 
higher order harmonics confer only minimal benef i t. 
Our Plenoxel grid uses trilinear interpolation to def i ne a 
continuous plenoptic function throughout the volume. This 
is in contrast to PlenOctrees, which assumes that the opacity 
and spherical harmonic coeff i cients remain constant inside 
each voxel. This difference turns out to be an important 
factor in successfully optimizing the volume, as we discuss 
below. All coeff i cients (for opacity and spherical harmonics) 
are optimized directly, without any special initialization or 
pretraining with a neural network. 
3.3. Interpolation 
The opacity and color at each sample point along each 
ray are computed by trilinear interpolation of opacity and 
harmonic coeff i cients stored at the nearest 8 voxels. We i nd 
that trilinear interpolation signif i cantly outperforms a sim- 
pler nearest neighbor interpolation; an ablation is presented 
in Tab. 1. The benef i ts of interpolation are twofold: inter- 
polation increases the effective resolution by representing 
sub-voxel variations in color and opacity, and interpolation 
produces a continuous function approximation that is critical 
for successful optimization. Both of these effects are evident 
in Tab. 1: doubling the resolution of a nearest-neighbor- 
interpolating Plenoxel closes much of the gap between near- 
est neighbor and trilinear interpolation at a i xed resolution, 
yet some gap remains due to the diff i culty of optimizing a 
discontinuous model. Indeed, we i nd that trilinear interpo- 
lation is more stable with respect to variations in learning 
rate compared to nearest neighbor interpolation (we tuned 
the learning rates separately for each interpolation method 
in Tab. 1, to provide close to the best number possible for 
each setup). PSNR ↑SSIM ↑LPIPS ↓

aged over the 8 NeRF synthetic scenes. We i nd that trilinear inter- 
polation provides dual benef i ts of improving effective resolution 
and improving optimization, such that trilinear interpolation at res- 
olution 1283outperforms nearest neighbor interpolation at 2563. 
3.4. Coarse to Fine 
We achieve high resolution via a coarse-to-f i ne strategy 
that begins with a dense grid at lower resolution, optimizes, 
prunes unnecessary voxels, ref i nes the remaining voxels by 
subdividing each in half in each dimension, and continues 
optimizing. For example, in the synthetic case, we begin 
with2563resolution and upsample to5123. We use trilinear 
interpolation to initialize the grid values after each voxel 
subdivision step. In fact, we can resize between arbitrary 
resolutions using trilinear interpolation. Voxel pruning is per- 
formed using the method from PlenOctrees [56], which ap- 
plies a threshold to the maximum weightTi(1−exp(−σiδi)) 
of each voxel over all training rays (or, alternatively, to the 
density value in each voxel). Due to trilinear interpolation, 
naively pruning can adversely impact the the color and den- 
sity near surfaces since values at these points interpolate with 
the voxels in the immediate exterior. To solve this issue, we 
perform a dilation operation so that a voxel is only pruned if 
both itself and its neighbors are deemed unoccupied.

The Plenoxel method introduces a sparse voxel grid representation called Plenoxels for volume reconstruction. This representation utilizes spherical harmonics and trilinear interpolation to achieve high-resolution photorealistic rendering. The method avoids the use of neural networks and instead focuses on direct optimization and efficient GPU implementation.
Compared to classical volume reconstruction methods such as voxel grids and multi-plane images (MPIs), Plenoxels offer an alternative approach that combines sparsity and interpolation to represent 3D scenes without high memory requirements. The use of spherical harmonics allows for modeling view dependence, and the trilinear interpolation enhances the effective resolution and stability of the optimization process.
In the context of neural volume reconstruction, Plenoxels offer a significant speed improvement compared to methods like Neural Radiance Fields (NeRF). The Plenoxel model can be optimized two orders of magnitude faster than NeRF while achieving comparable visual quality. Additionally, Plenoxels can be converted into PlenOctrees, further improving training and rendering efficiency by leveraging an efficient GPU octree implementation.
The Plenoxel method demonstrates that explicit volumetric representation and direct optimization, without neural networks, can achieve photorealistic results with substantial speed improvements. By utilizing a sparse voxel grid and spherical harmonics, Plenoxels provide an efficient alternative for volumetric reconstruction tasks.

3.5. Optimization 
We optimize voxel opacities and spherical harmonic co- 
eff i cients with respect to the mean squared error (MSE) over 
rendered pixel colors, with total variation (TV) regulariza- 
tion [39]. Specif i cally, our base loss function is: 
L = Lrecon+ λTVLTV(3) 
Where the MSE reconstruction lossLreconand the total 
variation regularizer LTVare: 
Lrecon=

|R| X 
r∈R kC(r) − 
ˆ C(r)k2

LTV=

|V| X 
v∈V 
d∈[D] q 
∆2 x(v,d) + ∆2y(v,d) + ∆2z(v,d) 
with∆2 x(v,d)shorthand for the squared difference between 
thedthvalueinvoxelv := (i,j,k)andthedthvalueinvoxel 
(i + 1,j,k)normalized by the resolution, and analogously 
for∆2 y(v,d)and∆2z(v,d). Note in practice we use different 
weights for SH coeff i cients andσvalues. These weights 
are i xed for each scene type (bounded, forward-facing, and 
360◦). 
For faster iteration, we use a stochastic sample of the rays 
Rto 
evaluate the MSE term and a stochastic sample of the 
voxelsVto 
evaluate the TV term in each optimization step. 
We use the same learning rate schedule as JAXNeRF and 
Mip-NeRF [2,7], but tune the initial learning rate separately 
for opacity and harmonic coeff i cients. The learning rate is 
i xed for all scenes in all datasets in the main experiments. 
Directly optimizing voxel coeff i cients is a challenging 
problem for several reasons: there are many values to op- 
timize (the problem is high-dimensional), the optimization 
objective is nonconvex due to the rendering formula, and 
the objective is poorly conditioned. Poor conditioning is

typically best resolved by using a second order optimiza- 
tion algorithm (e.g. as recommended in [28]), but this is 
practically challenging to implement for a high-dimensional 
optimization problem because the Hessian is too large to 
easily compute and invert in each step. Instead, we use RM- 
SProp [10] to ease the ill-conditioning problem without the 
full computational complexity of a second-order method. 
3.6. Unbounded Scenes 
We show that Plenoxels can be optimized for a wide range 
of settings beyond the synthetic scenes from the original 
NeRF paper. 
With minor modif i cations, Plenoxels extend to real, un- 
bounded scenes, both forward-facing and360◦. For forward- 
facing scenes, we use the same sparse voxel grid structure 
with normalized device coordinates, as def i ned in the original 
NeRF paper [26]. 
Background model.For360◦scenes, we augment our 
sparse voxel grid foreground representation with a multi- 
sphere image (MSI) background model, which also uses 
learned voxel colors and opacities with trilinear interpola- 
tion within and between spheres. Note that this is effectively 
the same as our foreground model, except the voxels are 
warped into spheres using the simple equirectangular projec- 
tion (voxels index over sphere anglesθandφ). We place 64 
spheres linearly in inverse radius from1to∞(we pre-scale 
the inner scene to be approximately contained in the unit 
sphere). To conserve memory, we store only rgb channels for 
the colors (only zero-order SH) and store all layers sparsely 
by using opacity thresholding as in our main model. This is 
similar to the background model in NeRF++ [57]. 
3.7. Regularization 
WeillustratetheimportanceofTVregularizationinFig.3. 
In addition to TV regularization, which encourages smooth- 
ness and is used on all scenes, for certain types of scenes we 
also use additional regularizers. 
On the real, forward-facing and360◦scenes, we use a 
sparsity prior based on a Cauchy loss following SNeRG [9]: 
Ls= λs X 
i,k 
log ?1 
+ 2σ(r i(tk))2 ? 
(4) 
whereσ(ri(tk))denotes the opacity of samplekalong train- 
ing rayi. In each minibatch of optimization on forward- 
facing scenes, we evaluate this loss term at each sample 
on each active ray. This is also similar to the sparsity loss 
used in PlenOctrees [56] and encourages voxels to be empty, 
which helps to save memory and reduce quality loss when 
upsampling. 
On the real,360◦scenes, we also use a beta distribution 
regularizer on the accumulated foreground transmittance of 
each ray in each minibatch. This loss term, following Neu- 
ral Volumes [20], promotes a clear foreground-background 
decomposition by encouraging the foreground to be either 
fully opaque or empty. This beta loss is: 
Lβ= 
λβ X 
r (log(TFG(r)) + log(1 − TFG(r)))(5) 
whererare the training rays andTFG(r)is the accumulated 
foreground transmittance (between 0 and 1) of ray r. 
3.8. Implementation 
Since sparse voxel volume rendering is not well- 
supported in modern autodiff libraries, we created a cus- 
tom PyTorch CUDA [29] extension library to achieve fast 
differentiable volume rendering; we hope practitioners will 
i nd this implementation useful in their applications. We also 
provide a slower, higher-level JAX [4] implementation. Both 
implementations will be released to the public. 
The speed of our implementation is possible in large part 
because the gradient of our Plenoxel model becomes very 
sparse very quickly, as shown in Fig. 4. Within the i rst 1-2 
minutes of optimization, fewer than 10% of the voxels have 
nonzero gradients.

In the Plenoxel method, the optimization process involves optimizing voxel opacities and spherical harmonic coefficients. The objective is to minimize the mean squared error (MSE) between the rendered pixel colors and the ground truth colors. Additionally, a total variation (TV) regularization term is added to encourage smoothness in the reconstructed volume.
The optimization is performed using the RMSProp algorithm, which helps alleviate the ill-conditioning problem typically associated with high-dimensional optimization problems. The learning rate schedule is similar to other NeRF variants, but the initial learning rate is tuned separately for opacity and harmonic coefficients.
Plenoxels can be applied to unbounded scenes, including forward-facing and 360° scenes. For forward-facing scenes, normalized device coordinates are used. For 360° scenes, a multi-sphere image (MSI) background model is added to the sparse voxel grid foreground representation. The background model uses trilinear interpolation within and between spheres.
Regularization techniques are employed to improve the optimization process. TV regularization is used for all scenes to promote smoothness. Additional regularizers, such as a sparsity prior and a beta distribution regularizer, are used for specific scene types to encourage voxel emptiness and foreground-background decomposition, respectively.
The implementation of Plenoxels involves a custom CUDA extension library in PyTorch for fast differentiable volume rendering. The implementation takes advantage of the sparsity of gradients, which enables efficient computation.
Overall, the Plenoxel method offers an efficient and effective approach to optimizing voxel-based volumetric reconstructions. The use of TV regularization and additional regularizers, along with the custom implementation, contributes to the successful optimization of the Plenoxel model.

We also present the results from various ablation studies 
of our method. In the main text we present average results 
(PSNR, SSIM [53], and VGG LPIPS [58]) over all scenes 
of each type; full results on each scene individually are

ing a network to predict MPIs for each view, and then can render 
novel scenes without further training; this pretraining is amortized 
across all scenes so we do not include it in the table. 
4.1. Synthetic Scenes 
Our synthetic experiments use the 8 scenes from NeRF: 
chair, drums, i cus, hotdog, lego, materials, mic, and ship. 
Each scene includes 100 ground truth training views with 
800×800 
resolution, from known camera positions dis- 
tributed randomly in the upper hemisphere facing the object, 
which is set against a plain white background. Each scene 
is evaluated on 200 test views, also with resolution 800× 
800 and known inward-facing camera positions in the upper 
hemisphere. We provide quantitative comparisons in Tab. 2 
and visual comparisons in Fig. 6. 
We compare our method to Neural Volumes (NV) [20] 
(as a prior method that predicts a grid for each scene, using 
a 3D convolutional network), and JAXNeRF [7, 26]. For 
Neural Volumes we use values reported in [26]; for JAXN- 
eRF we report results from our own rerunning, i xing the 
centered pixel bug. Our method achieves comparable quality 
compared to the best baseline, while training in an average 
of 11 minutes per scene on a single GPU and supporting 
interactive rendering. 
4.2. Real Forward-Facing Scenes 
We extend our method to unbounded, forward-facing 
scenes by using normalized device coordinates (NDC), as 
derived in NeRF [26]. Our method is otherwise identical to 
the version we use on bounded, synthetic scenes, except that 
weuseTVregularization(withastrongerweight)throughout 
the optimization. This change is likely necessary because of 
the reduced number of training views for these scenes, as 
described in Sec. 4.4. 
Our forward-facing experiments use the same 8 scenes 
as in NeRF, 5 of which are originally from LLFF [25]. Each 
scene consists of 20 to 60 forward-facing images captured 
by a handheld cell phone with resolution 1008×756, 
with 
7 
8 of the images used for training and the remaining 
1 
8 of the 
images reserved as a test set. 
We compare our method to Local Light Field Fusion 
(LLFF) [25] (a prior method that uses a 3D convolutional 
network to predict a grid for each input view) and JAXNeRF. 
We provide quantitative comparisons in Tab. 2 and visual 
comparisons in Fig. 7. 
4.3. Real360◦Scenes 
We extend our method to real, unbounded,360◦scenes by 
surrounding our sparse voxel grid with an multi-sphere im- 
age (MSI, based on multi-plane images introduced by [59]) 
background model, in which each background sphere is also 
a simple voxel grid with trilinear interpolation (both within 
each sphere and between adjacent background sphere lay- 
ers). 
Our360◦experiments use 4 scenes from the Tanks and 
Temples dataset [15]: M60, playground, train, and truck. For 
each scene, we use the same train/test split as [37]. 
We compare our method to NeRF++ [57], which aug- 
ments NeRF with a background model to represent un- 
bounded scenes. We present quantitative comparisons in 
Tab. 2 and visual comparisons in Fig. 8.

In the results section, the performance of the Plenoxel method is evaluated on synthetic scenes, real forward-facing scenes, and real 360° scenes. The quantitative results are presented in Table 2, and visual comparisons are shown in Figures 6, 7, and 8.
For the synthetic scenes, Plenoxel achieves comparable quality compared to Neural Volumes (NV) and JAXNeRF, while training in an average of 11 minutes per scene on a single GPU. The results demonstrate the effectiveness and efficiency of the Plenoxel method in optimizing voxel-based volumetric reconstructions.
In the real forward-facing scenes, Plenoxel is extended to unbounded scenes using normalized device coordinates (NDC). The results show that Plenoxel achieves comparable quality to Local Light Field Fusion (LLFF) and JAXNeRF. The ability to handle unbounded forward-facing scenes highlights the versatility of the Plenoxel method.
For the real 360° scenes, Plenoxel is extended to handle unbounded scenes using a multi-sphere image (MSI) background model. The results are compared to NeRF++, which also incorporates a background model for unbounded scenes. Plenoxel demonstrates competitive performance in rendering 360° scenes.
Overall, the results demonstrate that the Plenoxel method achieves high-quality results after a short optimization time. The method is capable of handling both synthetic and real-world scenes, including forward-facing and 360° scenes, with significant improvements in training speed compared to prior methods.

strikingly straightforward, shedding light on the core ele- 
ments that are necessary for solving 3D inverse problems: a

our case, via trilinear interpolation), and appropriate regular-

Limitations and Future Work.As with any underdeter-

Our method exhibits different artifacts than neural methods, 
as shown in Fig. 9, but both methods achieve similar quality 
in terms of standard metrics (as presented in Sec. 4). Future 
work may be able to adjust or mitigate these remaining arti- 
facts by studying different regularization priors and/or more 
physically accurate differentiable rendering functions.

The paper acknowledges that, like any underdetermined inverse problem, the Plenoxel method is susceptible to artifacts. While the method achieves high-quality results, there are still remaining artifacts that could be further addressed in future work. The paper suggests exploring different regularization priors and more physically accurate differentiable rendering functions to mitigate these artifacts.
The choice of hyperparameters, such as the TV weight (λTV), may also have an impact on the results. While the paper reports results with a fixed set of hyperparameters, it suggests that scene-specific tuning of these parameters could lead to even better performance.
The Plenoxel method can be extended to support multiscale rendering with anti-aliasing through voxel cone-tracing, similar to the approach used in Mip-NeRF. Tone-mapping can also be added to account for white balance and exposure changes, particularly in real 360° scenes. Additionally, the use of a hierarchical data structure, such as an octree, may provide further speed improvements without compromising differentiable interpolation.
The speed of the Plenoxel method opens up possibilities for downstream applications that were previously limited by the performance of NeRF. Examples include multi-bounce lighting and 3D generative models across large databases of scenes. By combining the Plenoxel method with other components such as camera optimization and large-scale voxel hashing, it could enable a practical pipeline for end-to-end photorealistic 3D reconstruction.
Overall, the Plenoxel method offers a promising approach to volumetric reconstruction with improved training efficiency, comparable fidelity to state-of-the-art methods, and insights into the core elements required for solving 3D inverse problems.

Driven by Compression Progress: A Simple Principle Explains Essential Aspects of Subjective Beauty, Novelty, Surprise, Interestingness, Attention, Curiosity, Creativity, Art, Science, Music, Jokes
Juergen Schmidhuber
I argue that data becomes temporarily interesting by itself to some self-improving, but computationally limited, subjective observer once he learns to predict or compress the data in a better way, thus making it subjectively simpler and more beautiful. Curiosity is the desire to create or discover more non-random, non-arbitrary, regular data that is novel and surprising not in the traditional sense of Boltzmann and Shannon but in the sense that it allows for compression progress because its regularity was not yet known. This drive maximizes interestingness, the first derivative of subjective beauty or compressibility, that is, the steepness of the learning curve. It motivates exploring infants, pure mathematicians, composers, artists, dancers, comedians, yourself, and (since 1990) artificial systems.

For several years after their discovery, the primary 
importance of the recursion relations followed from 
February 2018Notices of the AMS167 
THE GRADUATE STUDENT SECTION 
the fact that they yield incredibly more compact—and 
physically more transparent—representations for tree- 
level amplitudes. Processes that would have required 
more Feynman diagrams than atoms in the universe 
could now be represented by a single diagram. Another 
surprising feature of these relations was the discovery 
that individual terms enjoy much more symmetry than 
anyone had anticipated. These new symmetries were 
shown to hold for amplitudes, and were later identif i ed 
with a Yangian Lie algebra. 
Another key breakthrough came in 2009, when physi- 
cists discovered that the graphs arising in Figure 1 could 
be related to volume-forms on certain sub-varieties of 
Gr≥0(𝑘,𝑛)—the "nonnegative" portion of the Grassman- 
nian of 𝑘-dimensional subspaces of ℝ𝑛, 
to be def i ned 
momentarily. Here, 𝑛,𝑘 are determined by the graph: 𝑛 is 
the number of external edges, and 𝑘 = 2𝑛𝐵+ 𝑛𝑊− 𝑛𝐼− 2 
for a graph with 𝑛𝐵,𝑛𝑊blue and white vertices, re- 
spectively, and 𝑛𝐼internal 
edges. (The correspondence 
between these graphs and the totally nonnegative Grass- 
mannian was fully understood by mathematicians, such 
as Postnikov, considerably before physicists stumbled 
upon it independently.) The physical implications of this 
correspondence, together with its generalization to all 
orders of perturbation, can be found in [2]. 
Given the correspondence between the terms gener- 
ated by BCFW (and its all-orders generalization) and the 
Grassmannian, it was natural to wonder if a more in- 
trinsically geometric picture existed. Specif i cally, can the 
recursion relations be literally viewed as 'triangulating' 
some region in the Grassmannian? And if so, can this 
space be def i ned intrinsically—without reference to how 
it should be triangulated? In 2013, Arkani-Hamed and 
Trnka proposed the amplituhedron as the answer to both 
questions for the case of amplitudes in planar, maximally 
supersymmetric Yang-Mills theory [1]. 
Let us now turn to giving a precise mathematical 
def i nition of the amplituhedron, in the 0 loop "tree" case. 
(The ℓ loop amplituhedron for ℓ > 0 has a def i nition 
which is similar but somewhat more complicated; we will 
not discuss it further.) Let 𝑁 ∈ Mat(𝑘 × 𝑛) be a 𝑘 × 𝑛 
matrix of real numbers, with 𝑘 ≤ 𝑛. As we recall from 
linear algebra, the rows of 𝑁 determine a subspace of 
ℝ𝑛called its row space. If the row space is 𝑘-dimensional 
(the maximum possible), we say that 𝑁 has full rank. Two 
full-rank matrices 𝑁1and 𝑁2have 
the same row space 
if for some 𝐿 in the space of 𝑘 × 𝑘 invertible matrices, 
𝐿.𝑁1= 𝑁2. Clearly, any 𝑘-dimensional subspace of ℝ𝑛 
arises as the row space of some full-rank matrix; so the 
collectionofall𝑘-dimensionalsubspacescanbedescribed 
asMatfull(𝑘×𝑛)/𝐺𝑀(𝑘).ThisistheGrassmannianGr(𝑘,𝑛). 
The next ingredient required to def i ne the amplituhe- 
dron is the notion of positivity in the Grassmannian. A 
maximal minor of a matrix 𝑁 ∈ Mat(𝑘 × 𝑛) is the deter- 
minant of the 𝑘 × 𝑘 submatrix obtained from taking a 
subset of 𝑘 of the columns, in the order they appear in 
the matrix. The totally positive Grassmannian, denoted 
Gr>0(𝑘,𝑛), is the subspace of the Grassmannian for which 
all maximal minors have the same sign. The totally non- 
negative Grassmannian, Gr≥0(𝑘,𝑛), is def i ned in the same 
way, except that we also allow some minors to vanish. 
The totally nonnegative Grassmannian was studied by 
Postnikov as a concrete instance of Lusztig's theory of 
total positivity for algebraic groups. It is topologically 
equivalent to a ball, and has a beautiful cell structure that 
can be indexed by decorated permutations (permutations 
of 𝑆𝑛with one extra bit of information for each i xed 
point). Importantly, cells in this 'positroid' stratif i cation 
can be endowed with cluster coordinates and a natural 
volume form. 
We now have everything required to def i ne the tree 
amplituhedron. It is indexed by three integers, 𝑛, 𝑘, and 
𝑑, and a totally positive 𝑛 × (𝑑 + 𝑘) matrix 𝑃. From the 
point of view of physics, 𝑛 is the number of particles, 
𝑘, def i ned above in the context of graphs, encodes the 
total helicity l ow, 𝑑 is the space-time dimension, and 𝑃 
encodes the momenta and helicities of the particles. Let 
𝑁 ∈ Gr≥0(𝑘,𝑛) vary. The amplituhedron 𝒜, as def i ned 
by Arkani-Hamed and Trnka [1] is simply the total image 
locus,

The passage you provided discusses the significance of recursion relations in physics, particularly in relation to tree-level amplitudes and the representation of processes through a single diagram. It also highlights the discovery of new symmetries in individual terms and their connection to a Yangian Lie algebra. Furthermore, it mentions the relationship between certain graphs and volume-forms on sub-varieties of the Grassmannian, specifically the totally nonnegative Grassmannian.
The concept of the "amplituhedron" is introduced as a geometric interpretation of the recursion relations in the Grassmannian. The amplituhedron is proposed as a space that can be defined intrinsically, without relying on triangulation. In the context of planar, maximally supersymmetric Yang-Mills theory, the amplituhedron is proposed as the geometric space corresponding to amplitudes.
The mathematical definition of the amplituhedron is provided, involving the use of matrices, the Grassmannian, and the notions of positivity and total positivity in the Grassmannian. The totally nonnegative Grassmannian, which has a cell structure indexed by decorated permutations, plays a crucial role in defining the amplituhedron.

On Constructive Static Sequences

The "constructive static sequence versioning" or contrastive learning algorithm you described sounds like a complex and ambitious project.

It involves several components such as pixel stretching, template selection, scene layout, object trajectory, and various environmental factors.

𝘌𝘹𝘱𝘭𝘢𝘪𝘯 𝘪𝘵 𝘣𝘢𝘤𝘬 𝘵𝘰 𝘮𝘦.

A "constructive static sequence versioning" or contrastive algorithm is a method for compressing data that involves using a spiral pixel stretching exploration ray instead of a conventional method.

The colors of the pixels are stretched or pinched by a scalar multiplier on a template and a template-selector, which means that the pixel colors are calculated relative to the underlying selected template, that is steganographically, but the pixel color records a scene layout and object trajectory list, much like a scene layout in a 3D modeling software, with camera angles, scene textures, object location and trajectory, temperature of objects, their density, their current selected goal location, and meta-values such as the camera, the lighting in the room, the weather, humidity, and other potentially relevant factors.

The goal of the algorithm is to compress data in a way that preserves important information while discarding unnecessary details.

𝘐𝘯 𝘴𝘪𝘮𝘱𝘭𝘦𝘳 𝘸𝘰𝘳𝘥𝘴.

A contrastive algorithm is a type of compression algorithm that uses a "spiral pixel stretching exploration ray" instead of a traditional approach.

It changes the colors of pixels by stretching or shrinking them based on a scalar multiplier and a template-selector, which calculates the color of each pixel relative to the underlying template.

This algorithm also incorporates information about the scene layout, object trajectory, and other relevant factors, such as the camera angle, lighting, and weather conditions.

The goal is to create a more efficient way of representing and storing this information.

𝘌𝘷𝘦𝘯 𝘴𝘪𝘮𝘱𝘭𝘦𝘳.

A contrastive algorithm is a method of compressing data by using a system of templates to stretch or shrink the colors of pixels in an image.

The algorithm records information about the scene, such as the location of objects and the angle of the camera, and uses this information to adjust the pixels in the image.

The goal is to create a more efficient way of storing and transmitting images.

𝘚𝘰𝘮𝘦 𝘙𝘦𝘧𝘦𝘳𝘦𝘯𝘤𝘦𝘴.

A constructive static sequence versioning algorithm is a method of compressing data by analyzing patterns in the data and then using a mathematical formula to represent those patterns in a more compact form. 

The algorithm is "constructive" because it builds a new representation of the data, and "static" because it does not take into account any changes in the data over time.

The "sequence versioning" part of the name refers to the algorithm's ability to keep track of different versions of the data, allowing for easy recovery or comparison of previous versions.
