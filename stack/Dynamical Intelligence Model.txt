A Dynamical Model of General Intelligence: The Positive Manifold of 
Intelligence by Mutualism

Scores on cognitive tasks used in intelligence tests correlate positively with each other, that is, they 
display a positive manifold of correlations. The positive manifold is often explained by positing a 
dominant latent variable, the g factor, associated with a single quantitative cognitive or biological process 
or capacity. In this article, a new explanation of the positive manifold based on a dynamical model is 
proposed, in which reciprocal causation or mutualism plays a central role. It is shown that the positive 
manifold emerges purely by positive beneficial interactions between cognitive processes during devel- 
opment. A single underlying g factor plays no role in the model. The model offers explanations of 
important findings in intelligence research, such as the hierarchical factor structure of intelligence, the 
low predictability of intelligence from early childhood performance, the integration/differentiation effect, 
the increase in heritability of g, and the Jensen effect, and is consistent with current explanations of the 
Flynn effect. 
Keywords: intelligence, g factor, dynamical systems, mutualism, reciprocal causation 
In the study of intelligence, one empirical phenomenon is 
well established: Test scores on cognitive tasks show a positive 
manifold, that is, they are invariably positively intercorrelated, 
albeit to varying degrees. This implies that people who score 
well on one cognitive test are likely to score well on other 
cognitive tests. The positive manifold is a robust phenomenon. 
For instance, it does not depend on the exact nature of the 
cognitive task, and it is observed in a variety of populations 
(Jensen, 1998). It is in the light of this empirical phenomenon 
that many differential psychologists accept the idea of an un- 
derlying factor of general intelligence, commonly denoted as g, 
at least as a working hypothesis (Carroll, 1993; Gottfredson, 
1998; Jensen, 1998; Thorndike, 1994). As Bartholomew states, 
���If a set of test scores tends to be positively correlated among 
themselves there is a prima facie case for believing that those 
correlations are induced by a common dependence on a latent 
variable��� (Bartholomew, 2004, p. 62). 
It is important to distinguish between g as a psychometric and g 
as a psychological construct (Thorndike, 1994). From a psycho- 
metric point of view, the g factor is the outcome of factor analysis 
of the correlation matrices of cognitive test scores. In the simplest 
case, such analyses produce a dominant first-order general factor 
(see Figure 1a), or a dominant first eigenvalue. In more advanced 
versions of factor analyses of a wide variety of IQ tests (e.g., 
confirmatory factor analysis, exploratory or confirmatory hierar- 
chical factor analysis), g is conceptualized as a higher order factor 
or as a general first order factor in the presence of more specific 
group factors (Carroll, 1993; Gustafsson, 1984; Mackintosh, 
1998). In addition, in hierarchical models, g may be identified with 
first-order factors such as fluid intelligence (Horn & Noll, 1994). 
From a psychometric (i.e., factor analytic) point of view, g is 
considered to be well established (cf. Bartholomew, 2004). In this 
view, g is a summary measure or index of the positive manifold. 
As a psychological construct, g is much more controversial. This 
controversy centers on the question of the origin or nature of g 
(Sternberg & Grigorenko, 2002). Can psychometric g be identified 
with some psychological or biological variable? Does g explain 
differences amongst individuals in performance on diverse mental 
tests (Gottfredson, 1998)? 
A century ago, Spearman (1904, 1927) introduced the notion of 
mental energy as the main cause or origin of g. Many current 
explanations are of this ���single quantitative latent factor��� type. We 
denote this the g explanation. For instance, it has been argued that 
individual differences in g are due to individual differences in an 
underlying cognitive factor, such as speed or efficiency of infor- 
mation processing, working memory, or the capacity to handle 
cognitive complexity (for reviews, see Deary, 2002; Detterman, 
2002; Jensen, 1998). Alternatively, g is identified with underlying 
biologically related factors such as brain size, neural efficiency or 
pruning, or neural plasticity (Detterman, 2002; Garlick, 2002; 
Gray & Thompson, 2004). Although there is ample evidence that 
these factors play a major role in intelligence, none of these factors 
is generally accepted as the unitary cause of g (Ackerman, Beier, 
& Boyle, 2005; Luciano et al., 2005). 
The large body of research on g may give the impression that the 
g explanation is the only possible explanation of the positive

manifold. However, to establish the g factor, the analysis of 
correlations is insufficient (Borsboom, Mellenbergh, & van Heer- 
den, 2004). In the words of Bartholomew (2004), ���What we have 
done is to demonstrate that what we have observed is what we 
would have expected if an underlying variable, called g, did exist. 
It leaves open the possibility that some other mechanism could 
have produced the correlation��� (p. 73). Thus we must exclude 
alternative mechanisms, which do not include a general factor as 
an underlying quantitative variable but which do give rise to the 
positive manifold. 
Thorndike (1927) and Thomson (1951) proposed one such al- 
ternative mechanism, namely, sampling. In this sampling theory, 
carrying out cognitive tasks requires the use of many lower order 
uncorrelated modules or neural processes (so-called bonds). They 
hypothesized that the samples of modules or bonds used for 
different cognitive tests partly overlap, causing a positive correla- 
tion between the test scores. In this view, the positive manifold is 
due to a measurement problem in the sense that it is very difficult 
to obtain independent measures of the lower order processes. 
Jensen (1998) and Eysenck (1987) identified three problems with 
this sampling theory. First, whereas some complex mental tests, as 
predicted by sampling theory, highly load on the g factor, some 
very narrowly defined tests also display high g loadings. Second, 
some seemingly completely unrelated tests, such as visual and 
memory scan tasks, are consistently highly correlated, whereas 
related tests, such as forward and backward digit span, are only 
modestly correlated. Third, in some cases brain damage leads to 
very specific impairments, whereas sampling theory predicts gen- 
eral impairments. These three facts are difficult to explain with 
sampling theory, which as a consequence has not gained much 
acceptance.1Thus, the g explanation remains very dominant in the 
current literature (see Jensen, 1998, p. 107). 
The aim of this article is to outline a third possibility, a new 
explanation of the positive manifold. This explanation is based on 
a mathematically formulated developmental model with mutual- 
ism or positive beneficial relationships between cognitive pro- 
cesses. This explanation identifies a plausible mechanism that 
gives rise to the positive manifold but that does not include g as a 
latent quantitative variable. At the very least, this demonstrates 
that a latent variable, which is well established psychometrically 
(i.e., in factor analyses), need not correspond to an actual quanti- 
tative variable, such as speed of processing or brain size. This 
model also suggests explanations of other important empirical 
phenomena in intelligence research. We present and discuss pos- 
sible explanations for the low predictability of intelligence from 
early childhood performance, the hierarchical factor structure of 
intelligence, the increase in heritability of g, the Jensen effect, the

The article you've shared discusses a new theoretical model of intelligence proposed by Han L. J. van der Maas and his colleagues from the University of Amsterdam. This model challenges the traditional view of intelligence being primarily influenced by a dominant latent variable known as the general factor of intelligence, or g factor. Instead, it suggests that the positive correlations observed among different cognitive tasks, known as the positive manifold, can be explained through a dynamical model based on mutualism.
In this mutualism model, the positive manifold emerges from beneficial interactions between different cognitive processes during a person���s development. These interactions promote improvements in each cognitive task, leading to overall cognitive enhancement without requiring a single underlying g factor. This theory suggests a more complex interplay of factors contributing to intelligence, such as the development of cognitive processes that support each other.
The model addresses several key issues in intelligence research:
Hierarchical Factor Structure
: It provides a basis for the observed hierarchical organization of cognitive abilities.
Predictability of Intelligence
: It explains why intelligence measured at an early age is not always a reliable predictor of later intelligence, proposing that cognitive abilities can develop and integrate in various ways over time.
Increase in Heritability
: The model could explain why the heritability of intelligence seems to increase with age, as genetic factors might differentially influence the development of these interrelated cognitive processes.
Jensen Effect
: It offers a framework for understanding why some cognitive tasks are more strongly correlated with general intelligence than others.
Differentiation and Integration Effects
: The model is consistent with observations that cognitive abilities appear more differentiated in some contexts and more integrated in others.
Flynn Effect
: It aligns with theories about the Flynn effect, where population-level increases in IQ scores over time could be influenced by changes in environmental factors that enhance these mutualistic interactions among cognitive processes.
This dynamical model of intelligence by mutualism provides an alternative to the traditional g factor model, suggesting that intelligence is the emergent property of complex interactions among cognitive processes rather than stemming from a single cognitive or biological source.

The article is organized as follows. We first introduce a biolog- 
ical metaphor concerning ecosystems to explain the idea underly- 
ing our explanation. We then briefly introduce the models that 
biologists use to study such complex ecosystems. Following from 
these models, we introduce a model for intelligence based on 
mutualism or reciprocal causal interactions. In order to investigate 
this simple mathematical model, we introduce three scenarios for 
the explanation of data from intelligence research. Computer sim- 
ulations confirm that mutualism gives rise to, and thus embodies 
an explanation of, the positive manifold. In the remaining sections 
we investigate other aspects of psychometric g, such as the devel- 
opment of intelligence, the differentiation effect, the heritability of 
intelligence, and the Flynn effect. We end with a discussion of 
possible extensions, open questions, and possible objections. 
The Ecosystem Metaphor 
Suppose we investigate the ecosystems of several small lakes in 
a specific area. We set out to determine how well these ecosystems 
function, for instance regarding biodiversity or sensitivity to ex- 
ternal perturbations.2Our research strategy consists of collecting 
data concerning many different aspects of the lakes, such as 
measures of the quality of water and number and diversity of flora 
and fauna. Suppose we observe a positive manifold in these 
measures, and a dominant general factor in the subsequent factor 
analyses of the data. This would imply that ���good��� lakes are better, 
1The position of Jensen is perhaps inconsistent. In his discussion of the 
question whether g is unitary (Detterman, 2002; Jensen, 1998, p. 260; 
Kranzler & Jensen, 1991), he uses arguments similar to sampling theory, 
which he rejected earlier. With regard to the unitary question, he argues 
that the g factor is just a psychometric construct and may not relate to a 
single underlying process or capacity. It is our impression, however, that 
most differential psychologists believe that g is more than a statistical 
construct. A recent genetic formulation of sampling theory can be found in 
B. Anderson (2001). 
2In ecology, there is little consensus on measures for comparing eco- 
systems (but see Kennedy et al., 2002, and Brooks & Kennedy, 2004, on 
biodiversity barometers). Furthermore, real ecosystems include many com- 
petitive relations and will not show a simple positive manifold. For our 
present argument, we discard these issues.

A DYNAMICAL MODEL OF GENERAL INTELLIGENCE 
to varying degrees, than ���bad��� lakes in all measured aspects. Thus, 
we may ask: Is there a type of g factor for lakes? Is there an 
equivalent of mental energy, a ���speed��� factor, or a ���plasticity��� 
factor for ecosystems?3We do not exclude this possibility. How- 
ever, what is more important to our present proposal is that 
biologists have other explanations of these phenomena in 
ecosystems. 
In mathematical biology, ecosystems are often modeled with 
coupled differential or difference equations. Famous are the Lotka- 
Volterra type models for prey���predator population dynamics 
(May, 1973; Murray, 2002). The basic Lotka-Volterra prey��� 
predator model concerns two species with population sizes x1 
(prey) and x2(predator). Prey grows according to the logistic map, 
with birth factor a, and constrained by environmental resources K. 
Furthermore, predation by x2decreases x1by a factor M, the 
effectiveness of predation. x2has a constant death rate c, and its 
reproduction is proportional with factor b to amount of prey and M. 
The idea is that number of prey x1increases when number of 
predators x2is low and decreases when predators are numerous, 
whereas number of predators increases when prey are numerous 
and decreases when prey are rare. This leads to oscillations in both 
x1and x2. The dynamics are specified in two equations that define 
the change dx/dt of the population sizes x1and x2over time: 
dx1 
dt ? ax1(1 ? x1/K) ? Mx2x1,(1) 
dx2 
dt ? (Mbx1? c)x2.(2) 
This elementary system generates a number of fascinating and 
complex phenomena, as described in any basic text on population 
dynamics (and illustrated with many java applets on the internet). 
Current more realistic models can be very complex and detailed, 
providing accurate description of, and predictions concerning, the 
dynamics of large ecosystems (e.g., Kondoh, 2003; Prakash & de 
Roos, 2004). In these models, interactions in the form of compe- 
tition and cooperation are essential and will give rise to correla- 
tions between different aspects or parts of the ecosystem. 
Our dynamical explanation of the positive manifold of cognitive 
tasks is based on this type of interaction in multivariate dynamical 
systems (cf. van Geert, 1991). We argue that the positive manifold 
may be a by-product of the positive interactions between the 
different cognitive processes of the system. In our proposal, all 
processes of the system are initially undeveloped and uncorrelated. 
During the development of the system, the dynamical interactions 
give rise to correlations among the processes of the system. 
A Simple Dynamical Model for the Positive Manifold of 
Intelligence 
The model consists of two parts, a dynamical part and an 
interaction part. The dynamical part represents the development of 
cognitive processes. Developmental curves generally first show a 
strong increase and then reach some kind of asymptote (i.e., 
intelligence does not grow unboundedly). This type of growth 
pattern can be modeled in many ways. A popular model is the 
logistic growth model (first part of Equation 1), which was intro- 
duced as model for psychological growth by van Geert (1991) and 
is also used by Eaves, Kirk, Martin, and Russell (1999) and 
Molenaar and Raijmakers (1999) in simulations of genetic effects 
in development. The logistic model can be seen as an elementary 
model of growth, which can be extended in many ways. We also 
chose a very simple interaction model, which is a multivariate 
extension of the second part of Equation 1. Interactions are deter- 
mined by a matrix of weights. Figure 1b gives a schematic view of 
the model. We will introduce the model step by step. 
The first step is the assumption that intelligence is based on 
underlying cognitive processes, such as perceptual, memory, de- 
cision, and reasoning processes. There is at present little consensus 
about the specific basic processes underlying intelligent behavior 
(Deary, 2002, p. 153). It is possible to adopt one theoretical 
proposal, like the Sternberg model or the minimal cognitive archi- 
tecture model of M. Anderson (1992) and develop the mutualism 
model in these terms. The circles and squares used in Figure 1c 
could be labeled with components proposed by Sternberg (1988). 
However, our account of the positive manifold does not hinge on 
a particular cognitive architecture or brain model. We use the

terms ���processes��� generically to refer to any cognitive component that contributes to overall intelligence, such as attention, working memory, or executive functions. The assumption is that these processes are initially independent but can influence each other's development through reciprocal interactions as described in the mutualism model.
The mutualism model posits that these cognitive processes are interconnected in such a way that the development of one process can enhance the development of others. This is akin to species in an ecosystem where the thriving of one species can benefit others, either directly or indirectly. For intelligence, this means that improvements in specific cognitive abilities like reasoning might enhance memory capabilities, and vice versa, due to the supportive interactions among these processes.
The Mathematical Formulation
In the mathematical part of the model, the development of each cognitive process is described by a logistic growth curve, which is a common way to model constrained growth in biological and psychological contexts. This curve reflects how cognitive processes initially experience rapid growth, but then the rate of improvement decreases as they approach an upper limit of potential development, defined by genetic, environmental, or neurobiological factors.
Additionally, the model includes an interaction term that describes how each process influences and is influenced by the others. The weights in this matrix determine the strength and direction of these effects, providing a dynamic framework to simulate how cognitive processes evolve over time.
Empirical Validation and Simulation
To test and validate this model, the authors use computer simulations to explore how these dynamic interactions can lead to the emergence of the positive manifold observed in empirical data on intelligence testing. The simulations attempt to replicate real-world data, showing how even complex and varied patterns of cognitive abilities might arise from simple underlying interactions.
Key Findings and Implications
The findings suggest that a mutualistic model of cognitive development can explain the positive manifold without invoking a single, overarching factor like g. This challenges the traditional view of g as the sole explanation for the intercorrelations among cognitive test scores. Instead, it highlights the role of developmental interactions and mutual support among cognitive processes as a plausible alternative explanation.
This model not only contributes to our understanding of the structure of intelligence but also offers insights into why certain interventions might be effective in enhancing cognitive abilities. For instance, training that improves one cognitive ability could potentially have cascading benefits across other abilities, given the mutualistic relationships among them.
Future Research Directions
The authors conclude with a call for more empirical studies to further explore and refine this model. They suggest that future research could focus on identifying specific types of interactions among cognitive processes and how these can be influenced by genetic and environmental factors. Additionally, extending the model to account for individual differences in the rate of development and the ultimate levels of cognitive abilities could provide deeper insights into the nature of intelligence.
This approach not only advances our theoretical understanding of intelligence but also opens new avenues for practical interventions aimed at cognitive enhancement, educational strategies, and perhaps even addressing developmental disorders.

Dijiste:
what about in the case of general intelligence? Of course, this 
depends on one���s definition of general intelligence. If we equate 
general intelligence with g, then the mutualism model does not 
support general intelligence. We prefer to associate general intel- 
ligence with the positive manifold, so that we may view the 
mutualism model as a model of general intelligence in the sense 
that it explains why people, who are good at one test, are good at 
other tests as well. Given this interpretation of general intelligence, 
there is nothing wrong with using the g factor as a summary or 
psychometric index variable (e.g., in prediction), as long as we do 
not assume that this variable relates to a single underlying quan- 
titative process or capacity. In this view, the g factor is not 
advanced as an explanatory variable. 
Several possible points of criticism of the present proposal may 
be raised. First, we may ask whether the mutualism model is really 
different from the sampling theory. In sampling theory, the ele- 
mentary processes are uncorrelated. Correlations between perfor- 
mance on cognitive tasks exist because these tasks appeal to 
overlapping subsets of these elementary processes. In sampling 
theory, and this is true for all its variants, the positive manifold is 
due to a measurement problem. If we were able to measure 
elementary processes independently, the positive manifold would 
disappear. In the mutualism model, the elementary processes are 
uncorrelated initially but become correlated during development. 
A more refined measurement will not make the positive manifold 
disappear. 
The objections raised to the sampling theory (see introduction) 
are also less relevant to the mutualism model, because functional 
independence does not imply a developmental independence. Per- 
formance on simple reaction time tasks and performance on intel- 
ligence tests, such as the Raven���s Progressive Matrices test, may 
not have much in common. They may be functionally independent. 
Yet, in the development of reasoning processes that are important 
in the Raven test performance, speed of processing could well have 
been very important. Another example is the relation between 
short-term memory and many cognitive skills. In the first phase of 
skill acquisition, short term memory is essential, but later, when 
processes are automatized, short-term memory is no longer in- 
volved in performance (J. R. Anderson, 1982). Also brain damage 
might selectively impair performance on one type of test without 
impairing other, highly correlated, performances in the population, 
because the correlation is not based on current functional depen- 
dency or overlap in processes but rather on developmental depen- 
dency. Moreover, correlation between processes can be based on 
many Mijthrough indirect pathways. 
Another possible objection is that the mutualism model does not 
constitute a parsimonious explanation of the data. Indeed, if every 
element Mijhas to be determined from data, there is no reduction 
of information. We offer three responses to this. First, we do not 
assume the presence of a rather mysterious latent variable, such as 
g. Rather, we use a developmental model with a clear mechanism 
to account for the positive manifold. Second, we can constrain the 
structure of M, as in Scenario 3. Indeed, M can be quite sparse and 
still give rise to a positive manifold. Many kinds of restrictions 
may be placed on the elements in the matrix M, which can be 
based on theoretical considerations or the results of experimental 
studies. If, for instance, experimental manipulation of short-term 
memory is found to alter the performance on an arithmetic task, we 
would have reason to constrain the relevant Mijto a positive value. 
Finally, irrespective of these considerations, if we believe that 
beneficial relations between important cognitive or brain processes 
exist, we have to take the mutualism explanation of the positive 
manifold seriously. 
A general objection to all three explanations of the positive 
manifold concerns falsification (Jensen, 1998). It is not easy to 
falsify explanations of the positive manifold. It is also quite pos- 
sible that a full explanation of intelligence data requires elements 
of all three explanations. Some cognitive processes are probably 
much more important than others in the explanation of individual 
differences, reciprocal causation plays a role and the measurement 
problems in sampling theory can hardly be excluded. The best way 
to falsify the mutualism model is to find a variable that correlates 
perfectly with g. Furthermore, the present model incorporates 
various assumptions, which can be challenged in different ways. 
For instance, the model predicts that the initial values and growth 
parameters do not determine the asymptotic stable states. Demon- 
stration of a correlation between early infant performance and 
adulthood intelligence or a demonstration of a strong g factor in 
infancy would pose a problem for the mutualism model. 
A number of issues require further study. For instance, we hope 
to (a) extend the dynamical model using results of population 
biology, (b) establish statistical model equivalence between the 
mutualism model and factor analytic models, (c) make an inven- 
tory of causal links between relevant cognitive (and noncognitive) 
processes based on experimental evidence, (d) formulate the mu- 
tualism model in terms of a cognitive architecture with a choice of 
processes and causal links, and (e) obtain sufficient information to 
actually fit the mutualism model to data. 
This research program appears to have good prospects. In the 
past few years, the mutualism model and its various extensions 
have been studied extensively in population biology (see Footnote 
6). Additionally, model equivalence has been investigated in quite 
some depth (e.g., Molenaar, 2003; Raykov & Penev, 1999). Ob- 
jective c requires the review of the relevant literature and may 
necessitate new experimental cognitive research. Understanding 
the function of many biological complex systems, such as genetic 
networks and molecular signaling pathways, requires precise iden- 
tification of the interaction between individual components. The 
most common strategy to identify the causal links involves piece- 
meal perturbations of the elements involved (Krupa, 2002). Trans- 
lating this to psychology, we need (preferably) experimental data 
about the precise relations between modules, processes, or capac- 
ities of the mind. The last two issues require specification of the 
processes x in our model. We consider both a data-driven and a 
theory-driven strategy for this specification. In the data-driven 
strategy, we can work with one of the many available data sets 
from intelligence research and use subtest scores as measures of 
the processes x. In the theory-driven approach, we can adopt (or 
develop) a cognitive model of intelligence, such as the Sternberg 
model (Figure 1c) or a gf���gc type model. Because we have at our

data with dynamic structural equation models (McArdle et al., 
2000). Further technical developments are required in this area. 
To summarize, in the present article, we proposed a novel 
explanation of the positive manifold. Positive interactions, that is, 
reciprocal causation, in the development of cognitive processes, 
gives rise to the same important phenomenon, viz. the positive 
manifold, that has been advanced as evidence for a dominant 
underlying latent variable in intelligence. A developmental model 
with such interactions may also explain other important effects in 
intelligence research or, at minimum, provide new ways to study 
them. 
A final question is whether it is possible to apply this model, or 
at least this line of reasoning, to other areas in psychology, where 
correlational data play an important role, and the identification of 
latent variables is based strongly on the results of factor analyses. 
It would certainly be a useful exercise to conceptualize broad 
personality dimensions (e.g., the Big Five) as manifestations of the 
interaction between processes within a broadly defined psycholog- 
ical system. The same applies to more narrowly defined person- 
ality variables. For instance, should we view depression as a true 
latent variable, which determines a variety of psychological be- 
haviors, or is it actually the upshot of system of self-reinforced 
negative behaviors and feelings? Such questions can perhaps be 
answered by developing and testing models of the kind proposed 
in this article.

In the discussion of general intelligence (g) versus the mutualism model, the authors of the article present a nuanced view on what constitutes general intelligence. They argue that if general intelligence is equated with the g factor alone, then the mutualism model does not support this traditional view. Instead, they propose an alternative interpretation where general intelligence is associated with the positive manifold���the phenomenon where individuals who perform well on one cognitive test tend to perform well on others. In this context, the mutualism model serves as an explanation for why this correlation occurs, suggesting that general intelligence can be understood through the dynamic interactions and mutual support among various cognitive processes.
The mutualism model posits that these cognitive processes, while initially uncorrelated, develop interdependencies through reciprocal causation as they evolve. This model contrasts with sampling theory, where the positive manifold is attributed to overlapping subsets of uncorrelated elementary processes used in different cognitive tasks. The authors argue that refined measurements would not eliminate the positive manifold in the mutualism model because the correlations arise from developmental, not just functional, interactions among cognitive processes.
The article outlines several key criticisms and objections to both the mutualism model and the traditional g factor model. One major point is the challenge of falsifiability and the difficulty in empirically disproving explanations of the positive manifold. The authors suggest that a comprehensive understanding of intelligence might need to incorporate elements from multiple theoretical frameworks, including mutualism, g factor theories, and sampling theory, acknowledging that some cognitive processes are more critical than others and that measurement issues cannot be completely ruled out.
To advance the mutualism model, the authors propose a research program that includes extending the model using concepts from population biology, establishing statistical equivalences with factor-analytic models, and identifying causal links between cognitive processes through experimental research. This approach aims to specify the interactions within the cognitive system more clearly and test these through data fitting and experimental manipulations.
The authors also reflect on the broader implications of their model for other areas of psychology. They suggest that similar models could be applied to understand personality dimensions and psychological conditions like depression, viewing these as systems of interacting processes rather than outcomes determined by single latent variables. This perspective encourages a more dynamic and systemic approach to studying psychological phenomena, where the focus shifts from identifying isolated factors to understanding complex interactions within a broader system.

Give an explanation of each of the topics we've discussed.

ChatGPT
Certainly! Here���s a breakdown of the key topics we've discussed:
General Intelligence (g Factor)
General Intelligence
, commonly referred to as the
g factor
, is a concept from psychometrics used to summarize the commonalities among various cognitive abilities. In traditional intelligence research, the g factor is considered a dominant factor that explains why individuals who perform well on one type of cognitive task tend to perform well across a broad range of other cognitive tasks. The g factor is often interpreted as reflecting some underlying cognitive or biological process that influences overall cognitive performance.
Positive Manifold
The
positive manifold
refers to the observation that scores on different cognitive tasks are positively intercorrelated. This means that people who score highly on one cognitive test are likely to score highly on other tests. The positive manifold is a well-established empirical phenomenon in the study of intelligence and is often cited as evidence for the existence of a general intelligence factor.
Mutualism Model
The
mutualism model
is an alternative explanation for the positive manifold, proposed by Han L. J. van der Maas and colleagues. Unlike the g factor model, which posits a single underlying variable, the mutualism model suggests that the positive manifold arises from dynamic interactions and reciprocal support among cognitive processes during development. According to this model, cognitive abilities mutually enhance each other over time, leading to a network of developed capabilities that contribute to overall intelligence.
Sampling Theory
Sampling Theory
is another explanation for the positive manifold, which contends that cognitive tasks use overlapping subsets of basic, uncorrelated mental processes or neural modules. According to this theory, the positive manifold is a measurement artifact; if it were possible to measure these elementary processes independently, the manifold would disappear. Sampling theory has not been widely accepted due to its limitations in explaining the consistency of high correlations among seemingly unrelated tasks.
Challenges and Falsifiability
Falsifiability
is a significant challenge in theories of intelligence, particularly in validating models like the mutualism model. A theory is considered falsifiable if it can be proven false by an experiment or an observation. The difficulty with theories of intelligence is that they often incorporate multiple components and assumptions that are hard to isolate and test independently. The mutualism model, for example, suggests testing its validity by finding correlations that could be exclusively predicted by the model or by disproving its developmental assumptions.
Application to Other Psychological Areas
The underlying principles of the mutualism model can potentially be applied beyond intelligence to other areas of psychology. For instance, personality traits or psychological conditions like depression could be conceptualized not as outcomes of single latent variables but as systems of interacting processes. This approach encourages a broader, more integrative view of psychological phenomena, focusing on the dynamics within complex systems rather than isolated factors.
Each of these topics contributes to a deeper understanding of how we conceptualize and measure intelligence, offering a range of perspectives that challenge and enrich traditional views.

A reference for this: A Dynamical Model of General Intelligence: The Positive Manifold of 
Intelligence by Mutualism 
Han L. J. van der Maas, Conor V. Dolan, Raoul P. P. P. Grasman, Jelte M. Wicherts, 
Hilde M. Huizenga, and Maartje E. J. Raijmakers 
University of Amsterdam 
Scores on cognitive tasks used in intelligence tests correlate positively with each other, that is, they 
display a positive manifold of correlations. The positive manifold is often explained by positing a 
dominant latent variable, the g factor, associated with a single quantitative cognitive or biological process 
or capacity. In this article, a new explanation of the positive manifold based on a dynamical model is 
proposed, in which reciprocal causation or mutualism plays a central role. It is shown that the positive 
manifold emerges purely by positive beneficial interactions between cognitive processes during devel- 
opment. A single underlying g factor plays no role in the model. The model offers explanations of 
important findings in intelligence research, such as the hierarchical factor structure of intelligence, the 
low predictability of intelligence from early childhood performance, the integration/differentiation effect, 
the increase in heritability of g, and the Jensen effect, and is consistent with current explanations of the 
Flynn effect. 
Keywords: intelligence, g factor, dynamical systems, mutualism, reciprocal causation 
In the study of intelligence, one empirical phenomenon is 
well established: Test scores on cognitive tasks show a positive 
manifold, that is, they are invariably positively intercorrelated, 
albeit to varying degrees. This implies that people who score 
well on one cognitive test are likely to score well on other 
cognitive tests. The positive manifold is a robust phenomenon. 
For instance, it does not depend on the exact nature of the 
cognitive task, and it is observed in a variety of populations 
(Jensen, 1998). It is in the light of this empirical phenomenon 
that many differential psychologists accept the idea of an un- 
derlying factor of general intelligence, commonly denoted as g, 
at least as a working hypothesis (Carroll, 1993; Gottfredson, 
1998; Jensen, 1998; Thorndike, 1994). As Bartholomew states, 
���If a set of test scores tends to be positively correlated among 
themselves there is a prima facie case for believing that those 
correlations are induced by a common dependence on a latent 
variable��� (Bartholomew, 2004, p. 62). 
It is important to distinguish between g as a psychometric and g 
as a psychological construct (Thorndike, 1994). From a psycho- 
metric point of view, the g factor is the outcome of factor analysis 
of the correlation matrices of cognitive test scores. In the simplest 
case, such analyses produce a dominant first-order general factor 
(see Figure 1a), or a dominant first eigenvalue. In more advanced 
versions of factor analyses of a wide variety of IQ tests (e.g., 
confirmatory factor analysis, exploratory or confirmatory hierar- 
chical factor analysis), g is conceptualized as a higher order factor 
or as a general first order factor in the presence of more specific 
group factors (Carroll, 1993; Gustafsson, 1984; Mackintosh, 
1998). In addition, in hierarchical models, g may be identified with 
first-order factors such as fluid intelligence (Horn & Noll, 1994). 
From a psychometric (i.e., factor analytic) point of view, g is 
considered to be well established (cf. Bartholomew, 2004). In this 
view, g is a summary measure or index of the positive manifold. 
As a psychological construct, g is much more controversial. This 
controversy centers on the question of the origin or nature of g 
(Sternberg & Grigorenko, 2002). Can psychometric g be identified 
with some psychological or biological variable? Does g explain 
differences amongst individuals in performance on diverse mental 
tests (Gottfredson, 1998)? 
A century ago, Spearman (1904, 1927) introduced the notion of 
mental energy as the main cause or origin of g. Many current 
explanations are of this ���single quantitative latent factor��� type. We 
denote this the g explanation. For instance, it has been argued that 
individual differences in g are due to individual differences in an 
underlying cognitive factor, such as speed or efficiency of infor- 
mation processing, working memory, or the capacity to handle 
cognitive complexity (for reviews, see Deary, 2002; Detterman, 
2002; Jensen, 1998). Alternatively, g is identified with underlying 
biologically related factors such as brain size, neural efficiency or 
pruning, or neural plasticity (Detterman, 2002; Garlick, 2002; 
Gray & Thompson, 2004). Although there is ample evidence that 
these factors play a major role in intelligence, none of these factors 
is generally accepted as the unitary cause of g (Ackerman, Beier, 
& Boyle, 2005; Luciano et al., 2005). 
The large body of research on g may give the impression that the 
g explanation is the only possible explanation of the positive

manifold. However, to establish the g factor, the analysis of 
correlations is insufficient (Borsboom, Mellenbergh, & van Heer- 
den, 2004). In the words of Bartholomew (2004), ���What we have 
done is to demonstrate that what we have observed is what we 
would have expected if an underlying variable, called g, did exist. 
It leaves open the possibility that some other mechanism could 
have produced the correlation��� (p. 73). Thus we must exclude 
alternative mechanisms, which do not include a general factor as 
an underlying quantitative variable but which do give rise to the 
positive manifold. 
Thorndike (1927) and Thomson (1951) proposed one such al- 
ternative mechanism, namely, sampling. In this sampling theory, 
carrying out cognitive tasks requires the use of many lower order 
uncorrelated modules or neural processes (so-called bonds). They 
hypothesized that the samples of modules or bonds used for 
different cognitive tests partly overlap, causing a positive correla- 
tion between the test scores. In this view, the positive manifold is 
due to a measurement problem in the sense that it is very difficult 
to obtain independent measures of the lower order processes. 
Jensen (1998) and Eysenck (1987) identified three problems with 
this sampling theory. First, whereas some complex mental tests, as 
predicted by sampling theory, highly load on the g factor, some 
very narrowly defined tests also display high g loadings. Second, 
some seemingly completely unrelated tests, such as visual and 
memory scan tasks, are consistently highly correlated, whereas 
related tests, such as forward and backward digit span, are only 
modestly correlated. Third, in some cases brain damage leads to 
very specific impairments, whereas sampling theory predicts gen- 
eral impairments. These three facts are difficult to explain with 
sampling theory, which as a consequence has not gained much 
acceptance.1Thus, the g explanation remains very dominant in the 
current literature (see Jensen, 1998, p. 107). 
The aim of this article is to outline a third possibility, a new 
explanation of the positive manifold. This explanation is based on 
a mathematically formulated developmental model with mutual- 
ism or positive beneficial relationships between cognitive pro- 
cesses. This explanation identifies a plausible mechanism that 
gives rise to the positive manifold but that does not include g as a 
latent quantitative variable. At the very least, this demonstrates 
that a latent variable, which is well established psychometrically 
(i.e., in factor analyses), need not correspond to an actual quanti- 
tative variable, such as speed of processing or brain size. This 
model also suggests explanations of other important empirical 
phenomena in intelligence research. We present and discuss pos- 
sible explanations for the low predictability of intelligence from 
early childhood performance, the hierarchical factor structure of 
intelligence, the increase in heritability of g, the Jensen effect, the 
differentiation effect, and the Flynn effect.
