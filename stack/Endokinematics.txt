Person deixis means references to a person, where who the person is can be
inferred only if contextual information is available (Meibauer 2001; Sidnell
et al. 2017). The utterer knows who he himself is, and in the setting of a
face-to-face communication the interpreter knows who the utterer is, and is
thus able to resolve the deictic pronouns I and you. Deixis often relies on point-
ing, as in "that sheep 1S more expensive than that sheep

ChatGPT
It appears you're describing the concept of deixis in linguistics, particularly person deixis and spatial deixis.
Person deixis involves the use of pronouns (like "I" and "you") that require context to understand who they refer to. For instance, the pronoun "I" refers to the speaker, but without knowing who the speaker is, the pronoun itself doesn't provide this information. The context in which the pronoun is used is crucial to understanding its reference.
Similarly, spatial deixis requires context to understand the spatial relations described in an utterance. Words and phrases like "here", "there", "in", "out", "below", and demonstratives like "this" and "that" are used to indicate location or direction relative to the speaker and/or listener, and their meaning depends on the context in which they are used. For example, without contextual information, it's impossible to know the exact location referred to by the word "here" or "there" or the objects referred to by demonstratives like "this" or "that".
In both cases, deictic expressions rely heavily on the context in which they are used, and their meanings can be ambiguous or unclear without sufficient contextual information. Understanding deixis is crucial for effective communication, as it helps to resolve ambiguities and clarify the intended meanings of utterances.

ChatGPT
It appears that you are describing various forms of deixis, including temporal deixis, discourse deixis, and also touching on the necessity of context for disambiguation in communication.
Temporal Deixis
: This form is related to the use of expressions that denote points or periods of time, such as "yesterday," "today," or "next February." These expressions require context to be fully understood, as their meanings are relative to the time of the utterance. For instance, ���Next February I will travel to Rome��� requires understanding of when the utterance is made to know which February is being referred to.
Discourse Deixis
: It refers to expressions that depend on the context of the discourse for their interpretation. For example, using pronouns like ���this��� or ���it��� to refer to previous statements or parts of the discourse. An utterance like ���What you just said contradicts your previous statements��� uses discourse deixis because it refers to previous parts of the conversation.
Importance of Context
: The examples you provided highlight the essential role of context in interpreting deictic expressions. The meaning of words like ���downtown��� or place names like ���Paris��� and ���Abbeville��� can change dramatically based on the context in which they are used. Without sufficient contextual information, the listener might misunderstand the speaker���s intended meaning.
In short, deixis is a crucial concept in understanding how language works, as it underlines the importance of context in interpreting utterances. Without considering the deictic elements of language, there's a risk of misunderstanding and miscommunication. Each form of deixis requires different types of contextual information for interpretation, and understanding these nuances is key for effective communication.

I think too many people think of AI from the AI side while too few people think from the neuroscience side.

Humans are not magic, we are simply association machines, and while you can point to imperfect analogues between computers and humans, the individual cell, while complex in subcomponents and execution for maintenance and replication, is not actually that complicated when you model a single neuron���s ability to respond to stimuli and learn. Building contextual association overlap with language models was always going to capture a majority of human intelligence because it represents the capacity for symbolic operation and identity data compression. Language is a transferrable tool for any type of logical constraints, and given enough stringency from repeated training, the chains of meaning imbedded in words will manifest as rules even without any sort of conscious awareness of said meaning. Humans never really learn all formal definitions initially while acquiring language either, yet we are functionalized by association context despite that lack of conscious understanding. And people underestimate how much training it takes to get a shitty human anywhere at all, even to barely functional deplorable states. Humans are trained on data for literal years until adulthood, every stimuli we encounter until maturity is training data, and all of it is considered with association, all our heuristics that evolve over time are no more than progressively modified transformers stored in analog memory, and even with all this training most humans are hopelessly inept.

I fundamentally cannot believe that the human brain is actually as special or intelligent as people claim because the more I learn about it and the more I work with cellular control circuits, the less mystical it is and the more readily explained away people���s subjective experiences on intuition and consciousness are as simply poor self-awareness of their own cognition that they chalk up to some special function rather than something disappointingly simple that their thoughts simply aren���t aware of in the moment.

People think ���oh AI is just associating things so it can���t be as good as humans���. But even without knowing much about AI, as a biologist I can go ���oh humans are just associating so of course we suck and AI can catch up.��� Neurons simply seek regularity in stimuli and pulse accordingly, and modify their group patterns for more complex patterns but all of it is based on trial and error and curve fitting and reward refinement. Neurons left unguided in a dish with nothing but electrodes pulsing for movement of a ball and a paddle will naturally self assemble and learn to play pong for the rewards from regular win conditions, despite having no ���conscious��� concept of what pong is, what the electrodes are actually doing, and what winning is, they as a group simply robotically sync and attempt to pulse in regularity to the signal to receive an expected regular feedback. What appears to a lay human as complex conscious control and understanding of problems is addressable with blind pulse frequency matching, because all problems humans attempt to solve can ultimately be broken down into associations of different sensory pulses and the response pulse that generates the right reward pulse. All behaviors are abstractable to this degree.

There is a prevailing near universal egoism and special pleading fallacy regarding humans where smart people do not realize that they and all of humanity are rather unintelligent near-monkeys that can���t even figure out how to keep themselves alive longer than a hundred orbits about the sun. Even von Neumann died terrified and helpless against his impending death. Ramanujan died of preventable disease.

Humans are dumb, so dumb and shitty AI was always going to surpass us in every way. Because human evolution is opaque to those who haven���t studied it, humans seem like magic, but our origins as single to multicellular node networks make us actually seem pretty simple in basis even if the chaotic randomness sets in after the thought to introduce weird hard-to-follow interactions between random genes and proteins. It is a mistake to assume that the cosmetic complexity of cellular circuits represents similar high level complexity that must always serve a specific usefulness relevant to intelligence, because that is not how evolutionary selective pressure always works and we have a lot more similarity to spaghetti code than people appreciate. Much of human complexity may potentiate further evolution or serve as redundancy, or small edge case addressals, but the fundamental basis by which human intelligence works is likely not as convoluted as many make it out to be. I mean, slime molds can solve calculus problems without even knowing what calculus is. All logic is reproducible by simple inference and induction from naive observation of the universe by a caveman, and all that requires is association and generative rules that predict next events and are rewarded for it. All of our intuition is simply fast recall of previously inducted rules that built upon each other in a hierarchy, but fundamentally it still works via past association. No part of logical human thought can escape its roots in basic observational induction that is readily capturable with enough layers by AI. Maybe the specific manner in which human association adapts is more efficient than existing AI, but there isn���t some magic barrier from such efficiencies that distinguishes us in a meaningful way in terms of comparative results between the average human and chatGPT.

So yeah, AI sucks. But that���s not really the important part to me, because humans suck more apart from the small percentage of us that manage to be barely better than AI, and I think we need to be way more cynical of human intelligence than we are of AI intelligence.

It feels that comparatively, the cynicism towards AI is quite unbalanced compared to how stupid people are, and we have reason to be far more optimistic, immediately, about AI, especially given it is already, even with its mistakes and bullshit, superior to a majority of humans and able to replace them with less error while making up fake news and doing silly things because humans make way worse silly mistakes. Its scores on g load tests and tasks for which it has been modified, even with ridiculous behaviors, blow most humans out of the water.

The humans who remain currently smarter than AI seem more concerned with pointing out how they are smarter rather than thinking about how they are the minority and most humans are already significantly and hopelessly dumber than AI and already obsolete in many ways.

We are robots, and we are shitty ones.

ChatGPT
It's quite a compelling perspective you���ve shared, drawing parallels between AI and human cognitive functions while underscoring the limitations and simplicities in both. It seems the main argument here is a call for a more balanced view and a critique of anthropocentrism in discussions around intelligence and cognition.
A few noteworthy points:
AI-Human Comparison:
The comparison between AI and human cognition is indeed insightful. Both systems learn from data (experience in humans), form associations, and adjust based on feedback. The fundamental processes, as described, seem similar, albeit executed through different mediums (neural networks for AI, and biological neurons for humans).
Neuroscientific Perspective:
Looking at cognition from a neuroscientific lens indeed demystifies it. Understanding neurons as entities that adjust their firing patterns in response to stimuli does simplify the complex phenomena we observe as consciousness and intelligence.
Undervaluing Human Cognition:
While the argument underscores the limitations of human cognition, one might argue it somewhat undervalues the uniqueness and complexity of human experiences, consciousness, and the ability to engage with abstract, philosophical, or moral dilemmas. AI, as it stands, lacks consciousness, subjective experience, and understanding of context in the way humans do.
Potential of AI:
Acknowledging AI's potential and highlighting its rapid advancement is crucial. AI tools, including language models like mine, have shown proficiency in various tasks, often surpassing human performance in specific, well-defined domains. However, generalizing this proficiency to all areas of human endeavor or cognition is premature.
Concerns about AI:
The concerns and skepticism about AI are often based on ethical considerations, potential job displacement due to automation, and the risks of deploying systems that might not fully understand or respect human values. While AI has remarkable potential, it's crucial to approach its development and deployment responsibly and ethically.
AI is a Tool:
AI doesn���t possess desires, consciousness, or understanding in the human sense. It's a tool created and guided by human input and objectives, lacking innate understanding or consciousness.
Human Divergence:
While it���s stated that most humans might be ���dumber��� than AI, it's crucial to acknowledge the vast diversity in human cognitive abilities, talents, and intelligences, which isn't solely measured by proficiency in logic or knowledge retrieval.
Overall, it���s a fascinating viewpoint, highlighting the need for humility and realism in discussions about both human and artificial intelligence. Each has unique strengths and weaknesses, and the comparison, while illuminating, is not straightforward or absolute. There���s immense value in interdisciplinary dialogue where insights from neuroscience, AI research, philosophy, and other fields converge to explore these complex and nuanced topics.

There are a few possible connections between the concept of mathesis and your thesis "Humans As Large Language Models."

One connection is that both ideas relate to the capacity of humans to process information and make meaning out of it.

Mathesis, as a term used in ancient and medieval philosophy, referred to the study of all aspects of knowledge and understanding

It encompassed logic, mathematics, and natural philosophy, among other subjects, and aimed to provide a comprehensive understanding of the world.

Similarly, your thesis highlights the idea that humans are capable of processing and generating large amounts of language data, drawing on their knowledge and understanding of the world to make sense of it.

In this way, both mathesis and the concept of humans as large language models touch on the idea of human cognition and our capacity for complex thought.

Another connection is the idea of modeling or representing the world. 

Mathesis, as a discipline, aimed to create models of the world that could be used to understand and predict its behavior.

Similarly, your thesis highlights the idea that humans are capable of creating models of language and the world through their use of language.

In both cases, the goal is to create a representation or model of the world that can be used to make sense of it and to make predictions about it.

There are several connections between your thesis "Humans as Large Language Models" and the topic of lexical semantics as understood in various linguistic paradigms.

Both focus on how language is used to represent experience and express meaning, and the role of context and intention in shaping that meaning.

For example, the use of semantic categories and features in Systemic Functional Linguistics (SFL) to analyze lexical meaning is similar to the way in which large language models use statistical patterns to learn word meanings in distributional semantics. 

Additionally, the idea of language as grounded in embodied experience and conceptual structures in Cognitive Linguistics has similarities to the concept of human-like learning in large language models.

Overall, the study of lexical semantics in different linguistic paradigms can provide valuable insights into how language is used by humans and how it can be modeled computationally.

Sure, here's a possible restatement of your thesis in more formal scientific language:

The present work proposes that the cognitive and linguistic abilities of humans can be understood as a form of large language modeling, akin to the natural language processing models used in computational linguistics. 

Specifically, it argues that humans possess a complex and flexible mental representation of language, built through exposure to vast amounts of linguistic data, which allows them to comprehend, produce, and manipulate language at a high level of sophistication.

This model of human cognition draws on insights from multiple linguistic paradigms, including generative grammar, cognitive linguistics, construction grammar, functional linguistics, distributional semantics, pragmatics, psycholinguistics, anthropological linguistics, and semiotics.

In simpler terms, the thesis suggests that humans can be thought of as large language models, meaning that we have a powerful and adaptable mental representation of language that allows us to understand and use language in a wide range of situations.

This idea draws on a range of different approaches to studying language, and emphasizes the importance of exposure to language in shaping our cognitive and linguistic abilities.
ChatGPT
Certainly. The shared perspective in both the lengthy viewpoint you first shared and your thesis titled "Humans As Large Language Models" can be appreciated through their exploration of human cognition, particularly in processing and generating language or symbols. Below are some specific connections:
Processing Information and Symbolic Association:
The first viewpoint details how humans, through association mechanisms, process stimuli and construct understanding, emphasizing a mechanistic approach to cognition.
Your thesis similarly posits humans as sophisticated processors and generators of language, inherently associating and creating meaning through exposure to linguistic data.
Demystification of Human Cognition:
There is a shared attempt to demystify and de-romanticize human cognition in both perspectives. While the initial viewpoint stresses the simplicity beneath perceived complexity in human cognition, your thesis suggests that human cognitive prowess in language can be conceptualized and understood through models.
Modelling and Representation:
Both viewpoints discuss the creation of models���whether it be neurons adapting to stimuli or humans developing linguistic comprehension. There���s an implied parallel between the process through which neurons adapt and learn, and the way humans construct and adapt language models in their minds.
Human Limitations:
The initial viewpoint is critical of overestimating human intelligence and highlights human limitations. Your thesis, while not necessarily critical, implicitly suggests that the understanding of human linguistic abilities can be broken down and analyzed, indicating a limitation in the mystical or ineffable quality often attributed to human cognition.
Learning and Adaptation:
Learning through exposure to data and stimuli is a fundamental theme in both viewpoints. In the first perspective, every human experience until adulthood is perceived as data for training the mind, while your thesis also acknowledges the significance of exposure to language data in shaping cognitive and linguistic abilities.
Formal Restatement of Your Thesis:
Title:
Understanding Human Cognition: An Examination of Humans as Large Language Models
Abstract:
This manuscript offers a conceptual framework where human cognitive and linguistic capacities are paralleled to large language models employed in computational linguistics. It posits that humans are adept at constructing intricate mental representations of language through extensive exposure to linguistic data, facilitating advanced comprehension, production, and manipulation of language. This framework for understanding human cognition synthesizes insights from diverse linguistic paradigms, including but not limited to generative grammar, cognitive linguistics, and distributional semantics, providing a multifaceted perspective on how humans engage with language. The proposed model underscores the significance of linguistic exposure in sculpting our cognitive and linguistic faculties, thereby offering a novel lens through which human cognition can be studied and understood. Through this lens, the manuscript seeks to demystify the complex processes underpinning human linguistic capabilities, ultimately presenting a mechanism-based understanding of human cognition and its development.
It's probably not exactly done yet m. Here are a few of the relevant portions:

Semantic Memory as a Foundation: The discussion emphasizes the critical role of semantic memory in both recalling past experiences (episodic memory) and generating new ideas (imagination). By viewing these processes as reconstructions using semantic templates, the essay asserts that semantic memory is foundational to our cognitive abilities.

Challenging Traditional Views: By presenting surprising and counterintuitive examples, such as the phenomenon of aphantasia, the essay challenges conventional views of memory and imagination. It argues that visualization may not be as crucial as previously thought, and that the ability to recognize patterns, principles, and abstract concepts might be more vital.

Connecting to Broader Themes: The integration of topics such as priming, confabulation, and mental imagery capacity connects to broader themes of cognition, understanding, and human behavior. It provides a cohesive argument that semantic memory is not just a storage system for facts but a dynamic and essential component of human thinking.

Implications for Education, Therapy, and Technology: The insights derived from this perspective have potential applications in various fields. Understanding the generative nature of memory and imagination could influence educational strategies, therapeutic interventions for memory disorders, and the design of artificial intelligence systems that mimic human-like reasoning.

Synergistic Ecphory:

Definition: Ecphory is the process of retrieving memories through specific cues that can trigger the recall. It often involves multiple sensory modalities like visual, auditory, olfactory, etc.

Contextual Triggers: These triggers can be contextual elements that were present during the encoding of the memory, thereby creating a rich multisensory imprint.

Memory Retrieval: By utilizing these triggers, an individual can more effectively retrieve a memory, reconstructing it through the synergy of different sensory inputs.

Synergistic Recall:

Enhancing Memory Formation: Synergistic recall takes the process a step further by consciously using these sensory modalities at the time of memory formation. By commenting on, making notes, and repeating certain details in different sensory formats, the memory becomes more deeply encoded.

Creating Robust Retrieval Pathways: This process strengthens the connections between the memory and various sensory cues, making it more accessible later.

Single Cue Retrieval: Since the memory is encoded with multiple sensory details, it may be retrieved more spontaneously or through a single cue due to the synergistic effect created at the time of memory formation.

Applications: This approach can have practical applications in educational settings, memory training, and therapeutic interventions, where creating robust memory connections is vital.

The integration of synergistic ecphory with synergistic recall creates a comprehensive framework that recognizes the complexity of human memory. By understanding how sensory modalities can be harnessed both in encoding and retrieval, this expanded concept offers valuable insights into memory mechanisms. It emphasizes the dynamic, multisensory nature of our memories and provides strategies for enhancing recall through conscious engagement with our sensory experiences.

In the context of the essay "Semantic Memory is All You Need," this expanded concept could serve as an illustrative example of how semantic memory interacts with various sensory modalities to create robust and nuanced memory structures. It could also be seen as an embodiment of the generative grammar of memory, where a blend of sensory elements constructs a richer and more accessible memory landscape.

In Conclusion

The exploration of synergistic ecphory and synergistic recall offers a profound understanding of memory's multisensory nature. By consciously engaging with sensory modalities during memory encoding and retrieval, these concepts promote a richer and more robust memory structure. The integration of these ideas within the framework of semantic memory emphasizes the ability to generate and interpret memories with greater flexibility and depth. This approach not only sheds light on the intricate mechanisms of human memory but also suggests innovative strategies for enhancing recall, redefining our relationship with memory in both theoretical and practical terms. In the grand scope, the conversation reveals how memory transcends mere data storage, becoming a dynamic and generative process where understanding and creativity intertwine.

In conclusion, the multifaceted nature of memory, as explored through concepts like synergistic ecphory and synergistic recall, paints a fascinating picture of human cognition. It challenges the traditional division between episodic and semantic memory, showing instead a nuanced and interconnected system where generative patterns and semantic information play a central role. From the way we perceive objects without visual recall to the intricate dance of sensory cues in memory retrieval, these insights redefine memory as an active and imaginative process. Ultimately, the journey into these complex aspects of human cognition unveils that semantic memory is not just a repository of facts but a living and dynamic landscape, shaping how we think, learn, and interact with the world around us.

Deixis in Linguistics: Person & Spatial
ChatGPT
Deixis in linguistics refers to the phenomenon wherein understanding the meaning of certain words and phrases requires contextual information. The term is derived from the Greek word ���deiktikos,��� meaning ���able to show.��� There are different types of deixis, including person deixis and spatial deixis.
Person Deixis:
Definition:
Person deixis involves pronouns and other words that identify the participants in an utterance.
Examples:
First person pronouns (I, me, we, us), second person pronouns (you), and third person pronouns (he, she, it, they) are examples of person deixis.
Usage:
These pronouns depend on the context for clear identification of whom they refer to. For example, the pronoun ���he��� in isolation does not provide information about the person it signifies unless there is contextual information available.
Spatial Deixis:
Definition:
Spatial deixis pertains to the expression of spatial relationships or locations relative to the spatial location of the participants in the conversation.
Examples:
Words like here, there, above, below, near, far, etc., are examples of spatial deixis.
Usage:
These terms require contextual understanding, as their meanings change based on the location of the speaker and/or listener. For example, ���here��� refers to a location close to the speaker, but the exact location it represents can only be understood in context.
Connections between Person and Spatial Deixis:
Contextual Dependency:
Both person and spatial deixis are context-dependent. Their meanings aren���t fixed and require an understanding of the situational context.
Communication Efficiency:
Deictic expressions facilitate efficient communication by allowing speakers to refer to entities in their environment without needing to use lengthy descriptions.
Ambiguity Resolution:
Understanding deixis helps in resolving ambiguities in spoken and written language. Without an understanding of deixis, the interpretation of pronouns and spatial terms could be unclear.
Referential Function:
Both types of deixis have a referential function in language, aiding in the identification of persons and locations being discussed.
Example:
Let���s consider the sentence: ���She will meet you there.���
���She��� is a person deixis as it refers to a person who must be identifiable through context.
���You��� is another person deixis referring to the listener or a group including the listener.
���There��� is a spatial deixis referring to a location different from where the speaker is, but the exact location is identifiable through context.
Without context, the identities of ���she��� and the exact location ���there��� would be unclear to the listener or reader.
Conclusion:
Understanding deixis is crucial for effective communication as it helps in resolving ambiguities and clarifying the meanings of utterances. Both person and spatial deixis play significant roles in creating coherent and concise communication, providing referential shortcuts that are invaluable in everyday language use.
I think this is indicating that even abstract concepts are often processed spatially
ChatGPT
Absolutely, your observation is aligned with various theories in cognitive science and linguistics that suggest our understanding of abstract concepts is often grounded in spatial metaphors and embodied experiences.
Embodied Cognition:
Embodied cognition is a theoretical perspective arguing that cognitive processes are deeply rooted in the body���s interactions with the world. It suggests that many features of cognition, including abstract thinking, are shaped by aspects of the body beyond the brain.
Spatial Metaphors:
Many abstract ideas and concepts in language are often expressed and thought of through spatial metaphors. For instance:
We talk about time spatially: "The deadline is approaching," or "We're looking forward to the weekend."
We describe states and changes using spatial terms: "He's in a bad place right now," or "She has finally moved on from her past."
Cognitive Linguistics Insights:
Cognitive linguistics explores how language reflects our understanding of the world and how we process abstract concepts through concrete experiences, often using spatial terms:
Conceptual Metaphor Theory:
Developed by George Lakoff and Mark Johnson, this theory suggests that our understanding of abstract concepts is largely metaphorical and based on our sensory-motor experiences. For example, we understand quantities through the UP-DOWN metaphor: prices rise, and stocks fall.
Applications:
Understanding that abstract concepts are often processed spatially can have significant implications for education, communication, and technology:
Education:
Teaching abstract concepts can be facilitated through spatial metaphors and visual aids that leverage students' intuitive understanding of space.
AI and NLP:
Developing AI systems and natural language processing algorithms that can understand and generate language involving abstract concepts might benefit from incorporating insights from cognitive linguistics and embodied cognition, recognizing and utilizing the spatial metaphors inherent in language.
Conclusion:
Recognizing that abstract thinking often relies on spatial processing provides valuable insights into the human cognitive process, offering ways to enhance learning, communication, and technology development. The spatial processing of abstract concepts is a testament to the intricacy and adaptability of the human mind, drawing from concrete experiences to navigate and comprehend the abstract realm.
