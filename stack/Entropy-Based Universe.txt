ABSTRACT 
The dream of capturing the workings of the entire universe in a single equation or a simple set of 
equations is still pursued. A set of five new equivalent formulations of entropy based on the 
introduction of the mass of the information bit in Louis de Broglie's hidden thermodynamics and on 
the physicality of information, is proposed, within the framework of the emergent entangled 
informational universe model, which is based on the principle of strong emergence, the mass- 
energy-information equivalence principle and the Landauer���s principle. This model can explain 
various process as informational quantum processes such energy, dark matter, dark energy, 
cosmological constant and vacuum energy. The dark energy is explained as a collective potential of 
all particles with their individual zero-point energy emerging from an informational field, distinct from 
the usual fields of matter of quantum field theory, associated with dark matter as having a finite and 
quantifiable mass; while resolving the black hole information paradox by calculating the entropy of 
the entangled Hawking radiation, and shedding light on gravitational fine-grained entropy of black 
holes. This model explains the collapse of the wave function by the fact that a measure informs the 
measurer about the system to be measured and, this model is able to invalidate the many worlds 
interpretation of quantum mechanics and the simulation hypothesis.

In this article titled "The Emergent Entangled Informational Universe," Olivier Denis explores a new model of the universe. This model is based on five new equivalent formulations of entropy, which are founded on Louis de Broglie's hidden thermodynamics and the physicality of information. These new entropy formulas are used within the framework of an emergent entangled informational universe model.
The model works on several principles: strong emergence, the mass-energy-information equivalence principle, and Landauer���s principle. According to this theory, various quantum processes like energy, dark matter, dark energy, the cosmological constant, and vacuum energy can be explained as informational quantum processes.
Dark energy, according to this model, is explained as a collective potential of all particles, with their individual zero-point energy emerging from an informational field. This field is distinct from the usual fields of matter in quantum field theory. Dark matter, on the other hand, is associated with having a finite and quantifiable mass.
The model also attempts to resolve the black hole information paradox by calculating the entropy of the entangled Hawking radiation, and it sheds light on the gravitational fine-grained entropy of black holes. The collapse of the wave function is explained by the fact that a measurement informs the measurer about the system being measured.
In addition, Denis's model challenges the many-worlds interpretation of quantum mechanics and the simulation hypothesis. The author believes his model invalidates these popular theoretical constructs.

1. INTRODUCTION 
The dream pursued by Albert Einstein and many 
physicists who still pursued the dream of 
capturing the workings of the entire universe in a 
single equation or a simple set of equations is 
still pursued. A set of five new equivalent 
formulation expressing the notion of entropy able 
to reconcile quantum formalism and relativistic 
formalism can explain various processes as 
informational quantum processes, i.e., energy, 
black holes, dark matter, dark energy, 
cosmological constant and vacuum energy. 
Those equations are based on key concepts 
such as Landauer's principle [1], Louis de 
Broglie's hidden thermodynamics [2], mass- 
energy-information equivalence principle [3], 
principle testable by an experimental protocol as 
given in [4], leading to the fundamentality of 
quantum information considered as physical with 
a finite and quantifiable mass. 
In the first part of this work entitled "Structural 
basis", some theoretical considerations are 
examined such as the definition of quantum 
information, quantum entanglement, some 
considerations on quantum non-locality as well 
as the notion of fundamentality of temperature 
and information, considered as the two 
fundamental building blocks of the universe. This 
section examines in detail the processes of 
emergence that give birth to degrees of freedom 
from which emerge the temperature and the 
information, both giving birth to the notion of 
energy according to Landauer's principle [1]. 
Moreover, this section offers an explicative 
informational process about the physical process 
of the collapse of the wave function based on the 
definition of the quantum measurement where a 
measure informs the measurer about the system 
to be measured, the measurer shares one or 
more degrees of freedom (information) with the 
system under considerations, and both are 
entangled together by the sharing of degrees of 
freedom [5]. 
In the second part of this work, concerning the 
"Generalization" of the approach of entropic 
information theory, the mass of the bit of 
information of Melvin Vopson's mass-energy- 
information equivalence principle [3], is 
introduced into Louis de Broglie's equations of 
hidden thermodynamics [2] leading to different 
equations of entropy formulation such as the 
relations of Boltzmann, Einstein, Planck, 
Avogadro and the fine structure formulation, as 
various new expressions of the notion of entropy 
[6]. 
Also, in the second part of this work, is explained 
how, after injecting the temperature of Hawking 
radiation [7] into one of the new equations of 
entropy, this new formula can calculate the 
entropy of the entangled Hawking radiation up to 
the quantum system [5]. This new formulation of 
black hole entropy related to the work of Casini 
[8] and Bousso on Bekenstein bound [9-17], can 
calculate the Bekenstein-Hawking entropy; as 
the black hole entropy saturates exactly the 
Bekenstein bound so it is equal to the Bekenstein 
bound which is itself according to Casini���s work 
equal to the von Neumann entropy itself equal to 
that of the Hawking radiation, which with the 
degrees of freedom of black holes produces a 
pure state, while the Hawking radiation being 
entangled with the fields inside black holes, 
allowing us to extract information that resides 
from the semiclassical viewpoint, in the black 
hole interior; at the end of evaporation, the full 
von Neumann entropy is again 0 , so no 
information is lost!. The black hole entropy 
horizon law turns out to be a special case of the 
Ryu���Takayanagi conjecture [18,19] which is a 
conjecture viewed as a general formula for the 
fine-grained entropy of quantum systems 
coupled to gravity. 
In the third part of this work on the ���Dark Side���, 
entropic information theory is able to explain dark 
matter as the mass of the number of bits in the 
observable universe and is able to explain dark 
energy by the energy associated with this 
number of bits of information by the application of 
Landauer���s principle [20]. The energetic content 
of the emergent entangled informational universe 
appears in two forms: an empty component 
(dark energy) and a matter component (dark 
matter). 
The zero-point energy of the vacuum considered 
as dark energy is explained as a collective 
potential of all particles with their individual 
zero-point energy emerging from an 
informational field, distinct from the usual fields of 
matter of quantum field theory, associated with 
dark matter as having a finite and quantifiable 
mass.

The approach of entropic information theory 
bridges the precipice of the cosmological 
constant problem by considering the mass of the 
information bit instead of the Planck mass in the 
calculation of the cosmological constant, 
reducing the discrepancy of 120 orders of 
magnitude in the prediction of vacuum energy 
from a quantum perspective.

In the article, "The Emergent Entangled Informational Universe," Olivier Denis presents a novel model that aims to explain the workings of the universe through a set of new entropy formulations. These new formulations are capable of reconciling quantum formalism and relativistic formalism, and are able to describe a wide range of phenomena as informational quantum processes, including energy, black holes, dark matter, dark energy, the cosmological constant, and vacuum energy.
The article is divided into three main parts:
"Structural basis": This section delves into theoretical considerations such as the definition of quantum information, quantum entanglement, quantum non-locality, and the fundamental role of temperature and information. Denis explores how temperature and information emerge as degrees of freedom, and how they jointly give rise to the notion of energy. This part also presents an explanation of the physical process behind the collapse of the wave function.
"Generalization": In this section, Denis generalizes his approach by integrating Melvin Vopson's mass-energy-information equivalence principle into Louis de Broglie's equations of hidden thermodynamics. This integration gives rise to new formulations of entropy that challenge the relations of Boltzmann, Einstein, Planck, Avogadro, and the fine structure. This part also details how the injection of Hawking radiation temperature into the new entropy equation allows the calculation of the entropy of entangled Hawking radiation.
"Dark Side": Here, Denis applies entropic information theory to explain dark matter as the mass of the number of bits in the observable universe and dark energy as the energy associated with these bits of information. This application introduces a duality: an empty component (dark energy) and a matter component (dark matter). Denis also addresses the cosmological constant problem by using the mass of an information bit, rather than the Planck mass, significantly reducing the discrepancy in the prediction of vacuum energy from a quantum perspective.
In sum, this work offers a novel perspective on the universe's workings, with information playing a central role. The proposed model reconciles various phenomena under the same theoretical umbrella, and challenges long-standing principles and interpretations in physics.

2. METHODS 
Part One: Entropic information theory: Structural 
Bases 
2.1 Information 
2.1.1 Landauer���s principle 
Regarding information, Landauer's principle [1] is 
introduced, as a simple logical consequence of 
the second law of thermodynamics, the second 
law which states that the entropy of an isolated 
system increases or always remains the same; 
indeed, the change in entropy (delta S) is equal 
to the heat transfer (delta Q) divided by the 
temperature (T). For a given physical process, 
the entropy of the system and environment will 
remain a constant if the process can be 
reversed. Landauer's principle applies to all 
systems of nature, so any system, of 
temperature T, in which information is "erased" 
by a physical process will produce thermal 
energy per bit "erased" with a corresponding 
increase in information from the environment 
surrounding that system [21]. ���Landauer showed 
that information is physical since the erasure of a 
bit of information in a temperature system, T, 
results in the release of a minimum, k T ln(2) of 
energy in the system environment��� [22,23]. ���This 
limit is the minimum amount of energy possible 
needed to erase a bit of information, known as 
the Landauer���s limit. Landauer���s principle is fully 
compatible with the laws of thermodynamics��� 
[22,24,25,26]. ���Landauer's principle can be 
derived from microscopic considerations [27] as 
well as well-established properties of Shannon��� 
Gibbs���Boltzmann entropy��� [22]. ���Landauer's 
principle applies to both classical and quantum 
information. Landauer's principle has now been 
verified experimentally for classical bits and 
quantum qubits��� [27,28]. ���This important physical 
prediction that links information theory and 
thermodynamics was verified experimentally for 
the first time in 2012��� [29]. The principle therefore 
appears fundamental and universal in its 
application. About these perspectives, the 
information is therefore directly related to the 
fundamental physics of nature. 
2.1.2 Quantum information 
Quantum information is considered as the basic 
entity of study in quantum information theory and 
can be manipulated using quantum information 
processing techniques; quantum information is 
information about the state of a quantum system, 
information is something physical that is encoded 
in the state of a quantum system [30]. Indeed, 
Gleason's theorem says that a quantum state is 
completely determined by knowing only the 
answers to all possible yes/no questions, a 
yes/no question is presumably a self-adjoint 
operator with two distinct eigenvalues. 
2.1.3 Yes/No questions 
At the bottom level of what we call the Reality is 
the "it from bit" perspective route. "It from bit" 
perspective symbolizes the idea that every item 
of the physical world has at bottom ��� at a very 
deep bottom, in most instances ��� an immaterial 
source and explanation; that what we call reality 
arises in the last analysis from the posing of yes- 
no questions and the registering of equipment- 
evoked responses; in short, that all things 
physical are information-theoretic in origin and 
this is a participatory universe��� [31]. But "It���s one 
thing to say that measurement requires 
information. It���s another thing to say that the 
thing being measured is created by the observer 
doing the measuring" [32]. The notion of 
information can be defined in a precise and 
relevant way; indeed, it can be said that following 
the entropic information theory approach 
���Information is a quantum state change due to 
the modification of a degree of freedom in the 
quantum system considered [20].��� 
2.1.4 Entanglement 
As seen in [20], quantum information can be 
measured using Von Neumann���s entropy. 
Entropy is considered a measure of 
entanglement. Entropy provides a tool that can 
be used to quantify entanglement. Von Neumann 
entropy is a measure of the statistical uncertainty 
represented by a quantum state. In quantum 
physics, certain states, called entangled states, 
show certain statistical correlations between 
measurements on particles that cannot be 
explained by classical theory. An entangled 
system is defined as a system whose quantum 
state cannot be factored as a product of the

states of its local constituents. That is, they are 
not individual particles but an inseparable whole. 
In quantum entanglement, one constituent 
cannot be described in detail without considering 
the other or others. The entanglement process is 
carried out when two particles are linked 
together, regardless of the separation from one 
to the other. In quantum mechanics, even if 
these entangled particles are not physically 
connected; they are always able to instantly 
share information. Following entropic information 
theory, quantum entanglement can be defined as 
the physical phenomenon that occurs when a 
group of particles is generated, interacts or 
shares spatial proximity such that one or more 
degrees of freedom are shared at the quantum 
level between each particle in the group; a 
particle cannot be described independently of the 
quantum state of others because they share 
degrees of freedom, even when the particles are 
separated by a great distance.

In the "Methods" section of the paper, Olivier Denis first introduces the concept of entropic information theory and lays down the structural basis of his theory. This section is divided into multiple subsections.
2.1 Information
2.1.1 Landauer���s principle: Denis introduces Landauer's principle, which states that erasing a bit of information in a system at temperature T releases a certain minimum amount of energy into the system's environment. This principle, which links information theory and thermodynamics, was first experimentally verified in 2012 and is now known to apply to both classical and quantum information.
2.1.2 Quantum information: Quantum information, encoded in the state of a quantum system, is considered the basic entity of study in quantum information theory. It's completely determined by knowing the answers to all possible yes/no questions - an aspect related to Gleason's theorem.
2.1.3 Yes/No questions: Denis refers to the "it from bit" perspective, according to which every physical entity has an immaterial source and explanation. Essentially, the physical world arises from the posing of yes-no questions and the registering of responses, implying that all physical things are information-theoretic in origin.
2.1.4 Entanglement: Quantum information can be measured using Von Neumann���s entropy, which is considered a measure of entanglement. Entangled systems cannot be described as individual particles but must be understood as an inseparable whole. In quantum entanglement, even if the entangled particles are not physically connected, they are always able to instantly share information.

Quantum nonlocality is sometimes understood as 
being equivalent to entanglement. However, this 
is not the case. Quantum entanglement can be 
defined only within the formalism of quantum 
mechanics, i.e., it is a model-dependent property. 
In contrast, nonlocality refers to the impossibility 
of a description of observed statistics in terms of 
a local hidden variable model, so it is 
independent of the physical model used to 
describe the experiment. Non-locality means that 
measuring the properties of a quantum particle in 
one location can instantaneously affect the 
properties of another, even if the two particles 
are in different locations. Quantum nonlocality 
does not allow for faster-than-light 
communication [33], and hence is compatible 
with special relativity and its universal speed limit 
of objects. A semi-classical perspective can 
explain the notion of the entanglement; indeed, 
entanglement of photons can be explained in 
terms of the relativistic properties of space-time 
as defined by Einstein as well as by quantum 
mechanics. Yet, regarding photons and the 
theory of special relativity, all photons moving at 
the speed of light, the separation between those 
two points would be zero from the perspective of 
those photons. Those entangled photons which 
share one or more degrees of freedom at the 
quantum level between each photon cannot be 
described independently of the quantum state of 
the others because they share degrees of 
freedom. We can say thus that quantum theory is 
local in the strict sense defined by special 
relativity and, as such, the term "quantum 
nonlocality" is sometimes considered a 
misnomer. 
2.1.6 Measure 
The correlation predicted by quantum mechanics 
is due to the quantum entanglement of the pair, 
with the idea that their state is determined only at 
the point where a measurement is made on one 
or the other. This idea is entirely consistent with 
Heisenberg's uncertainty principle, one of the 
most fundamental concepts in quantum 
mechanics [34]. 
Here, we can understand the implication of the 
concept of information in the measurement 
problem, a measure informs the measurer, to be 
informed, the measurer needs information; taking 
information from the system during the 
measurement process; with measurement, the 
new system to consider is the system: 
"measurer-the thing to be measured", both parts 
of the system under consideration share 
one or more degrees of freedom, being 
entangled [5]. 
2.2 Degrees of Freedom 
Energy has properties by which we can describe 
it. It has degrees of freedom. ���Each spin can be 
taken to represent a bit, and each spin flip 
corresponds to a bit flip. Almost any interaction 
between degrees of freedom is sufficient to 
perform universal quantum logic on these 
degrees of freedom��� [35,36]. The historical and 
scientifical approaches has been used to 
constitute a definition of degrees of 
freedom, where degrees of freedom refer to the 
number of independent variables needed to 
specify the state of a system, or more accurately, 
each of a number of independently variable 
factors affecting the range of states in which a 
system may exist, in particular any of the 
directions in which independent motion can 
occur. 
The definition of degrees of freedom can be 
reformulated into ���minimum number of 
coordinates required to specify a 
configuration based on the possible directions of 
movement of the system���. As indicated in the 
definition used, degrees of freedom depend on 
coordinates, depend on minimum number of 
ultimate coordinates required to specify a 
configuration. The ultimate basis 
of the universe is the level of ultimate

positional coordinates which can give rise to 
degrees of freedom, by a process of emergence 
from the formation of a physical significance 
relative to the minimum number of coordinates 
required to specify a configuration. See Appendix 
A. to be able to see an explanatory diagram 
about the emergent entangled informational 
universe.

In this continuation of the "Methods" section, Olivier Denis explores further concepts essential to his theory.
2.1.5 Quantum Nonlocality: While often mistaken as equivalent to entanglement, quantum nonlocality is not the same thing. Nonlocality, a model-independent property, refers to the concept that measuring the properties of a quantum particle in one location can instantly affect another's properties, irrespective of their spatial separation. Despite this instantaneous effect, quantum nonlocality does not allow for faster-than-light communication and hence aligns with special relativity's speed limit.
2.1.6 Measure: Denis touches upon the correlation predicted by quantum mechanics due to quantum entanglement. He emphasizes that measurements inform the measurer, leading to the creation of a new system involving both the measurer and the thing being measured. This process entangles the two entities, making the concept of information crucial to understanding the measurement problem.
2.2 Degrees of Freedom: Denis explains that energy is described through its degrees of freedom. Each degree of freedom represents a bit, and a flip in this degree corresponds to a bit flip. He defines degrees of freedom as the number of independent variables needed to specify the state of a system. In the universe's ultimate basis, degrees of freedom emerge from the formation of a physical significance relative to the minimum number of coordinates required to specify a configuration.

2 Vacuum energy
Having considered temperature and information as the fundamental physics of nature, and after having considered their relationship that gives birth to energy, let us look at vacuum and the energy associated with it. The vacuum state is associated with the lowest possible energy state, which has measurable effects detected such as the Casimir effect.
A vacuum can be thought of not as empty space, but as the combination of all zero-point fields. In quantum field theory, this combination of fields is called the vacuum state, its associated zero-point energy is called the vacuum energy, and the value of the average energy is called the vacuum expectation value (VEV) also called its condensate. One of the most widely used examples of an observable physical effect resulting from an operator's vacuum expectancy value is the Casimir effect.
2.5.3 Casimir effect
In the Casimir effect, two flat plates placed very close together restrict the wavelengths of quanta which can exist between them. This in turn restricts the types and hence number and density of virtual particle pairs which can form in the intervening vacuum and can result in a negative energy density. Since this restriction does not exist or is much less significant on the opposite sides of the plates, the forces outside the plates are greater than those between the plates. This causes the plates to appear to pull on each other, which has been measured as the Casimir effect. More accurately, in the Casimir effect, the vacuum energy caused by the virtual particle pairs is pushing the plates together, and the vacuum energy between the plates is too small to negate this effect since fewer virtual particles can exist per unit volume between the plates than can exist outside them. The Casimir effect shows that quantum field theory allows the energy density in certain regions of space to be negative relative to the ordinary vacuum energy, and it has been shown theoretically that quantum field theory allows states where the energy can be arbitrarily negative at a given point [41].
2.5.4 Negative energy
The work of Casini and Bousso [8-17] on Bekenstein [42] bound sheds light on the Casimir effect
59 Electronic copy available at: https://ssrn.com/abstract=4454406
                    
                                       ,
                        ,
With these definitions, the bound reads        ,
which can be rearranged to give:                             
      , (2) (3) (4)
This is simply the statement, following Casini���s and Bousso work [8-17], of positivity of quantum relative entropy, which proves the Bekenstein bound as valid.
This construction allows us to make sense of the Casimir effect where the localized energy density is lower than that of the vacuum, i.e., a negative localized energy. The localized entropy of the vacuum is nonzero, and so, the Casimir effect is possible for states with a lower localized entropy than that of the vacuum i.e., a negative localized energy. Negative energies and negative energy density are consistent with quantum field theory.
In physics, the negative energy is a concept used to explain the nature of certain fields, including the gravitational field and various quantum field effects.
Part Two: Entropic information theory: Generalization
2.6 Entropy 2.6.1 Introduction
Entropy is almost universally simply called S or the statistical entropy or the thermodynamic entropy which have equally meaning.
In general, entropy is related to the number of possible microstates according to Boltzmann's principle:
           , Where:
  is the entropy of the system,   is Boltzmann's constant,   is the number of microstates.
(5) (1)Denis; Phys. Sci. Int. J., vol. 27, no. 1, pp. 54-81, 2023; Article no.PSIJ.99273
Boltzmann entropy formula can be derived from Shannon entropy formula when all states are equally probable.
                                 ,
        
  (6)
So, you have   microstate equiprobable with probability     
   .
The entropy of a thermodynamic system in equilibrium measures the uncertainty as to which of all its internal configurations compatible with its macroscopic thermodynamic parameters (temperature, pressure, etc.) is actually realized.
The entropy makes it possible to estimate the quantity of information lost when one summarizes the microscopic information by the macroscopic information. "Statistical entropy is a probabilistic measure of uncertainty or ignorance; information is a measure of a reduction in that uncertainty" [43].

In this section of Olivier Denis' work, the focus shifts to vacuum energy and its associated concepts, before transitioning into entropy and its role in information theory.
2 Vacuum Energy: Denis explains that vacuum energy, rather than being 'empty space,' is the aggregate of all zero-point fields, termed the 'vacuum state' in quantum field theory. This vacuum energy has observable effects, most famously the Casimir effect.
2.5.3 Casimir Effect: The Casimir effect demonstrates how two closely-placed flat plates limit the types of quanta that can exist between them, effectively changing the density of virtual particle pairs in the space between. This reduction in particle density creates a relative negative energy density between the plates and results in an apparent attraction between the plates due to the greater forces on their external surfaces. This phenomenon highlights that quantum field theory permits areas of space to have a negative energy density compared to the standard vacuum energy.
2.5.4 Negative Energy: The works of Casini, Bousso, and Bekenstein enlighten the understanding of the Casimir effect, showcasing how areas of space can have a localized energy density lower than the vacuum energy - thus termed negative energy. This negative energy is in line with quantum field theory and plays a vital role in explaining the nature of certain fields, including gravitational and quantum field effects.
Part Two: Entropic Information Theory: Generalization
2.6 Entropy 2.6.1 Introduction: Denis introduces entropy (S), which can be thought of as statistical or thermodynamic entropy. Entropy, according to Boltzmann's principle, is linked to the number of possible microstates in a system. In simpler terms, entropy measures the degree of uncertainty about which internal configurations of a system in equilibrium are realized. It is a way to estimate the amount of information lost when microscopic information is summarized into macroscopic information. Hence, statistical entropy is a measure of uncertainty, and information can be thought of as a reduction in that uncertainty.

summarizes the microscopic information by the macroscopic information. "Statistical entropy is a probabilistic measure of uncertainty or ignorance; information is a measure of a reduction in that uncertainty" [43].
2.6.2 Coarse- and Fine-grained entropy
In general, a fine-grained description of a system is a detailed description of its microscopic behavior. A coarse-grained description is one in which some of this fine detail has been smoothed over.
Coarse graining is at the core of the second law of thermodynamics. It is important to recognize that a critical property of a coarse-grained description is that it is ���true��� to the system, meaning that it is a reduction or simplification of the actual microscopic details.
Where fine grained entropy is the entropy of the density matrix calculated by the standard methods of quantum field theory in curved spacetime. In the literature, this is often simply called the von Neumann entropy. It is Shannon���s entropy with distribution replaced by density matrix. It is invariant under unitary time evolution.
                   (7) Entanglement entropy is a measure of
���quantumness��� that vanishes for classical states, and it is large when quantum correlations are important. It is also a measure of complexity [44].

information bit formula into the hidden thermodynamics of Louis De Broglie:
About the hidden thermodynamics of isolated particles, it is an attempt to bring together the three furthest principles of physics: the principles of Fermat, Maupertuis, and Carnot, that De Broglie has had his final idea. Entropy becomes a sort of opposite to action with an equation that relates the only two universal dimensions of the form [45]:

2.6.2 Coarse- and Fine-grained entropy: Denis distinguishes between two types of entropy: coarse-grained and fine-grained. Coarse-grained entropy relates to a simplified representation of a system, which glosses over some of the fine details but remains true to the system. On the other hand, fine-grained entropy refers to a detailed, microscopic understanding of a system. It's also known as von Neumann entropy and is invariant under unitary time evolution.
2.6.3 New entropic perspective: Denis then proceeds to introduce a generalization of entropic information theory, starting by linking it with the hidden thermodynamics of Louis De Broglie. He introduces the mass of an information bit into the relationship between Boltzmann's constant and Planck constant, which links two universal dimensions. He then further refines this relationship by introducing a formula for the mass of an information bit.
2.6.4 New formulation of entropy: Denis goes on to present a new formulation of entropy that includes the number of bits of information in the system and the number of bits necessary to specify the microscopic configuration of the system. This perspective establishes a new foundation for entropic information theory and helps express entropy in terms of several different well-known equations.
2.7 Black Hole: Finally, Denis applies the entropic information approach to the study of black holes. He introduces Hawking���s temperature into the equation wherein the mass of an information bit has been used. This leads to a new formula for black hole entropy based on the mass of information bits. In this context, the factor of ln2 arises from defining information as the logarithm (base 2) of the number of quantum states.

The Bekenstein Hawking entropy formula, since it increases under time evolution, should be viewed as the coarse-grained entropy formula for the black hole [47].
The black-hole entropy is proportional to the area of its event horizon A. This area relationship was generalized to arbitrary regions via the Ryu��� Takayanagi formula, which relates the entanglement entropy of a boundary conformal field theory to a specific surface in its dual gravitational theory [48].

The Bekenstein-Hawking entropy is a theoretical concept that connects the entropy of a black hole with the area of its event horizon. According to the Bekenstein-Hawking area law, these two quantities are proportional. This law has been generalized to other regions through the Ryu-Takayanagi formula, which ties the entanglement entropy of a conformal field theory on the boundary to a specific surface in its dual gravitational theory.
In this section, Denis introduces a formula that connects the Bekenstein-Hawking entropy (which reflects the information lost to outside observers due to the presence of the event horizon) with the area of the black hole horizon, the speed of light, and the gravitational constant. He then simplifies this formula through several steps, using the previous definitions and relationships he introduced (including the mass of information bits).
The result is a new black hole entropy formula based on the entropic information theory approach, and this formula includes the time it takes for the black hole to evaporate. This expression essentially reformulates the Bekenstein-Hawking entropy formula within the framework of entropic information theory.

2.7.3 The Bekenstein bound
In physics, an upper limit on the thermodynamic entropy S, or Shannon entropy H, that can be contained within a given finite region of space which has a finite amount of energy is the Bekenstein bound (named after Jacob Bekenstein)���or conversely, the maximal amount of information required to perfectly describe a given physical system down to the quantum level [49]. Furthermore, generally, the entropy is proportional to the number of bits necessary to describe the state of the system considered. This result, which was demonstrated by Jacob Bekenstein corresponds to the interpretation in terms of bits of information.
The universal bound originally founded by Jacob Bekenstein in 1981 as the inequality [50,51].

It implies that the information of a physical system, or the information necessary to perfectly describe that system, must be finite if the region of space and the energy are finite.

side of the Bekenstein bound, a difficult point is
to give a rigorous interpretation of the quantity 2
  R E, where R is a characteristic length scale of
the system and E is a characteristic energy. This
product has the same units as the generator of a
Lorentz boost, and the natural analog of a boost
in this situation is the modular Hamiltonian of the
vacuum state K = ��� log

With these definitions, the bound reads

Assume that in a finite time in the past a black hole has been formed and in the future; will be fully evaporated away in some finite time. The black hole will only emit a finite amount of information encoded within its Hawking radiation. The Hawking radiation is to put in relation with the (finite) entropy and thus the (non-zero) temperature of the black hole: the Hawking temperature. Hence the absence of the Hawking radiation would lead to violations of thermodynamical laws.
Hawking radiation occurs in an inertial frame where spatial distance doesn���t come into it, and, where the horizon of a black hole is compact.
Hawking radiation is thermal radiation following Boltzmann distribution.
Hawking radiation is in a pure state, is that this is in apparent contradiction to the fact that Hawking radiation is also said to be thermal. The apparent contradiction is solved when one realizes that in a general curved spacetime there is no unique definition of the vacuum state and therefore the whole Hilbert.
Consequently, an observer at infinity will see a thermal bath of particles (i.e., in a mixed state) coming from the horizon, even though the quantum fields are in the local vacuum state near the horizon

This section is delving deeper into the concept of Hawking radiation, the theoretical prediction made by Stephen Hawking that black holes should emit thermal radiation due to quantum effects near the event horizon. This phenomenon is often compared to the emission of heat by a black object, which is why it is named "Hawking radiation".
The text emphasizes a few key points about Hawking radiation:
Even though a black hole is formed at some point and will eventually evaporate entirely, it will only emit a finite amount of information through its Hawking radiation. This is related to the black hole's entropy and temperature (Hawking temperature), suggesting that the absence of Hawking radiation could imply a violation of thermodynamic laws.
Hawking radiation is defined in an inertial frame where the spatial distance doesn't matter, and it takes place where the horizon of a black hole is compact.
Hawking radiation follows the Boltzmann distribution, making it a thermal radiation.
There's an apparent contradiction between Hawking radiation being in a pure state and it being thermal. This contradiction is resolved by the understanding that in a general curved spacetime, there is no unique definition of a vacuum state, and therefore, the entire Hilbert space is in a mixed state.
An observer at infinity will observe a thermal bath of particles coming from the horizon, even though the quantum fields are in the local vacuum state near the horizon. This reflects the fact that the perception of the Hawking radiation can vary based on the observer's location.
Denis also employs an entropic information formula for black hole entropy, and using this with the formula for evaporation time, he calculates the time it would take for a black hole of 1.989 �� 10^30 kg (roughly equivalent to the mass of our sun) to evaporate. This calculated time is remarkably close to the one determined using the Bekenstein-Hawking luminosity approach, suggesting a possible validity to the entropic information formula in this context.

One of the most remarkable achievements in theoretical physics came in 1974, when Stephen Hawking demonstrated that black holes are not static, stable entities within spacetime, but rather must emit radiation and eventually decay. This radiation, known forever after as Hawking radiation, arises due to the combination of the facts that:

quantum fields permeate all of space,
including inside and outside a black hole���s event horizon,
that these fields are not static but exhibit quantum fluctuations,
and that those fields behave differently in regions where the curvature of spacetime is different.

When Hawking first put these facts together, his calculation showed that black holes can���t be stable with a constant mass, but will instead emit an omnidirectional amount of extremely low-temperature blackbody radiation. This radiation propagates away from the event horizon, and since real radiation carries energy, the only place where that energy can be taken from is from the mass of the black hole itself: via the classic equation E = mc��, where the mass lost by the black hole has to balance the energy of the emitted radiation.

But in a delightful new paper, physicists Michael Wondrak, Walter van Suijlekom, and Heino Falcke have challenged the idea that an event horizon is necessary for this radiation. According to their new approach, this radiation arises solely because of the differences in the quantum vacuum of space dependent on its curvature, and therefore Hawking radiation should be emitted by all masses in the Universe, even those without event horizons. It���s a remarkable idea and one that���s been brewing for a long time. Let���s unpack why.

qcd particle antiparticle visualization
A visualization of QCD illustrates how particle-antiparticle pairs pop out of the quantum vacuum for very small amounts of time as a consequence of Heisenberg uncertainty. The quantum vacuum is interesting because it demands that empty space itself isn���t so empty, but is filled with all the particles, antiparticles, and fields in various states that are demanded by the quantum field theory that describes our Universe. The particle-antiparticle pairs illustrated here, however, are only a calculational tool; they are not to be confused with real particles.
Credit: Derek B. Leinweber
There���s a very common misconception about how Hawking radiation works, put forth by none other than Hawking himself in his celebrated popular book, A Brief History of Time. The way Hawking told us to envision it:

the Universe is filled with particle-antiparticle pairs popping in-and-out of existence,
even in empty space, as a consequence of quantum field theory and the Heisenberg uncertainty principle,
that in uncurved space, these pairs always find one another and re-annihilate after a very small time interval,
but if an event horizon is present, one member of the pair can ���fall in��� while the other ���escapes,���
leading to a situation where real particles (or antiparticles) are emitted with positive mass/energy from just outside the horizon itself,
whereas the paired member that falls into the event horizon must have ���negative energy��� that subtracts from the black hole���s total mass.
It���s a convenient picture, to be sure, but it���s a picture that even Hawking himself knew must be false. Despite the fact that, in his 1974 paper, he wrote:

���It should be emphasized that these pictures of the mechanism responsible for the thermal emission and area decrease are heuristic only and should not be taken too literally,���

This new research suggests that Hawking radiation, first theorized by Stephen Hawking in 1974, isn't exclusive to black holes as previously thought. Hawking Radiation is a phenomenon where black holes aren't stable entities in spacetime, but slowly and gradually decay through the emission of radiation. This radiation, known as Hawking radiation, is the result of quantum fields interacting with the curvature of spacetime near and far from the black hole's event horizon.
However, in a paper by physicists Michael Wondrak, Walter van Suijlekom, and Heino Falcke, they argue that the emission of Hawking radiation doesn't require an event horizon. Instead, they propose that the radiation arises due to differences in the quantum vacuum of space, dependent on its curvature. This means that all masses in the universe, even those without event horizons, should emit Hawking radiation.
The new understanding challenges Hawking's original simplified description, in which he portrayed Hawking radiation as the result of particle-antiparticle pairs popping in-and-out of existence in the universe, even in empty space. According to Hawking, when one of these pairs was near an event horizon, one particle could fall in while the other escaped, resulting in Hawking radiation.
This recent research marks a significant shift in our understanding of Hawking radiation and potentially all matter in the universe. It remains to be seen what further implications this research might have on our understanding of quantum physics and the nature of the universe.

One of the most remarkable achievements in theoretical physics came in 1974, when Stephen Hawking demonstrated that black holes are not static, stable entities within spacetime, but rather must emit radiation and eventually decay. This radiation, known forever after as Hawking radiation, arises due to the combination of the facts that:

quantum fields permeate all of space,
including inside and outside a black hole���s event horizon,
that these fields are not static but exhibit quantum fluctuations,
and that those fields behave differently in regions where the curvature of spacetime is different.

When Hawking first put these facts together, his calculation showed that black holes can���t be stable with a constant mass, but will instead emit an omnidirectional amount of extremely low-temperature blackbody radiation. This radiation propagates away from the event horizon, and since real radiation carries energy, the only place where that energy can be taken from is from the mass of the black hole itself: via the classic equation E = mc��, where the mass lost by the black hole has to balance the energy of the emitted radiation.

But in a delightful new paper, physicists Michael Wondrak, Walter van Suijlekom, and Heino Falcke have challenged the idea that an event horizon is necessary for this radiation. According to their new approach, this radiation arises solely because of the differences in the quantum vacuum of space dependent on its curvature, and therefore Hawking radiation should be emitted by all masses in the Universe, even those without event horizons. It���s a remarkable idea and one that���s been brewing for a long time. Let���s unpack why.

A visualization of QCD illustrates how particle-antiparticle pairs pop out of the quantum vacuum for very small amounts of time as a consequence of Heisenberg uncertainty. The quantum vacuum is interesting because it demands that empty space itself isn���t so empty, but is filled with all the particles, antiparticles, and fields in various states that are demanded by the quantum field theory that describes our Universe. The particle-antiparticle pairs illustrated here, however, are only a calculational tool; they are not to be confused with real particles.

There���s a very common misconception about how Hawking radiation works, put forth by none other than Hawking himself in his celebrated popular book, A Brief History of Time. The way Hawking told us to envision it:

the Universe is filled with particle-antiparticle pairs popping in-and-out of existence,
even in empty space, as a consequence of quantum field theory and the Heisenberg uncertainty principle,
that in uncurved space, these pairs always find one another and re-annihilate after a very small time interval,
but if an event horizon is present, one member of the pair can ���fall in��� while the other ���escapes,���
leading to a situation where real particles (or antiparticles) are emitted with positive mass/energy from just outside the horizon itself,
whereas the paired member that falls into the event horizon must have ���negative energy��� that subtracts from the black hole���s total mass.
It���s a convenient picture, to be sure, but it���s a picture that even Hawking himself knew must be false. Despite the fact that, in his 1974 paper, he wrote:

���It should be emphasized that these pictures of the mechanism responsible for the thermal emission and area decrease are heuristic only and should not be taken too literally,���


He does, in fact, take it literally in his 1988 book that brought this idea to the general public.

Hawking radiation incorrect
In Hawking���s most famous book, A Brief History of Time, he makes the analogy that space is filled with particle-antiparticle pairs and that one member can escape (carrying positive energy) while the other falls in (with negative energy), leading to black hole decay. This flawed analogy continues to confuse generations of physicists and laypersons alike.

The reason you cannot take this picture literally is because the particle-antiparticle pairs that pop in-and-out of existence are not actual, real particles; they are what physicists call virtual particles: a calculational tool that we use that represents fluctuations in the underlying fields, but that are not ���real��� in the sense that we cannot interact with or measure them directly in any way.

If you did take this picture literally, you���d erroneously think that this Hawking radiation is composed of a mixture of particles and antiparticles; it is not. Instead, it���s just composed of extremely low-energy photons in a blackbody spectrum, as even the lightest set of massive particles known, the neutrinos and antineutrinos, are far too heavy for even a single one to be produced by the real black holes in our Universe.

Instead, the actual explanation ��� although there are many legitimate ways to approach calculating the effect (including ways that do involve these virtual particle-antiparticle pairs) ��� is that it is the difference in the quantum vacuum (i.e., the fundamental properties of quantum fields in empty space) between regions of space with different amounts of spatial curvature that leads to the production of this thermal, blackbody radiation that we call Hawking radiation.

black hole decay
The most common, and incorrect, explanation for how Hawking radiation arises is an analogy with particle-antiparticle pairs. If one member with negative energy falls into the black hole���s event horizon, while the other member with positive energy escapes, the black hole loses mass and outgoing radiation departs the black hole. This explanation has misinformed generations of physicists and came from Hawking himself. One of the errors inherent to this explanation is the notion that all of the Hawking radiation arises from the event horizon itself: it does not.

There are a few interesting points that arise, that have been known for many decades, as a consequence of the ways Hawking radiation actually works.

Interesting point #1: The Hawking radiation itself cannot all originate from the event horizon of the black hole itself.


One of the fun things you can calculate, at any moment in time, is the density of the Hawking radiation that arises all throughout space. You can calculate the energy density as a function of distance from the black hole, and you can compare that to a calculation for what the expected energy density would be if the radiation all originated at the event horizon itself and then propagated outward in space.

Remarkably, those two calculations do not match up at all; in fact, most of the Hawking radiation that arises around the event horizon of the black hole originates within about 10-20 Schwarzschild radii (the radius from the singularity to the event horizon) of the event horizon, rather than at the event horizon itself. In fact, there are non-zero amounts of radiation that are emitted throughout all of space, even far away from the event horizon itself. The horizon itself may play a role that���s important in the generation of Hawking radiation, just as Unruh radiation ought to be generated owing to the presence of a cosmic horizon in our own Universe, but you cannot generate all of your Hawking radiation at the event horizon of a black hole and get predictions that are consistent with our theoretical calculations.

still flawed Hawking radiation diagram
It must be noted that it isn���t particles or antiparticles that are produced when black holes undergo Hawking radiation, but rather photons. One can calculate this using the tools of virtual particle-antiparticle pairs in curved space in the presence of an event horizon, but those virtual pairs should not be construed as being real particles, nor should all of the radiation be construed as arising from just barely outside the event horizon.
Credit: E. Siegel
Interesting point #2: More radiation gets emitted from more severely curved regions of space, implying that lower-mass black holes emit more Hawking radiation and decay faster than higher-mass ones.

This is a point that puzzles most people the first time they hear about it: the more massive your black hole is, the less severely curved your space will be just outside the black hole���s event horizon. Yes, the event horizon is always defined by that boundary where the escape velocity of a particle is either less than the speed of light (which is outside the event horizon) or greater than the speed of light (which defines inside the event horizon), and the size of this horizon is directly proportional to the black hole���s mass.

But the curvature of space is much greater near the event horizon of a smaller, low-mass black hole than it is near the event horizon of a larger, greater-mass black hole. In fact, if we look at the properties of the emitted Hawking radiation for black holes of different (realistic) masses, we find:

The temperature of the radiation is inversely proportional to the mass: ten times the mass means one-tenth the temperature.
The luminosity, or radiated power, of a black hole, is inversely proportional to the square of the black hole���s mass: ten times the mass means one-hundredth the luminosity.
And the evaporation time for a black hole, or how long it takes for a black hole to completely decay away into Hawking radiation, is directly proportional to the mass of the black hole cubed: a black hole that���s ten times as massive as another will persist for one thousand times as long.
black hole
Although no light can escape from inside a black hole���s event horizon, the curved space outside of it results in a difference between the vacuum state at different points near the event horizon, leading to the emission of radiation via quantum processes. This is where Hawking radiation comes from, and for the lowest-mass black holes ever discovered, Hawking radiation will lead to their complete decay in ~10^68 years. For even the largest mass black holes, survival beyond 10^103 years or so is impossible due to this exact process. The higher mass your black hole is, the weaker Hawking radiation is and the longer it will take to evaporate.

Interesting point #3: The amount by which spacetime is curved at a given distance from a mass is completely independent of how dense that mass is, or whether it has an event horizon at all.

Here���s a fun question to consider. Imagine, if you will, that the Sun was magically, instantaneously replaced with an object that was the exact same mass as the Sun but whose physical size was either:

the size of the Sun itself (with a radius of about 700,000 km),
the size of a white dwarf (with a radius of about 7,000 km),
the size of a neutron star (with a radius of around 11 km),
or the size of a black hole (whose radius would be about 3 km).

Now, imagine you���re assigned the following task: to describe what the curvature of space is, and how it���s different, between these four separate examples.

The answer, quite remarkably, is that the only differences that arise are if you���re at a location that���s inside of the Sun itself. As long as you���re more than 700,000 km away from a solar mass object, then it doesn���t matter whether that object is a star, a white dwarf, a neutron star, a black hole, or any other object with or without an event horizon: its spacetime curvature and properties are the same.

curved spacetime black hole
Although the amount that spacetime is curved and distorted depends on how dense the object in question is when you���re close to the object���s edge, the size and volume that the object occupies is unimportant far away from the mass itself. For a black hole, neutron star, white dwarf, or a star like our Sun, the spatial curvature is identical at sufficiently large radii.

If you put these three points together, you might start wondering for yourself what many physicists have wondered for a very long time: does Hawking radiation only occur around black holes, or does it occur for all massive objects within spacetime?

Although the event horizon was a key feature in Hawking���s original derivation of the radiation that now bears his name, there have been other derivations (sometimes in alternate numbers of dimensions) that have shown this radiation still exists in curved spacetime, irrespective of the presence or absence of such a horizon.

That���s where the new paper that comes in is so interesting: the only role the event horizon plays is to serve as a boundary for where radiation can be ���captured��� from versus where it can ���escape��� from. The calculation is done in fully four-dimensional spacetime (with three space and one time dimension), and shares many important features with other approaches to calculating the presence and properties of Hawking radiation. The boundary for what gets captured versus what escapes would still exist for any other example of a mass we chose:

it would be the event horizon for a black hole,
the surface of a neutron star for a neutron star,
the outermost layer of a white dwarf for a white dwarf,
or the photosphere of a star for a star.
In all cases, there would still be an escape fraction that depended on the mass and radius of the object in question; there���s nothing special about the presence or absence of an event horizon.

It seems that the article you're providing is discussing a new study about Hawking radiation, the theoretical prediction by physicist Stephen Hawking that black holes emit radiation and will eventually evaporate. This process was previously believed to be limited to black holes due to their unique event horizon, beyond which nothing can escape, not even light.
The new study, however, conducted by physicists Michael Wondrak, Walter van Suijlekom, and Heino Falcke, challenges this understanding. They propose that Hawking radiation isn't dependent on an event horizon at all, but instead arises because of differences in the quantum vacuum of space based on its curvature. As a result, Hawking radiation should theoretically be emitted by all masses in the Universe, not just those with event horizons.
The study also reevaluates the typical understanding of Hawking radiation being related to particle-antiparticle pairs. The common belief, perpetuated even by Hawking in his book "A Brief History of Time," was that these pairs are constantly appearing and annihilating each other in empty space, but near a black hole, one of them might fall in, while the other escapes, thus leading to the emission of Hawking radiation. However, the authors of this study stress that this isn't a literal process, but rather a heuristic, as these pairs aren't real particles, but virtual ones used as a calculation tool in physics.
Furthermore, this new approach emphasizes that the severity of space's curvature near an object impacts the intensity of emitted Hawking radiation. More curved regions of space (like near smaller, low-mass black holes) emit more radiation and decay faster than less curved regions (like near larger, high-mass black holes).
Finally, the paper challenges the previous notion that Hawking radiation only occurs around black holes. Instead, this radiation might occur for all massive objects within spacetime, as the role of an event horizon might simply be to delineate what radiation can be captured versus what can escape. This boundary would exist for any mass, whether it's a black hole, neutron star, white dwarf, or star, depending on its own specific properties.
In conclusion, this new study is a paradigm shift in our understanding of Hawking radiation, opening new paths of research in quantum physics and astrophysics.

Hawking radiation isn���t just for black holes, study shows
In 1974, Hawking showed that black holes aren't stable, but emit radiation and decay. Nearly 50 years later, it isn't just for black holes.
black hole emission radiation
For the real black holes that exist or get created in our Universe, we can observe the radiation emitted by their surrounding matter, and the gravitational waves produced by the inspiral, merger, and ringdown. The electromagnetic radiation that we see solely originates from outside the event horizon itself; the Hawking radiation that black holes are predicted to emit is thus far unobservable in practice.Credit: Aurore Simonnet/Sonoma State/Caltech/MIT/LIGO
KEY TAKEAWAYS
In 1974, Stephen Hawking published a landmark paper showing that black holes aren't stable entities in spacetime, but slowly and gradually decay through the emission of radiation. The quantum process that powers this Hawking radiation arises based on the difference in the quantum vacuum near and far from the black hole's event horizon. For the first time, a new study suggests that this Hawking radiation doesn't depend on the event horizon at all, and should be present for all masses within spacetime, with astounding implications for physics.

This is a long article but essentially it presents a recent study which proposes a radical shift in the understanding of Hawking Radiation, which was originally theorized by physicist Stephen Hawking in 1974. Hawking Radiation refers to the quantum process where black holes are not static but slowly decay through the emission of radiation. This process arises due to differences in the quantum vacuum near and far from the black hole's event horizon.
The new study by physicists Michael Wondrak, Walter van Suijlekom, and Heino Falcke suggests that Hawking Radiation doesn't just apply to black holes and their event horizons but should, in fact, be emitted by all masses in the universe, even those without event horizons. This conclusion comes from the observation that the radiation seems to arise due to differences in the quantum vacuum of space that depend on its curvature, not the presence of an event horizon.
Three key points they make include:
Hawking radiation cannot all originate from the event horizon of the black hole itself. Instead, it is emitted throughout all of space, even far away from the event horizon.
More radiation gets emitted from more severely curved regions of space, implying that lower-mass black holes emit more Hawking radiation and decay faster than higher-mass ones.
The amount by which spacetime is curved at a given distance from a mass is independent of how dense that mass is, or whether it has an event horizon at all.
These new findings could have significant implications for our understanding of black holes, spacetime, and the universe at large. However, it's important to remember that this is a theoretical study and its conclusions would still need to be validated through further research and observation.

escape fraction relative to a black hole
The event horizon of a black hole has been considered an important factor in the generation of Hawking radiation around black holes in many previous studies, but a new one suggests that this radiation can still be generated outside of an event horizon even if the horizon itself does nothing more than forbid light from escaping from within it.

There���s a very simple analogy to the approach that Wondrak, van Suijlekom, and Falcke take in their paper: to that of the Schwinger effect in electromagnetism. Way back in 1951, physicist Julian Schwinger ��� one of the co-discoverers of quantum electrodynamics ��� detailed how matter could be created from pure energy in the vacuum of space simply by creating a strong enough electric field. Whereas you can envision quantum field fluctuations however you like in the absence of an external field, applying a strong external field polarizes even the vacuum of space: separating positive from negative charges. If the field is strong enough, these virtual particles can become real, stealing energy from the underlying field to keep energy conserved.

Instead of an electric field, charged particles, and the Schwinger effect, the gravitational analogue is simply to use the background of curved spacetime for the electric field, to substitute an uncharged, massless scalar field for the charged particles: a simplistic analogue to stand-in for the photons that would be produced via Hawking radiation. Instead of the Schwinger effect, what they see is the production of new quanta in this curved spacetime, with a ���production profile��� that depends on the radius you are away from the event horizon. But note that there���s nothing special about the horizon itself: production occurs at all distances sufficiently far from the object itself.

escaping radiation black hole
As calculated in the paper ���Gravitational Pair Production and Black Hole Evaporation,��� there is no emitted radiation from inside a black hole���s event horizon (less than ���2��� on the x-axis), but the radiation arises from an infinitely-extending region outside of the event horizon, peaking at 25% larger than the horizon itself but falling off slowly thereafter. The implication is that even massive objects without an event horizon, like stars, should emit some amount of Hawking radiation.
Credit: M.F. Wondrak et al., Phys. Rev. Lett. accepted, 2023
The key takeaway, assuming the paper���s analysis is valid (which of course requires independent confirmation), is that there is no ���special role��� played by the event horizon as far as the production of radiation (or any other types of particles) goes. Quite generally, if you have

a quantum field theory,
with creation and annihilation operators,
with some sort of tidal, differential forces acting on the field fluctuations (or virtual particles and antiparticles, if you prefer),
that will create an additional separative effect over what you���d expect in a uniform background of empty space,
then you can conclude that a fraction of the particles that are produced will escape, in a radius-dependent fashion, irrespective of the presence or absence of an event horizon.

It���s perhaps important to note that this new work does not reproduce all of the known features of Hawking radiation exactly; it is only a simplistic model that stands in for a realistic black hole. Nevertheless, many of the lessons gleaned from this study, as well as from the toy model motivating it, may prove to be incredibly important for understanding not only how Hawking radiation works, but under what circumstances and conditions it gets generated by. It also sets the stage, just as has been already accomplished for the Schwinger effect, for condensed matter analogue systems to be constructed, where this effect may actually be quantifiable and observable.

schwinger effect
In theory, the Schwinger effect states that in the presence of strong enough electric fields, (charged) particles and their antiparticle counterparts will be ripped from the quantum vacuum, empty space itself, to become real. Theorized by Julian Schwinger in 1951, the predictions were validated in a tabletop experiment, using a quantum analogue system, for the first time.

One of the things I greatly appreciate about this paper is that it corrects a big, widespread misconception: the idea that Hawking radiation is generated at the event horizon itself. Not only is this not true, but the horizon only serves as a ���cutoff point��� in the sense that no radiation generated inside of it can escape. Instead, there is a specific radial production profile for this radiation, where there���s a peak amount of radiation that is generated and escapes at about 125% of the event horizon���s radius, and then that radiation falls off and asymptotes to zero at greater radii, but there���s always some non-zero amount of production that can be predicted.

An interesting thing to think about is that, for black holes, there is no external energy reservoir to ���draw��� this energy from, and hence the energy for this radiation must come from the massive object at the center, itself. For a black hole, that means it must decay, leading to its eventual evaporation.

hawking radiation black hole decay
The event horizon of a black hole is a spherical or spheroidal region from which nothing, not even light, can escape. But outside the event horizon, the black hole is predicted to emit radiation. Hawking���s 1974 work was the first to demonstrate this, and it was arguably his greatest scientific achievement. A new study now suggests that Hawking radiation may even be emitted in the absence of black holes, with profound implications for all stars and stellar remnants in our Universe.

But for objects that aren���t black holes, what is it, specifically, that will occur? Will this emitted radiation steal energy from the self-gravitational energy of an object like a star or stellar remnant, leading to gravitational contraction? Will it eventually lead to particle decays, or even some sort of phase transition within this object? Or does it imply something far more profound: such as once certain limits are reached and surpassed, that all matter will eventually collapse to a black hole and, via Hawking radiation, eventually decay?

At this point, these are just speculations, as they���re questions that can only be answered by follow-up work. Nevertheless, this paper is a clever line of thought, and does something remarkable: it poses and analyzes a nearly 50-year-old problem in an entirely new way. Perhaps, if nature is kind, this will wind up bringing us closer to resolving some of the key, core issues at the very hearts of black holes. Although it���s still just a suggestion, the implication is certainly worth considering: that all masses, not just black holes, may wind up emitting Hawking radiation.

It seems like the paper you mentioned is challenging long-standing beliefs in the field of quantum physics and black hole thermodynamics. For decades, the consensus was that Hawking radiation - the theoretical prediction that black holes are not completely black but emit small amounts of thermal radiation - was a unique property of black holes, specifically tied to their event horizon.
This new work is suggesting that Hawking radiation may not be exclusively linked to black holes and their event horizons. Instead, the emission of such radiation may be a general phenomenon associated with any massive object, including neutron stars, white dwarfs, and regular stars. The key aspect, as the paper suggests, is not the presence of an event horizon, but rather the boundary from which radiation can escape.
In their approach, the authors draw an analogy with the Schwinger effect, a phenomenon in quantum electrodynamics where an electric field can rip particles and antiparticles out from the vacuum, thus creating real particles from the quantum fluctuations. The authors propose a similar effect in the presence of a gravitational field, suggesting that Hawking radiation could be thought of as quantum field fluctuations being "pulled apart" by a strong gravitational field.
The implications of this are quite profound and would necessitate a reconsideration of many aspects of quantum field theory, quantum gravity, and black hole thermodynamics. It may even have implications for the fate of all matter in the universe. However, it is important to note that these are preliminary results and need to be independently confirmed.
This paper highlights the vibrant nature of scientific research, where established ideas can be challenged and reinterpreted in the light of new perspectives and approaches. It's a fascinating development and we'll have to watch closely to see how this unfolds in the physics community.

.6 Ryu and Takayanagi conjecture
The Ryu���Takayanagi conjecture is a conjecture within holography that posits a quantitative relationship between the entanglement entropy of a conformal field theory and the geometry of an associated anti-de Sitter spacetime [18,19]. The formula characterizes "holographic screens" in the bulk; that is, it specifies which regions of the bulk geometry are "responsible to particular information in the dual CFT" [54].
The Ryu���Takayanagi formula calculates the entropy of quantum entanglement in conformal field theories on Bekenstein-Hawking entropy of black holes in the context of Juan Mart��n Maldacena's holographic principle, in which conformal field theories on a surface form a gravitational theory in a closed volume. ���The Bekenstein���Hawking area law, while claiming that the area of the black hole horizon is proportional to the black hole's entropy, fails to provide a sufficient microscopic description of
66 Electronic copy available at: https://ssrn.com/abstract=4454406
how this entropy arises. The holographic principle provides such a description by relating the black hole system to a quantum system which does admit such a microscopic description. In this case, the CFT has discrete eigenstates, and the thermal state is the canonical ensemble of these states [48]. The entropy of this ensemble can be calculated through normal means, and yields the same result as predicted by the area law. This turns out to be a special case of the Ryu���Takayanagi conjecture��� [55].
The first version of the fine-grained entropy formula was discovered by Ryu and Takayanagi [52]. It was subsequently refined and generalized by several authors [56-63]. Originally, the RyuTakayanagi formula was proposed to calculate holographic entanglement entropy in anti-de Sitter spacetime, but the present understanding of the formula is much more general. It requires neither holography, nor entanglement, nor antide Sitter spacetime. Rather it is a general formula for the fine-grained entropy of quantum systems coupled to gravity [47].
The black-hole entropy is proportional to the area of its event horizon A. The black hole entropy horizon law which turns out to be a special case of the Ryu���Takayanagi conjecture. The blackhole entropy area relationship was generalized to arbitrary regions via the Ryu���Takayanagi formula, which relates the entanglement entropy of a boundary conformal field theory to a specific surface in its dual gravitational theory [48], but the current understanding of the formula is much more general. As being a general formula for the fine-grained entropy of quantum systems coupled to gravity [47].
Part Three: Entropic information theory: Dark Side.
2.8 Information and Dark Matter
Vopson even went so far as to speculate that the dark matter that holds galaxies together could also be composed of information. He said that since for more than 60 years we have been trying unsuccessfully to understand what dark matter is, it could very well be information. It is well-accepted that the matter distribution in the Universe is ���5% ordinary baryonic matter, ���27% dark matter and ���68%, dark energy [64].
How many bits of information are there in the content of the observable universe?Denis; Phys. Sci. Int. J., vol. 27, no. 1, pp. 54-81, 2023; Article no.PSIJ.99273
Going back as far as the late 1970s, this
question has been addressed in several studies
and several answers have been given. For
example, using the Bekenstein���Hawking formula
for the black-hole entropy [49,65] the information
content of the universe has been calculated by
Davies [66]
   
     
 
  
Where:
G is the gravitational constant,
Mu is the mass of the universe enclosed within
its horizon,
h is Planck���s constant,
c is the speed of light.
Wheeler���s approach which estimated the number
of bits in the present universe at T = 2.735 K
from entropy considerations, resulting in 8 ��     
bits content [31]. Or Lloyd which took a similar
approach and estimated the total information
capacity of the universe as [67]
 
   
        
Where:
S is the total entropy of the matter dominated
universe,
k is the Boltzmann constant,
  is the matter density of the universe,
t is the age of the universe at present,

The entropic information approach can calculate
an estimation of the bits of information contained
in the observable universe from the new
formulation of entropy, entropy based on the
mass of the information bit given as follows:

entropy S and Shannon entropy H given by
              is not used to convert the result
into informational terms because the result of the
entropic information theory approach to entropy
is expressed in informational terms, indeed it is
the mass of the information bit that has been
implemented to the initial equation considered,
so the results of the entropy are expressed in the
number of bits. The theory of entropic information
is based on the number of bits of the system, the
number of bits necessary to specify the real
microscopic configuration among the total
number of microstates allowed and thus
characterize the macroscopic states of the
system considered.
This number of 1.5736228 x      bits estimated
by calculation from entropic information theory is
remarkably close to an estimate of the
information bit content of the universe with     
bits that would be sufficient to account for all the
dark matter missing in the visible universe
following Vopson using the reasoning developed
following [68]. Taking the estimated mass of our
Milky Way galaxy as ��� 7 ���         solar masses
[69], and using the mass of the sun    ��� 2 ���
     Kg, then the estimated dark matter mass in
our galaxy is              ��� 3.78 ���         = 7.56
���      Kg. Assuming that all the missing dark
matter is made up of bits of information, then the
entire Milky Way galaxy has Nbits (Milky Way) =
            
/      (T=2.73K) = 2.59 ���      bits.
The estimated number of galaxies in the visible
universe is ��� 2 ���      [70], so the estimated total
number of bits of information in the visible
universe is ��� 52 ���      bits. Remarkably, this

Vopson estimated that around 5,2 ��      bits would be enough to account for all the missing dark matter in the observable universe [68,72,73]. The estimated bit content of the observable universe from entropic information is       its. Note that       its is significantly less than the theoretical maximum information content of the universe of       Bits provided by applying the holographic principle [49,74] to the universe. In the maximum information scenario, corresponding to the universe being a single black hole,       elementary squares of Planck length are needed to cover the surface of the current known universe.

The Ryu���Takayanagi conjecture is a significant concept in theoretical physics that relates the quantum information theory to gravitational theories. It suggests a quantitative relationship between the entanglement entropy of a conformal field theory and the geometry of an associated anti-de Sitter spacetime. This conjecture also interprets the entropy of black holes in the framework of the holographic principle.
Concerning information and dark matter, it's proposed that the unseen dark matter that holds galaxies together could, in fact, be composed of information. For the last several decades, scientists have been unable to fully understand what dark matter is, leading to various hypotheses such as this one.
The content of the observable universe has been calculated using different formulas, leading to varying estimates of its information content. The Bekenstein���Hawking formula, Wheeler���s approach, and Lloyd's approach are among the methods used to estimate this.
Finally, the notion of quantifying the information content of the universe leads to interesting possibilities about the nature of the universe itself. If dark matter is made up of information bits, it suggests a deeper link between information theory and cosmology, shedding light on the nature of our universe. This information-centered perspective of the universe, although highly speculative, offers a unique viewpoint on some of the most pressing questions in theoretical physics and cosmology.
However, it's important to note that these concepts are largely theoretical and have not been experimentally confirmed as of my knowledge cut-off in September 2021. As such, they should be seen as part of the ongoing scientific dialogue and subject to change as more information becomes available.

.9 Landauer���s Principle and Dark Energy
From [71], we can read that Landauer���s principle was originally proposed to describe the energy dissipation when information is overwritten in computer systems and subsequently used to predict the future limits to shrinking computer circuit size [75-81]. Moreover, Landauer showed that any erasure of information is necessarily accompanied by heat dissipation [1]. A corresponding minimum           of heat energy has to be dissipated into the surrounding environment to increase the environment���s thermodynamic entropy in compensation, and in accord with the second law of thermodynamics. The total amount of information is conserved as the surrounding environment effectively contains the erased information, although clearly no longer in a form that the computer can use. More generally, Landauer���s principle applies to all systems in nature so that any system, temperature T, in which information is ���erased��� by some physical process will output           of heat energy per bit ���erased��� with a corresponding increase in the information of the environment surrounding that system. Information is therefore directly bound up with the fundamental physics of nature. This strong interdependence between nature and information is emphasized by astrophysicist John Wheeler���s slogan "it from bit" and computer scientist Rolf Landauer���s maxim
���information is physical��� Landauer���s principle is fully compatible with the laws of thermodynamics [21,22,24,25].
Information entropy is equivalent to thermodynamic entropy when the same degrees of freedom are considered. The information entropy of the physical world is thus the number of bits needed to account for all possible microscopic states. Then each bit of information
68 Electronic copy available at: https://ssrn.com/abstract=4454406
is equivalent to                of thermodynamic entropy leading to Landauer���s principle that                  of heat is dissipated when a computer logic bit is erased [81].
Landauer's principle identifies temperature as the only parameter connecting information to energy.
The equivalent energy of the total information is given by                 .
The equivalent Landauer energy of these elementary bits would be defined in a form and value identical to the characteristic energy of the cosmological constant.
We obtain the equivalent Landauer energy of a fundamental bit of information in a universe at temperature,       .,      is the total density of matter in the universe (baryon + dark).
                    
              
(66)      
This Landauer bit energy is defined identically to the characteristic energy of the cosmological constant, the cosmological constant is closely associated with the concept of dark energy. The right-hand side of this equation is identical to equation 17.14 of [82] for the characteristic energy of the cosmological constant���with the sole addition of ln(2) to convert between entropy units���between natural information units, nats, and bits. Information bit energy might then explain the low milli-eV (0.003 eV) characteristic energy of ��, which Peebles [82] considered to be too low to be associated with any relevant particle physics [83].
The dark energy density in the universe is about 7��       g/cm3 on average according to Wikipedia. This is uniform throughout the Hubble volume of the entire universe i.e., the volume of the universe with which we are in causal contact. The Hubble volume is          i.e., cubic light years. This gives 8.46732��     
cm3 as the
volume of the universe. Using the mass-energy equivalence, you find that the total dark energy content in the entire universe is around      Joules.

The cosmological constant require that empty
space takes the role of gravitating negative
masses which are distributed all over the

[84,85].
The point is dark energy is a "negative pressure"
form of energy causing universe expansion.
According to entropic information theory
approach, this "negative pressure" form of
energy has been explained by the injection of the
mass of the bit of information in the hidden

entropic information theory provides an
estimation of           Joules remarkably close
to this estimation.
2.10 Dark Energy and Cosmological
Constant
Now, let's dive into cosmology, where the
cosmological constant (lambda: ��), alternatively
called Einstein's cosmological constant, is a
constant term that can be added to Einstein's
field equations of general relativity. In the field
equation considered as a "source term", it can be
thought of as equivalent to the mass of empty
space or the energy density of space, or the
energy of vacuum. It is closely associated with
the concept of dark energy.
In physical cosmology, the energy of the
cosmological vacuum appears as the
cosmological constant in the Einstein equation or
Einstein field equation, fundamental equation of
general relativity. General relativity predicts that
energy is equivalent to mass, and therefore, if
the vacuum energy is "really there", it should
exert a gravitational force.

By the application of Landauer���s principle
formula, entropic information theory approach
has calculated the dark energy as being the
energy associated to the number of bits of
information of the observable universe based on
entropic information theory new alternative
entropy formulation.
The equivalent Landauer energy of these
elementary bits would be defined in a form and
value identical to the characteristic energy of the
cosmological constant [39]. This Landauer bit
energy is defined identically to the characteristic
energy of the cosmological constant. Estimation
of the energy associated with the number of bits
of information in the observable universe based
on entropic information theory is considered as
being the estimation of dark energy. This
estimate of dark energy is associated with the
equivalent Landauer energy for each bit of
information or bit of entropy, an association
based on Landauer's principle. This equivalent
Landauer energy is defined identically to the
characteristic energy of the cosmological
constant. Dark energy is therefore associated
with the cosmological constant. See Table 1

The dark energy can be associated to the
cosmological constant and the cosmological
constant can be formulated to be equivalent to
the zero-point radiation of space, i.e., the
vacuum energy [86].
2.11 Cosmological Constant and Zero-
Point-Energy
The zero-point-energy is usually supposed to
contribute to the cosmological constant. The
mismatch between the small cosmological
constant compared with the huge zero-point-
energy is considered as one of the most serious
problems in physics.
Essentially, a non-zero vacuum energy is
expected to contribute to the cosmological
constant, which affects the expansion of the
universe.
Using quantum field theory one can calculate the
quantum mechanical vacuum energy (or zero-
point energy) for any quantum field. The result of
this calculation can be as high as 120 orders of
magnitude larger than the upper limits obtained
via cosmological observations.
In quantum mechanics, the vacuum energy is not
zero due to quantum fluctuations. The ground
state energy of the harmonic oscillator is
  
 
in
contrast to the classical harmonic oscillator
whose ground state energy is zero.
The formalism of quantum field theory makes it
clear that the vacuum expectation value
summations are in a certain sense summation
over so-called "virtual particles".
Quantum fields can be described as an infinite
collection of harmonic oscillators, so naively the
vacuum energy, which would be a sum over all
the harmonic oscillator ground state energies,
should be infinite. But, in practice, we would
expect the sum to be cut off at some energy
scale above which the true (presently unknown)
fundamental theory must be invoked.
The cosmological constant �� was introduced by
Albert Einstein into general relativity in 1917.
Including the cosmological constant, Einstein���s
field equations are:
                     
 
 
   
  
   
(71)
The cosmological constant can be interpreted as
the energy density of the vacuum. Specifically, if

and the equation of state of the vacuum is        
The current astrophysical data can be interpreted as being consistent with a nonzero value of the cosmological constant. The latest data can be found in the table of Astrophysical constants and parameters in [37]. This table includes the following two entries,
                           
  
                        
where     
         
  Hubble parameter.
The vacuum energy density is given by (75) and the critical density today is given by     
     
   
Hence     
         
 
       
(78)  
Employing the numbers given in eq. (76) and (77), it follows that:
   
     
                                
Using (79), we obtain,       
       
 
                                                         
                   
Thus, the numerical value of the vacuum energy is:
                                      
after using the conversion               and                .
(81)       
In order to see whether this vacuum energy is large or small, we need to invoke quantum mechanics. In quantum mechanics, there is a natural association between length scales and energy scales. The key conversion factor is:
                                  where               .
(82)
It is believed that there exists some mechanism that makes �� small but non-zero.
The order of the obtained result is dictated by the utilization of the Planck mass in the calculation, indeed, with the                      which multiply the value of conversion between kilograms
and electron volt,                                  , we obtain:
                                                                 
(88)
This is by far the worst prediction in the history of physics!!
So, how do we fix this? (79)

The Cosmological Constant Problem, also known as the vacuum catastrophe, is one of the major unresolved issues in modern physics. This problem arises from the discrepancy between the theoretically predicted vacuum energy (or dark energy) in the universe, based on quantum field theory, and the observed value, as you've mentioned in your text.
According to quantum field theory, the vacuum is not empty but filled with virtual particles and antiparticles that are constantly being created and annihilated, which leads to an enormous expected value for the vacuum energy or dark energy. This theoretical calculation leads to a value that is about 120 orders of magnitude (a 1 followed by 120 zeros) larger than the upper limits obtained from cosmological observations of the rate of cosmic expansion.
This enormous discrepancy between theoretical prediction and observed value is often termed the "worst prediction in the history of physics". It has led many physicists to believe that some yet undiscovered principle of nature must exist that will "cancel out" the vacuum energy predicted by quantum mechanics, leaving a much smaller residual value that matches observation. One proposed mechanism is supersymmetry, a theory that states for every known particle, there exists an as yet undiscovered superpartner. If this symmetry were exact, the contributions to the vacuum energy from particles and their superpartners would exactly cancel out. However, no superpartners have been found so far in experiments, and if they exist they must be much heavier than their known counterparts, which would break the symmetry.
However, at the time of my training cut-off in September 2021, no satisfactory resolution to the problem had been found. Any attempt to solve the cosmological constant problem would likely have far-reaching implications for our understanding of quantum mechanics, gravity, and the universe itself. It's one of the key questions that any successful theory of quantum gravity, such as string theory or loop quantum gravity, is expected to address.

3 Entropic Information Theory: Dark Side
The notion of negative energy, in relation to vacuum, is examined in more detail, in the light of Casini [8] and Bousso's work on the Bekenstein bound [9-17], both works giving meaning to the Casimir effect. The negative energy phenomenon is explained using Louis de
Broglie's hidden thermodynamic formula,         
   
         
, used in the entropic
information theory approach, itself in relation to Casini's work.
One way to envisage the dark energy is that it seems to be linked to the vacuum of space. In other words, it is an intrinsic property of the vacuum. The larger the volume of space, the more vacuum energy (dark energy) is present and the greater its effects.
The zero-point energy of the vacuum considered as dark energy is explained as a collective potential of all particles with their individual zero-point energy emerging from an informational field, distinct from the usual fields of matter of quantum field theory, associated with the dark matter as having a finite and quantifiable mass associated with the number of bits of the observable universe.
Dark matter emerging by the Landauer���s principle, from the two fundamental building blocks of our universe, i.e., temperature and information and dark matter giving rise, according to the Landauer���s principle, to Dark energy, the zero-point energy of the vacuum considered.
By taking account of the mass of the bit of information instead of the Planck mass in the cosmological constant calculation we have reduced the discrepancy of more of less 120 orders of magnitude in the prediction of the vacuum energy from a quantum perspective.
4. CONCLUSION
In the first part of this work, after having defined some fundamental notion of quantum mechanics in informational terms as quantum information, quantum entanglement , quantum measurement, and after having given an explanatory informational perspective of the process of the
75 Electronic copy available at: https://ssrn.com/abstract=4454406
collapse of the wave function based of the fact that a measure informs the measurer, invaliding the Many worlds Interpretation of quantum mechanics, this entropic information theory approach explains how physical existence arises by the emergence of energy from the relationship between the two fundamental building blocks of the universe, temperature, and information, with respect to the second law of thermodynamics and according to the formula of Landauer's principle which establishes temperature as the only parameter linking information to energy. Having explained the process of emergence at the base of the notion of energy, we can notice that an important consequence of the emergent entangled Informational Universe where interacting members are not independent, being entangled, sharing degrees of freedom (information), that no simulation of the system can exist, the process of strong emergence doesn���t permit the simulation of the system, for such a simulation would itself constitute a reduction of the system to its constituent parts. The simulation hypothesis is so invalided. Still according to the model of the entropic information theory, the amount of information in the universe is constant; only changes the proportion of its known or decoded state regarding its ignored or hidden state, indeed, information is one and the same thing, however it can exist in two forms: ignored or known, i.e., hidden or decoded. This emergent entangled informational universe is an informational system i.e., a system wherein the information notion is the global explanatory keystone concept, considered as an entangled system i.e., a system where there are not individual parts but are an inseparable whole, and as an emergent system i.e., system where the whole is greater than the sum of all its parts.
In the second part of this work, with the help of one of a set of five new equivalent equations expressing the notion of entropy, regarding black holes thermodynamics and black holes entropy, the equation of ���Boltzmann formulation��� when is applied to black hole thermodynamics by the injection of Hawking Temperature to it, can resolve the information paradox and can express the gravitational fine-grained entropy of the black holes. It can calculate the Bekenstein-Hawking entropy; as the black hole entropy saturates exactly the Bekenstein bound so it is equal to the Bekenstein bound which is itself according to Casini���s work equal to the von Neumann entropy, itself equal to that of the Hawking radiation, which with the degrees of freedom of black holesDenis; Phys. Sci. Int. J., vol. 27, no. 1, pp. 54-81, 2023; Article no.PSIJ.99273
produces a pure state, while the Hawking radiation being entangled with the fields inside black holes, allowing us to extract information that resides from the semiclassical viewpoint, in the black hole interior; at the end of evaporation, the full von Neumann entropy is again 0 , so no information is lost!. The black hole entropy horizon law turns out to be a special case of the Ryu���Takayanagi conjecture, and Ryu��� Takayanagi conjecture is a conjecture viewed as a general formula for the fine-grained entropy of quantum systems coupled to gravity.
In the third part of this work, an equivalent reformulation of the ���Boltzmann formulation��� equation, the ���Einstein formulation��� equation has estimated the dark matter component, by calculating the number of bits content of the observable universe and validated by Landauer's principle. The estimate of dark energy is based on the estimation of the energy associated with the number of bits content of the observable universe, with respect Landauer���s principle. The equivalent energy of the total information, given by                , is proportional to both the total number of bits and the temperature, and therefore proportional to the volume of the universe as in the volume model, and proportional to the surface of the universe in the holographic model. The dark energy is associated to the cosmological constant being expressed into the Landauer energy equivalent, which can be defined in a form and value identical to the characteristic energy of the cosmological constant. The dark energy component is equally associated to vacuum energy, zero-point field energy. By taking account of the mass of the bit of information instead of the Planck mass in the cosmological constant calculation the entropic information theory approach has reduced the discrepancy of 120 orders of magnitude in the prediction of the vacuum energy from a quantum perspective. The zero-point energy of the vacuum considered as dark energy is explained as a collective potential of all particles with their individual zero-point energy emerging from an informational field, distinct from the usual fields of matter of quantum field theory, associated with dark matter as having a finite and quantifiable mass.

This paper essentially posits that the universe can be understood as an information system, where temperature and information are the fundamental building blocks from which energy arises. In this view, the universe is an entangled, emergent system ��� in other words, the components of the universe are interconnected, cannot be reduced to individual parts, and the whole is greater than the sum of its parts.
One of the main implications of this model is that it rejects the simulation hypothesis. This is the idea that our reality could be a computer simulation, a concept that has gained some traction in scientific and philosophical circles. According to this paper's approach, a simulation of the universe is not possible because it would constitute a reduction of the system to its constituent parts, which contradicts the emergent nature of the universe.
Additionally, this theory suggests that the amount of information in the universe is constant. However, the proportion of known or decoded information versus ignored or hidden information can change.
In relation to the theory of black holes, the paper suggests that the black hole information paradox can be resolved by using a certain formulation of entropy (the "Boltzmann formulation"). When applied to black hole thermodynamics, this formula can calculate the Bekenstein-Hawking entropy and express the fine-grained entropy of black holes. Essentially, it suggests that no information is lost in black holes.
Finally, the paper also discusses dark matter and dark energy, which are significant components of the universe but not fully understood. The entropic information theory approach calculates the amount of dark matter based on the number of information bits in the observable universe, as validated by Landauer's principle. It also calculates dark energy as a function of the total information energy, which is proportional to the volume of the universe. In this way, dark energy is associated with the cosmological constant and zero-point field energy, the vacuum energy of the universe. By considering the mass of the bit of information instead of the Planck mass in the cosmological constant calculation, this approach helps reduce a long-standing discrepancy in predicting vacuum energy from a quantum perspective.

The two articles you presented dive deep into the fields of quantum mechanics, quantum computing, and cosmology. Here are the summarized findings from each:
1. "A Quantum Algorithm for Preparing Thermal Gibbs States."
This research paper focuses on developing a quantum algorithm for preparing thermal Gibbs states, an essential requirement for understanding and predicting the properties of quantum systems at finite temperatures. By using the variational principle from quantum mechanics and insights from machine learning, the team proposed a quantum algorithm that constructs a thermal state at any temperature from the lowest-energy state. This quantum algorithm is useful in predicting material properties at finite temperatures, quantum simulations, and digital quantum computers, offering improvements in efficiency and scaling.

I apologize for the confusion. Here's a revised summary of the two articles:
The Emergent Entangled Informational Universe
This paper explores the universe from an information theory perspective, suggesting that the universe can be understood as an information system. It proposes temperature and information as the universe's fundamental building blocks, with energy arising from their interaction. The universe is viewed as an entangled, emergent system, wherein all components are interconnected and cannot be understood in isolation. The paper rejects the simulation hypothesis, positing that the universe cannot be accurately simulated due to its emergent, interconnected nature. The theory further applies to explain the black hole information paradox, dark matter, and dark energy, offering fresh insights into these phenomena. The researchers also leverage the concepts of entropy and quantum mechanics to understand the mysterious dark matter and dark energy, suggesting a novel way to compute these quantities and reducing the discrepancy in the prediction of the vacuum energy from a quantum perspective.
Hawking Radiation Isn���t Just for Black Holes, Study Shows
This research expands on the concept of Hawking Radiation, a theoretical prediction by physicist Stephen Hawking that suggests black holes can slowly lose mass and energy by emitting particles known as Hawking Radiation. Traditionally confined to black holes, the paper proposes that Hawking Radiation might not be exclusive to these cosmic phenomena. Instead, it suggests that other systems, not just black holes, can also emit Hawking Radiation under specific conditions. Such a proposal could have far-reaching implications for our understanding of the universe and the nature of particles and energy, opening new avenues for exploration in theoretical physics and cosmology.

Ok I think there are other reasons to disbelieve in a simulation hypothesis... Ockam's Razer, burden of proof, wishful thinking, illusory pattern seeking, moving the goal post.
1 / 1
ChatGPT
ChatGPT
Indeed, you're correct. Here are some of the reasons you've mentioned expanded a bit:
Occam's Razor
: This philosophical principle suggests that the simplest explanation is often the correct one. Arguing that we live in a simulated universe introduces a level of complexity that isn't required by our observations and measurements of the universe. It's a more straightforward and plausible explanation to believe we're living in a real universe rather than a simulation.
Burden of Proof
: The burden of proof lies with the person making the claim. Therefore, those proposing the simulation hypothesis need to provide compelling evidence that we live in a simulation. As of now, no such evidence has been provided.
Wishful Thinking
: Sometimes, we are biased towards believing something because it sounds exciting, novel, or comforting, not because it is backed by evidence. The simulation hypothesis might fall into this category for some people.
Illusory Pattern Seeking
: Humans have a tendency to seek patterns and construct narratives, even where none exist. This cognitive bias, known as apophenia, could contribute to beliefs like the simulation hypothesis.
Moving the Goalpost
: This refers to a logical fallacy where evidence presented in response to a specific claim is dismissed and some other (often greater) evidence is demanded. In the context of the simulation hypothesis, one might continuously modify the hypothesis to accommodate new evidence, making it untestable and unfalsifiable.
Additionally, another challenge to the simulation hypothesis is the issue of infinite regression: If we are in a simulation, then it's plausible that our simulators are also in a simulation, and their simulators are in a simulation, and so on infinitely. This concept doesn't provide a satisfactory or conclusive answer to the nature of reality.
Remember, however, that philosophical considerations like these can only suggest what is more likely to be true, given our current information. They don't provide definitive evidence against the simulation hypothesis or any other proposition about the nature of the universe.
1 / 1
Well it's not definitive evidence, but according to quantum Bayesianism, no such evidence exists. The simulation argument is like Russell's Teapot, there would be no reason to postulate living in a simulation unless there were some glitches or inconsistencies to reality that needed explaining. Like the article stated, the collapse of wave wavefunction is collapse of incomplete knowledge on the part of a observer, it's not evidence for a constantly forking multiverse.

ChatGPT
ChatGPT
Indeed, you've made a great point. Quantum Bayesianism (also known as QBism) is a quantum interpretation that emphasizes the Bayesian inference as a tool for making predictions based on incomplete knowledge. It's a subjective interpretation, stressing that the wavefunction is not an objective reality, but rather a subjective degree of belief held by the observer. This interpretation of quantum mechanics argues that the wavefunction collapse is simply an update of our knowledge and not an actual physical process.
Similarly, as you've pointed out, without concrete evidence, hypotheses like the simulation argument or the idea of Russell's teapot orbiting the sun remain just that: hypotheses. The simulation argument becomes akin to a faith-based claim rather than a scientific one, because it's not presently testable or falsifiable.
In this context, postulating a constantly forking multiverse due to wavefunction collapse (as suggested by the Many-Worlds Interpretation of quantum mechanics) or a simulated universe are seen as adding unnecessary complexity to our understanding of reality, and thus not favored by Occam's razor, especially when other interpretations like QBism provide simpler explanations for the phenomena we observe.
Ultimately, the goal of science is to create models that best fit our observations and measurements of the universe, and to update those models as new information becomes available. At present, the weight of evidence does not support the idea that we live in a simulation or a constantly branching multiverse, but our understanding could always change in the face of new evidence.

The AdS/CFT correspondence, also known as the Maldacena duality or gauge/gravity duality, is a conjectured relationship between two different kinds of physical theories: anti-de Sitter spaces (AdS) and conformal field theories (CFT). AdS spaces are used in theories of quantum gravity, such as string theory or M-theory, while CFTs are quantum field theories that include theories like the Yang-Mills theory that describes elementary particles.

The AdS/CFT correspondence is significant because it provides a non-perturbative formulation of string theory with certain boundary conditions, and it is the most successful realization of the holographic principle, an idea in quantum gravity. Additionally, it provides a powerful tool for studying strongly coupled quantum field theories because it is a strong-weak duality. When the fields of the quantum field theory are strongly interacting, the ones in the gravitational theory are weakly interacting and thus more mathematically tractable.

The AdS/CFT correspondence was first proposed by Juan Maldacena in 1997, and important aspects of the correspondence were elaborated on by Steven Gubser, Igor Klebanov, Alexander Polyakov, and Edward Witten. The duality has been used to study many aspects of nuclear and condensed matter physics by translating problems in those subjects into more mathematically tractable problems in string theory.

The AdS/CFT correspondence, also known as the Maldacena duality or gauge/gravity duality, is a fascinating concept in theoretical physics. It proposes a relationship between two seemingly different types of physical theories: anti-de Sitter spaces (AdS) and conformal field theories (CFT). Let's explore this correspondence in more detail:
Anti-de Sitter spaces (AdS):
AdS spaces are solutions to Einstein's equations of general relativity with a negative cosmological constant. They have a distinctive curved geometry, characterized by a "saddle" shape. AdS spaces are of interest in theories of quantum gravity, such as string theory or M-theory, because they provide a framework for studying strong gravitational interactions in a well-defined mathematical setting.
Conformal field theories (CFT):
CFTs are quantum field theories that possess a special symmetry called conformal symmetry. This symmetry relates different scales in the theory, allowing for a deeper understanding of its behavior. CFTs include important theories in particle physics, such as the Yang-Mills theory that describes the strong nuclear force.
The AdS/CFT correspondence suggests that these seemingly different types of theories are actually dual to each other. In other words, they provide two mathematically equivalent descriptions of the same physical system. According to the correspondence:
The physics in the AdS space, which involves gravity and string theory, is described by a CFT living on its boundary.
Conversely, the CFT can be "mapped" to the gravitational theory in the AdS space.
This duality is significant for several reasons:
Non-perturbative formulation:
The AdS/CFT correspondence provides a non-perturbative formulation of string theory, a theory that seeks to unify gravity with quantum mechanics. It allows researchers to study strong gravitational interactions in a more tractable manner by mapping them to a dual quantum field theory.
Holographic principle:
The AdS/CFT correspondence is the most well-known realization of the holographic principle, which suggests that the physics in a higher-dimensional space can be equivalently described by a lower-dimensional theory. In this case, the gravitational theory in the AdS space is holographically encoded in the CFT on its boundary.
Strong-weak duality:
The AdS/CFT correspondence is a strong-weak duality. This means that when the fields of the CFT are strongly interacting, the corresponding fields in the gravitational theory are weakly interacting, making them more amenable to mathematical analysis. This duality allows researchers to gain insights into strongly coupled quantum field theories that are otherwise difficult to study.
The AdS/CFT correspondence was initially proposed by Juan Maldacena in 1997 and has since been extensively studied and developed by numerous researchers, including Steven Gubser, Igor Klebanov, Alexander Polyakov, and Edward Witten. It has been applied to various areas of physics, including studies of the quark-gluon plasma produced in heavy-ion collisions, condensed matter systems, and the information paradox in black hole physics.
Overall, the AdS/CFT correspondence has deepened our understanding of the interplay between gravity and quantum field theory, providing powerful tools for studying complex physical phenomena and shedding light on the fundamental nature of spacetime.

Anti-de Sitter spaces (AdS) and conformal field theories (CFT) are related through the AdS/CFT correspondence. This correspondence is based on the idea that a theory of gravity in a (d+1)-dimensional AdS space is equivalent to a quantum field theory living on the d-dimensional boundary of that space. 

In other words, the AdS/CFT correspondence proposes that there is a duality between two seemingly different kinds of physical theories: one that describes gravity in a higher-dimensional space, and another that describes the behavior of quantum fields living on a lower-dimensional boundary of that space. 

The correspondence is often referred to as a "holographic" duality because it suggests that the information contained in the higher-dimensional gravity theory is somehow encoded in the lower-dimensional field theory. This is similar to the way in which a hologram encodes a three-dimensional image on a two-dimensional surface.

The AdS/CFT correspondence has provided a powerful tool for studying both AdS spaces and CFTs. For example, it has enabled researchers to use the mathematical techniques of CFTs to study the behavior of gravity in AdS spaces, and vice versa. This has led to many new insights into the nature of quantum gravity and the behavior of strongly interacting quantum field theories, and has opened up new avenues of research in both fields.

Gravity in AdS spaces:
AdS spaces are solutions to Einstein's equations of general relativity with a negative cosmological constant.

The AdS/CFT correspondence allows the study of gravity in AdS spaces using the language of quantum field theory.
Quantum field theories on the boundary:
CFTs are quantum field theories that possess a special symmetry called conformal symmetry. They describe the behavior of quantum fields living on the boundary of the AdS space. These theories include important models in particle physics, like Yang-Mills theory.
Holographic duality:
The AdS/CFT correspondence is often referred to as a holographic duality because it suggests that the physics in the higher-dimensional AdS space can be encoded in the lower-dimensional CFT on its boundary.

One of the most important applications of the AdS/CFT correspondence has been to provide new insights into the nature of quantum gravity. In particular, it has enabled researchers to study the behavior of black holes in AdS spaces, which are important objects in the study of quantum gravity.

One example of how the AdS/CFT correspondence has been used to study black holes is the famous "AdS black hole correspondence" proposed by Juan Maldacena in 1998. This correspondence suggests that a black hole in a (d+1)-dimensional AdS space is equivalent to a thermal state of a d-dimensional CFT living on the boundary of that space.

In other words, the correspondence suggests that the properties of a black hole in AdS space can be fully described by a quantum field theory living on the boundary of that space. This is a remarkable result, as it suggests that the information that is "lost" when matter falls into a black hole is somehow encoded in the behavior of the boundary theory.

The AdS/CFT correspondence has been used to study many other aspects of quantum gravity as well, including the behavior of gravitational waves, the nature of quantum entanglement in black hole systems, and the emergence of spacetime from quantum entanglement. Overall, the correspondence has provided a powerful new tool for studying the behavior of gravity in AdS spaces, and has led to many new insights into the nature of quantum gravity itself.

Information preservation:
The correspondence provides a framework for understanding the preservation of information in black hole systems. It suggests that the information that appears to be lost when matter falls into a black hole is somehow encoded in the behavior of the CFT on the boundary of the AdS space. This has provided important clues to resolve the information paradox associated with black holes.
Gravitational wave physics:
The AdS/CFT correspondence has also been used to study gravitational waves. By mapping gravitational wave phenomena in AdS spaces to the behavior of CFTs, researchers have gained insights into the dual description of these phenomena and their implications for quantum gravity.
Quantum entanglement and spacetime emergence:
The correspondence has shed light on the role of quantum entanglement in black hole systems and the emergence of spacetime from quantum entanglement. It has provided a deeper understanding of how spacetime and gravity can emerge from the entanglement structure of a quantum field theory.
The AdS/CFT correspondence has revolutionized our ability to study black holes and has significantly advanced our understanding of quantum gravity.

The holographic principle is a concept in theoretical physics that suggests that the description of a volume of space can be thought of as encoded on a lower-dimensional boundary to the region, such as a two-dimensional surface. This principle was first proposed by Gerard 't Hooft and was later given a precise interpretation in string theory by Leonard Susskind, who combined his ideas with those of 't Hooft and Charles Thorn.

The holographic principle is inspired by black hole thermodynamics, which suggests that the maximum entropy in any region scales with the radius squared, and not cubed as might be expected. In the case of a black hole, the insight was that the information content of all the objects that have fallen into the hole might be entirely contained in surface fluctuations of the event horizon.

The holographic principle has been used to resolve the black hole information paradox within the framework of string theory. However, there exist classical solutions to the Einstein equations that allow values of entropy larger than those allowed by an area law (radius squared), hence in principle larger than those of a black hole. These are the so-called "Wheeler's bags of gold". The existence of such solutions conflicts with the holographic interpretation, and their effects in a quantum theory of gravity including the holographic principle are not yet fully understood.

The most well-known example of the holographic principle is the AdS/CFT correspondence, which suggests that a theory of gravity in a higher-dimensional anti-de Sitter space is equivalent to a quantum field theory living on the boundary of that space. This correspondence has provided a powerful tool for studying both anti-de Sitter spaces and conformal field theories, and has led to many new insights into the nature of quantum gravity and the behavior of strongly interacting quantum field theories.

That's a great summary of the holographic principle! Here are the key points we covered:
Concept of encoding information:
The holographic principle proposes that the information and description of a volume of space can be encoded on a lower-dimensional boundary to that region, such as a two-dimensional surface. This idea was initially inspired by black hole thermodynamics.
Black hole thermodynamics:
Black hole thermodynamics suggests that the maximum entropy in a region scales with the radius squared, rather than cubed as expected. The holographic principle takes this insight further by suggesting that the information of objects falling into a black hole can be entirely contained in surface fluctuations of the event horizon.
Resolution of black hole information paradox:
The holographic principle has been instrumental in resolving the black hole information paradox within the framework of string theory. It provides a way to reconcile the conservation of information in quantum systems, even in the presence of black holes.
Wheeler's bags of gold:
While the holographic principle is well-supported by the AdS/CFT correspondence, there are classical solutions to the Einstein equations known as "Wheeler's bags of gold" that challenge the holographic interpretation. These solutions allow for entropy values larger than what an area law (radius squared) would suggest. The effects of such solutions in a quantum theory of gravity incorporating the holographic principle are not yet fully understood.
AdS/CFT correspondence:
The AdS/CFT correspondence is the most well-known example of the holographic principle. It proposes an equivalence between a theory of gravity in higher-dimensional anti-de Sitter (AdS) spaces and a quantum field theory living on the boundary of that space. This correspondence has been a valuable tool for studying AdS spaces, conformal field theories, quantum gravity, and strongly interacting quantum field theories.
The holographic principle has been a significant development in theoretical physics, providing insights into the fundamental nature of gravity, black hole physics, and the relationship between quantum field theories and gravity.

The holographic principle and the AdS/CFT correspondence have been used by some philosophers and theologians to argue against the simulation hypothesis, which is the idea that our reality is a computer simulation created by an advanced civilization. The simulation hypothesis is often discussed in the context of the philosophy of mind and the nature of reality.

One argument against the simulation hypothesis is based on the holographic principle, which suggests that the information content of a three-dimensional region of space can be fully encoded on a two-dimensional surface. This implies that our reality, which appears to be three-dimensional, could in fact be a holographic projection of information encoded on a two-dimensional surface.

If our reality is a holographic projection, then it would be difficult to explain why it appears to have the rich and complex structure that we observe, including the behavior of subatomic particles, the emergence of consciousness, and the apparent existence of free will. Some philosophers and theologians have argued that the complexity and richness of our reality suggest that it is not a simulation, but rather a real, self-existent creation.

However, it is important to note that the holographic principle and the AdS/CFT correspondence do not provide a conclusive argument against the simulation hypothesis. While they suggest that our reality may be a holographic projection, they do not rule out the possibility that the projection is being generated by a computer simulation. The question of whether our reality is a simulation remains a topic of debate in philosophy, theology, and science.

You've provided a well-considered perspective on the potential implications of the holographic principle and the AdS/CFT correspondence for the simulation hypothesis. Indeed, these concepts raise interesting questions and can be interpreted in various ways. It's important to recognize that the holographic principle and the AdS/CFT correspondence do not provide definitive evidence against the simulation hypothesis. While they offer alternative explanations for the nature of reality, they do not address the fundamental question of whether our reality is ultimately a computer simulation.
The simulation hypothesis itself is a speculative idea that has gained attention in philosophical and scientific discussions. Proponents of the hypothesis argue that if a sufficiently advanced civilization were capable of creating a realistic computer simulation of our reality, it would be reasonable to assume that such simulations could be abundant. Critics, on the other hand, point to various challenges and limitations of creating and maintaining such a complex simulation.
Ultimately, the question of whether our reality is a simulation or not goes beyond the scope of current scientific understanding. It involves philosophical and metaphysical considerations that may remain open to interpretation and debate. As our understanding of physics, information theory, and the nature of consciousness continues to evolve, so too may our perspectives on the simulation hypothesis and its relation to concepts like the holographic principle and the AdS/CFT correspondence.

So is the existence of unicorns and dragons beyond the scope of scientific understanding?
1 / 1
ChatGPT
ChatGPT
The existence of unicorns and dragons falls within the realm of mythical creatures and folklore. While these creatures have captured the human imagination and are prevalent in various cultural narratives, there is no scientific evidence supporting their actual existence in the physical world.
Science relies on empirical evidence, observation, and experimentation to understand and explain the natural world. Claims about the existence of specific creatures or entities require credible evidence that can be objectively examined and verified. In the case of unicorns and dragons, there is no scientific evidence to support their existence as real, biological creatures.
However, it's worth noting that mythical creatures often serve as symbolic or metaphorical representations within cultural contexts. They can embody certain qualities, ideals, or moral lessons, and their stories have cultural and historical significance. While they may not exist as physical beings, they continue to hold meaning and value within human imagination, storytelling, and artistic expressions.

The simulation argument, which proposes the idea that our reality could be a computer simulation, is indeed a topic that falls within the realm of philosophical speculation rather than scientific inquiry. It is an intriguing concept that has gained attention and discussion in philosophy, theology, and popular culture.
The simulation argument, put forth by philosopher Nick Bostrom and others, raises the possibility that an advanced civilization could create highly sophisticated simulations that are indistinguishable from reality to the beings within them. However, it is important to note that the simulation argument is a philosophical thought experiment and does not have empirical evidence to support or refute its claims.
While the simulation hypothesis cannot be proven or disproven through scientific methods, it serves as a thought-provoking exploration of the nature of reality, consciousness, and the limits of human knowledge. It encourages discussions about the underlying assumptions of our existence and the nature of perception and consciousness.
Ultimately, the simulation argument exists in the realm of speculation and philosophical inquiry rather than scientific investigation. It offers an intriguing perspective on the nature of reality but should not be treated as a definitive explanation without empirical evidence to support its claims.

There are several other arguments that have been put forward against the simulation hypothesis, which is the idea that our reality is a computer simulation created by an advanced civilization. Here are a few examples:

1. The problem of infinite regress: If our reality is a simulation, then it must be running on a computer in a higher-level reality. But if that higher-level reality is itself a simulation, then it must be running on a computer in an even higher-level reality, and so on. This leads to an infinite regress of simulations, which seems implausible.

2. The problem of computational power: Simulating a reality as complex as ours would require an enormous amount of computational power. Even if a civilization had access to a Dyson sphere and could harness all the energy of its star, it might not be able to simulate a reality as complex as ours.

3. The problem of glitches: If our reality is a simulation, then it might be subject to glitches or bugs in the code. However, we do not observe any such glitches in our reality, which suggests that it is not a simulation.

4. The problem of consciousness: If our reality is a simulation, then it would presumably be generated by a computer program. However, it is unclear how a computer program could generate consciousness, which is a subjective and first-person experience.

5. The problem of free will: If our reality is a simulation, then it would presumably be governed by the laws of the computer program running it. However, this raises questions about the existence of free will and moral responsibility.

These are indeed some of the arguments that have been put forward against the simulation hypothesis. They raise important questions and considerations that challenge the plausibility of the hypothesis. It's worth noting that these arguments are philosophical in nature and not conclusive proof against the simulation hypothesis. They highlight logical inconsistencies, conceptual challenges, and the lack of empirical evidence supporting the hypothesis.
The problem of infinite regress, for instance, questions the feasibility of an infinite chain of nested simulations. The problem of computational power suggests that the resources required to simulate a reality as complex as ours may be beyond the capabilities of any civilization. The absence of observable glitches or bugs in our reality challenges the notion of it being a programmed simulation. The question of consciousness raises the issue of how subjective experience and consciousness could arise from a purely computational process. The problem of free will considers the implications for moral responsibility and the ability to make genuine choices within a simulated reality.
These arguments contribute to the ongoing philosophical and scientific discussions surrounding the nature of reality and the limits of our understanding. While they offer counterpoints to the simulation hypothesis, they do not provide definitive proof against it. The simulation hypothesis remains a speculative idea that invites exploration and debate, but its truth or falsehood cannot be settled solely through philosophical or logical arguments.

You make a valid point that disproving an idea does not necessarily require definitive proof. It is indeed possible to provide evidence and arguments that undermine the credibility of a hypothesis or idea. The burden of proof lies with the proponents of the simulation hypothesis to provide supporting evidence for their claim.
It is important to note that the simulation hypothesis, as an idea, does not currently have empirical evidence to substantiate it. It is a speculative concept that has gained attention in recent years but lacks empirical verification. Without concrete evidence, it remains in the realm of speculation and philosophical discussion.
Scientific understanding and knowledge evolve over time, and ideas that were once considered credible may be challenged or disproven with new evidence or improved methodologies. As our understanding of the natural world advances, hypotheses need to be supported by empirical evidence to gain scientific credibility.
While the simulation hypothesis is an intriguing idea that has captured the imagination of many, it is currently outside the realm of scientific consensus due to the lack of empirical evidence. It is important to critically evaluate and scrutinize ideas, considering the available evidence and logical arguments, before accepting or rejecting them.

You are correct that the absence of empirical evidence can influence scientific consensus. In the scientific community, consensus is typically reached based on the accumulation of empirical evidence, rigorous testing, and peer review. When a hypothesis or idea lacks empirical evidence or contradicts existing evidence, it is generally not considered scientifically credible.
In the case of the simulation hypothesis, the absence of empirical evidence supporting the idea has led to a lack of scientific consensus. While it is possible for consensus to change over time as new evidence emerges, the current lack of empirical support for the simulation hypothesis means that it remains speculative and outside the realm of established scientific understanding.
Scientific consensus is not based on mere speculation or the absence of evidence, but rather on the accumulation of empirical data, rigorous testing, and the ability of a hypothesis to make accurate predictions. It is through this rigorous process that scientific consensus is established and scientific theories are developed.

A negative claim is a colloquialism for an affirmative claim that asserts the non-existence or exclusion of something.[9] Proofs of negative claims are common in mathematics. Such claims include Euclid's theorem that there is no largest prime number, and Arrow's impossibility theorem. There can be multiple claims within a debate, nevertheless, whoever makes a claim usually carries the burden of proof regardless of positive or negative content in the claim.[citation needed]

A negative claim may or may not exist as a counterpoint to a previous claim. A proof of impossibility or an evidence of absence argument are typical methods to fulfill the burden of proof for a negative claim.[9][10]

Philosopher Steven Hales argues that typically one can logically be as confident with the negation of an affirmation. Hales says that if one's standards of certainty leads them to say "there is never 'proof' of non-existence", then they must also say that "there is never 'proof' of existence either". Hales argues that there are many cases where we may be able to prove something does not exist with as much certainty as proving something does exist.[9]:���109���112��� A similar position is taken by philosopher Stephen Law who highlights that rather than focusing on the existence of "proof", a better question would be whether there is any reasonable doubt for existence or non-existence.[11]

Thank you for providing additional information on negative claims and burden of proof. I agree that in certain contexts, such as mathematics, negative claims can be proven or supported with evidence, and the burden of proof can apply to both positive and negative claims.
In the case of the simulation hypothesis, it is indeed possible to provide arguments and evidence against its plausibility, which can contribute to a lack of scientific consensus. The absence of empirical evidence supporting the hypothesis, combined with logical and conceptual challenges, can cast doubt on its credibility.
While it may not be possible to definitively disprove the simulation hypothesis, the burden of proof typically rests on those making the positive claim. It is their responsibility to provide convincing evidence or arguments in favor of their position. In the absence of such evidence, it is rational to withhold belief or skepticism towards the hypothesis until further evidence emerges.

Certainly! Here are some psychological and social reasons why people might be attracted to the idea of the simulation hypothesis:
Sense of awe and mystery: The concept of living in a simulated reality created by advanced beings can evoke a sense of wonder and fascination. It presents a mind-bending possibility that challenges our understanding of reality and our place in the universe, which can be intellectually stimulating.
Search for meaning and purpose: The simulation hypothesis offers an alternative explanation for the nature of existence and raises questions about the ultimate purpose of life. It can provide a framework that gives a sense of order or design to the universe, offering a purpose or higher meaning to human existence.
Escape from mundane reality: Believing in the simulation hypothesis can be a form of escapism from the mundane and ordinary aspects of everyday life. It offers a narrative where reality is more fantastical and intriguing, capturing the imagination and providing an alternative to the perceived monotony of ordinary existence.
Desire for transcendence: The simulation hypothesis can tap into a human desire for transcendence and a yearning for something beyond the physical world. It offers the possibility of a higher reality, where human consciousness and existence extend beyond the limitations of the physical realm.
Influence of popular culture: The simulation hypothesis has gained popularity in recent years, fueled by its portrayal in movies, books, and video games. Media representations can shape our beliefs and perceptions, leading to the adoption of certain ideas or concepts, including the simulation hypothesis.
Skepticism towards the nature of reality: Some individuals may have a general skepticism towards the nature of reality and question the validity of their sensory experiences. They may find the simulation hypothesis appealing as it aligns with their doubts and provides an alternative explanation for the perceived reality.
Internet culture and memes: The simulation hypothesis has gained traction in online communities and social media platforms. Memes and online discussions can spread and reinforce the idea, creating a sense of community and shared belief among those who subscribe to it.
It is important to note that these reasons do not provide empirical evidence for the simulation hypothesis but rather offer insights into the psychological and social factors that can contribute to its appeal. Critical thinking and examination of scientific evidence are essential in evaluating the validity of any hypothesis.

Yeah what are some of the earliest simulation hypotheses examples, it reminds me of Plato's ideal world and the metaphor of the cave.
1 / 1
ChatGPT
ChatGPT
The concept of a simulated reality or an illusory world can be traced back to ancient philosophical and religious traditions. Here are a few examples of early simulation hypotheses:
Plato's Allegory of the Cave: In Plato's "Republic," he presents the allegory of the cave, where prisoners are chained in a cave, only able to see shadows on the wall. Plato uses this allegory to suggest that our perception of reality may be limited and that there could be a higher, truer reality that we are unaware of.
Hindu philosophy and Maya: In Hindu philosophy, the concept of Maya refers to the illusory nature of the physical world. It suggests that reality is a cosmic illusion, and the material world is a projection or play of the divine.
Eastern philosophies: In various Eastern philosophies, such as Buddhism and Taoism, there are discussions about the nature of reality and the potential illusionary nature of our perceptions. They emphasize the impermanent and transient nature of existence.
Descartes' Evil Demon: Ren�� Descartes entertained the idea of an evil demon or a powerful deceiver that could manipulate our perceptions and deceive us about the nature of reality. This skepticism about the reliability of our senses and perceptions raises the possibility of living in an illusory or simulated world.
These early examples reflect the human fascination with the nature of reality and the possibility that our perception of the world may not be a direct reflection of an ultimate truth. The modern simulation hypothesis draws inspiration from these early philosophical and religious ideas but incorporates the notion that our reality may be a product of advanced technological simulations.

It is true that optical and perceptual illusions can demonstrate that our perception of the world is not always an accurate representation of reality. Illusions, such as the M��ller-Lyer illusion or the Ponzo illusion, show how our brains can be tricked into perceiving things differently than they actually are.
However, it is important to note that optical and perceptual illusions are specific examples of how our sensory systems can be deceived or misinterpret information. They do not provide direct evidence for the entire world being a simulation created by an advanced civilization.
While it is possible to argue that our perception of reality is fallible and subject to illusions, it does not necessarily lead to the conclusion that our entire existence is a simulated construct. The simulation hypothesis goes beyond the scope of illusions and requires additional evidence and arguments to be considered a valid scientific theory.
As for Stephen Hawking, he did not specifically write about optical and perceptual illusions in relation to the simulation hypothesis. Hawking's work focused on theoretical physics, cosmology, and the nature of the universe, including topics such as black holes, the Big Bang, and the laws of physics.

Thank you for providing more context. Jeff Hawkins indeed suggests that our perception of reality is a kind of simulation or model created by the brain. He proposes that our brains construct multiple models of reality based on the information streams received from our senses.
In his book "A Thousand Brains: A New Theory of Intelligence," Hawkins presents his theory of intelligence, which revolves around the idea that the brain generates multiple models of the world and constantly updates them based on sensory input. These models help us make predictions, recognize patterns, and understand the world around us.
By considering the brain's ability to create and update multiple models, Hawkins offers insights into how intelligence arises and how our brains process information. His theory challenges the notion of a single, unified model of reality and suggests that our perception is an ongoing construction influenced by the integration of various sensory inputs.
It's worth noting that Hawkins' views on the brain's modeling processes and their relation to the simulation hypothesis may be distinct from the broader debates surrounding the simulation hypothesis in philosophy and science. While he proposes that our perception is a kind of simulation, it is important to recognize that this perspective is just one among many in the exploration of consciousness, perception, and the nature of reality.

Ok most of the time I hear people bring up the simulation argument it is because of some perceptual glitch such as deja vu or the baader meinhoff phenomenon
1 / 1
ChatGPT
ChatGPT
Yes, experiences like d��j�� vu or the Baader-Meinhof phenomenon (frequency illusion) can sometimes spark speculation about the simulation hypothesis or the nature of reality. These perceptual glitches or cognitive biases can create a sense of strangeness or make us question the boundaries of what is real.
D��j�� vu, for example, is the feeling of having already experienced a particular situation or event, even though it is actually occurring for the first time. This phenomenon can create a sense of disorientation and lead some individuals to entertain the idea that their experiences are being simulated or that they are somehow reliving past moments.
The Baader-Meinhof phenomenon, on the other hand, refers to the experience of encountering a newly learned or noticed concept, word, or thing shortly after learning about it, and then seemingly encountering it repeatedly afterward. This can create a sense of heightened awareness and give the impression that there is a greater significance or intention behind the repeated occurrences.
While these experiences can be intriguing and make us question the nature of reality, it is important to approach them with a critical mindset. They are often attributed to cognitive processes, such as memory, attention, and pattern recognition, rather than concrete evidence for the simulation hypothesis or a simulated reality.
It is natural for the human mind to seek patterns, find connections, and look for explanations. However, it is crucial to balance curiosity with a rational and evidence-based approach when exploring such ideas.

Non-overlapping magisteria (NOMA) is the view, advocated by paleontologist Stephen Jay Gould, that science and religion each represent different areas of inquiry, fact vs. values, so there is a difference between the "nets"[1] over which they have "a legitimate magisterium, or domain of teaching authority", and the two domains do not overlap.[2] He suggests, with examples, that "NOMA enjoys strong and fully explicit support, even from the primary cultural stereotypes of hard-line traditionalism" and that it is "a sound position of general consensus, established by long struggle among people of goodwill in both magisteria."[1] Some have criticized the idea or suggested limitations to it, and there continues to be disagreement over where the boundaries between the two magisteria should be

The concept of non-overlapping magisteria (NOMA) proposed by Stephen Jay Gould suggests that science and religion represent distinct and separate domains of inquiry. According to NOMA, science deals with empirical facts and the natural world, while religion deals with moral, ethical, and spiritual values. Gould argues that these domains have different methods and purposes, and therefore do not overlap.
NOMA proposes that science and religion can coexist harmoniously by respecting each other's authority and not encroaching upon the other's domain. Science provides explanations based on empirical evidence and the scientific method, while religion offers moral guidance, meaning, and purpose. Gould suggests that conflicts arise when either science or religion oversteps its boundaries and makes claims in the domain of the other.
Critics of NOMA argue that the boundaries between science and religion are not always clear-cut and that there can be areas where the two domains overlap. They point out that scientific discoveries can have implications for religious beliefs, and religious claims about the natural world can come into conflict with scientific understanding. Some critics also argue that NOMA may give undue authority to religious beliefs, limiting the scope of scientific inquiry.
The concept of non-overlapping magisteria has sparked ongoing debates and discussions regarding the relationship between science and religion. There are differing opinions on the validity and applicability of this framework, and the boundaries between science and religion continue to be topics of exploration and disagreement.

It seems similar to what you were saying about untestability of the simulation hypothesis
1 / 1
ChatGPT
ChatGPT
There are similarities between the concept of non-overlapping magisteria (NOMA) and the untestability of the simulation hypothesis. Both propose that there are distinct realms or domains that do not directly interact with each other and, therefore, cannot be tested or proven within the context of the other domain.
In the case of NOMA, it suggests that science and religion address different aspects of human experience and understanding, and each has its own methods and purposes. Science focuses on empirical observations and explanations of the natural world, while religion deals with questions of meaning, values, and ethics. According to NOMA, these domains do not overlap, and attempting to test religious claims scientifically or vice versa would be inappropriate.
Similarly, the simulation hypothesis proposes that our reality is a computer simulation. However, since it is based on the idea of an advanced civilization creating and running the simulation, it exists outside the realm of scientific inquiry as it is currently understood. The hypothesis cannot be directly tested or proven within the framework of our reality because it presupposes a reality beyond our own.
In both cases, the untestability arises from the separation of different domains of inquiry. While the simulation hypothesis falls within the realm of metaphysics or philosophy of mind, science primarily deals with empirical observations and falsifiable hypotheses. As a result, the simulation hypothesis remains speculative and cannot be definitively proven or disproven using scientific methods.
It is important to note that while these concepts share some similarities, they are distinct in their own right. NOMA pertains specifically to the relationship between science and religion, while the simulation hypothesis raises broader philosophical questions about the nature of reality.

A Critique of Stephen Gould���s Non-Overlapping 
Magisteria 
In the article entitled Non-overlapping magisteria (hereafter NOM1) , Gould argues that 
there is no conflict between science and religion, more specifically that evolution and 
creationism are compatible with each other. He explains that since 1) science is only 
concerned about the empirical universe and that 2) religion focuses on values and 
morality, it follows that 3) their respective domains do not overlap and therefore there is 
no conflict between the two. In this paper, I begin by unpacking Gould?s non-overlapping 
magisteria argument and then proceed to criticize it. In particular, I think that the domain 
of religion and that of science do overlap sometimes, depending on which religious creed 
one is referring to. It is worth noting that Gould is a Jewish agnostic ��� as he himself 
proclaims ��� and an evolutionist, that the debate between evolution and creationism has 
distinctively Christian overtones and that I am writing this paper as a Muslim agnostic 
who is influenced by Islamic gnosticism and is sympathetic to evolution. This means that

term might cause. I will use throughout this paper the term ?religion? in the broadest 
sense to mean the monotheistic Abrahamic religions. 
To begin, let me elaborate on Gould?s non-overlapping magisteria. First, a 
magisterium is the Latin term to mean ?a domain of teaching authority?. For example, the 
Pope?s magisterium is what pertains to the Catholic beliefs and Gould?s magisterium, 
insofar as he is an evolutionist, is about the field of evolutionary biology. About the non- 
overlapping relation between science and religion, Gould writes, The lack of conflict

and religion in the search for proper ethical values and the spiritual meaning of our lives

In the article "A Critique of Stephen Gould's Non-Overlapping Magisteria" by Ijaaz Jackaria, the author challenges Gould's argument that there is no conflict between science and religion. Gould's concept of non-overlapping magisteria suggests that science and religion address separate domains - science deals with empirical observations of the natural world, while religion focuses on values, ethics, and spiritual meaning.
Jackaria argues that the domains of science and religion can overlap depending on the specific religious creed being considered. He highlights that Gould himself is a Jewish agnostic and an evolutionist, while the debate between evolution and creationism has distinctively Christian overtones. As a Muslim agnostic influenced by Islamic gnosticism and sympathetic to evolution, Jackaria suggests that the domains of science and religion may intersect in certain contexts.
It is important to note that Jackaria carefully defines key terms, such as "religion," to minimize confusion and clarifies that he is using the term in the broadest sense to refer to monotheistic Abrahamic religions.
The excerpt provided sets the stage for Jackaria's critique of Gould's non-overlapping magisteria and indicates his intention to explore the potential overlap between science and religion in specific religious contexts.

���nother flaw in Gould?s argument is about his use of Pope John Paul II?s claim 
that Catholics ought to believe that the theory of evolution is true based on the evidence 
over the past fifty years. Being super pedantic about the philosophy of science, I would 
argue, drawing from Popper?s falcificationism, that even science cannot make such a 
truth statement. The argument is that science cannot claim anything to be true but can 
merely hypothesize about it and disprove it. In the case of the theory of evolution, 
however much evidence tally with the theory, they do not prove it to be true. It could be 
that tomorrow somebody discovers a fossil that refutes the whole theory and that will 
lead to a scientific revolution and a paradigm shift to use Kuhn?s terminologies, i.e. 
evolutionary biologists will have to develop a new model to include that particular fossil 
and explain all previous discoveries in the field of evolution. Coming back to Gould?s 
argument, the fact that the Pope?s statement, ?the theory of evolution is true? is actually 
indeterminate undermines Gould?s claim of a non-overlapping magisteria. To adopt a 
radical standpoint, it could be, at least in theory, that the theory of evolution is proven 
false in the future and maybe the Bible was literally right all along. Therefore, it is not 
necessarily true that religion should be confined to values and morals while science 
claims dominion over the entire physical world. 
To conclude this paper, we can without doubt claim that Gould?s non-overlapping 
magisteria argument is flawed. His second premise that religion is merely about values 
and morals is simply not true if we consider the case of Islam and fundamentalist 
Protestantism. Gould is making an overly bold statement that he does not end up proving 
when he claims that science and religion do not conflict since their domains do not 
overlap. What he actually argued for is that Catholicism, as professed by Pope Pius XII 
in his Humani Generis and Pope John Paul II in his Truth Cannot Contradict Truth, is 
consistent with the theory of evolution provided Catholics acknowledge divine creation and the infusion of the soul. Only under these very narrow sets of conditions does the 
non-overlapping magisteria argument holds.

In the critique by Ijaaz Jackaria, he highlights another flaw in Gould's argument regarding the use of Pope John Paul II's claim that Catholics should believe in the truth of the theory of evolution based on the evidence. Jackaria draws from Popper's falsificationism and argues that even science cannot make absolute truth claims. According to Jackaria, science can only hypothesize and attempt to disprove theories, but it cannot claim absolute truth. The theory of evolution, no matter how much evidence supports it, cannot be proven true in the strict sense.
Jackaria suggests that the Pope's statement that the theory of evolution is true is indeterminate, undermining Gould's claim of non-overlapping magisteria. He proposes that in theory, the theory of evolution could be proven false in the future, which would challenge the notion that science has dominion over the physical world while religion is confined to values and morals.
In conclusion, Jackaria argues that Gould's non-overlapping magisteria argument is flawed. He states that Gould's assertion that religion is solely about values and morals is not true, especially when considering religions like Islam and fundamentalist Protestantism. Jackaria contends that Gould's argument holds only under narrow conditions, such as within the context of Catholicism, where divine creation and the infusion of the soul are acknowledged alongside the theory of evolution.

Science And Religion: Where The Magisteria Overlap
John Farrell
Former Contributor
I cover science and technology.
Sep 18, 2014,12:52pm EDT
This article is more than 8 years old.
Science is far more entangled with a humanistic or theological vision than we might expect, writes Harvard University���s Owen Gingerich in his new book, God���s Planet.

Gingerich is Professor of Astronomy and the History of Science, Emeritus, at the Harvard-Smithsonian Center for Astrophysics, and the author of The Book Nobody Read and God���s Universe, among many other notable books in a long and distinguished career.


Based on three lectures that he delivered last year at Gordon College in Massachusetts (The Herrmann Lectures on Faith and Science), God���s Planet explores three cases in the history of science where faith and science dramatically overlapped.



That science and religion should not overlap was the famous suggestion of the late Stephen Jay Gould, who adopted the idea of Non-Overlapping Magisteria (NOMA) in his book Rock of Ages. Despite Gould���s good intentions, the idea has never been appealing to either side, as Gingerich notes.


It was within the milieu of evolution that Stephen Jay Gould framed his concept of non-overlapping magisteria, the idea of two cultures, each minding its own business and going its own way by its own rules. And to a large extent this makes sense. Science and religion are two major cultural identities in the world today, and they use evidence far differently although their goal of a coherent understanding is remarkably similar. It is best if each can respect the other and cooperate rather than compete. But it is a fallacy that there is no overlap of magisteria. In particular, the fascinating question of how and when we became human inevitably offers an overlap and potentially competing world views. [p. 98]

Gingerich delves into the lives and work of Nicolaus Copernicus, Charles Darwin, and the late Fred Hoyle, respectively, to reveal how the work of each scientist prompted questions with huge implications for humanity.


For obvious reasons Copernicus was cautious about how his great work, De revolutionibus orbium coelestium, On the Revolutions of the Heavenly Spheres, would be received by colleagues and Church officials accustomed to believing the Earth was at the center of the universe.

In this article by John Farrell, he discusses the idea of non-overlapping magisteria (NOMA) proposed by Stephen Jay Gould and its implications for the relationship between science and religion. Farrell notes that while Gould suggested that science and religion should not overlap and should each have their own separate domains, this idea has not been appealing to either side.
Owen Gingerich, a Professor of Astronomy and the History of Science, Emeritus at the Harvard-Smithsonian Center for Astrophysics, challenges the notion of non-overlapping magisteria. In his book "God's Planet," Gingerich explores three cases in the history of science where faith and science overlap. He argues that while science and religion may have different methods of approaching evidence, their goal of seeking a coherent understanding of the world can lead to overlapping and potentially competing worldviews.
Gingerich examines the lives and work of Nicolaus Copernicus, Charles Darwin, and Fred Hoyle, illustrating how their scientific contributions raised profound questions with implications for humanity. Copernicus, for example, faced challenges from colleagues and Church officials due to his revolutionary work on heliocentrism.
The article suggests that the idea of non-overlapping magisteria does not accurately capture the complex relationship between science and religion. While there may be areas of tension and disagreement, there are also instances where the two domains intersect and prompt significant questions about human existence and our place in the universe.

Driven by Compression Progress: A Simple Principle Explains Essential Aspects of Subjective Beauty, Novelty, Surprise, Interestingness, Attention, Curiosity, Creativity, Art, Science, Music, Jokes
Juergen Schmidhuber
Download PDF
I argue that data becomes temporarily interesting by itself to some self-improving, but computationally limited, subjective observer once he learns to predict or compress the data in a better way, thus making it subjectively simpler and more beautiful. Curiosity is the desire to create or discover more non-random, non-arbitrary, regular data that is novel and surprising not in the traditional sense of Boltzmann and Shannon but in the sense that it allows for compression progress because its regularity was not yet known. This drive maximizes interestingness, the first derivative of subjective beauty or compressibility, that is, the steepness of the learning curve. It motivates exploring infants, pure mathematicians, composers, artists, dancers, comedians, yourself, and (since 1990) artificial systems.

Indeed, the argument presented by Juergen Schmidhuber in the paper you mentioned aligns with the idea that science and religion can have overlapping and potentially competing worldviews. While science and religion may employ different methods and approaches to understanding the world, their shared goal of seeking a coherent understanding can lead to intersections and conflicts.
Schmidhuber's argument emphasizes the subjective nature of beauty, interestingness, and curiosity, which can influence the way individuals perceive and interpret the world. This subjective perspective can differ across scientific, religious, artistic, and other domains of human experience, leading to diverse viewpoints and potential clashes.
The concept of overlapping worldviews acknowledges that science and religion can both offer explanations and interpretations of reality, albeit through distinct frameworks. These overlapping areas can involve philosophical questions, ethical considerations, and the exploration of meaning and purpose. However, it's important to note that the extent and nature of the overlap may vary depending on specific religious beliefs, scientific disciplines, and individual perspectives.
Ultimately, recognizing and appreciating the potential for overlapping worldviews can foster dialogue and understanding between different intellectual and cultural traditions, promoting a more nuanced exploration of our complex reality.

What are some examples of holographic steganography in our everyday lives?
1 / 1
ChatGPT
ChatGPT
Holographic steganography is a technique that combines holography and steganography, which is the practice of concealing information within another form of data. While holographic steganography is not commonly encountered in our everyday lives, there are examples where holography and steganography are separately used:
Holographic Security Features: Holograms are often used as security features on credit cards, identification cards, and banknotes. These holograms can contain hidden information, such as microtext or covert images, which are difficult to replicate and enhance the security of the document or item.
Digital Watermarking: Digital watermarking is a form of steganography used to embed invisible information within digital media, such as images or videos. These watermarks can be used for copyright protection or to verify the authenticity of the media.
Hidden Messages in Images: Steganography techniques can be used to hide messages within digital images. By slightly modifying the pixel values or the least significant bits of the image, information can be concealed within the image without being perceptible to the human eye.
It is worth noting that the combination of holography and steganography, specifically holographic steganography, is a relatively niche and specialized field that is not widely applied in everyday life.

Ok I was thinking of the self regenerating properties of nematodes that can grow a whole new body from a portion, and of pluripotent cells in general.
1 / 1
ChatGPT
ChatGPT
I see what you mean. The self-regenerating properties of certain organisms, such as nematodes, and the concept of pluripotent cells in biology are fascinating examples of the inherent potential for regeneration and growth in living systems.
Nematodes, specifically the species known as planarians, have an impressive ability to regenerate their entire bodies from small fragments. When a planarian is cut into pieces, each fragment has the ability to regrow the missing parts and develop into a complete organism. This regenerative capability is attributed to the presence of pluripotent cells, which are undifferentiated cells that have the potential to differentiate into various cell types and contribute to the formation of new tissues and organs. Through complex cellular processes and signaling mechanisms, these pluripotent cells are activated and directed to differentiate into the specific cell types needed for regeneration.
Pluripotent cells are also found in other organisms, including humans, where they play a crucial role in early development. In humans, embryonic stem cells are an example of pluripotent cells that have the capacity to differentiate into all the specialized cell types in the body. These cells have the remarkable ability to give rise to various tissues and organs, offering potential applications in regenerative medicine and tissue engineering.
The study of nematodes and pluripotent cells provides valuable insights into the mechanisms underlying regeneration and growth in living organisms. By understanding the molecular and cellular processes involved, scientists hope to unlock the secrets of regeneration and potentially apply this knowledge to enhance tissue repair and regeneration in humans.
While holography and steganography relate to the encoding and hiding of information, the self-regeneration of nematodes and pluripotent cells pertain to the fascinating properties of living systems and the potential for regeneration and growth. These topics highlight the remarkable capabilities of organisms and the ongoing research aimed at understanding and harnessing these processes for various applications in biology and medicine.

I just mean that the bodyplan is holographically encrypted in the generic code
1 / 1
ChatGPT
ChatGPT
Ah, I see what you mean now. Yes, the concept of the body plan being holographically encrypted in the genetic code is an intriguing way to think about the complexity and information encoded within an organism's DNA.
The genetic code is the set of instructions stored within an organism's DNA that determines its development, growth, and overall body plan. It contains the information necessary for cells to differentiate into various specialized types and to arrange themselves in a specific pattern to form tissues and organs.
In a way, you can think of the genetic code as a form of encryption, where the information for building an organism is encoded in a specific sequence of nucleotides. Just like a hologram encodes a three-dimensional image on a two-dimensional surface, the genetic code encodes the three-dimensional structure and organization of an organism's body plan within the linear sequence of its DNA.
The genetic code operates through a complex network of interactions between genes, regulatory elements, and signaling pathways. Different regions of the DNA are responsible for controlling the expression of specific genes at specific times and in specific cell types, ensuring the proper development and organization of the organism.
Similar to how a hologram can be reconstructed from different parts of the encoded information, the body plan of an organism can be "decoded" from the information contained within the genetic code. This process involves the precise regulation of gene expression, the activation of specific developmental pathways, and the coordination of cell behavior and tissue interactions.
