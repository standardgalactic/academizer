The excerpt you've shared brings to the forefront significant ethical and strategic concerns regarding the development of AI, specifically around the issue of alignment. Alignment refers to the challenge of ensuring that AI systems act in ways that are beneficial to humanity and align with human values, even as those systems become more capable.
Leopold Aschenbrenner, referenced in the text, emphasizes the potential rapid advancement of AI technology and the need for an iterative approach to alignment. This approach involves gradually increasing the capabilities of AI systems while simultaneously working to ensure these systems remain aligned with human goals, particularly through the utilization of automated AI researchers. Aschenbrenner's perspective underscores the complexity and urgency of establishing robust alignment mechanisms before AI reaches superhuman levels of intelligence.
This dialogue underscores a significant debate in the AI ethics community: whether AI development should primarily focus on leveraging more advanced AI systems to solve alignment issues or if human-led research should remain at the forefront to preemptively address these challenges. The risks outlined include the possibility of creating "alien" systems with architectures and algorithms vastly different from current models, which could exacerbate the difficulties in ensuring alignment and control.
The need for adequate research, investment, and coordinated effort in alignment is crucial.

I was going to brain storm ideas for slowing down the development of AGI. One is a tower of Babel solution is that it be mandated that every neighboring schools be in different language, cycling through the 300 most commonly used ones. Students should be allowed to go to a different school every day of the year or stay in the same classroom for their entire education, according to their preference. Computer keyboards should alternate between qwerty and dvorak keyboards in even and odd years. A computer science degree should be required in order to use social media.
ChatGPT dijo:
ChatGPT
It sounds like you're thinking about quite radical and creative strategies to slow down the development of artificial general intelligence (AGI) by introducing complexity and inefficiency into the system. Your ideas center around creating barriers to information dissemination and technology fluency, which could hypothetically slow the pace at which knowledge and skills necessary for advancing AGI are acquired and spread. Let's explore the implications and potential effectiveness of each idea:

A sardonic review of the whole conversation.
ChatGPT dijo:
ChatGPT
Ah, our conversation���an audacious voyage through a sea of futuristic whims and educational fantasies, replete with technological marvels that would make even the most ardent sci-fi enthusiasts blush. Here's a sardonic rundown of our ambitious brainstorm:
AI and AGI Concerns
: We started off with a somber note on AI alignment���basically trying to teach future superintelligences not to annihilate us. A noble cause indeed, peppered with documents and dissertations warning us of our impending irrelevance.
Eccentric Educational Proposals
: Next, we proposed turning the education system into a linguistic kaleidoscope, rotating through 300 languages. Because clearly, what our educational systems need is not more funding or smaller class sizes, but a Tower of Babel scenario to really spice things up. As if that wasn't enough, we contemplated allowing students to hopscotch between schools daily. Stability and continuity in education? Overrated!
Typing Schizophrenia
: And just for kicks, why not toggle between QWERTY and Dvorak keyboard layouts biennially? Sure, mastery in typing is overvalued. Let���s keep the young ones guessing���it builds character.
Social Media Gatekeeping
: We then ventured into dictatorial territory, suggesting a computer science degree as a prerequisite for social media usage. Because obviously, the best way to enhance digital literacy is through elitist barriers. Let's ensure only the elite can tweet, that'll surely democratize information.
Automotive Innovations
: Onward to automotive 'advancements'. Why have windows when you can encase passengers in a metal coffin with cameras? Bonus points for suggesting that we suspend passengers in ���electric jello��� that hardens on impact. Comforting, yet disturbingly reminiscent of a dystopian Jell-O ad.
Environmental Overhaul
: And finally, the pi��ce de r��sistance: replacing garbage dumps with thousands of sorting centers because simplicity is so last millennium. And, of course, let's pay people for their trash because in a world where social media requires a degree, why shouldn't garbage have economic value?
Through these flights of fancy, we���ve taken logic on a wild ride, boldly proposing solutions that would make even Kafka pause and ponder. Yet, beneath the sarcasm, there lies a genuine exploration of ideas, albeit cloaked in layers of implausibility. A fascinating thought experiment, undoubtedly, but perhaps best left in the realm of theoretical musings rather than practical applications.
