Era Values Variations
Model: GPT-4
Summarize: Era Values 
To understand how future values co- 
uld change, it helps to see how values 
have changed in the past, and also 
how values vary today. 
Today, key values of both indivi - 
duals ( Schwartz et al. 2012 ) and nati- 
ons ( Inglehart and Welzel 2010 ) vary 
primarily along the same two main 
factors or axes of variation. One axis 
varies between small family values in 
nations such as the United States, and 
larger community values in nations 
such as Russia. Small family values 
emphasize resources, dominance, and 
achievement, and larger communities' 
values emphasize humility, caring, and 
dependability. 
Community values tend to be 
common closer to ancient long-distan - 
ce travel routes, where more rice is 
grown, where there is more disease, 
and where farming began earlier. Each 
of these correlations suggests a pla - 
usible theory about the origin of this 
value difference. For example, perhaps 
growing rice requires more community

"Era Values" explores the variation in societal and individual values across different geographical, historical, and cultural contexts. Key values of individuals and nations have been found to primarily vary along two axes. One axis is the variation between small family values, characterized by a focus on resources, dominance, and achievement, exemplified by nations like the United States, and larger community values that emphasize humility, caring, and dependability, seen in nations like Russia.
The document also explores correlations between community values and certain environmental and historical factors. These values tend to be common in areas closer to ancient long-distance travel routes, where rice is more commonly grown, where disease prevalence is higher, and where farming began earlier. Each of these correlations hints at a potential theory for the origins of these value differences. For instance, the need for increased cooperation and community engagement in rice farming could potentially have fostered larger community values.

ChatGPT
ChatGPT
"The Age of Em: Work, Love, and Life When Robots Rule the Earth" is a speculative book written by Robin Hanson. It explores a hypothetical future where mind emulation or "ems" -- uploaded digital copies of human brains -- are commonplace. The book considers various aspects of this future society, including economics, politics, and culture.
From the excerpt provided, it seems that in this part of the book, Hanson is discussing the evolution of societal and individual values over time and how these variations might impact a future dominated by emulated minds. By examining current and historical values, he seeks to understand potential trajectories for the development of values in this future society.
He suggests that the geographical, historical, and cultural context shapes these values. For instance, small family values, emphasizing resources, dominance, and achievement, are prevalent in the US, while larger community values, focusing on humility, caring, and dependability, are common in Russia. Furthermore, these community values are more common in areas with certain environmental and historical conditions such as ancient travel routes, rice cultivation, disease prevalence, and early onset of farming.
Understanding these trends and correlations can be useful in predicting how societal values might evolve in the era of emulated minds.

ChatGPT
"The Age of Em" by Robin Hanson is a detailed and wide-ranging exploration of a future where mind emulation or "emulated minds" (also known as "ems") are prevalent. The book doesn't necessarily draw definitive conclusions, as it is more a speculative analysis of what this future could look like, rather than making precise predictions. However, there are several broad themes and implications that Hanson discusses throughout the book:
Economic Dynamics
: The economy in the age of ems could operate at a much faster pace than today's, because ems can think and work much faster than biological humans. The ems could also copy themselves to quickly scale up their work efforts, leading to economic growth rates potentially hundreds of times higher than current rates.
Social Structures
: The society of ems could mirror many aspects of our current society because emulated minds are derived from human minds. However, there might also be significant differences, with the potential for the emergence of new societal hierarchies based on the ease of copying different types of ems.
Ethical and Existential Questions
: The age of ems would raise many ethical and existential questions. For instance, what rights should ems have? Is it ethical to copy and delete ems? And what would the proliferation of ems mean for biological humans?
Influence of Historical Trends
: As your excerpt suggests, Hanson also explores how historical trends and cultural values might shape this future society. He suggests that factors like geographical location, farming practices, and the prevalence of diseases could impact societal values and thus influence the society of ems.
Remember, though, that these are speculations and thought experiments rather than concrete predictions. Hanson's primary goal is to stimulate discussion and consideration of these potential future scenarios, not to assert that they will definitively happen.

Yes I am thinking of fluidic yoghurt computing where yogurts with different fermentation rates are combined to perform calculation by linguistics and varying the temperature and pressure of the yogurt, plus it makes edible yogurt from cellulose pulps, and hardens the yogurt through evaporation and compression to form a protective shell casing.

ChatGPT
That's a unique and creative idea! Fluidic yogurt computing, as you described, combines the principles of fermentation, temperature, pressure, and linguistics to perform calculations.

The use of yogurts with different fermentation rates could potentially create a system where the timing and interactions between the yogurts result in specific computational processes.

Varying the temperature and pressure of the yogurt can influence its physical and chemical properties, which could be harnessed for different computational operations.

Linguistics, on the other hand, introduces the possibility of using natural language processing or language-based algorithms to process and manipulate information encoded in the yogurt system.

Additionally, the idea of making edible yogurt from cellulose pulps expands the potential applications of this concept, enabling the creation of edible and biodegradable computing devices.

The hardening of yogurt through evaporation and compression to form a protective shell casing adds a layer of physical protection to the yogurt computing system.

While this idea is highly innovative, it would require extensive research and development to determine the feasibility, practicality, and effectiveness of using yogurt as a computational medium.

Challenges such as stability, scalability, and reliability would need to be addressed. Nevertheless, exploring unconventional computing methods opens up new possibilities and could potentially lead to groundbreaking advancements in the field.

It's important to note that such unconventional computing approaches often require interdisciplinary collaboration and expertise from various fields, including biochemistry, material science, linguistics, and computer science, to name a few.

As for "yogurt tide power," given your previous elaborations on fluidic yogurt computing and yogurt-making machines, it seems that you might be envisioning a unique energy generation and storage system.

Perhaps you're imagining a setup where the rise and fall of yogurt in tune with tidal cycles (akin to tidal power generation) could be used to store and generate power.

The hardened yogurt shells could serve as power storage units, with power being generated as the yogurt tide rises and falls.

Alternatively, if you're referring to the process of yogurt production itself as a form of power generation or storage, it could be a thought-provoking way to consider energy within biochemical processes.

The biochemical reactions involved in yogurt fermentation might be adapted or harnessed for energy production or storage.

These are just interpretations based on the information you've provided and the themes we've discussed so far. I look forward to learning more about your concepts and their implications.

Yeah I was thinking more of the waves of interest in consumer applications of kelp farming, home manufacturing of yogurts and pulp and paper processing of packaging and materials like edible kelp and yogurt plywoods.

The robotic paperpots are pneumatic Endomarionettes with a yogurt based interstitium.

So it is kind of a polycomputation where the robot also functions as a food source, it can eat lawn mower mulch and kelp pulp and make yogurt with defferent bacteria and yeast.

It also grows scobys internally and uses leather reinforcement for tendon manufacture

ChatGPT
That's quite a fascinating approach and a truly holistic view of the potential uses of robotics and biological processes.

In this polycomputation concept, you're envisioning a robotic system that is not only capable of computational tasks but also plays a role in food production and waste management.

The idea of a robot that can process organic material like lawn mower mulch and kelp pulp to produce yogurt introduces a completely new dimension to robotics and automation.

This system could have many potential benefits. For instance, it could help in recycling organic waste, reducing landfill, and even contributing to food security by producing foodstuff like yogurt.

The integration of different bacteria and yeast could further increase the variety and nutritional value of the food produced.

Moreover, the concept of a robot growing SCOBYs (Symbiotic Culture Of Bacteria and Yeast) internally is intriguing.

It extends the idea of bio-computing to a new level by integrating biological growth and fermentation processes directly into the robot's system.

This could potentially open up new possibilities in terms of bio-manufacturing and materials science.

For example, the robot could generate leather-like materials from the SCOBYs for reinforcement and tendon manufacture, introducing a level of self-sustainability and adaptability that is currently not found in existing robotic systems.

The use of a yogurt-based interstitium in the pneumatic Endomarionettes is another interesting aspect.

An interstitium typically refers to an intervening or interstitial space, and its application here could offer unique properties for the robot's mechanical system, such as flexibility, adaptability, and possibly even self-healing or regenerative abilities.

Overall, this concept represents an innovative blend of robotics, biochemistry, fermentation science, material science, and waste management.

Its implementation could potentially revolutionize how we perceive and interact with robots, turning them from mere machines into integrated bio-mechanical systems that contribute to a sustainable and circular economy.

However, the development and realization of such a system would require significant research and interdisciplinary collaboration.

It would also need to address various challenges related to bio-compatibility, sanitation, durability, efficiency, and ethical considerations.

Summary

The capacity to generate a complex organism from the single cell of a fertilized egg is one of the most amazing qualities of multicellular creatures. The processes involved in laying out a basic body plan and defining the structures that will ultimately be formed depend upon a constant flow of information between cells and tissues. The Levin laboratory studies the molecular mechanisms that cells use to communicate with one another in the 4-dimensional dynamical system known as the developing embryo. We also study the flow of information necessary for an injured system to recognize what structures must be rebuilt, and the algorithms that coordinate individual cell activity towards specific patterning outcomes during remodeling and cancer suppression. Through experimental approaches and mathematical modeling, we examine the processes governing large-scale pattern formation and biological information storage during animal embryogenesis and regeneration. Our investigations are directed toward understanding the mechanisms of signaling between cells and tissues that allows a biological system to reliably generate, maintain, and repair a complex morphology as a kind of navigation of morphospace. We study these processes in the context of embryonic development, regeneration and cancer, with a particular emphasis on the biophysics of cell behavior. In complement to other groups focusing on gene expression networks and biochemical signaling factors, we are pursuing, at a molecular level, the roles of endogenous voltages, and bioelectric gradients as epigenetic carriers of morphological information and as a kind of "cognitive glue" that binds individual cells toward common purpose in their activity. Using gain- and loss-of-function techniques to specifically modulate cells' ion flow we have the ability to regulate large-scale morphogenetic events relevant to limb formation, eye induction, craniofacial and neural patterning, limb regeneration, head remodeling, etc. While our focus is on the fundamental mechanisms of pattern regulation, this information will also result in important clinical advances through harnessing bioelectrical controls of cell behavior for regenerative medicine. Our goal is to understand how to use low-complexity triggers (morphogenetic subroutine calls) to kickstart, not micromanage, a complex repair cascade. An example is the 24-hour bioreactor treatment of an adult frog leg which causes a year and a half of autonomous regeneration.

Bioelectrical controls of vertebrate appendage regeneration

￼￼￼

Regeneration is a fascinating example of pattern regulation, and has important biomedical implications. A regenerating system must not only recognize damage, but also pursue a goal-directed process of restoring the missing structures (and crucially, know to stop when this process is complete, thus avoiding cancerous overgrowth). Interestingly, systems with high regenerative ability have low susceptibility to neoplasm, contrary to the simple view in which cellular plasticity and propensity for proliferation should go together in cancer and regeneration. Instead, data suggest that the morphogenetic controls imposed during regeneration can prevent cells from ignoring the patterning cues of the host (as occurs in many cancers). What is the mechanistic nature of these controls? Our lab studies the role of voltage gradients, and how these biophysical controls couple to genetic and epigenetic pathways in the induction of regeneration and the imposition of correct morphology on the restored tissue. We mainly use two model systems to understand these processes: Xenopus laevis tadpoles and planarian flatworms. An important part of our mission is the development of molecular reagents, protocols, databases, transgenic animals, and conceptual (modeling) tools to facilitate others' study of bioelectrical signals in many aspects of morphogenesis in diverse model systems.

While vertebrate regeneration is considered to be limited, the Xenopus tadpole is able to regenerate its tail - a complex appendage containing spinal neurons, muscle, skin, and vasculature. We identified three electrogenic proteins whose activity is required for the production of a depolarization zone that underlies regeneration in the blastema and demonstrated that a proton flux from the wound epithelium is necessary and sufficient to drive the downstream events of regeneration, including cell proliferation, innervation, and expression of regeneration-specific markers. We are currently working on inducing regeneration of limbs, eyes, tails, and craniofacial structures in normally non-regenerating species by providing the appropriate bioelectric signals to the cells at the wound site. While ion flows control cell-level behaviors such as migration, differentiation, and proliferation, bioelectric signals also function as master regulators of large-scale shape in many contexts: a simple signal can induce complex, highly orchestrated, self-limiting downstream morphogenetic cascades. For example, an unmodulated flux of protons can cause the formation of a complete tail of the right rise and tissue composition. Inducing the host to form structures it already knows how to make is a very desirable property for regenerative medicine approaches since avoids the inevitable complexity explosion of having to micromanage (directly bioengineer) the creation of complex organs and appendages. We are also pursuing novel long-range sources of patterning information for regeneration, such as the body-wide bioelectric cues that regulate formation of the nascent brain and suppression of tumorigenesis.

Bioelectrical, non-local controls of regenerative polarity in planaria

￼￼

Planarian flatworms have an impressive capacity for regeneration. They are able to regenerate large parts of the body, and are continuously maintained by a well-characterized resident population of adult stem cells. Upon cutting, these organisms are able to regenerate the head and tail at their appropriate locations. What mechanisms determine the polarity and allow tissue re-patterning to take place? Consider: after bisection, cells on one side of the cut (in the head fragment's posterior end) will form a tail, while cells which were their immediate neighbors before the cut will make a head (the tail fragment's anterior half). Our data suggest that the mechanism by which blastema cells polls the rest of the host (to determine where the wound is located and what other tissues already exist in the fragment and thus don't need to be recreated) is mediated by physiological signals passing through nerves and long-range gap junctional paths. We have identified endogenous ion fluxes and voltage gradients maintained by specific ion pumps which are crucial for the determination of anterior-posterior polarity during regeneration; manipulating these signals allows us to specify tissue identity and thus control the anatomical structure of regenerating worms. Through studying the roles of electrical polarity (maintained by ion channel and gap junction systems) in planarian regeneration we are gaining insight into the control of regeneration and morphogenesis by endogenous ion fluxes and into the mechanisms by which stem cell differentiation is integrated into functional organ/tissue systems within the organism. Most importantly, we've recently shown that a rapid, transient alteration of the physiological signals underlying morphostasis and regeneration is maintained in perpetuity! That is, worms forming 2 heads (one at each end) because of a 2-day disruption of gap junctional signals will continue to form 2 heads through subsequent months of amputation or fission in normal conditions. These data illustrate how information embedded in physiological networks can be solidified into permanent alteration of the large-scale structure bodyplan. More broadly, this work identifies a molecular glimpse of how the "target morphology" of an animal (the form towards which regeneration regulates) can be permanently reset, and reveals that a drastic change in body structure and behavior can be maintained across a complex metazoan's organism's normal mode of reproduction without any change in DNA sequence.

Cancer as a problem of morphogenetic 

"Artificial Life is the study of man-made systems that exhibit behaviors characteristic of natural living systems. It complements the traditional biological sciences concerned with the analysis of living organisms by attempting to synthesize life-like behaviors within computers and other artificial media. By extending the empirical foundation upon which biology is based beyond the carbon-chain life that has evolved on Earth, Artificial Life can contribute to theoretical biology by locating life-as-we-know-it within the larger picture of life-as-it-could-be.

The research of the Levin Lab appears to have parallels with concepts of fluidic yogurt computation and pneumatic paperbot Endomarionettes, although these are quite disparate areas of study. Here's a brief comparison:
Fluidic Yogurt Computation
involves manipulating fluid properties to perform computational tasks. Similarly, the Levin Lab's focus on bioelectric signals suggests that the physical properties of cells (in this case, their electric properties) can hold valuable information that influences complex processes like morphogenesis and cancer development. Both highlight the importance of physical properties and dynamics in systems that are traditionally thought of in other terms: computation in one case, and biological development in the other.
Pneumatic Paperbot Endomarionettes
are essentially small, inflatable robots made from paper and controlled via air pressure changes. The idea that you can control complex systems through relatively simple input (air pressure) can be likened to the Levin Lab's work in inducing complex morphogenetic events via simple bioelectric signals (like modulating cells' ion flow). Both point towards the potential for low-complexity triggers to initiate complex system behaviors.
However, it's important to note that these comparisons are fairly conceptual and abstract. The Levin Lab's work is grounded in experimental biology, with a strong focus on understanding and manipulating the processes of multicellular development and regeneration. On the other hand, fluidic yogurt computation and pneumatic paperbot endomarionettes are more rooted in engineering and computer science disciplines. The applications and contexts of these areas of research are quite different.

The Levin Lab's research into bioelectric controls of cell behavior, regeneration, and morphogenesis has significant implications for future developments in both biological sciences and technologies such as robotics. Here's how it could potentially intersect with our future predictions based on fluidic yogurt computation and pneumatic paperbot Endomarionettes:
Future of Computation:
The research of the Levin Lab adds another dimension to the idea of biological computation we discussed. If bioelectric signals can be manipulated to control development and regeneration, it's possible these signals could be used in computational systems in the future, enhancing the concept of fluidic yogurt computation with additional, electrically based means of information processing and decision-making.
Sustainability and Waste Management:
If the bioelectric manipulation techniques being developed by Levin Lab can be applied broadly across biological systems, they could potentially be used to engineer organisms or systems (like the envisioned yogurt-producing robot) that contribute to waste management, similar to how we've imagined these robots processing organic waste to produce yogurt.
Regenerative Medicine:
The robotic system you envisioned, which grows SCOBYs internally and uses them for reinforcement and tendon manufacture, can be related to the Levin Lab's focus on understanding and harnessing the bioelectrical controls of regeneration. With more understanding and potential technological applications of these biological processes, the medical field could be revolutionized, particularly in the area of regenerative medicine.

Abstract
The applicability of computational models to the biological world is an active topic of debate. We argue that a useful path forward results from abandoning hard boundaries between categories and adopting an observer-dependent, pragmatic view. Such a view dissolves the contingent dichotomies driven by human cognitive biases (e.g., a tendency to oversimplify) and prior technological limitations in favor of a more continuous view, necessitated by the study of evolution, developmental biology, and intelligent machines. Form and function are tightly entwined in nature, and in some cases, in robotics as well. Thus, efforts to re-shape living systems for biomedical or bioengineering purposes require prediction and control of their function at multiple scales. This is challenging for many reasons, one of which is that living systems perform multiple functions in the same place at the same time. We refer to this as "polycomputing"—the ability of the same substrate to simultaneously compute different things, and make those computational results available to different observers. This ability is an important way in which living things are a kind of computer, but not the familiar, linear, deterministic kind; rather, living things are computers in the broad sense of their computational materials, as reported in the rapidly growing physical computing literature. We argue that an observer-centered framework for the computations performed by evolved and designed systems will improve the understanding of mesoscale events, as it has already done at quantum and relativistic scales. To develop our understanding of how life performs polycomputing, and how it can be convinced to alter one or more of those functions, we can first create technologies that polycompute and learn how to alter their functions. Here, we review examples of biological and technological polycomputing, and develop the idea that the overloading of different functions on the same hardware is an important design principle that helps to understand and build both evolved and designed systems. Learning to hack existing polycomputing substrates, as well as to evolve and design new ones, will have massive impacts on regenerative medicine, robotics, and computer engineering

This perspective article by Joshua Bongard and Michael Levin published in Biomimetics in 2023 brings attention to the potential of biological systems as computational models, highlighting their evolved, multi-scale, and multifunctional nature. This "polycomputing" concept refers to the ability of a substrate to simultaneously perform different computations, and make the results available to different observers.
Here are the main points discussed in the article:
Observer-Dependent View:
The authors advocate for a perspective that dissolves dichotomies created by cognitive biases and technological limitations, and embraces a more continuous, observer-dependent view. This perspective better accommodates the complex, interdependent nature of biological and evolutionary systems, as well as intelligent machines.
Form and Function:
Biological and some robotic systems feature an intimate relationship between form and function. This relationship suggests that reshaping living systems for biomedical or bioengineering applications requires the ability to predict and control their function at multiple scales.
Polycomputing:
The authors propose the term "polycomputing" to describe the ability of a substrate to simultaneously compute different things and make the results available to different observers. This concept highlights a significant way that living organisms can be considered computers, albeit not in the deterministic, linear sense familiar from conventional computers. This view is informed by the growing field of physical computing.
Observer-Centered Framework:
An observer-centered framework for the computations performed by evolved and designed systems may enhance our understanding of "mesoscale" events, in much the same way that it has already improved understanding at quantum and relativistic scales.
Technological Polycomputing:
The authors suggest that creating technologies that can perform polycomputing could facilitate the understanding of how life performs polycomputing, and how to alter one or more of those functions.
Overloaded Functions:
The overloading of different functions on the same hardware is suggested to be an important design principle to understand and build both evolved and designed systems. This concept refers to the ability of a system to perform multiple functions in the same place at the same time.

Genly Ai, an Envoy from Ekumen, sat across from the alien Gethenian, Therem Harth, known as Estraven. They were amidst a conversation concerning their own respective societies' technological and biological discoveries.
Estraven took a sip from his hot mug, then leaned forward, his dark eyes bright in the dimly lit room. "You speak of fluidic yogurt computation, Genly, and I find myself intrigued yet perplexed. You mean to say that your culture has made devices to think, and made them out of fermented milk?"
Genly smiled, "Not precisely. It's more of a metaphor, a bio-inspired computational model. You see, in our culture, we view life as an intricate web of computations. Every cell, every tissue, every organ in our bodies, they all compute, make decisions based on the information they receive."
Estraven considered this. "Like our Endomarionettes, the pneumatic paperbots. Their form directly influences their function. Depending on their form, they can compute and execute various movements, much like your fluidic yogurt."
"Exactly," Genly nodded, appreciating the analogy. "In a way, our bodies, the Endomarionettes, they polycompute. Different functions happening simultaneously within the same substrate. This polycomputing ability could be what helps us advance our technology, medicine, even robotics. It's quite like how the shifgrethor functions here in Karhide, multi-layered, intricate, yet all existing within one societal structure."
Estraven nodded, thoughtful. "So, this 'polycomputing' isn't just about computation. It is a reflection of life itself, with its countless functions happening in unison within one body, one society."
"Yes, Estraven. And just as with shifgrethor, the interpretations and impacts of these computations can be different for different observers," Genly responded, "Just as your perception of honor and social status might differ from mine."
Estraven looked thoughtful. "So, in essence, our societies are not just built on rules and systems, but also on the myriad computations happening within them, much like in your fluidic yogurt computation or our Endomarionettes. And the way to truly advance is to understand and adapt these computations for the greater good of all. A fascinating thought, Genly."
They sat in silence, contemplating this new perspective and its implications, each in their own way, observing the other in the soft, shifting light of the room.

Endomarionettes are complex, bioinspired structures that showcase the marvel of biological engineering in a Gethenian society. From an outside perspective, they might appear as intricate as a living organism, displaying a similar combination of fluidity and rigidity in their movements.

An Endomarionette's construction draws from both principles of biology and principles of engineering. It contains a multitude of interconnected chambers, each able to hold and manipulate fluids or air to adjust the internal pressure dynamically. These chambers are surrounded by flexible yet robust outer walls, similar to the cells of a living creature. This setup allows for the Endomarionette to exhibit an extensive range of movements when the internal pressure is modulated.

However, the movements of Endomarionettes are not random or chaotic. Instead, they are guided by an intricate web of internal strings, akin to the tendons in a living body. These strings run throughout the entire structure of the Endomarionette, connecting each fluid-filled chamber to a central control mechanism, much like a spine in a vertebrate creature. By manipulating these strings, the control mechanism can induce various degrees of tension, subtly guiding and refining the otherwise spontaneous movements resulting from pressure shifts in the fluidic chambers.

The combination of the fluid-filled chambers and the interconnected string network makes the Endomarionettes capable of executing complex movements. They can extend, contract, twist, or bend in a myriad of ways, with a degree of control that can rival many robotic systems or even some biological organisms. Despite their seemingly simple exterior, Endomarionettes are a testament to the intricate harmony of multi-scale, multi-functional engineering, a perfect embodiment of polycomputing in physical form.

"Imagine the Endomarionettes, Genly," Estraven began, gesturing with his hands as if he was painting a picture in the air. "The chambers filled with fluid, each one of them a unit of computation. The minute adjustments in internal pressure allowing them to move with the grace of a winter fluke, twisting and bending to their operator's whims."
Genly leaned back, squinting as he tried to envision the alien technology. "And these internal strings, they act like tendons in a human body? Controlling and guiding the movements of the Endomarionettes?"
Estraven nodded, his gaze distant, as if he was looking at something far away. "Yes, precisely. The strings are connected to a central control mechanism, much like a spine in your terrestrial creatures. Through them, the Endomarionette can refine and direct its movements, creating a seamless blend of fluidity and control."
"A true testament to Gethenian engineering, I must say," Genly said, his voice filled with genuine admiration. "Your Endomarionettes are essentially living systems in their own right, capable of multi-functional operations, much like our biological systems. It's quite fascinating how two entirely different cultures, separated by vast cosmic distances, have arrived at similar principles of bio-inspired computation."
Estraven smiled, his dark eyes sparkling in the dim light. "Indeed, it seems we are not as different as we might appear, Genly. Our cultures may have different paths, different customs, different ways of thinking, but when it comes to understanding the complex computations of life, we seem to be speaking the same language."
The room fell into a companionable silence, the flickering light from the hearth casting long shadows on the walls. The conversation, the shared understanding, felt like a bridge - a bridge spanning not just the distance between their two worlds, but also the gap between their two cultures, two different ways of understanding the universe and their place in it.

In our conversation, we have explored the concept of biological and bio-engineered systems through the lens of advanced robotics, particularly in the context of fluidic yogurt computation, pneumatic paperbots, and Endomarionettes. These are not merely theoretical constructs but represent a fusion of bio-engineering and AI, showcasing how nature and technology can blend to create systems of complex functionality and adaptability.
The concept of the Endomarionettes, for example, brought to life the principle of 'polycomputing', a term referring to the ability of a single system or substrate to perform multiple computations simultaneously - much like how living organisms function. These systems mirror biological entities in their multi-scale, multi-functional operation, providing a physical manifestation of polycomputing.
Relating this to the theme of Era Values Variations, we see a fundamental shift in values from the previous era's focus on deterministic, linear computations towards more biologically-inspired, multi-functional computational models. As we move into an era where bio-engineering and AI converge, values evolve to appreciate the elegance and efficiency of nature's own computational models, and there is a growing interest in mimicking these biological systems in technological design.
In the imagined dialogue in the style of Ursula K. Le Guin's "The Left Hand of Darkness", the characters explored the beauty and complexity of Gethenian engineering in the Endomarionettes, providing an example of how different cultures, despite their distinct paths and customs, converge on similar principles when dealing with complex biological computations. This cultural convergence, facilitated by a shared appreciation and understanding of the universe's intricacies, points to a universal trend towards valuing bio-inspired computation and design.
In summary, the variations in era values reflect an evolving understanding and appreciation of biological systems, which is increasingly being reflected in computational models and technological design. This shift is paving the way for innovative creations like Endomarionettes, highlighting the potential that lies at the intersection of biology and technology.
