I'm trying to say "out of the library of the immortal chthulu" in Latin. Ex Libris Chthulus Immortalis
Your translation, "Ex Libris Chthulus Immortalis," is close to the correct translation, but it is not quite accurate. Here are a few different ways you could translate "out of the library of the immortal Cthulhu" into Latin:
E bibliotheca Cthulhi immortalis - This translates to "out of the library of immortal Cthulhu." It's a straightforward and accurate translation that uses the ablative case to indicate "out of."
Ex bibliotheca Cthulhi immortalis - This is similar to your original translation, but with the correct word order. "Ex" also means "out of," but it requires the ablative case to follow, hence "bibliotheca Cthulhi immortalis."
E libris Cthulhi immortalis - This translates to "out of the books of immortal Cthulhu." If you want to emphasize that the books are what you're referring to specifically, this is a good option.
All of these translations are valid, so choose the one that best fits the context you're using it in.
Yeah I think Ex Libris Chthuli Immortalis is fine. It was common to put ex libris ______ in the front of old books with a kind of art nouveau illustration.
I understand what you mean. "Ex Libris" is indeed a common phrase used in old books to indicate ownership or origin. Therefore, if you're using the phrase "Ex Libris Chthuli Immortalis" in the context of an old book or a similar artistic piece, it would be a fitting translation to convey that the book belongs to the immortal Cthulhu's library.
