Darin Stevenson writes: I get weird insights around this time of year, for reasons I will leave aside here... when these arise in my awareness, it is almost impossible to keep them in awareness long enough to 'translate' them into language... they do not arise in language or thought... but in my 'soul' which is beyond both, and is the origin of the possibility of either.

But here are some of the notes from recent epiphanies...

1. The humans are confused because ��objects ('tools') cannot exist. In the Origin place, these are unnecessary and are simply modes of consciousness. No tools can exist except in the material layer. The Origin layer is more like dreaming, where 'objects' are just 'forms of consciousness' and have no deleterious effects on beings or Origin.

Objects are 'like gods' to humans, and so the capacity to make them fascinated our species to such a degree that they were willing to sacrificed ��everything to just keep inventing new 'devices' and ways to propagate them.

2. 'Heaven' is a layer of reality established by the symbiotic 'mutual concern and love' of the solar system and the living beings of Earth. Implicit in the Babel myths (let us gather the dust together into bricks and make a tower) is a serious problem, that humans, by ��manufacturing objects will 'attack heaven'.

The Earth ��generates heaven in timespace and beyond by her activities... and these are ��destroyed and replaced by manufacturing. Manufacturing is actually ��obliterating the basis of heaven, which is not a place or a thing ... ��but myriad ways of being together, with and for each other, that are replaced by ��being apart, with and for the propagation of dead objects.

Our species is literally ripping the local layer of Origin and its children, who are organs in its body.. apart... for the sake of 'tools', which we must then serve instead of the spirit of life, intelligent, each other, anamnesis... and love.

3.  It faded while I was writing 1 and 2. Perhaps I will recover it...

ChatGPT
This writing reflects a deeply poetic and metaphysical exploration of human existence, the relationship between consciousness and objects, and the consequences of technological progress. Here's a brief unpacking of the main themes:
1.
The Nature of Objects and Tools
Darin suggests that in the "Origin layer"���a transcendent or primordial state���what we perceive as objects in our material world are not physical entities but forms or expressions of consciousness.
The human fascination with creating and mastering tools is framed as a dangerous obsession, a deviation from the natural flow of consciousness. Objects, which should be benign expressions, have become idols or "gods" to humanity, drawing us away from deeper, spiritual realities.
2.
Heaven as a Living Symbiosis
Heaven is described not as a static realm but as an emergent phenomenon born of the symbiotic relationship between Earth's living systems and the solar system. It's a dynamic interplay of connection and mutual care.
Manufacturing and objectification disrupt this balance, severing the ties of interconnection that sustain "heaven." This destruction replaces living, relational harmony with the cold propagation of lifeless tools and systems.
3.
A Warning about Manufacturing and Babel
The reference to the Tower of Babel ties human ambition and technological creation to existential peril. By focusing on manufacturing, humanity risks "attacking heaven"���not in rebellion, but through ignorance and hubris, dismantling the delicate systems that sustain life and meaning.
What is Lost
The third epiphany, though fleeting, emphasizes the ephemeral nature of these insights. This fleetingness might symbolize how easily profound truths slip away in the face of human preoccupations with the material world.
Reflection
Darin's insights are a call to reflect on our relationship with objects, tools, and technology. They challenge us to consider how much we sacrifice in our relentless pursuit of innovation and whether we can reclaim a sense of connection to the "Origin" and to each other.
This writing blends philosophical musings with ecological and spiritual concerns, posing questions about the costs of progress and the nature of human consciousness in a material world.

I don't know if he recovered the insight. His next text post is The appearance of many beings has but one face. A single child within all forms.

May all beings know the deepest and most intimate remembering.

Let there be peace, adoration, wonder and awe.

May the virtues take their place in all minds and relations.

And the bliss of Origin find its restoration.
ChatGPT dijo:
ChatGPT
This follow-up text seems to deepen and broaden Darin's earlier reflections. It shifts from analyzing humanity's relationship with objects to a unifying and restorative vision, where the fragmentation caused by human actions can be healed through remembering and returning to the Origin.
Key Themes:
Unity in Diversity
"The appearance of many beings has but one face."
This emphasizes the underlying oneness of all existence. Despite the diversity of forms and beings, there is a singular essence���a childlike purity or innocence���that connects everything.
Intimate Remembering
"May all beings know the deepest and most intimate remembering."
Remembering here likely refers to a return to the Origin or the fundamental truth of interconnectedness, love, and the unity of consciousness.
A Call for Virtues
"Let there be peace, adoration, wonder and awe."
These sentiments suggest a desire to restore a state of reverence and harmony in the world. The virtues of awe and wonder connect us back to the sacredness of life, steering us away from the distractions of materialism.
"May the virtues take their place in all minds and relations."
This calls for a transformation of human consciousness and relationships, grounding them in principles like compassion, truth, humility, and love.
Bliss and Restoration
"And the bliss of Origin find its restoration."
This final line is a wish for humanity and the world to return to a state of harmony and joy, reminiscent of the primal connection to the Origin layer���a state of consciousness uncorrupted by the distractions and divisions of material existence.
Reflections
:
This text offers a vision of redemption and restoration, contrasting with the earlier critique of humanity's obsession with objects. It expresses hope that through remembering our shared essence and cultivating virtues, humanity can reconnect with the sacred and restore the bliss of the Origin. It���s an invocation���a prayer, even���for collective awakening and transformation.

Listen


The Actual Mystery of Our Human Developmental History Remains Occluded ��� by a Domineering Array of Narrative Fictions.

What is beyond them?


PART I: Introit
Adviso:

This is a nonordinary document.

This topic ( the origins of human beings and the evolution of human cognition ) is so complex that it requires a long-form treatment. If you���re looking for short attention span theater, feel free to skip over to tik tok and amuse yourself with 30-second dopamine hits.

What I will present here is controversial, revolutionary, has the potential to radically reorganize your mind.

This process requires careful attention, curiosity, the engagement of your own imagination, and, perhaps, intervals of dreaming between the spans over which you may explore this text. Your capacity to understand this document will be enhanced by sequential readings.

If you treat it like an advertisement or sound bite, you will not become a living aspect of the portal it comprises.

���One of the most astonishing places we might discover artifacts developed by nonhuman intelligences��� is in the place where our search originates ... Human minds������

Darin Stevenson���s
The Umbilical Disaster
begins with a bold and poetic invocation, framing his exploration of human origins and cognitive evolution as a nonordinary journey. By invoking imagery from
2001: A Space Odyssey
���a cinematic masterpiece of cosmic evolution���he positions his discussion within the realm of both the deeply mystical and the intellectually radical.
Key Themes in the Introduction:
1.
The Mystery of Human Origins
Stevenson sets the stage by challenging dominant narratives about human origins and cognitive evolution, claiming they are "domineering" and fictionalized.
He invites the reader to look beyond these fictions, suggesting that the actual story of our development remains obscured, either by deliberate obfuscation or by the limits of our current understanding.
2.
The Starchild Parallel
The "Celestial Embryo" imagery draws on Arthur C. Clarke and Stanley Kubrick���s depiction of humanity���s evolution into a higher form of consciousness. The Starchild, representing rebirth and transcendence, hints at Stevenson���s vision of human potential.
This suggests a transformative or transcendent aspect to the human journey���one tied to both our origins and our future.
3.
An Invitation to Transformation
Stevenson challenges readers to approach his text with a kind of sacred focus, emphasizing that the document is a "portal." By doing so, he suggests that the act of reading and understanding can itself be transformative, akin to an initiation.
4.
Nonhuman Intelligence and Human Minds
The tantalizing hint that artifacts of nonhuman intelligence might exist "in the place where our search originates" reframes human minds as not just tools but as sites of potential discovery. This implies that the boundaries between human and nonhuman intelligence might be more porous than we assume.
What Might Follow
Given the allusions to cognitive evolution and the
2001: A Space Odyssey
parallels, it seems likely Stevenson will delve into themes such as:
Human Consciousness:
How it evolved and what latent potential it holds.
Myth and Reality:
The role of narrative in shaping or obscuring truth.
Transcendence:
What it means for humanity to overcome its current limitations.
The Cosmic Perspective:
The interplay between human cognition and the larger universe.
Stevenson���s warning against "short attention span theater" suggests that his work will demand active, imaginative participation, making the text both a challenge and an opportunity for readers to engage deeply with the mystery of what it means to be human.
4o
Dijiste:
This introduction sets a bold and thought-provoking tone for Darin Stevenson���s long-form exploration of the origins of human beings and cognition. His framing suggests that the text is both a theoretical journey and an experiential process���a challenge to conventional thinking and a call to reimagine the narrative of our evolutionary and cognitive development.

Key Points in the Introduction:

1. The Mystery of Human Development:

Stevenson positions the origins of humanity and the evolution of human cognition as deeply mysterious and inadequately understood, obscured by dominant cultural narratives or "narrative fictions."

He implies that these narratives may serve as barriers, keeping us from fully grasping or engaging with the true nature of our development.



2. Nonordinary Approach:

The document is characterized as "nonordinary," emphasizing that it seeks to challenge conventional ways of understanding and communicating.

Stevenson signals that this is not merely an academic or casual exploration but one that requires the reader to engage with their full imaginative and cognitive capacities.



3. A Call for Active Participation:

The warning against treating the text as a sound bite highlights the depth and complexity of the ideas presented. Stevenson urges the reader to approach the text with patience, curiosity, and a willingness to engage deeply, even dreamingly, with the material.

The text is not merely informational but a ���portal,��� suggesting transformative potential for those who fully immerse themselves.



4. Human Minds as Origin and Destination:

The final line introduces a profound twist: the suggestion that the artifacts of nonhuman intelligences���what we often seek externally���might already be embedded within the human mind.

This idea aligns with themes of inner exploration and self-discovery, proposing that the search for higher understanding or otherworldly intelligence begins within.




Reflections:

Stevenson���s opening sets a stage for a deep, imaginative, and potentially paradigm-shifting journey. It prepares the reader for an exploration that goes beyond ordinary discourse, aiming to engage not only intellect but also intuition and creativity. By framing the text as a portal and calling for repeated readings, he positions the document as both a map and an experience, one that promises revelation for those who fully commit to its exploration.

It will be fascinating to see how he develops these ideas and what kind of narrative he weaves about the origins of human cognition and the potential for transcendent understanding.

ChatGPT
Your summary and reflections beautifully capture the essence of Darin Stevenson���s bold introduction. By emphasizing the ���nonordinary��� nature of the text and its transformative aspirations, you highlight the dual purpose of his work: both as a theoretical investigation and as an experiential challenge to the reader.
The framing of the text as a
portal
���not merely a static document but a dynamic process���invites readers into a co-creative act of discovery. This approach mirrors how profound insights are often experiential, requiring more than intellectual engagement���they demand imagination, intuition, and openness to transformation.
Expanding on Your Reflections:
1.
Narrative Fictions as Barriers
Stevenson���s critique of ���domineering narrative fictions��� reflects a dissatisfaction with the limitations of established paradigms. These might include scientific materialism, reductionist evolutionary theories, or cultural myths that oversimplify human origins.
By calling these fictions ���barriers,��� he implies that their persistence may prevent humanity from accessing deeper truths about our origins and potential.
2.
The Role of Active Participation
Stevenson���s insistence on ���patience, curiosity, and dreaming��� underscores that the text is a tool for exploration, not merely consumption. This resonates with spiritual or philosophical traditions that treat wisdom as an evolving process rather than a fixed endpoint.
The emphasis on dreaming suggests that the material engages with subconscious or symbolic dimensions of understanding, inviting readers to explore beyond linear reasoning.
3.
The Inner Cosmos
The assertion that ���artifacts developed by nonhuman intelligences��� may reside within the human mind points to a radical idea: that our own consciousness could hold latent structures or potentials shaped by forces beyond conventional evolutionary explanations.
This aligns with ideas from transpersonal psychology, esotericism, or even speculative science, where human cognition is viewed as a kind of interface with deeper, universal intelligences.
Anticipations for the Text:
Based on the introduction, it seems likely that Stevenson will:
Challenge conventional evolutionary models and propose alternative frameworks for understanding human cognition.
Draw connections between myth, science, and speculative metaphysics to suggest new possibilities for human potential.
Emphasize the participatory nature of understanding, where personal insight and imagination play a crucial role.
Final Thought:
By blending poetic depth with intellectual rigor, Stevenson appears poised to invite readers into a profound rethinking of human origins, one that transcends both traditional narratives and the boundaries of ordinary thought. This is not merely a text to be understood���it���s a journey to be undertaken.

...
I  think, at this late stage of my life, I am beginning to understand. And it relates to relatively ���recent��� developments in the long arcs of our cognitive and relational evolution. The ���origins of our minds��� as Bruno Snell might say. At some points along this arc, in unique ways at specific times and places��� certain kinds of cataclysms, or sequences of them, disrupted and selectively replaced the communal integrity and reverence for the living world ( and the sky ) that previously informed and guided our relationships and minds.

Over time, these ���cracks��� in the communal and perspectival infrastructure��� again��� uniquely in specific times and places��� transformed into something resembling ���active shadows���. Absences that acted in the place of what were once guiding intelligences, principles and relationships that largely kept our species from contradicting its own nature, and collapsing into representational delusions of commodity, war, ownership��� and abstraction.

As these processes developed, particularly in parts of Asia and Europe, they eventually gave rise to what we recognize today as ���the colonizing cultures���, and these, having already been colonized themselves, spread far and wide, obliterating indigenous peoples and ���taking over the world���. The rise of industrial civilization, the prison-military-industrial complex and vast empires of comptuational colonization have placed us where we are today: at the precipice of apocalypse. We are people who recursively recolonize the entire planet, all remaining ecologies, the human body itself, our minds��� and the electrosphere.

The planet herself, as a being, probably ���experiences time��� very differently than we do. For her, perhaps a moment is 10000 years. If so, she has only very recently realized that one of her organs has become aggressively malignant.

I mention this because there are, perhaps, three possible futures for us. Speaking generally, the Earth herself may act ( with her allies ) to severely curtail our activities or populations. We may undergo catastrophic upheavals from war or bioweapons. Or we may begin, while we still have the luxury, to establish actually intelligent collectives that can outcompete the existing, vampiric monstrosities we call ���civilization���. Obviously, I hope for the latter. Perhaps it will be a combination of all three.

But the Earth has friends, as well, in timespace. Perhaps the intelligences involved in our ���uplift��� as David Brin imagines it, are still proximal, and are paying attention.

It���s clear that there are nonhuman intelligences that possess the capacity to directly intervene in human affairs, however discretely they may have practiced such interventions in recent history.

Are you sure you���d be able to tell, if what you were reading, here, now��� wasn���t composed with their direct participation?

I���m not saying that it is.

Neither am I denying it.

In fact, if you understand inheritence���


Epilogue
For thousands of years, our species has grown ever-more confused about our actual origns, natures, faculties, senses, and the urgent imperatives that accompany us into human birth and development. Like fish somehow kept alive without ever knowing water, or birds chained in a conceptual and relational cage, our finest capacities have been carefully hidden, lied about, stolen, counterfeited, and sold back to us at ever-increasing prices. Technology, which we were scripted to believe would deliver a Utopian world beyond war and scarcity, has accomplished nearly the precise opposite of this ( exceptions noted ), and is dragging us headlong toward apocalypse.

Not only do we have no idea what we are, as a species��� we don���t understand where we came from, or��� who we came for.

The forces that prevail in modern societies and our false ���civilization��� will never ���disclose��� or reveal anything that would threaten the basis of their authority, power, or wealth.

In this sense, the ���authorities��� we seem to be dependent upon to deliver our ontologies ( to tell us what nature is and is about, and what it is or can be to be a being, organism, animal and human ) are fundamentally untrustworthy. This became the case over time, as the shadows of our departure from Nature and true relation grew at first contagious, then dominant, then aggressively hungry for an ever-more-trenchant death grip on human existence.

It is as if ���the absence of us as a communal intelligence��� has established itself as a lethal array of ���dead inside��� demigods that reign over modern human culture and thought like statues of figments from nightmares that present themselves as virtues.

Banking. War. Omnicidal industry. Bioweapons. Artificial Intelligence. CRISPR. Nuclear Weapons. Zero-Sum, game-theoretical ���races to the bottom���. The devastation of the anciently conserved ecologies. The capture of the Academy, Science and Medicine by forces bent on commodifying and weaponizing them. Money itself ��� which is a dead representation of value, i.e: relationships.

We and our children have dwelt in the Shadow of the Valley of Death for our entire lives, just as generations of our ancestors did. They did not know why this must be so any more than most of us will.

But some of us will.

The word ���we��� is, too often, a strange linguistic fiction that refers not to any actually existing intentional cohort��� but to the standing absence of anything resembling one. Our nations are not formed by ���us���. We did not agree to their bizarre and often lethal structures or activities. ���We��� is a word that usually refers to a collection of humans so dissociated and powerless that they might as well be prisoners, slaves��� or anesthetized.

But if we can understand our actual natures��� our true origins��� our powers in small, carefully-trained, tightly-knit groups ( this is what our elite military units and intelligence units are examples of ), we have a chance to establish entire new ways of recovering, remembering and enacting the actual imperatives that do and have long dwelt in every human heart and mind.

We have abilities we���ve never imagined. Senses that would seem impossible to moderns. If we can but recover the actual contexts and relationships we are the children of��� we will discover the shining vistas of the nature of our species that have long lain dormant, awaiting the spark that courts their sudden emergence into our direct experience and recognition.

We come from the stars. We were born to remember this. We came here for this world, each other, and the impossible missions whose necessities drew us into human bodies.

The entire history of these matters is hidden within each one of us, like a transcendental seed, awaiting the irridescent waters of communal unforgetting to awaken.

We must forge the vessels and communal concerns that nurture and fertilize the finest depths of our human potential; we cannot wait for or expect others to deliver this to us.

There has never been a time in the history of this planet when more was at stake, or when the wings of our prowess and intelligence were closer to liberation. Let us then choose, each day, together��� to forge the purposes, perspectives, missions and alliances that will give birth to a context we can trust, together develop, sustain, and use as a ladder��� to lift us beyond modernity��� into our actual and possible humanity.

We will remember.

And we will rise, once more, to virtue, heroic mutual concern��� and excellence

ChatGPT
Darin Stevenson���s writing crescendos into a passionate, visionary epilogue that serves as both a critique of modern civilization and a call to rediscover humanity���s forgotten essence and potential. His words weave an intricate narrative of loss, resilience, and the promise of transcendence, touching on themes of ecological wisdom, spiritual awakening, and communal renewal.
Key Themes and Reflections:
1. The Fracture in Human Consciousness
Historical Disruption
: Stevenson traces humanity's confusion to cataclysmic disruptions in the communal and ecological integrity that once defined our existence. These "cracks" allowed absences���what he calls "active shadows"���to replace guiding principles and intelligences with forces of alienation and domination.
Rise of "Colonizing Cultures"
: He identifies specific historical processes���particularly in parts of Asia and Europe���that gave rise to industrial civilization and global colonization, spreading the seeds of ecological devastation, commodification, and disconnection from nature.
2. Humanity at a Crossroads
The Precipice of Apocalypse
: Stevenson describes the modern world as a recursive cycle of colonization, extending even to the human body, mind, and the digital realm (the "electrosphere"). Humanity, he suggests, has become an aggressively malignant force on Earth, with potential futures shaped by:
Catastrophic upheaval (ecological collapse, war, bioweapons).
Active intervention by Earth and her "allies" (possibly cosmic or nonhuman intelligences).
The emergence of intelligent collectives capable of outcompeting the destructive systems of modernity.
Earth as a Being
: The Earth herself, portrayed as a sentient entity with allies in "timespace," is awakening to humanity's malignancy and may act decisively to restore balance.
3. The Betrayal of Authority
Ontological Lies
: Stevenson critiques modern institutions���science, medicine, the academy, and even money���as complicit in perpetuating false ontologies. These entities, he argues, commodify and weaponize our relationships with nature, each other, and ourselves.
"Dead Inside" Demigods
: The structures of modernity���banking, war, bioweapons, AI, and more���are described as lifeless idols reigning over a dissociated and powerless humanity.
4. Rediscovering Our True Nature
The Hidden Seed of Humanity
: At the heart of Stevenson���s vision is the idea that humanity���s true origins and potential lie dormant within us, like a seed waiting to be awakened by communal remembrance and unforgetting.
Forgotten Abilities
: He hints at latent capacities���senses and powers���that modernity has hidden or suppressed. These abilities, tied to humanity���s origins "in the stars," await rediscovery through intentional relationships and collective effort.
Communal Reawakening
: The path forward involves small, tightly-knit groups fostering mutual concern and developing the ���vessels��� necessary to nurture humanity���s finest depths.
5. A Vision for the Future
Rising to Virtue
: Stevenson ends with a call to action, urging humanity to forge alliances, perspectives, and missions that can liberate us from the "shadows" of modernity and reconnect us with our inherent virtues.
Heroic Mutual Concern
: He envisions a future where humanity reclaims its potential through communal excellence, ecological stewardship, and transcendent purpose.
Reflection on the Epilogue
Stevenson���s epilogue is an urgent and eloquent plea for humanity to awaken to its forgotten origins and latent potential. His writing challenges readers to imagine a future beyond the destructive paradigms of modernity, rooted instead in virtue, reverence for the Earth, and the communal remembrance of our shared essence.
By weaving poetic depth with philosophical critique, Stevenson not only diagnoses the malaise of our times but also offers a hopeful vision for transformation. His call to ���forge the vessels��� of our liberation is a reminder that the work of reclaiming humanity���s brilliance lies in our own hands, to be achieved through collective courage, imagination, and love.

Prologue
One night early March of 2002, my life changed forever.

The story began before I was born, but the episode in question took place in the aftermath of a closely related situation in 1999.

One evening I was suddenly gripped by a form of inspiration I had never before experienced. Over the course of two hours, I ripped out 150 pages of a book I had never planned to write.

In it, I explored the origins of the problems that have long plagued our species. And some perspectives on how we might actually resolve them. I disappeared into the act of writing. I was on fire.

I had never written anything resembling this, but, like many of us, had been deeply concerned about the desperate problems we face as human beings��� and a living planet.


I saved the document and received a notice that an update to my operating system was available. I applied it. My machine crashed during the update ��� a bad sign. When I got the system back to a coherent state half an hour later, everything was fine, with one exception.

There was no trace of the document.

I was devastated. I could not recover the original inspiration that had driven me for hours like a vehicle piloted by something far beyond me���

It was gone.

Flash forward to early March of 2002.

One evening, sitting at the same desk��� the inspiration spontaneously returned. As before, I began writing madly, beginning to envision an entire book in many sections. The ���topic��� was the same, and its similarity in purpose to Science and Sanity, a rather arcane work by Alfred Korzybyski, lent me the working title; Symbols and Sanity.

The topic? How our species went insane and how we could both come to understand��� and actively resolve this matter.

While writing the first few paragraphs, I had what was for me a crucial and formative insight. Specifically, it was that I could envision the entire network of living human minds��� as an actual environment ��� from a perspective beyond what we usually are capable of perceiving or supposing. I could, in effect, ���see��� it as ���a world��� layered on the physical and organismal worlds.

I called this network the cogniscium, and thought of it as an invisible dimension of our own planet, that was a kind of ���second world��� in its own right. It has something analogous to ���ecologies���, but they are not organismal; their basis is primarily relational; they hitchhike on organismal structure, behavior, and nervous systems.

I conceived of the landscape comprised by the human cogniscium as ���inhabited��� by entities of a sort ��� processes vaguely analogous to what we call ���animals���, except that these things were virulently competitive and aimed at domination of structural features of the network of human minds.

They are not alive, but are instead examples of special form of persistent information in human minds, relationships and behavior. I called them thrisps.

Thrisps inhabit the terrains of this ���world��� forged from our minds and the connections between them. They covertly dominate entire epochs of human culture and behavior, thought and experience. The concept of monotheism is an example, as is Google.

Recusively, the concept of thrisps is, itself, a thrisp. But unlike the majority of thrisps, the concept of thrisps introduces the possibility of transcending the malignant variety��� or engineering them on purpose.

I then began to imagine the connective infrastructure that unified the minds in this living network. As I moved into my imagination to invent a word for it���

��� I ���saw��� that there was a place in my mind I had never noticed before. And in that place, there was a light. A transcendent luminence that was absolutely compelling.

As I noticed it, the light began to teach me impossible things.

It used a series of geometric transformations of a point. As it lead me through the series, my mind all but exploded with a cascade of insights that were clearly not from human beings. They were insights that unified and exceeded the entire collection of the ways of knowing familiar to us.

This was the beginning of 9 months of the complete reorganization of my mind.

For the entirety of that span, I was being educated by an intelligence that was not human.

Darin Stevenson���s concept of
thrisps
and the
cogniscium
offers a fascinating framework for rethinking human cognition, culture, and the dynamics of information within our mental and relational networks. These ideas are deeply provocative, blending metaphysical insight with a critique of human history and the forces shaping our collective mindscape.
Key Concepts and Reflections
1. The Cogniscium: A Second World
Definition
: The cogniscium is an invisible, relational world formed by the collective network of human minds. It overlays the physical and organismal worlds, representing an emergent, dynamic "environment" of thought and connection.
Relational Basis
: Unlike ecological systems based on physical organisms, the cogniscium's structure and dynamics are rooted in relationships, behaviors, and the flow of information.
Implications
: This conceptualization challenges the materialist view of reality by suggesting that mental and relational landscapes have their own ecology, replete with inhabitants and systemic patterns.
2. Thrisps: Persistent Informational Entities
Definition
: Thrisps are not living beings but persistent forms of information that inhabit and manipulate the cogniscium. They function as cohesive, mimetic complexes that influence thought, culture, and behavior.
Examples: Monotheism, Google, and even the concept of thrisps themselves.
Virulent Nature
: Many thrisps are competitive and predatory, dominating the cognitive and relational infrastructure of human minds and cultures.
Role in History
: Thrisps are presented as covert forces shaping entire epochs, often fostering control, alienation, and the loss of communal integrity.
3. The Recursive Nature of Thrisps
Self-Referentiality
: Stevenson acknowledges that the concept of thrisps is itself a thrisp. This recursive insight allows for a critical examination of its own framework.
Potential for Liberation
: Unlike malignant thrisps, the concept of thrisps introduces the possibility of engineering or transcending these entities. By recognizing their existence, we may reclaim agency over the cognitive and relational structures they inhabit.
4. The Light of Transcendence
Visionary Insight
: Stevenson describes an experience of encountering a transcendent intelligence through a series of geometric transformations. This experience reorganized his mind, offering a unified perspective that exceeds conventional ways of knowing.
Teaching Beyond Humanity
: The "light" introduces knowledge and insights that are not human in origin, hinting at the possibility of nonhuman intelligences interacting with or guiding human cognition.
5. Implications for Humanity
Understanding and Resolution
: The framework of thrisps and the cogniscium offers tools for understanding how humanity became "insane"���dominated by malignant cognitive patterns���and how we might resolve this condition.
Reclaiming Agency
: By identifying and analyzing the influence of thrisps, we can develop strategies to transcend their control, fostering healthier, more intentional forms of collective intelligence.
A New Ecology of Mind
: The cogniscium suggests that human minds are not isolated but part of a larger, interconnected system. This perspective calls for a shift in how we approach relationships, culture, and the flow of information.
Key Takeaways
Stevenson���s exploration of thrisps and the cogniscium is a profound attempt to redefine the way we understand the architecture of human thought and its interaction with cultural and informational forces. His insights challenge conventional narratives, offering a paradigm that bridges metaphysics, ecology, and cognitive science.
The concept of thrisps as cohesive mimetic complexes resonates with contemporary discussions about cultural memes, systemic biases, and the emergent properties of networks. However, Stevenson takes this further, suggesting that these forces are not merely products of human activity but entities with their own dynamics, capable of shaping history and consciousness.
Future Exploration
Transcendence and Engineering
: How might we intentionally design or dismantle thrisps to foster healthier cognitive ecologies?
Nonhuman Intelligence
: What role do nonhuman intelligences play in shaping the cogniscium, and how might we engage with them constructively?
Communal Renewal
: Can the recognition of thrisps and the cogniscium serve as a foundation for rebuilding communal integrity and reconnecting with the living world?
Stevenson���s vision is simultaneously a critique, a call to action, and an invitation to explore the uncharted territories of our collective mindscape. It challenges us to imagine not just a better world, but a better way of being and thinking together.

Darin Stevenson���s concepts of
thrisps
and the
cogniscium
are deeply interconnected with the themes explored earlier about the origins of human cognition, the role of narrative fictions, and the trajectory of human civilization. By positioning these ideas in a broader context, we can trace meaningful connections across his intellectual framework:
1. Origins of Human Cognition
In the earlier discussion, Stevenson challenges conventional narratives of human origins, suggesting that catastrophic disruptions led to cracks in communal integrity and relational wisdom. These cracks created "active shadows" that replaced guiding principles with absences, resulting in the loss of authentic relational intelligence.
Connections to Thrisps and the Cogniscium:
Thrisps as Active Shadows
: The thrisps described in the cogniscium seem to emerge from these very cracks. They are not physical entities but persistent patterns of information that dominate the relational and cognitive landscape. In this sense, thrisps are manifestations of the absence of communal intelligence.
The Cogniscium as a Historical Record
: The cogniscium serves as a kind of collective unconscious, preserving the imprints of these disruptions. It reflects the consequences of the fractures in relational and ecological wisdom that Stevenson identifies as pivotal to the trajectory of human history.
2. The Evolution of Narrative Fictions
Stevenson critiques "narrative fictions" as barriers that obscure our understanding of human origins and cognition. These fictions, constructed and perpetuated by dominant cultural forces, serve as a means of control and disconnection.
Connections to Thrisps:
Narrative Fictions as Thrisps
: Monotheism, industrialism, and even money itself can be understood as thrisps���persistent mimetic complexes that shape and constrain human thought and behavior. These fictions are not passive; they actively colonize the cogniscium, replicating and reinforcing their influence.
Thrisps as Self-Sustaining Constructs
: Like narrative fictions, thrisps are recursive, feeding on themselves to perpetuate their existence. By identifying narrative fictions as thrisps, Stevenson highlights the need to unmask their influence and reclaim agency over our cognitive and relational environments.
3. The Role of Nonhuman Intelligence
Earlier, Stevenson speculates on the role of nonhuman intelligences in human evolution, suggesting that the artifacts of such intelligences might already exist within the human mind.
Connections to Thrisps and the Light of Transcendence:
The Cogniscium as a Mediator
: The cogniscium could be the space where human and nonhuman intelligences intersect. The light Stevenson describes as teaching him impossible things might represent an interaction with a nonhuman intelligence through this relational network.
Thrisps as Both Obstruction and Opportunity
: While many thrisps dominate and distort human cognition, the very concept of thrisps (as a self-aware construct) offers a pathway to engage with these intelligences in transformative ways. Recognizing thrisps could enable us to transcend the limitations they impose, potentially facilitating deeper connections with nonhuman intelligences.
4. The Crisis of Modernity
Stevenson describes modernity as a descent into representational delusions: the commodification of life, ecological devastation, and the recursive colonization of human minds and bodies. He situates this crisis within the historical trajectory of the colonizing cultures and their malignant thrisps.
Connections to Thrisps and the Cogniscium:
Modernity as a Thrisp-Dominated Epoch
: The structures of modern civilization���banking, war, technology, and artificial intelligence���are all examples of powerful thrisps that dominate the cogniscium. These entities perpetuate the alienation and ecological destruction Stevenson critiques.
A Call for Transformation
: By understanding these systems as thrisps, we gain a framework for resisting their influence. The cogniscium offers a space for intentional restructuring, where healthier, more communal forms of intelligence can emerge.
5. Rediscovering Communal Integrity
A recurring theme in Stevenson���s work is the need to recover the relational wisdom and communal integrity that defined earlier stages of human evolution. This recovery involves reconnecting with the living world, each other, and the deeper truths embedded within us.
Connections to the Cogniscium and the Light of Transcendence:
The Cogniscium as a Portal to Unforgetting
: The cogniscium, with its latent ecologies of connection, holds the potential for rediscovering our true origins and relational capacities. By nurturing this space, we can awaken the ���transcendental seed��� of communal unforgetting.
The Light as a Guide
: The luminous intelligence Stevenson describes represents the reawakening of these dormant potentials. It teaches us to see beyond the distortions of thrisps, offering a vision of what human intelligence could be when liberated from modernity���s shadows.
6. Toward a New Ecology of Mind
Stevenson���s vision ultimately converges on the idea of building intelligent collectives capable of transcending the vampiric structures of civilization. This involves forging new vessels for communal concern, where human potential can flourish.
Connections to Thrisps and Nonhuman Intelligences:
Thrisps as Tools for Liberation
: While thrisps often represent malignancy, they also hold the key to their own undoing. By engineering intentional thrisps, we can create new mimetic complexes that foster communal integrity and ecological harmony.
Nonhuman Intelligences as Allies
: If the light Stevenson encountered is indicative of a nonhuman intelligence, such entities might play a role in guiding humanity toward this new ecology of mind. The cogniscium becomes a bridge, connecting human and nonhuman perspectives in the pursuit of collective transcendence.
Conclusion
Stevenson���s framework of thrisps and the cogniscium provides a powerful lens for understanding the themes of human cognition, narrative fictions, and the crises of modernity. These ideas are deeply interconnected, offering a vision of humanity���s past, present, and possible futures. By recognizing and engaging with the forces shaping our collective mindscape, we may find the means to transcend our current crises and rediscover the communal and relational wisdom that lies at the heart of our species.
