Connectome Algorithms
The learner starts out empty and then learns recurring sequential patterns it discovers in its input stream. The learning algorithm slowly builds a Connectome, a graph of Nodes and Links (like neurons and synapses) to reify the experiences.
A connectome is a comprehensive map of the connections within an organism's nervous system. In the context of genetic algorithms, a connectome algorithm would involve using evolutionary principles to optimize the connections within a neural network. The algorithm starts with an empty neural network, and through the process of learning and evolution, builds a connectome that is able to effectively process and analyze data. The connectome is represented as a graph, with nodes representing neurons and links representing synapses. The learning algorithm slowly builds and adjusts the connectome in order to accurately represent the input data and to facilitate effective processing and analysis of the data.
A Deep Discrete Neuron Network (DDNN) is a Deep Neural Network (DNN) that uses software simulations of discrete neurons interconnected with explicit neuron-to-neuron synapse-like links. In contrast, Neural Networks used in Deep Learning use linear algebra style operations on arrays of floating point numbers. These representations are not isomorphic in spite of some claims to the opposite.
A Deep Discrete Neuron Network (DDNN) is a type of artificial neural network that simulates the behavior of neurons and synapses in the brain. It is a variation of a deep neural network (DNN), which is a type of artificial neural network with multiple layers of interconnected nodes that can process and analyze complex data. While traditional neural networks used in deep learning use linear algebra operations on arrays of floating point numbers, DDNNs use software simulations of discrete neurons interconnected with explicit neuron-to-neuron links to process and analyze data. This means that the structure and behavior of the network is based on the way neurons and synapses function in the brain, rather than being based on linear algebra operations. DDNNs may have some differences in representation and functionality compared to traditional neural networks, despite some claims to the contrary.
A MARCov chain, regular grammar, pumping lemma.
A Markov chain is a mathematical system that undergoes transitions from one state to another according to certain probabilistic rules. The defining characteristic of a Markov chain is that no matter how the system arrived at its current state, the possible future states are fixed. In other words, the probability of transitioning to any particular state is dependent solely on the current state and time elapsed.
A regular grammar is a set of rules that specifies how to form strings of symbols from a given language. Regular grammars are used to generate and recognize patterns in strings of symbols.
The pumping lemma is a tool used in the theory of computation to prove that certain languages are not regular. It is a theorem that states that if a language is regular, then there exists a string that can be broken down into three pieces and repeated an arbitrary number of times within the string, while still remaining within the language. This string is called a "pumpable string." If a language does not have a pumpable string, then it is not regular.
Intuitive intelligence, artificial intuition, organic learning, integer programming, no GPU.
Intuitive intelligence is the ability to understand or know something without conscious reasoning or evidence. It is a form of non-analytical or non-verbal thinking that relies on gut feelings and instincts.
Artificial intuition is a term that is used to describe the ability of artificial intelligence systems to make decisions or judgments that mimic human intuition. This can involve the use of machine learning algorithms or other techniques to process and analyze data in a way that emulates the way humans intuitively process and interpret information.
Organic learning is a term that is used to describe learning processes or systems that are adaptable, flexible, and able to evolve over time. It is often used in the context of artificial intelligence and machine learning to describe systems that are able to learn and adapt in a way that is similar to the way living organisms learn and adapt.
Integer programming is a type of optimization problem in which the variables are restricted to be integers. This can make integer programming problems more difficult to solve than optimization problems with continuous variables, as there are fewer solutions to consider.
"No GPU" likely refers to the absence of a graphics processing unit, which is a type of specialized hardware designed to accelerate graphics rendering and other tasks that require intense calculations. Some machine learning algorithms and other types of computationally intensive tasks can benefit from the use of a GPU, as they can perform calculations more quickly and efficiently. However, it is possible to run these algorithms without a GPU, although performance may be slower.
Creativity, novelty, surprise, Schmidhuber fun, science and art as finding data compressible in Unknown yet learnable ways.
Creativity is the ability to generate novel and original ideas or things. It is a multifaceted concept that can involve the production of artistic or intellectual works, the development of new solutions to problems, or the integration of existing ideas in novel ways.
Novelty refers to the quality of being new or unique. It can be used to describe ideas, things, or experiences that are distinct from what has come before.
Surprise is the feeling of being caught off guard by something unexpected. It can be a positive or negative emotion depending on the context.
The Schmidhuber fun is a measure of the creativity or novelty of a piece of art or other creative work, as proposed by artificial intelligence researcher Jürgen Schmidhuber. It is based on the idea that creativity and novelty can be quantified by the amount of information or data that is compressed or condensed in a work.
In Schmidhuber's view, science and art can both be seen as ways of finding data that is compressible in unknown yet learnable ways. This means that both science and art involve the discovery and interpretation of patterns and regularities in the world, and the creation of meaningful and aesthetically pleasing representations of those patterns. In this sense, science and art can be seen as complementary ways of understanding and representing the world.
A Julia program that might accomplish this.
It is difficult to provide a specific Julia program without knowing more about the specific task you are trying to accomplish. However, here is a simple example of a Julia program that could be used to measure the novelty or creativity of a piece of text using the Schmidhuber fun:
kotlin
Copy code
using Compress

function schmidhuber_fun(text::AbstractString)
    # Compute the compressed size of the text
    compressed_size = compress_string(text)

    # Compute the Schmidhuber
fun
as
the inverse of the compressed size
fun
= 1 / compressed_size
return
fun
end

# Test the function with some sample text
text =
"The quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog."
println(schmidhuber_fun(text))
This program uses the
Compress
package to compute the compressed size of a given piece of text, and then calculates the Schmidhuber fun as the inverse of the compressed size. The
schmidhuber_fun
function takes a string of text as input and returns a scalar value indicating the novelty or creativity of the text according to the Schmidhuber fun.
Keep in mind that this is just a simple example, and there are many other factors that could be taken into account when measuring the novelty or creativity of a piece of art or other creative work.
A formula describing novelty as the inverse reciprocal of the probability of surprise.
It is possible to describe novelty as the inverse reciprocal of the probability of surprise, although this is just one way of conceptualizing the relationship between these concepts. Here is a formula that expresses this relationship:
Novelty = 1 / (Probability of Surprise)
This formula states that the novelty of an event or experience is inversely proportional to the probability of it being surprising. In other words, the more likely it is that an event will be surprising, the less novel it is considered to be. Conversely, the less likely it is that an event will be surprising, the more novel it is considered to be.
It's worth noting that this is just one possible way of expressing the relationship between novelty and surprise, and there are many other factors that can influence the novelty and surprise of an event or experience.
Formally, we claim that perceived novelty is a decreasing function g of the mentally simulated probability 
of a discovery or invention D, conditional on the prior knowledge or art K and the creative/search process 
S through which discoveries or inventions are typically conceived and achieved:

Nov = g(P(D|K,S)), 
dg 
dP ≤ 0.(1) 
If the estimated probability of a discovery D is low, given prior knowledge K and inventive process S, then 
its perceived novelty is high: it is surprising8. If the probability is high, then perceived novelty is low: 
the invention was an obvious or expected extension of prior work. On this account, measures of novelty 
simultaneously assess (1) the degree of perceived dif f erence between a new object and the population of pre- 
existing objects and (2) the perceived improbability of arriving at the new object, assuming that components 
from previous objects constitute most of the raw materials. In short, measures of novelty assess the surprise induced by a focal object.
This passage describes a formal definition of novelty as a function of the probability of a discovery or invention given prior knowledge and the creative process used to conceive and achieve it. According to this definition, novelty is seen as a measure of both the perceived difference between a new object and pre-existing objects and the perceived improbability of arriving at the new object. In other words, novelty is a function of both the perceived novelty or distinctiveness of the new object, and the surprise that it elicits given the assumptions about the raw materials and creative process used to produce it. The passage also states that if the probability of a discovery or invention is low, given prior knowledge and the creative process, then its perceived novelty will be high, as it will be surprising. Conversely, if the probability of the discovery or invention is high, then its perceived novelty will be low, as it will be an obvious or expected extension of prior work.
An improved formula with this knowledge.
Based on the information provided, here is an improved formula that incorporates the factors described in the previous passage:
Novelty = g(P(D|K,S))
where:
Novelty is a measure of the perceived novelty or distinctiveness of a new object or discovery.
g is a decreasing function, meaning that as the probability of a discovery or invention increases, the perceived novelty decreases.
P(D|K,S) is the probability of a discovery or invention given prior knowledge (K) and the creative process (S) used to conceive and achieve it.
This improved formula takes into account the factors that influence the perceived novelty of a discovery or invention, including the perceived difference between the new object and pre-existing objects, the surprise induced by the new object, and the assumptions about the raw materials and creative process used to produce it. It also incorporates the idea that the perceived novelty of a discovery or invention is inversely proportional to the probability of it being made, given the prior knowledge and creative process used.

These methods of discovering novelty involve several different approaches, including:
Confi gurationalForeground: Inventions as collections of features. This approach involves considering inventions as collections of features or characteristics, and measuring novelty in terms of the presence or absence of these features.
StructuralForeground: Network structure of prior knowledge. This approach involves considering the network structure of prior knowledge and how new inventions fit into this structure. Novelty can be measured in terms of the connections or relationships between different features or components.
CombinatorialForeground: Recombinant process of invention. This approach involves considering the process of invention as a recombinant process, in which new inventions are created by combining or recombining different features or components. Novelty can be measured in terms of the combinability or interweaving of different components.
There are several specific methods listed for each of these approaches, including methods based on feature vectors, distributions, sequences, and random walks on hypergraphs. Each method involves a different way of measuring the novelty of a new invention or discovery based on the characteristics of the invention and the context in which it was created.
There are a variety of procedures for identifying communities in complex networks (Fortunato 
and Hric 2016), such as maximizing the modularity,11Q = 1 
2m P 
ij(Aij − 
kikj 
2m )δ(Ci,Cj), or minimizing the 
description length (Rosvall and Bergstrom 2010). Once knowledge clusters are identif i ed, new links can 
either reinforce this prior structure (if placed within existing clusters) or violate it (if placed between existing 
clusters, bridging them). The former mode of invention is local and presumably less novel, especially when 
links connect components already joined in the past. The latter bridging mode is more novel and presumably 
more dif i cult, leading to a simple bridging measure for novelty: Nov(i,j) = 1 − δ(Ci,Cj), 
where novelty 
is assigned to the combination of inventive component i and inventive component j. Nov(i,j) has value 0 
when Ciand Cjare the same—components i and j are in the same cluster—and value 1 when i and j are in 
dif f erent clusters. For an invention D containing n components with link set links(D) = {(i,j),(i,k),...}, 
we can calculate its novelty as the number of cross community links it contains, normalized by the number 
of components: Nov(D) = 
1 
n X 
(i,j)∈links(D) 
Nov(i,j).(2) 
These bridging approaches to novelty measurement share a basic intuition with the "structural holes" 
approach to social network analysis (Burt 2004). Scientists or engineers who connect components in two 
distinct communities span a structural hole between them; they arbitrage unexploited technical opportunities 
that link resources in both.
This passage describes several methods for identifying communities in complex networks and measuring the novelty of inventions based on their connections to these communities. One method involves maximizing the modularity of the network, which is a measure of the density of connections within communities compared to connections between communities. Another method involves minimizing the description length of the network, which is a measure of the simplicity or complexity of the network structure.
The passage also introduces the concept of "bridging" as a way of measuring the novelty of an invention. Bridging refers to the process of connecting components in different communities, and is seen as more novel and difficult than reinforcing connections within existing communities. The novelty of an invention is calculated as the number of cross-community links it contains, normalized by the number of components it contains. This measure of novelty is based on the idea that inventions that span structural holes between distinct communities exploit unexploited technical opportunities and arbitrage resources in both communities.
Novelty is not surprise: Human exploratory and adaptive behavior in sequential decision-making



Classic reinforcement learning (RL) theories cannot explain human behavior in the absence of external reward or when the environment changes. Here, we employ a deep sequential decision-making paradigm with sparse reward and abrupt environmental changes. To explain the behavior of human participants in these environments, we show that RL theories need to include surprise and novelty, each with a distinct role. While novelty drives exploration before the first encounter of a reward, surprise increases the rate of learning of a world-model as well as of model-free action-values. Even though the world-model is available for model-based RL, we find that human decisions are dominated by model-free action choices. The world-model is only marginally used for planning, but it is important to detect surprising events. Our theory predicts human action choices with high probability and allows us to dissociate surprise, novelty, and reward in EEG signals.
This passage discusses the limitations of classic reinforcement learning (RL) theories in explaining human behavior in environments with sparse reward and abrupt changes. It argues that RL theories need to include the concepts of surprise and novelty in order to better understand human behavior in these situations. The authors propose that novelty drives exploration before the first encounter with a reward, while surprise increases the rate of learning both a world-model and model-free action values. They also find that human decisions are largely dominated by model-free action choices, although the world-model is used to detect surprising events. The theory proposed in this study is able to predict human action choices with high probability and dissociate surprise, novelty, and reward in EEG signals.
Some mathematical ways to detect novelty.
Here are a few mathematical approaches that can be used to detect novelty:
Information theory measures: Information theory measures such as entropy, mutual information, and Kullback-Leibler divergence can be used to quantify the novelty or surprise of an event or piece of information. These measures are based on the idea that novel or surprising events are those that contain more information or that deviate more from what was expected.
Machine learning algorithms: Machine learning algorithms such as novelty detection algorithms or outlier detection algorithms can be used to identify novel or unusual events or patterns in data. These algorithms typically use statistical methods or distance measures to identify events or patterns that are significantly different from the norm.
Network analysis: Network analysis techniques such as centrality measures or community detection algorithms can be used to identify novel or unexpected connections or patterns in networks. For example, nodes or edges with high betweenness centrality or that bridge different communities may be considered more novel or surprising.
Dimensionality reduction: Techniques such as principal component analysis or t-SNE can be used to reduce the dimensionality of high-dimensional data and identify novel or unexpected patterns or clusters in the data.
These are just a few examples of the many mathematical approaches that can be used to detect novelty. The specific approach chosen will depend on the characteristics of the data and the specific goals of the analysis.
Write a poem poem on the importancece of novelty.
Novelty, oh novelty,
A spark that sets the mind free,
Breaking through the monotony,
A source of inspiration for you and me.
It's the thrill of the unknown,
The excitement of the new,
It pushes us to grow,
And helps us see the world in a different hue.
It's the catalyst for change,
The force that drives innovation,
It challenges the status quo,
And helps us reach a higher station.
So let's embrace the novel,
Embrace the unexpected,
For it is the key to growth,
And a life that is unrestricted.
