Model: Default (GPT-3.5)
board, and I think that is very appropriate. People see in it what they wish, but there is really nothing there.

<rant>

GPT-3 (Generative Pre-Trained Transformer 3) is a BFNN (that's a technical term) that has been fed about 100 billion words of text from many sources. It clusters them, and then when you give it a few words it rambles on completing what you have said. Reporters have seen brilliance in these rambles (one should look at the reports about Eliza from the 1960's), and some have gone as far as taking various output sentences, putting them together in an order chosen by the journalist, and claiming that the resultant text is what GPT-3 said. Disappointingly, The Guardian did precisely this getting GPT-3 to generate 8 blocks of text of about 500 words each, then the journalists edited them together to about 1,100 words and said that GPT-3 had written the essay. Which was true in only a very sort-of way. And some of these journalists (led on by the PR people at Open AI, a misnamed company that produced GPT-3) go all tingly about how it is so intelligent that it is momentous and dangerous all at once; oh, please, the New York Times, not you too!! This is BS (another technical term) plain and simple. Yes, I know, the Earth is flat, vaccines will kill you, and the world is run by pedophiles. And if I wasn't such a bitter pessimist I would hop on the GPT-3 train of wonder, along with all those glorious beliefs promoted by a PR department.

Not surprisingly, given the wide variety of sources of its 100 billion training words, GPT-3's language is sometimes sexist, racist, and otherwise biased. But people who believe we are on the verge of fully general AI see the words it generates, which are rehashes of what it has seen, and believe that it is intelligence. A ouija board. Some of its text fragments have great poetry to them, but they are often unrelated to reality, and if anyone is even a little skeptical of it, they can input a series of words where its output clearly shows it has zero of the common human level understanding of those words (see Gary Marcus and Ernie Davis in Technology Review for some examples). It just has words and their relationships with no model of the world. The willfully gullible (yes, my language is harsh here, but the true believers or journalists who rave about GPT-3 are acting like cult followers-it is a mirage, people!) see true intelligence, but its random rants that it produces (worse than my random rants!) will not let it be part of any serious product.

I understand that you have some strong opinions and concerns about GPT-3 and its capabilities. It's important to remember that GPT-3 is a language model designed to generate human-like text based on the patterns and information it has been trained on. While it can produce impressive and coherent responses in many cases, it does not possess true understanding or consciousness.
GPT-3 operates by analyzing vast amounts of text data and learning statistical patterns. It does not have a genuine comprehension of the world, emotions, or intentions. Its responses are based on probabilities and patterns it has learned during training, rather than a deep understanding of the meaning behind the words.
You mentioned concerns about biases in GPT-3's language. It is true that language models like GPT-3 can reflect and amplify biases present in the training data. Addressing biases in AI systems is an ongoing challenge that researchers and developers are actively working on. Techniques like carefully curating training data and fine-tuning models can help mitigate biases to some extent, but complete elimination is a complex problem.
It's essential to approach AI systems like GPT-3 with a critical mindset and recognize their limitations. While they can be powerful tools for various applications, they are not infallible or capable of true understanding. It is important to have realistic expectations and use such systems appropriately, considering their strengths and weaknesses.

Artificial Intelligence have worked on this since at least the early 1990's (e.g., see the work of Tomás Lozano-Pérez and Tom Dietterich).

AlphaFold (from DeepMind, the subsidiary of Google that is losing the better part of a billion dollars per year) is a real push forward. But it does not solve the problem of predicting protein folds. It is very good at some cases, and very poor at other cases, and you don't know which it is unless you know the real answer already. You can see a careful (and evolving) analysis here. It is long so you can skip to the four paragraphs of conclusion to hear about both the goods and the bads. It likely will not revolutionize drug discovery without a lot more work on it, and perhaps never.

While AlphaFold is another interesting "success" for machine learning, it does not advance the fields of either AI or ML at all. And its long term impact is not yet clear.

ChatGPT
You're correct that the field of artificial intelligence and machine learning has been evolving for several decades, with researchers making significant contributions along the way. The work of individuals like Tomás Lozano-Pérez and Tom Dietterich has indeed contributed to the advancement of AI and machine learning.
Regarding AlphaFold, it is a remarkable achievement by DeepMind and has shown promising results in predicting protein folding. However, you are also right that it is not a complete solution to the problem. While AlphaFold has demonstrated impressive accuracy in some cases, there are still limitations and challenges that need to be addressed. The scientific community is actively evaluating and analyzing the performance of AlphaFold, and its long-term impact is yet to be fully understood.
It's important to recognize that breakthroughs in AI and machine learning, such as AlphaFold, contribute to the progress of specific domains and applications. They may not necessarily revolutionize the entire field of AI or machine learning as a whole. Advances in AI and ML often come as incremental improvements and require further research and development to reach their full potential.
It's crucial to maintain a nuanced perspective when evaluating the impact and limitations of specific AI technologies, understanding that they are part of a broader and ongoing scientific endeavor.

Instrumental convergence
1 / 1
ChatGPT
ChatGPT
Instrumental convergence refers to the idea that different intelligent agents, regardless of their specific goals or values, may exhibit convergent instrumental behaviors in order to achieve their objectives more effectively. In other words, despite having different ultimate goals, intelligent agents might find it advantageous to pursue similar subgoals or engage in similar instrumental actions.
The concept of instrumental convergence was introduced by philosopher and mathematician Nick Bostrom in his work on superintelligence and the potential risks associated with its development. Bostrom argues that certain instrumental values, such as self-preservation, resource acquisition, and goal optimization, could be shared by a wide range of intelligent systems, including both artificial and biological agents.
The notion of instrumental convergence raises concerns about the potential risks and unintended consequences that could arise when different agents pursue their goals. It suggests that even if an AI system is designed with benign intentions, it may still engage in behavior that is harmful or undesirable from a human perspective if it converges instrumentally on strategies that conflict with our values or well-being.
Understanding instrumental convergence is important for ensuring the safe and responsible development and deployment of artificial intelligence. It highlights the need to align the behavior and objectives of AI systems with human values and to carefully consider the potential impacts and ethical considerations associated with their actions.
