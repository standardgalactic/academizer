Feedback Loop in PCT
Explain how to make a feedback loop similar to in perceptual control theory that makes constant corrections for error. I asked chatGPT for numbered pseudocode of a simple feedback control loop: It provided. (image for illustration)

1. Set initial conditions and parameters
2. Measure the current system state (input)
3. Calculate the error between the desired state and the current state
4. Determine the control action to be applied to the system based on the error
5. Apply the control action to the system
6. Measure the new system state (output)
7. Calculate the new error
8. Repeat steps 3-7 until the error is within a desired tolerance or a maximum number of iterations is reached
This is a basic feedback loop structure used in control systems to achieve a desired output state. The loop continuously measures the system's state, calculates the error between the desired and current state, determines the control action to adjust the system, applies the action, and repeats the process until the error is within a desired tolerance or a maximum number of iterations is reached.
Give an example or two, say a fly walking  on the inside of a rotating tube.
Fly Walking on a Rotating Tube:
In this example, the system is a fly walking on the inside of a rotating tube. The desired state is for the fly to walk in a straight line along the axis of the tube.
Initial conditions and parameters:
The fly's initial position and velocity are recorded.
The rotation speed of the tube is set.
The desired straight line path is defined.
Measure the current system state (input):
The fly's current position and velocity are measured.
Calculate the error between the desired state and the current state:
The difference between the fly's current position and velocity and the desired straight line path is calculated.
Determine the control action to be applied to the system based on the error:
Based on the calculated error, the fly's legs are adjusted to maintain balance and stay on the desired path.
Apply the control action to the system:
The fly's legs are adjusted accordingly.
Measure the new system state (output):
The fly's new position and velocity are measured.
Calculate the new error:
The new error is calculated based on the fly's new position and velocity and the desired straight line path.
Repeat steps 3-8 until the error is within a desired tolerance or a maximum number of iterations is reached.
The fly continually adjusts its legs based on the calculated error until it is able to walk in a straight line along the axis of the rotating tube.
Temperature Control System:
In this example, the system is a heating and cooling system in a building. The desired state is to maintain the temperature of the building at a set point.
Initial conditions and parameters:
The initial temperature of the building is recorded.
The set point temperature is defined.
The heating and cooling parameters are set.
Measure the current system state (input):
The current temperature of the building is measured.
Calculate the error between the desired state and the current state:
The difference between the current temperature and the set point temperature is calculated.
Determine the control action to be applied to the system based on the error:
Based on the calculated error, the heating or cooling system is activated or deactivated.
Apply the control action to the system:
The heating or cooling system is turned on or off accordingly.
Measure the new system state (output):
The new temperature of the building is measured.
Calculate the new error:
The new error is calculated based on the new temperature and the set point temperature.
Repeat steps 3-8 until the error is within a desired tolerance or a maximum number of iterations is reached.
The heating and cooling system continually adjusts the temperature of the building based on the calculated error until the temperature is maintained at the set point.
Ok cool, how about an examine from artist making a painting by putting paint randomly on the canvas, seeing if it looks like something using paradolia, and then correcting errors.
Artist Painting using Randomness and Correction:
In this example, the system is an artist making a painting by putting paint randomly on the canvas and then correcting errors to create a recognizable image.
Initial conditions and parameters:
The artist sets the canvas and paints.
The artist decides on a subject or theme for the painting.
Measure the current system state (input):
The artist looks at the current state of the painting.
Calculate the error between the desired state and the current state:
The artist evaluates the painting to see if it resembles the intended subject or theme and calculates the difference between the current state and the desired state.
Determine the control action to be applied to the system based on the error:
Based on the calculated error, the artist decides on what corrections need to be made to the painting.
Apply the control action to the system:
The artist makes the necessary corrections to the painting.
Measure the new system state (output):
The artist looks at the new state of the painting.
Calculate the new error:
The artist evaluates the new state of the painting to see if it resembles the intended subject or theme and calculates the new error.
Repeat steps 3-8 until the error is within a desired tolerance or a maximum number of iterations is reached.
The artist continually makes corrections to the painting based on the calculated error until the painting resembles the intended subject or theme.
A summary of the use of feedback loops in perceptual control.
A feedback loop in perceptual control is a process used to maintain a desired state in a system. It operates by continuously measuring the system's current state, calculating the error between the current state and the desired state, determining the control action to be applied to the system based on the error, applying the control action, and measuring the new state of the system. This process is repeated until the error is within a desired tolerance or a maximum number of iterations is reached.
Feedback loops are widely used in various fields including engineering, biology, psychology, and art. In perceptual control, it is used to regulate behavior, thought, and perception by making constant corrections for error. Feedback loops in perceptual control ensure that a desired state is maintained and deviations from the desired state are corrected, leading to improved control and stability in the system.
