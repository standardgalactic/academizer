Sensemaking: The Power of the Humanities in the Age of the Algorithm Hardcover - March 21 2017
by Christian Madsbjerg (Author)

Based on his work at some of the world's largest companies, including Ford, Adidas, and Chanel, Christian Madsbjerg's Sensemaking is a provocative stand against the tyranny of big data and scientism, and an urgent, overdue defense of human intelligence.

Humans have become subservient to algorithms. Every day brings a new Moneyball fix--a math whiz who will crack open an industry with clean fact-based analysis rather than human intuition and experience. As a result, we have stopped thinking. Machines do it for us.

Christian Madsbjerg argues that our fixation with data often masks stunning deficiencies, and the risks for humankind are enormous. Blind devotion to number crunching imperils our businesses, our educations, our governments, and our life savings. Too many companies have lost touch with the humanity of their customers, while marginalizing workers with liberal arts-based skills. Contrary to popular thinking, Madsbjerg shows how many of today's biggest success stories stem not from "quant" thinking but from deep, nuanced engagement with culture, language, and history. He calls his method sensemaking.

In this landmark book, Madsbjerg lays out five principles for how business leaders, entrepreneurs, and individuals can use it to solve their thorniest problems. He profiles companies using sensemaking to connect with new customers, and takes readers inside the work process of sensemaking "connoisseurs" like investor George Soros, architect Bjarke Ingels, and others.

Both practical and philosophical, Sensemaking is a powerful rejoinder to corporate groupthink and an indispensable resource for leaders and innovators who want to stand out from the pack.

"Sensemaking: The Power of the Humanities in the Age of the Algorithm" by Christian Madsbjerg explores the importance of human intelligence and intuition in a world increasingly dominated by data and algorithms. Published in 2017, the book argues against the overreliance on big data and scientific approaches, advocating for the integration of humanities-based thinking in decision-making processes.
Madsbjerg contends that humans have become overly dependent on algorithms and data analysis, which can lead to a disregard for the complexity and nuance of human experiences. He highlights the deficiencies and risks associated with this data-centric mindset, emphasizing that blind adherence to numbers and calculations can be detrimental to businesses, education, governments, and personal finances.
Contrary to the prevailing belief that success lies in quantitative thinking, Madsbjerg asserts that meaningful engagement with culture, language, and history is often the driving force behind major achievements. He introduces his own approach called "sensemaking," which involves deep and nuanced understanding of human experiences and contexts.
The book presents five principles that business leaders, entrepreneurs, and individuals can apply to solve complex problems using the sensemaking approach. Madsbjerg profiles companies that have successfully utilized sensemaking to connect with customers and shares insights from notable figures like investor George Soros and architect Bjarke Ingels.
Combining practical advice with philosophical reflections, "Sensemaking" challenges the prevailing corporate groupthink and provides a valuable resource for leaders and innovators seeking to differentiate themselves in a data-driven world. It highlights the significance of incorporating humanities-based thinking in decision-making processes to foster genuine understanding and drive meaningful outcomes.
