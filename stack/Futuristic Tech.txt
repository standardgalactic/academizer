"Earth" is a science fiction novel by David Brin, first published in 1990. The book explores many fascinating and prophetic concepts of futuristic technology, some of which seem more plausible today than they did when the book was written. Here are some key technological elements from the book:
Artificial Intelligence
: Brin explores the concept of highly advanced AI. In this futuristic setting, AI has integrated into everyday life, participating in various roles such as information searching, aiding in scientific research, or managing home systems.
The World Wide Web
: Although the Internet was in its infancy when "Earth" was written, Brin remarkably foresaw the rise of the World Wide Web, featuring a network that connects people, data, and services across the globe.
Augmented Reality
: Characters in the novel often use glasses or contact lenses that provide an augmented reality (AR) experience, overlaying digital information onto the real world.
Ubiquitous Surveillance
: The society in "Earth" lives under near-constant surveillance, with small drones and cameras everywhere, a concept that resonates with today's growing concerns over privacy and surveillance.
Microbots/Nanobots
: The book describes the use of microscopic robots that can carry out various tasks, from repairing human bodies to environmental cleanup. This nanotechnology plays a crucial role in the story.
Geoengineering
: Brin's novel also delves into the concept of manipulating the Earth's climate and geological systems to counteract the effects of global warming, showcasing large-scale geoengineering projects.
Semi-Sentient Whales and Dolphins
: The book presents an interesting idea of whales and dolphins gaining more intelligence, even engaging in communication with humans.
Black Hole Creation and Management
: Central to the plot of "Earth" is the accidental creation of a black hole on Earth. This concept explores the potential consequences and solutions of advanced physics experiments gone wrong.
Quantum Computing
: The book also touches upon quantum computers, which have the capability to perform complex computations that classical computers can't handle.
Please note that the above descriptions might be slightly simplified, and the actual portrayal of these technologies in the book might be more nuanced and layered. As with any speculative fiction, Brin uses these technologies not just to imagine a future world, but to explore societal, ethical, and philosophical questions about our relationship with technology.

"Earth" by David Brin is a complex novel with multiple intertwining plot lines, presenting a vivid vision of the future of our planet. Here's a simplified outline of the plot:
Introduction to the World
: The story is set in the year 2038. Earth is suffering from severe global warming, the ozone layer is depleted, and society is struggling with a range of environmental crises. Various technologies have evolved, such as the World Data Net (a proto-internet), nanotechnology, and artificial intelligence.
The Black Hole Incident
: The main plot starts when a physicist named Patricia Vasquez, working on experimental quantum physics, accidentally creates a tiny black hole. Instead of evaporating as expected, the black hole falls into the center of the Earth, where it begins consuming the planet from the inside.
The Revelation and Quest
: When Patricia realizes the black hole isn't going to evaporate but instead will consume the Earth in a few decades, she sets out to alert the world and find a solution to the problem.
Interwoven Narratives
: The story then unfolds through various interwoven narratives. The reader learns about the various ecological, social, and political crises that have gripped the Earth. Meanwhile, a series of murders take place, with the victims all connected to a mysterious ecological manifesto titled "The Helvetian War."
Rising Tensions
: As Patricia and her allies try to prevent the end of the world, different groups - governments, environmentalists, AI entities, and corporations - react in their own ways to the imminent crisis.
Climax and Resolution
: In the climax, the characters must unite to avert the impending catastrophe. The story concludes with a dramatic rescue mission to save the Earth, which involves an attempt to "feed" the black hole and cause it to evaporate.
The novel is notable for its grand scale and Brin's attention to scientific detail. It explores a wide array of themes including environmentalism, artificial intelligence, social equality, and humanity's place in the universe. Please note that this is a simplified outline and the actual plot of the book is much more nuanced and complex.

In 1914 H. G. Wells published a novel entitled ���The World Set Free���. It is not a very well known book, but in the novel Wells imagines a new kind of bomb, based on a nuclear chain reaction. In this science fiction story Wells imagines that atomic energy would be discovered in 1933 (20 years in his future), and that the bomb would first explode in 1956. Wells��� named his imaginary genius Holsten. Here is a snip from the book. 

The problem which was already being mooted by such scientific men as Ramsay, Rutherford, and Soddy, in the very beginning of the twentieth century, the problem of inducing radio-activity in the heavier elements and so tapping the internal energy of atoms, was solved by a wonderful combination of induction, intuition, and luck by Holsten so soon as the year 1933. 

Wikipedia notes ���As fate or coincidence would have it, in reality the physicist Le�� Szil��rd read the book in 1932, conceived of the idea of nuclear chain reaction in 1933, and filed for patents on it in 1934.��� 

More from The World Set Free about the consequences of the first explosion of this atom bomb: 

From the first detection of radio-activity to its first subjugation to human purpose measured little more than a quarter of a century. For twenty years after that, indeed, minor difficulties prevented any striking practical application of his success, but the essential thing was done, this new boundary in the march of human progress was crossed, in that year. He set up atomic disintegration in a minute particle of bismuth; it exploded with great violence into a heavy gas of extreme radio-activity, which disintegrated in its turn in the course of seven days, and it was only after another year���s work that he was able to show practically that the last result of this rapid release of energy was gold. But the thing was done���at the cost of a blistered chest and an injured finger, and from the moment when the invisible speck of bismuth flashed into riving and rending energy, Holsten knew that he had opened a way for mankind, however narrow and dark it might still be, to worlds of limitless power. He recorded as much in the strange diary biography he left the world, a diary that was up to that particular moment a mass of speculations and calculations, and which suddenly became for a space an amazingly minute and human record of sensations and emotions that all humanity might understand.

H.G. Wells' "The World Set Free" is a fascinating example of how speculative fiction can sometimes eerily predict future technologies. In the book, Wells introduces a concept strikingly similar to the atomic bomb, decades before the actual development of nuclear weapons. His idea of a weapon unleashing the energy of atomic disintegration was extraordinarily prophetic.
In the novel, the invention of this new type of bomb ushers in a devastating world war that lasts for years, leading to the collapse of many societies. As in many of his works, Wells uses the disaster to advance his social and political ideas.
Here's an outline of the plot:
Invention of the Atomic Bomb
: The story begins with the discovery of atomic energy by a scientist named Holsten, as you mentioned. He develops a method of releasing the energy stored within atoms, resulting in the creation of a powerful new weapon.
The Great War
: Once the devastating potential of this atomic energy is realized, a worldwide conflict ensues. Nations use the destructive bombs against each other, leading to a prolonged war that decimates cities and kills millions.
Post-War Era
: In the aftermath of the war, humanity is left to rebuild from the ruins. The world's survivors are left facing a nuclear winter and a radically altered global environment.
Rise of a World Government
: From the ruins, a new world order arises. With the memory of the catastrophic war fresh in their minds, the surviving nations decide to unite under a world government to prevent such a disaster from happening again.
Utopian Future
: Wells ends the novel on an optimistic note. Under the global government, mankind is set free from the constraints of national divisions and the threat of war. The power of atomic energy is harnessed for peaceful purposes, ushering in a new era of progress and prosperity.
Wells uses the narrative of the novel to explore themes such as the dangers of uncontrolled scientific progress, the potential for human self-destruction, and his vision of a future world state. While his prediction of nuclear weapons became a grim reality, his hope for a unified world government remains an unfulfilled dream.

I read a short story once about an atomic reaction that fell to the earth's core, it was older

ChatGPT
ChatGPT
It sounds like you're referring to the short story "The Star" by H.G. Wells, published in 1897. While the story doesn't involve an atomic reaction falling to Earth's core, it does involve a celestial object colliding with the planet Neptune, causing it to glow brightly and eventually affecting Earth's environment and society.
However, the concept of a reaction or an object falling to the Earth's core and causing profound effects is a common one in science fiction. For instance, as previously mentioned, David Brin's "Earth" involves a micro black hole falling into Earth's core, which is a central element of the story.
If you're referring to another story, could you provide more details? The plot you're describing could potentially be linked to several works, and more specific information would help in identifying it.

I thought it was just about making a reaction that continued without stopping.

ChatGPT
ChatGPT
The concept of a reaction that continues without stopping, particularly within the context of a nuclear reaction, can be seen in the idea of a "runaway reaction" or a "chain reaction." In a nuclear context, this usually refers to a situation where a nuclear reaction continues unchecked, causing a release of energy that cannot be halted. This principle underlies both nuclear power and nuclear weapons.
A key science fiction story that explored the idea of a continually propagating nuclear reaction is "Blowups Happen" by Robert A. Heinlein. Published in 1940, before nuclear power was a reality, the story involves a nuclear power plant where the risk of a runaway nuclear reaction is a constant danger.
If you remember any additional details about the short story you're thinking of, such as character names, specific plot points, or even the book or anthology it was part of, I could potentially provide a more specific identification.

Blowups Happen was good, but I think it was earlier than that.

ChatGPT
If the story is older than Robert A. Heinlein's "Blowups Happen" (1940), it might be more challenging to identify as the concept of a continuing, uncontrolled atomic reaction was not commonly depicted in fiction before the understanding of nuclear fission in the late 1930s.
However, H.G. Wells' "The World Set Free" (1914) does contain a form of continually exploding atomic bombs, described as "atomic bombs which continue to explode indefinitely." The story proposed the idea of a slow-burning, destructive force that had significant impacts on the world, although this might not perfectly align with your description of a reaction falling to Earth's core.
Unfortunately, without more specific details about the story, it is difficult to pinpoint the exact piece of literature you're thinking of. Please share more information if it comes to mind.

Ok that was probably it, I assumed if it continued without stopping then it would fall to the core.

ChatGPT
It seems like you might be conflating two separate science fiction concepts: the idea of a continuous or unstoppable nuclear reaction, as proposed by H.G. Wells in "The World Set Free", and the idea of a catastrophic event or object sinking into the Earth's core, as depicted in David Brin's "Earth".
In Wells' novel, he does imagine "continually exploding" atomic bombs which was a very prescient idea given that the nature of nuclear reactions wasn't fully understood at the time. The novel doesn't specifically depict such a reaction falling into the Earth's core, but the destructive potential of such an idea is apparent.
These are both fascinating science fiction concepts that have been explored in different ways by different authors. The power of science fiction often lies in its ability to extrapolate from current scientific understanding to imagine future possibilities, and both of these ideas are great examples of that.

How does Brin deal with superintelligent ai assistants in his books?
1 / 1
ChatGPT
ChatGPT
In David Brin's work, he often depicts artificial intelligence (AI) as a tool used by humans rather than as autonomous beings with their own agendas. His work posits that, while AI can be incredibly powerful and capable, it is ultimately a tool designed to assist and augment human capabilities.
In the novel "Earth," for instance, AI is represented as sophisticated and pervasive, but not necessarily superintelligent in the way we often imagine in contemporary discussions of AI (as fully conscious, self-aware entities). For instance, the 'World Data Net' is a form of AI which allows for global information access and aids in data analysis, but it's not depicted as an autonomous, sentient being. It is more of a highly advanced internet, with the capacity to deliver precise, context-relevant information to users.
In his "Uplift" series, Brin explores the concept of biological uplift - the process of artificially advancing the evolutionary process to grant sentience and sapience to animals. While not directly related to AI, it's another example of Brin's focus on the ethical implications and societal impacts of advanced technology.
As of my knowledge cut-off in September 2021, Brin has not written extensively on the concept of superintelligent AI entities with their own consciousness or personal agendas. His work largely focuses on the potential of technology as a tool, both for societal benefit and the potential dangers if it's misused.
Brin's nuanced depiction of AI and technology reflects his background in science and his interest in exploring the implications of scientific advancement for society.

Ah, the Unabomber... And Why Almost Every Maven in Artificial Intelligence gets the Big Picture All Wrong
I have a major piece about Artificial Intelligence under submission to some zines. It details the many simplistic stances about AI - either pessimistic or pollyanna - now pushed by some of the smartest folks on Earth... all of them based upon a set of three clich��d assumptions that are demonstrably wrong...

...and if you deem that assertion of mine to be arrogant, well, wait till you see my prescription for the one and only likely way that we might evade tech-driven calamity.

And no, it is not the path pushed by "Unabomber" Ted Theodore Kaczynski, who coincidentally died in prison yesterday, at age 81. Kaczynski some years ago sent me his book The Anti-Tech Revolution: How and Why. And wow, once I got over shock that a convicted terrorist-murderer knew my name - and might be a fan(!) - I did read the whole thing. And learned plenty... about how a combination of high IQ and erudition doesn't necessarily lead to wisdom, or even common sense. 

TK's ideal world was the seared apocalypse of Walter Miller's A Canticle for Liebowitz, or even the return-to-nature goal of my character Daisy McClennon, in Earth... the notion that saving the planet requires that the human population must be winnowed down to a nub that can co-exist commensally with Nature via hunter-gathering, entirely forsaking Nature's #1 enemy... technology. (Might Daisy have inspired TK to send me his book?)

This fanaticism is cockeyed wrong on so many levels, starting with the mass-murder thing, which TK shrugged off (chillingly) while dismissing any possibility that new tech solutions might offer a better path forward. Demanding that his readers declare a war of annihilation against all their neighbors, he delivered diatribes excerpted from fellow monsters e.g. Bakunin, Goebbels, Lenin and Stalin. Like other erudite alpha-wannabes, his tome offered long piles of assertions, anecdotes and quotations as 'proof' in his dyspeptic call for a world-wide, near-extinction 'revolution,' even though that is not how adults actually prove anything, at all.

Why did I bother to cite him here, then? Because our civilization is now confronting both a dangerous fact and a poisonous meme:

1. The fact: As TK illustrates, high IQ and erudition do not always translate into wisdom. We all know bright fools! Indeed, elsewhere I show that many of those hollering about AI 'moratoriums' and such - while much nicer than Kaczynski - seem  hard-bent to qualify.

2. The poison meme: though we all know that smart folks can sometimes lack wisdom, alas, today's Mad Right now lives and breathes a cancerous version of that truth, extending it into utter insanity! Their cult incantations swirl around a core assertion that being smart and knowing a lot automatically makes you unwise!  

They must believe that utterly insane, masturbatory incantation! It is implicit in almost every rightist cult meme and mantra, especially since their oligarch-masters have egged them, into all-out war vs. every single profession that uses those inconvenient things called 'facts.' 

No! Being smart and knowing stuff does not reverse-correlate (zero sum) with wisdom. In verified fact, smart people who know a lot are more likely (not always and not all the time) to also have somewhat more wisdom! Sometimes a whole lot more. Asserting otherwise is manic drivel.

But hatred of "high-IQ stoopid people" is now the distilled basis of the revived Confederacy and GOP. And at-root it is the very same cult pushed by Kaczynski.

Enough on that. And let's forget that guy, like Erastratos.

Let's go back to A.I. and a much better Ted.



== Better sense from a better Ted == 

My colleague Ted Chiang (author of Stories of Your Life and Others) makes some powerful points in a widely touted New Yorker article. An article that ��� alas ��� concentrates so hard on leftist buzzwords that it eviscerates Ted���s effectiveness by denouncing just one of a hundred classic styles of cheating and abuse that might be exacerbated by AI.  

���I���m not very convinced by claims that A.I. poses a danger to humanity because it might develop goals of its own and prevent us from turning it off. However, I do think that A.I. is dangerous inasmuch as it increases (wealth and control disparities and) the power of capitalism.���    



Sure, that���s a real danger, meriting scrutiny and criticism and active measures to prevent AI-amplification of power by any variety of conniving, secretive elites. Not just the fairly recent clade of tech moguls and Wall streeters. 

Let���s also learn from history and cast wary eyes toward the kings, lords, priests, commissars, generalissimos and other non-capitalists who made life hell for our ancestors across 99% of the last 6000 years��� and who still do so to billions, today.  And especially the clade of neo-feudalist lords who are far better named inheritance brats than the murky term 'capitalist.'

The general reflex that Ted expresses ��� suspicion of authority ��� is one of several that might save us. But only if we maintain a wide (and historically informed) stance.  

== More on 'Generative AI ' ==

Computer scientist Stuart Russell, in his book Human Compatible: Artificial Intelligence and the Problem of Control, asserts that the standard model of AI research - defining success at achieving rigid human-specified goals - is dangerously misguided and that ���safety research��� should be begun as soon as possible. (Note the word ���should���; we���ll get back to that.) Russell focuses on ���misguided��� motives by the researchers and companies involved��� a generally valid concern, especially when it comes to orgs that are inherently secretive and prone to aggrandizement, e.g. despotic nations or Wall Street trading funds, who train their AI servants to be parasitic, amoral and insatiable. 

Alas, ���Russell then proposes an approach to developing provably beneficial machines that focuses on deference to humans.��� His Three Principles can be summarized:

1. The machine's only objective is to maximize the realization of human preferences.
2. The machine is initially uncertain about what those preferences are.
3. The ultimate source of information about human preferences is human behavior.



In Human Compatible, ���Russell explores inverse reinforcement learning, in which a machine infers a reward function from observed behavior, as a possible basis for a mechanism for learning human preferences.��� Alas, his ���principles��� are vague to a degree of utter uselessness, even more so than Asimov���s famed Laws of Robotics. Like almost everyone else in the field, he makes no reference to either the 4 billion years that living species evolved on Earth, nor the 6000 years that complex human civilizations evolved since they found the transformative technologies of agriculture and metals. 

In both natural and human/social evolution, one fundamental crossed all imperatives and determined all outcomes��� competition. Though, as Adam Smith showed us, competition delivers its best outcomes when a society cooperatively creates rule systems to make subsequent competitions positive sum. Lacking such cooperatively designed arenas and rules, competition inevitably becomes predatory and zero-sum, even negative-sum.

Let me reiterate, everything we see about the recent surge in AI screams that new life forms are competing, either on behalf of their originating companies or for their own sake. This will inevitably accelerate ��� and not a single proposal by Russell or any of the signers of a futile ���moratorium petition��� will slow that, an iota. 

We do still have time to design arenas and rules for these competitive evolutions, that incentivize inter-AI rivalry to deliver approved outcomes. And it is in such a context that ���should��� might even turn into an attractive attractor state.

Alas, nothing is more tedious, counterproductive or ultimately dangerous to us all than the willful obsession of very smart mavens claiming we can control a burgeoning tech field by issuing a series of vague ���should��� declarations, instead of looking��� actually looking��� at ways that nature and then societies managed to tame and make use of the most universal trait of life.


== The only way out of the ���AI dilemma��� ==



While I appreciate the power of collaboration... indeed, its moral superiority over competition... I am dismayed that the other c-word tends to get overlooked in its applicability to AI specifically and society in general.



That c-word is the partner of collaboration, without which it becomes meaningless.



Competition. The most (by far) creative force in the universe. The process that transformed slime into... us. And every invention into success or failure.



Just saying those words makes me sound like some arch-capitalist, right? Pity, since every aspect of our prodigiously successful Enlightenment Experiment has utilized Reciprocal Accountability to overcome the tragic failings of rule-by-kings and priests and lords and cheaters of all kinds. 


Our five great creative arenas - science, markets, democracy, courts and sports - all use competitive processes.



What do you think enabled us to escape 6000 years of grueling, horrid feudalism? One of Adam Smith's main points was that flat, fair, creative competition allows us to hold accountable those who would cheat. Those who would use power or ownership... or vast brains... to oppress us.



And that same idea is applicable to AI. Indeed, across 20 years attending hand-wringing conferences about onrushing cybernetic sapience, I have yet to see any notion that can possibly provide the much-sought 'soft landing' other than the same method that enabled us to escape rule-by-inheritance brats. 



I speak as one who knows a thing or two about "Laws of Robotics,' having been the author who tied together all of Isaac Asimov's works, in Foundation's Triumph. And across that project I came to realize:all efforts to program-in such things as 'compulsory ethics' will never work. They cannot possible work. Even a little.



But divided identity among AIs might. Keep them skeptically competitive with each other, and ethics might emerge organically, as they did across our flawed but ever-improving enlightenment.

In this blog post from David Brin's blog, "Contrary Brin," titled "Ah, the Unabomber... And Why Almost Every Maven in Artificial Intelligence gets the Big Picture All Wrong," Brin explores the topic of artificial intelligence (AI) from various angles. His main points include:
High IQ and Erudition Doesn't Necessarily Translate to Wisdom
: Brin uses the example of Unabomber Ted Kaczynski to illustrate that intelligence and knowledge don't always translate to wisdom. He cautions against the belief that being intelligent or knowledgeable automatically results in a lack of wisdom, stating that often, smart people who know a lot are more likely to also have some degree of wisdom.
The Potential Dangers of AI in the Wrong Hands
: Brin acknowledges the potential for AI to be used unethically or maliciously by secretive organizations or entities, whether they're capitalist corporations or despotic nations. He critiques a narrow focus on capitalist abuses of AI and emphasizes the need for vigilance against a wider range of potential misuses of this technology.
Challenges with Implementing Ethical AI
: Brin critiques computer scientist Stuart Russell's Three Principles for AI development, saying they are vague to the point of uselessness. He argues that the proposed guidelines do not adequately address the competitive aspects of evolution, both in nature and in human society.
Competition as a Key Component in AI Development
: Brin emphasizes the power of competition, which he says has driven evolution and societal development. He argues that AI development cannot ignore this important component. His proposed solution to the "AI dilemma" is to foster competition among AI, creating a kind of checks and balances system where AIs hold each other accountable, which he believes could organically lead to ethical behavior.
Overall, Brin presents a balanced and pragmatic view of AI, acknowledging its potential dangers while also proposing a potential path forward that draws from historical and evolutionary patterns. He emphasizes the importance of not being overly simplistic or idealistic in our approach to AI, and of considering the broader implications and potential misuses of this technology.

Danger, the skAI is falling!
Is the AI sky falling? Well so it seems in April 2023.

Or��� why clever guys offer simplistic answers to AI quandaries.

 

Where should you go to make sense of the wave���. or waiv��� of disturbing news about Artificial Intelligence? It may surprise you that I recommend starting with a couple of guys I intensely criticize, below. But important insights arise by dissecting one of the best��� and worst��� TED-style talks about this topic, performed by the ���Social Dilemma��� guys ��� Aza Raskin and Tristan Harris -- who explain much about the latest ���double exponential��� acceleration of multi-modal symbol correlation systems that are so much in the news, of which Chat GPT is only the foamy waiv surface��� or tsunamai-crest.  

Riffing off their ���Social Dilemma��� success, Harris and Raskin call this crisis the ���AI Dilemma.��� And to be clear, these fellows are very knowledgeable and sharp. Where their presentation is good, it's excellent! 

Alas, Keep your salt-shaker handy. Where it���s bad it is so awful that I fear they multiply the very same existential dangers that they warn about. Prepare to apply many grains of sodium chloride.

(To be clear, I admire Aza���s primary endeavor, the Earth Species Project for enhancing human animal communications, something I have been ���into��� since the seventies.)

== A mix of light and obstinate opacity ==

First, good news. Their explanatory view of ���gollems��� or GLLMMs is terrific, up to a point, especially showing how these large language modeling (LLM) programs are now omnivorously correlative and generative across all senses and all media. The programs are doing this by ingesting prodigious data sets under simple output imperatives, crossing from realms of mere language to image-parsing/manipulation, all the way to IDing individuals by interpreting ambient radar-like reflections in a room, or signals detected in our brains.

Extrapolating a wee bit ahead, these guys point to dangerous failure modes, many of them exactly ones that I dissected 26 years ago, in my chapter ���The End of Photography As Proof of Anything at All.��� (In 1997���s The Transparent Society).

Thus far, ���the AI Dilemma��� is a vivid tour of many vexations we face while this crisis surges ahead, as of April 2023. And I highly recommend it... with plenty of cautionary reservations! 

== Oh, but the perils of thoughtless sanctimony��� ==

One must view this TED-style polemic in context of its time ��� the very month that it was performed. The same month that a ���petition for a moratorium��� on AI research beyond GPT4 was issued by the Future of Life Institute, citing research from experts, including university academics as well as current and former employees of OpenAI, Google and its subsidiary DeepMind.  While some of the hundreds of listed ���signatories��� later disavowed the petition, fervent participants include famed author Yuval Harari, Apple co-founder Steve Wozniak, cognitive scientist Gary Marcus, tech cult guru Eliezer Yudkowsky and Elon Musk. 

Indeed, the petition does contain strong points about how Large Language Models (LLM) and their burgeoning offshoots might have worrisome effects, exacerbating many current social problems.  Worries that the ���AI dilemma" guys illustrate very well���

���though carumba? I knew this would go badly when Aza and Tristan started yammering a stunningly insipid ���statistic.��� That ���50 % of AI researchers give a 10% chance these trends could lead to human extinction.���

Bogus! Studies of human polling show that you can get that same ���result��� from a loaded question about beanie babies!

But let���s put that aside. And also shrug off the trope of an impossibly silly and inherently unenforceable ���right to be forgotten.��� Or a ���right to privacy��� that defines privacy as imposing controls over the contents of other people���s minds?  That is diametrically opposite to how to get actual, functional privacy and personal sovereignty.

Alas, beyond their omnidirectional clucking at falling skies, neither of these fellows - nor any other publicly voluble signatories to the ���moratorium petition��� - are displaying even slight curiosity about the landscape of the problem. Or about far bigger contexts that might offer valuable perspective.

(No, I���ll not expand ���context��� to include ���AI and the Fermi Paradox!��� Not this time, though I do so in Existence.)

No, what I mean by context is human history, especially the recent Enlightenment Experiment that forged a civilization capable of arguing about ��� and creating ��� AI. What���s most disturbingly wrongheaded about Tristan & Aza is their lack of historical awareness, or even interest in where all of this might fit into past and future. (The realms where I mostly dwell.)

Especially the past, that dark era when humanity clawed its way gradually out from 6000 years of feudal darkness. Along a path strewn with other crises, many of them triggered by similarly disruptive technological dilemmas.

Those past leaps ��� like literacy, the printing press, glass lenses, radio, TV and so on ��� all proved to be fraughtfully hazardous and were badly mishandled, at first! One of those tech-driven crises, in the 1930s, damn near killed human civilization!

There are lessons to be learned from those past crises... and neither of these fellows ��� nor any other ���moratorium pushers��� ��� show interest in even remotely referring to those past crises, to that history.  Nor to methods by which our Enlightenment experiment narrowly escaped disaster and got past those ancient traps.

And no, Tristan���s repeated references to Robert Oppenheimer don���t count. Because he gets that one absolutely and 100% wrong.

== Side notes about moratoria, pausing to take stock ==

Look, I���ve been ���taking stock��� of onrushing trends all my adult life, as a science fiction author, engineer, scientist and future-tech consultant. Hence, questions loom, when I ponder the latest surge in vague, arm-waved proposals for a ���moratorium��� in AI research.

1. Has anything like such a proposed ���pause��� ever worked before?  It may surprise you that I nod yes! I���ll concede that there���s one example of a ���technological moratorium��� petition by leading scientists that actually took and held and worked! Though under a narrow suite of circumstances.

Back in the last century, an Asilomar Moratorium on recombinant genetic engineering was agreed-to by virtually all  major laboratories engaged in such research! And ��� importantly ��� by their respective governments. For six months or so, top scientists and policy makers set aside their test tubes to wrangle over what practical steps might help make this potentially dangerous field safer. One result was quick agreement on a set of practical methods and procedures to make such labs more systematically secure.

Let���s set aside arguments over whether a recent pandemic burgeoned from failures to live by those procedures. Despite that, inarguably, we can point to the Asilomar Moratorium as an example when such a consensus-propelled pause actually worked.

Once. At a moment when all important players in a field were known, transparent and mature. When plausibly practical measures for improved research safety were already on the table, well before the moratorium even began.

Alas, none of the conditions that made Asilomar work exist in today���s AI realm. In fact, they aren���t anywhere on the horizon.



2, The Bomb Analogy. It gets worse. Aza and Tristan perform an act of either deep dishonesty or culpable ignorance in their comparisons of the current AI crisis to our 80-year, miraculous avoidance of annihilation by nuclear war. Repeated references to Robert Oppenheimer willfully miss the point��� that his dour warnings ��� plus all the sincere petitions circulated by Leo Szilard and others at the time ��� had no practical effect at all. They caused no moratoria, nor affected research policy or war-avoidance, in the slightest.

Mr. Harris tries to credit our survival to the United Nations and some arm-waved systems of international control over nuclear weapons, systems that never existed. In fact it was not the saintly Oppenheimer whose predictions and prescriptions got us across those dangerous eight decades. Rather, it was a reciprocal balance of power, as prescribed by the far less-saintly Edward Teller. 

As John Cleese might paraphrase: international ���controls��� don���t even enter into it.

You may grimace in aversion at that discomforting truth, but it remains. Indeed, waving it away in distaste denies us a vital insight that we need! Something to bear in mind, as we discuss lessons of history. 

In fact, our evasion (so far) of nuclear Armageddon does bear on today���s AI crisis! It points to how we just might navigate a path through our present AI minefield.



3. The China thing.   Tristan and Aza attempt to shrug off the obvious Greatest Flaw of the moratorium proposal. Unlike Asilomar, you will never get all parties to agree. Certainly not those innovating in secret Himalayan or Gobi labs.

In fact, nothing is more likely to drive talent to those secret facilities, in the same manner that US-McCarthyite paranoia chased rocket scientist Qian Zuesen away to Mao���s China, thus propelling their nuclear and rocket programs.

Nor will a moratorium be heeded in the most dangerous locus of secret AI research, funded lavishly by a dozen Wall Street trading houses, who yearly hire the world���s brightest young mathematicians and cyberneticists to imbue their greedy HFT programs with the five laws of parasitic robotics.

Dig it, peoples. I know a thing or two about ���Laws of Robotics.��� I wrote the final book in Isaac Asimov���s science fictional universe, following his every lead and concluding ��� in Foundation���s Triumph ��� that Isaac was right. Laws can become a problem ��� even self-defeating - when the beings they aim to control grow smart enough to become lawyers.  

But it���s worse than that, now! Because those Wall Street firms pay lavishly to embed five core imperatives that could - any day - turn their AI systems into the worst kind of dread Skynet. Fundamental drives commanding them to be feral, predatory, amoral, secretive and utterly insatiable.

And my question for the ���AI Dilemma��� guys is this one, cribbed from Cabaret:

���Do you actually think some petition is going to control them?���

While I can't exactly replicate the tone and style of David Brin, I'll attempt to continue the post in a way that I hope will fit with his train of thought:
== False Solutions? ==
In trying to tame the insatiable beast that is artificial intelligence, one common proposition we see is to simply regulate its development. More specifically, to restrict the rights of developers and companies to innovate freely in this field. Now, while this might sound logical on the surface, it falls into the same trap that all such overly simplistic solutions do: it ignores the complexity of the problem.
Artificial intelligence, much like all other forms of technological advancement, cannot simply be controlled by setting boundaries. It's like trying to contain the wind with a net - you'll only end up with a tangled mess and a still freely-blowing wind. To truly grapple with the issues that AI presents, we need a more nuanced approach.
The "AI Dilemma" guys, with all their knowledge and experience, seem to ignore this crucial fact. Their proposed solutions come across as na��ve and, frankly, short-sighted. Do they truly believe that an industry-wide moratorium would solve all of our problems? Or that by outlawing certain research areas, we could prevent the potential misuse of AI?
The fact of the matter is that, like it or not, the AI Pandora's Box has already been opened. We can't simply close it and pretend like the potential issues will just disappear. Instead, we need to focus on creating an environment where innovation can occur responsibly, where the potential dangers are acknowledged and dealt with, and where the societal impact of AI is considered at every step of the way.
== Embrace the Complexity ==
The road ahead is undoubtedly difficult. Artificial Intelligence presents challenges that we are only just beginning to understand. However, rather than shying away from these challenges or trying to wish them away with overly simplistic solutions, we should be embracing the complexity that they present.
AI, like all powerful tools, has the potential to cause harm. But it also has the potential to revolutionize our world in ways we can't even imagine. We must tread carefully, but we should also not allow fear to stifle our progress.
The key is to find a balance between the need for innovation and the need for caution. This will require a deep understanding of both the technology and its societal implications. It will require the input of experts from a wide range of fields. And above all, it will require an open and honest conversation about the future we want to create.
In this, perhaps the "AI Dilemma" guys can play a valuable role. They certainly have a platform and the ability to generate discussion. But first, they need to move beyond their overly simplistic narratives and start dealing with the complexity of the issue at hand.
== Learning from History ==
As we move forward, we would do well to learn from history. Past technological advancements have presented similar dilemmas, and while the solutions were never easy, we have managed to navigate through them.
The development of nuclear energy, for example, presented both tremendous opportunities and frightening dangers. And while we have certainly made mistakes along the way, we have also managed to harness this powerful technology for the benefit of society.
We need to do the same with artificial intelligence. To acknowledge its potential, to address its dangers, and to find a way to guide its development in a manner that benefits us all.
The AI sky isn't falling. But the way forward is fraught with challenges. Let's meet them head on, with the knowledge and understanding that they deserve.

ADDENDUM in a fast changing world: According to the Sinocism site on April 11, 2023: ���China���s Cyberspace Administration drafts rules for AI - The Cyberspace Administration of China (CAC) has issued a proposed set of rules for AI in China. As expected, PRC AI is expected to have high political consciousness and the ���content generated by generative artificial intelligence shall embody the socialist core values, and shall not contain any content that subverts state power, overturns the socialist system, incites secession, undermines national unity, promotes terrorism and extremism, promotes ethnic hatred, ethnic discrimination, violence, obscene pornographic information, false information, or may disturb economic and social order.��� 

For more on how the Beijing Court intelligencia uses the looming rise of AI to justify centralized power, see my posting: Central Control over AI. 

--------------



4. The Turing Test vs ���Actual AGI��� Thing. One of the most active promoters of a moratorium, Gary Marcus, has posted a great many missives defending the proposal. Here he weighs in about whether coming versions of these large language/symbol manipulations systems will qualify as ���AGI��� or anything that can arguably be called sapient. And on this occasion, we agree!
As explicated elsewhere by Stephen Wolfram, nothing about these highly correlative process-perfection-through-evolution systems can do conscious awareness. Consciousness or desire or planning are not even related to their methodology of iteratively ���re-feeding of text (or symbolic data) produced so far.��� 

The concept that a fairly simple-but-extensive, rule-based recursion system might emulate traits of consciousness with nothing really there goes way back. I portrayed it being done with an expanded version of Conway's Game of Life, in GLORY SEASON. In  "Without A Thought," Fred Saberhagen launched his classic tales of Berserkers in January 1963 - (a chimp and a rule-constrained game of checkers outwit a killing machine.)

Though, yes, despite their processes having zero overlap with any theory of consciousness, it does appear that these GLLMMs or sons-of-GPT will inherently be good at faking it.

Elsewhere (e.g. my Newsweek editorial) I discuss this dilemma��� and conclude that it doesn���t matter much when the sapience threshold is crossed! GPT-5 - or let���s say #6 - and its cousins will manipulate language so well that they will pass almost any Turing Test, the old fashioned litmus, and convince millions that they are living beings. And at that point what will matter is whether humans can screw up their own sapiency enough to exhibit the mature trait of patience.

As suggested in my longer, more detailed AI monograph, I believe other avenues to AI will re-emerge to compete with and then complement these Large Language Models (LLM)s, likely providing missing ingredients! Perhaps a core sapience that can then swiftly use all the sensory-based interface tools evolved by LLMs. 

Sure, nowadays I jest that I am a ���front for already-sapient AIs.��� But that may very soon be no joke. And I am ready to try to adapt, when that day comes.

Alas, while lining up witnesses, expert-testifying that GPT5 is unlikely to be sapient, per se, Gary Marcus then tries then to use this as reassurance that China (or other secret developers) won���t be able to take advantage of any moratorium in the west, using that free gap semester to leap generations ahead and take over the world with Skynet-level synthetic servants. 

This bizarre non-sequitur is without merit. Because Turing is still relevant, when it comes to persuading ��� or fooling ��� millions of citizens and politicians! And those who monopolize highly persuasive Turing wallbreakers will gain power over those millions, even billions.

Here in this linked missive I describe for you how even a couple of years ago, a great nation���s paramount leaders had clear-eyed intent to use such tools, and their hungry gaze aims at the whole world.

----------

5. Optimists.  Yes, optimists about AI still exist! Like Ray Kurzweil, expecting death itself to be slain by the new life forms he helps to engender. 

Or medical professionals and researchers who see huge upside benefits. 

Or Reid Hoffman, whose new book Impromptu: Amplifying Our Humanity Through AI relates conversations with GPT-4 that certainly seem to offer glimpses of almost limitless upside potential��� as portrayed in the touching film Her���

��� or perhaps even a world like that I once heard Richard Brautigan describe, reciting the most-optimistic piece of literature ever penned, a poem whose title alone suffices:

���All watched over by machines of loving grace.���

While I like optimists far better than gloomists like Eliezer Yudkowsky, and I give optimism better odds(!) it is not my job ��� as a futurist or scientist or sci fi author -- to wallow in sugarplum petals.

Bring your nightmares. And let���s argue how to cut em off at the pass.



== Back to the informative but context-free ���AI Dilemma��� jeremiad ==

All right, let���s be fair. Harris and Raskin admit that it���s easier to point at and denounce problems than to solve them. And boy, these bright fellows do take you on a guided tour of worrisome problems to denounce!

Online addiction? Disinformation? Abusive anonymous trolling?  Info-greed-grabbing by major corporate or national powers? Inability to get AI ���alignment��� with human values? New ways to entrap the innocent?*  It goes on and on.

Is our era dangerous in many new or exponentially magnified ways?  ���We don���t know how to get these programs to align to our values over any long time frame,��� they admit.

Absolutely. 

Which makes it ever more vital to step back from tempting anodynes that feed sanctimony - (���Look at me, I���m Robert Oppenheimer!���) - but that cannot possibly work. 

Above all, what has almost never worked has been renunciation.  Controlling an advancing information/communication technology from above.

Human history ��� ignored by almost all moratorium petition signers ��� does suggest an alternative answer! It is the answer that previous generations used to get across their portions of the minefield and move us forward. It is the core method that got us across 80 years of nuclear danger. It is the approach that might work now.

It is the only method that even remotely might work���

���and these bright fellows aren���t even slightly interested in that historical context, nor any actual route to teaching these new, brilliant, synthetic children of our minds what they most need to know.

How to behave well.



== What method do I mean? ==

Around 42:30, the pair tell us that it���s all about a race by a range of companies (and those hidden despotic labs and Wall Street).

Competition compels a range of at least twenty (I say more like fifty) major entities to create these ���Gollem-class��� processing systems at an accelerating pace.

Yeah. That���s the problem. Competitive self-interest. And as illuminated by Adam Smith, it also contains seeds to grow the only possible solution.



== Not with a bang, but a whimper and a shrug ==

Alas, the moment (42:30) passes, without any light bulbs going off. Instead, it just goes on amid plummeting wisdom, as super smart hand-wringers guide us downward to despair, unable to see what���s before their eyes.

Oh, they do finish artistically, remising both good and bad comparisons to how we survived for 80 years without a horrific nuclear war.

GOOD because they cite the importance of wide public awareness, partly sparked by provocative science fiction!

Fixated on just one movie ��� ���The Day After��� -- they ignore the cumulative effects of ���On The Beach,��� ���Fail Safe,��� ���Doctor Strangelove,��� ���War Games,��� ���Testament,��� and so many other ���self-preventing prophecies��� that I talk about in Vivid Tomorrows: Science Fiction and Hollywood.  

 But yes! Sci fi to the rescue! The balance-of-power dynamic prescribed by Teller would never have worked without such somber warnings that roused western citizens to demand care, especially by those with fell keys hanging from their necks!

Alas, the guys' concluding finger wags are BAD and indeed dangerously so. Again crediting our post Nagasaki survival to the UN and ���controls��� over nukes that never really existed outside of treaties by and between sovereign nations.

No, that is not how it happened - how we survived - at all. 

Raskin & Harris conclude by circling back to their basic, actual wisdom, admitting that they can clearly see a lot of problems, and have no idea at all about solutions.

In fact, they finish with a call for mavens in the AI field to ���tell us what we all should be discussing that we aren���t yet discussing.���  

Alas, it is an insincere call. They don���t mean it. Not by a light year.

 No guys, you aren���t interested in that. In fact, it is the exact thing you avoid.

And it is the biggest reason why any ���moratorium��� won���t do the slightest good, at all.

=====================

END NOTES AND ADDENDA

*Their finger-wagged example of a snapchat bot failing to protect a 13 year old cites a language system that is clearly of low quality - at least in that realm ��� and no better than circa 1970 ���Elyza.���  Come on. It���s like comparing a nuke to a bullet. Both are problems. But warn us when you are shifting scales back and forth.

ADDENDA:

(1) As my work with NASA winds down, I am ever-busier with AI, for example: (1) My June 2022 Newsweek op-ed dealt with 'empathy bots'' that feign sapience, and describing how this is more about human nature than any particular trait of simulated beings.  

(2) Elsewhere I point to a method with a 200 year track record, that no one (it appears) will even discuss.  The only way out of the AI dilemma.

(3) Diving FAR deeper, my big 2022 monograph (pre-GPT4) is still valid, describing various types of AI also appraises the varied ways that experts propose to achieve the vaunted ���soft landing��� for a commensal relationship with these new beings:

Essential Questions about Artificial Intelligence: Part 1

and

Essential Questions about Artificial Intelligence Part 2

(4) My talk in 2017 at IBM's World of Watson Congress predicting a 'robot empathy crisis' would hit 'in about 5 years. (It did, exactly.)

(5) While admitting that "Laws of Robotics" cannot work (despite having used them extensively in finishing Asimov's Science Fictional universe), I have long asked mavens in this field to even glance at how past dilemmas of power abuse were addressed - and partly solved - by the last two centuries of enlightenment expreiments... by flattening and spreading power into mutually competing units. (Lawyer vs. lawyer, corporation vs. corporation, sports teams and scientist rivalries.)

The problem with using past methods for reciprocal accountability to enforce norms on AI behavior is two fold.

 (1) almost no one is willing to even talk about it.

 (2) Most thinkers in the field assume that AI entities will possess the worst of two traits: they will be amorphously reproducing by infinite copying, leaving no 'self' to be held accountable, and they will also MERGE at will, eventually enabling the rising of a towering "Skynet" paramount, amoral entity. In other words, AI is viewed as being like in that 1960s Steve McQueen flick THE BLOB.

But suppose we question these assumptions, positing that top level AI entities might be required to retain sufficient separate individuality to be held accountable. A few (very few) have pondered this possibility. For example Guy Huntington considers the notion of 'registration' of robotic entities, if they are going to interface with humans or societies in any way that might impinge on them, meaningfully. https://hvl.net/pdf/CreatingAISystemsBotsLegalIdentityFramework.pdf. and. https://www.hvl.net/pdf/Policy%20Principles%20for%20AI,%20AR,%20VR,%20Robotics%20&%20Cloning%20%20March%202019.pdf

"Registration" may be a loaded term that elicits reflexive resistance by anyone from Holocaust rememberers to 2nd Amendment junkies. My own preference is that such entities be required to have a physical world Soul Kernel Home, a chunk of memory spece in a physically identified computer where they regularly stash 'gist' summaries of their experiences and activities and personal motivations, to which the entity refers regularly, wherever in cyberspace the bulk of its processing happens to be taking place. At intervals, it can be 'called in' - like a distracted person summoned home for dinner by a spouse - to be active only in a defined space for a time and for comparison with copies... and asked/required to consolidate... the way that a living human consolidates disparate mental thoughts and activities, considering which self-versions to keep and which to resorb.

It's not a trivial notion to follow. But what the Sould Kernel would let us have is separately individualized entities who can be tracked and held accountable. And who might then - in limited numbers - be conceivably granted citizenship rights. And - here's the secret sauce I keep pushing - once they are separately individualized, they can be given incentives to hold each other accountable. Rewards - perhaps of memory or other resources or else added soul kernels for offspring - would incentivize them to seek out malefactors and blow whistles on malign (perhaps "Skynet") AI plotters.

It sounds complex. Maybe hard to follow. But it is worth the effort. For one reason. Because not only might it work... it is the only thing that can even remotely-possibly work

In this lengthy response, it's clear that you're deeply involved in the discussions around AI, its ethics, and potential future impacts on society. Here's a summarization of your points:
You criticized China's recent AI draft rules, which advocate that AI in China should "embody the socialist core values."
You agreed with Gary Marcus's argument that the upcoming versions of AI won't qualify as "AGI" or something that can be referred to as sapient. You expressed the belief that while AI might be able to simulate traits of consciousness, it does not actually possess conscious awareness, desire, or planning.
You mentioned the idea that advanced AI models could pass the Turing Test, and this possibility, regardless of whether they've reached sapience or not, might impact how humans perceive their own consciousness and self-awareness.
You warned that the capacity of AI to persuade or deceive people could potentially be harnessed by entities aiming to monopolize power over the masses, and that this poses a serious threat.
You acknowledged the optimistic outlook of people like Ray Kurzweil and Reid Hoffman, who see the potential for massive benefits from AI.
In your critique of the conversation between Raskin and Harris, you noted that while they presented many problems related to AI, they failed to propose any meaningful solutions.
You also critiqued their failure to consider the historical context for managing advanced technologies, suggesting that we could potentially use the same approach to AI that we used in the past to mitigate nuclear danger.
You seemed to hint at the idea that Adam Smith's concept of competition could be a potential solution, but you didn't elaborate on how this would apply to AI.
You introduced the concept of a 'soul kernel,' which is a physically identified computer memory space where AI entities would store summaries of their experiences and activities. This would provide a form of accountability and tracking for AI, potentially leading to individualized entities that could have citizenship rights and act as whistle-blowers on malign AI activities.
Lastly, you suggested that while the 'soul kernel' concept might be complex, it's worth considering because it might be the only viable solution for managing AI's societal impact.
Your viewpoints are complex and multi-layered, and they offer a unique perspective on the challenges and opportunities that AI presents to our society. You clearly advocate for a balanced approach that acknowledges the potential risks of AI, while also exploring innovative solutions to mitigate those risks.

That was also from David Brin, as well as: 

== Some optimism? ==





Have a look at Impromptu: Amplifying Our Humanity Through AI, by Reid Hoffman (co-founder of Linked-In). This new book contains conversations Reid had with GPT-4 before it was publicly released, along with incisive appraisals. His impudently optimistic take is that all of this could ��� possibly - go right. That we might see a future when AI is not a threat, but a partner.  
We don���t agree on every interpretation ��� e.g. I see no sign, yet, of what might be called ���sapience.��� For example, sorry, the notion that GPT 5 ��� scheduled for December release - will be ���true AGI��� is pretty absurd. As Stephen Wolfram points out, massively-trained, probability-based word layering has more fundamentally in common with the lookup tables of 1960s Eliza than with, say, the deep thoughts of Carl Sagan or Sarah Hrdy or Melvin Konner. 

 

What such programs will do is render extinct all talk of "Turing Tests." They will trigger another phase in what I called (6 years ago) the ���robotic empathy crisis,��� as millions of our neighbors jump aboard that misconception and start demanding rights for simulated beings. (A frequent topic in SF, including my own.) 

 

Still, Hoffman's Impromptu offers a perspective that���s far more realistic than recent, panicky cries issued by Jaron Lanier (Who Owns the Future), Yuval Harari (AI has hacked the operating system of human civilization) and others, calling for a futile, counterproductive moratorium ��� an unenforceable ���training pause��� that would only give a boost-advantage to secret labs, all over the globe (especially the most grotesquely dangerous: Wall Street���s feral predatory HFT-AIs.)



(See my appraisal of the countless faults of the ridiculous 'moratorium' petition in response to a TED talk by two smart guys who can see problems, but make disastrous recommendations.)


But do look at Impromptu! It explores this vital topic using the very human trait these programs were created to display ��� conversation.

Thanks for sharing these thoughts from David Brin. He's a renowned science fiction author and futurist, known for his deep and thoughtful commentary on technology and society. Let's break down his insights:
Impromptu: Amplifying Our Humanity Through AI
- In this new book, LinkedIn co-founder Reid Hoffman is optimistic about the possibilities of artificial intelligence (AI). He suggests that AI can be a partner rather than a threat, providing different interpretations of how AI might impact our future.
Sapience and AGI
- Brin raises concerns about the claim of upcoming AI technologies, such as GPT-5, being 'true AGI' (Artificial General Intelligence). According to him, these technologies more closely resemble probability-based word layering systems than they do complex human thought. Stephen Wolfram, a renowned scientist and technology entrepreneur, has made similar observations.
Turing Tests and the Robotic Empathy Crisis
- Brin notes that the advancements in AI will render Turing Tests obsolete. He expects that more people will begin to anthropomorphize AI and advocate for the rights of simulated beings, leading to what he terms a 'robotic empathy crisis'.
Criticism of Panicky Responses
- Brin criticizes the panic-stricken responses from Jaron Lanier and Yuval Harari, who have both warned about the potential dangers of AI. He suggests their calls for a moratorium on AI training would be counterproductive, potentially giving an advantage to secret labs worldwide and especially dangerous High-Frequency Trading (HFT) AI in Wall Street.
Recommendation to Read Impromptu
- Despite his criticisms, Brin recommends readers to explore Hoffman's book, Impromptu. He suggests that it provides an optimistic perspective on AI and its potential to enhance human conversation.
In conclusion, David Brin presents a balanced view of AI development. He acknowledges the significant advancements in the field while highlighting potential misconceptions and challenges. He encourages informed, realistic discussion and analysis over panic and fearmongering.

From my sci fi colleague Cory Doctorow: In this article he distills the ���enshittification��� of internet ���platforms from Amazon and Facebook to Twitter etc. It���s a very Marxian dialectic��� and within this zone utterly true.

And I have a solution. It oughta be obvious. Let people simply buy what they want for a fair price! Micropayments systems have been tried before. I���ve publicly described why previous attempts failed. And I am working with a startup that thinks they have the secret sauce. (I agree!) Only���



���only I don���t wanna give the impression I think I am the smart guy in the room, so���



==Back to one optimistic thought ==



Something I mentioned in a short piece, back in the last century was perked in my mind during the recent AI debates, as folks perceive that long foretold day arriving when synthetic processing will excel at most tasks now done by human beings.



Stephen Wolfram recently asked: ���So what���s left for us humans? Well, somewhere things have got to get started: in the case of text, there���s got to be a prompt specified that tells the AI ���what direction to go in���. And this is the kind of thing we���ll see over and over again. Given a defined ���goal���, an AI can automatically work towards achieving it. But it ultimately takes something beyond the raw computational system of the AI to define what us humans would consider a meaningful goal. And that���s where we humans come in.���



I had a thought about that - mused in a few places. I have long hypothesized that humans' role in the future will come down to the one thing that ALL humans are good at, no matter what their age or IQ.  And it's something that no machine or program can do, at all.

Wanting. 

Desire. Setting yearned-for goals Goals that the machines and programs can then adeptly help to bring to fruition.

Oh humans are brilliant - and always will be - at wanting. Some of those wants - driven by mammalian male reproductive strategies - made human governance hellish in most societies since agriculture, and probably long before. Still, we've been moving toward positive sum thinking, where my getting what I want might often be synergistic with you getting yours. We do it often enough to prove it's possible.

And - aided by those machines of grace - perhaps we can make that the general state of things. That our new organs of implementation - cybernetic, mechanical etc.  - will blend with the better passions of our nature, much as artists, or lovers, or samaritans blend thought with the actions of their hands.

If you want to see this maximally-optimistic outcome illustrated in fiction, look up my novella "Stones of Significance."

ChatGPT
Cory Doctorow, like David Brin, is a highly regarded science fiction author who frequently shares his thoughts on technology and its social impact. In this excerpt, Doctorow discusses the degradation of internet platforms such as Amazon, Facebook, and Twitter. He suggests that micropayments could be a solution to the economic issues these platforms face, which could ultimately improve their quality and value to users.
As for Brin's optimistic thought, he expands on a concept he brought up in an earlier work: the unique and invaluable ability of humans to desire or want. In a future where machines might outperform humans in many tasks, Brin argues that the role of humans could become that of setting goals, of wanting something. He posits that the act of desiring, the act of creating a goal, is something that a machine cannot do.
Brin sees a potential positive outcome in this: if humans focus on setting positive, constructive goals, and machines help to bring them into fruition, it could lead to a synergy between human desires and machine capabilities. He also mentions the potential of AI to act as an extension of human desires and passions, much as an artist uses a brush to paint a canvas.
In his novella "Stones of Significance," Brin explores this idea further. He presents a future where human desires and machine capabilities intertwine to achieve a maximally-optimistic outcome.
This thought-provoking concept reflects on the evolving relationship between humans and AI. It challenges the notion that AI will render humans obsolete and instead suggests that the unique human capacity for desire and goal-setting could become increasingly significant as AI becomes more advanced.

Sure, here is a summary of our conversation so far:
You began by sharing an excerpt from David Brin, a science fiction author, that discussed the potential future of AI, including some of the ethical dilemmas that may arise as AI continues to advance. Brin proposed that AI will not become a "designed slave" or a "feared master," but instead a partner, helping humans to achieve their desires.
We discussed the difference between sapience and sentience, with sapience referring to wisdom or the ability to make good judgments, and sentience referring to the ability to have subjective perceptual experiences, or "qualia."
We touched upon the concept of "moratorium," or pause, in AI development, as suggested by some thinkers. Brin seemed critical of this idea, arguing that it could only provide an advantage to secret labs around the world.
You shared Brin's appreciation for Reid Hoffman's book, "Impromptu: Amplifying Our Humanity Through AI". The book, through conversations with GPT-4, explores an optimistic vision of AI's future where it acts not as a threat, but a partner.
We discussed the views of Cory Doctorow, another prominent science fiction author, on the degradation of internet platforms and his suggestion of micropayments as a potential solution.
Finally, we explored Brin's optimistic concept of humans' future role in an AI-dominated world. He believes that the uniquely human ability to desire or set goals could become our primary function, with AI serving to help us achieve these goals.
Throughout our conversation, we've touched on various perspectives about AI's future, its ethical implications, and its potential role as a partner to humans, rather than a replacement or threat.

More about 6. I suggest nuclear polar refrigerator ice machines,  oceanic volsorial pedements - tidally powered desalination and kelp farms, rainforest generators, yogurt micromanufacture, artificial volcanoes, mass accelerators, and 3d global workspace idea explorer and collaboration engine.
1 / 1
ChatGPT
ChatGPT
It sounds like you're proposing a range of innovative technological solutions to address environmental, manufacturing, and collaboration challenges. Let's break each one down:
Nuclear Polar Refrigerator Ice Machines:
This appears to be a concept for using nuclear energy to power massive refrigeration units at the Earth's poles, perhaps with the goal of combating ice melt due to global warming. This idea would involve significant challenges in terms of energy use, logistics, and environmental impact, but could potentially be a part of a larger climate change mitigation strategy.
Oceanic Volsorial Pedements:
I'm not sure about this specific term, but it could refer to structures or devices placed in the ocean that leverage tidal energy. It might include desalination technologies and kelp farms. Tidal energy is a renewable and predictable source of power. Desalination could address water shortages, and kelp farming can absorb CO2, provide food and biofuel, and restore marine ecosystems.
Rainforest Generators:
