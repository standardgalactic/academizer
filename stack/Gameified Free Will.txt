Abstract
When the distributions between the source (training) and target (test) datasets are different, the performance of classical statistical learning methods degrades significantly. Domain adaptation (DA) aims at correcting this distribution mismatch and narrowing down the distribution discrepancy. Existing methods mostly focus on correcting the mismatch between the marginal distributions and/or the class-conditional distributions. In this paper, we assume that the distribution mismatch in domain adaptation is the joint distribution mismatch, and propose an Extended Maximum Mean Discrepancy (EMMD) metric to measure the distance between joint distributions. Based on this metric, we propose the Joint Distribution Matching Embedding (JDME) approach, which finds a mapping matrix to project the samples into a latent space, where the EMMD between the source and target joint distributions is minimized. The resultant orthogonal-constrained optimization problem can be solved in the form of an unconstrained problem on the Grassmann manifold. After the joint distribution matching, we can expect the classical statistical learning methods to perform well on the target dataset. Experiments on object recognition, face recognition, and spam filtering demonstrate that our method statistically outperforms the state-of-the-art shallow methods and is also on par with the deep learning methods.

Introduction
There is usually a distribution difference between the source (training) and target (test) datasets. Reasons accounting for the discrepancy are various and application-dependent. In computer vision, it may result from a different device, illumination or angle. While in text analysis, it may attribute to a different time or context. Since most classical statistical learning methods are built on the independent-and-identically-distributed (i.i.d.) assumption, the existence of the distribution difference makes their performance decrease significantly. Domain adaptation (DA) exactly aims at correcting this distribution mismatch and narrowing down the distribution gap. Recent years have witnessed the successful application of DA in various fields, such as object recognition [15], [22], [32], [36], [39], [59], face recognition [11], [22], [37], text categorization [3], [7], [59], sentiment analysis [26], [27], [43], [49], and indoor WiFi localization [3], [44].

Depending on whether the labeled data are available in the target domain, DA is divided into unsupervised domain adaptation (UDA) and semi-supervised domain adaptation (SDA). UDA and SDA uniformly hold abundant labeled data in the source domain. In the target domain, the unlabeled data is available for both UDA and SDA, and SDA additionally requires a small fraction of labeled data. In practice, sometimes it may cost a lot of manpower and time to obtain the labels for the target data. Considering this and our interest as well, we will focus on UDA in this paper.

A number of various methods have been proposed for addressing the UDA problem. According to the learning mechanism, these adaptation methods can be roughly categorized into instance reweighting adaptation, feature adaptation, classifier adaptation, and neural network adaptation.

Instance reweighting adaptation reweights the source samples so as to reduce the distribution discrepancy between the two domains [8], [20], [24], [30], [55]. Kernel Mean Matching (KMM) [24] reweights the source data such that the discrepancy between the kernel means of the reweighted source samples and the target samples is minimized. Feature adaptation, as a more popular methodology, focuses on seeking a latent space where the domain discrepancy is minimized [3], [14], [28], [32], [37], [57]. Specifically, feature adaptation can be further categorized into distribution matching [3], [11], [27], [28], [31], [32], [37], [57], subspace learning [14], covariance matching [49], [59], and more. For distribution matching, it aims at minimizing the statistical distances between domains to learn the feature mapping (mappings). For example, Joint Distribution Adaptation (JDA) [37] minimizes the Maximum Mean Discrepancy (MMD) [19] between the source and target distributions, and the MMD between the source and target class-conditional distributions to learn a mapping matrix. Building on JDA, Domain-Irrelevant Class Clustering (DICE) [32] further promotes class clustering for both the source and target data, while Domain Invariant and Class Discriminative feature learning (DICD) [31] considers both the intra-class and inter-class scatter when jointly matching the distributions. To better improve the effect of distribution matching, the important class imbalance problem [53] and the different contributions of the marginal and conditional distributions to the domain discrepancy [52], [54] are also considered in this line of works. For subspace learning, it intends to match the subspaces spanned by the eigenvectors of the source and target samples [14]. For covariance matching, it matches the source and target covariance matrices in the Euclidean space [49] or the Reproducing Kernel Hilbert Space (RKHS) [59]. Classifier adaptation trains a classifier on the labeled source data and unlabeled target data, and uses it to predict labels for the target data [4], [7], [33]. Liu et al. [33] proposed the Structure-Preserved Unsupervised Domain Adaptation (SP-UDA) framework, which ensures that the whole structure of the source data is preserved so as to guide the target structure learning in a semi-supervised clustering manner.

Different from the shallow approaches mentioned above, neural network adaptation integrates feature extraction with knowledge transfer in an end-to-end model. It can be roughly divided into discrepancy-based methods [35], [38], [45] and adversarial-based methods [9], [15], [29], [36], [58]. The discrepancy-based methods mainly minimize the MMD metric, whereas the adversarial-based methods minimize the domain difference via an adversarial objective. As a discrepancy-based method, Joint Adaptation Network (JAN) [38] minimizes the Joint Maximum Mean Discrepancy (JMMD) between the source and target joint distributions of the full-connection activations from multiple layers of a network. For adversarial-based methods, Domain-Adversarial Neural Network (DANN) [15] intends to learn a domain-invariant but class-discriminant feature representation in an adversarial way. To better match the distributions, Li et al. [29] introduced a Joint Adversarial Domain Adaptation (JADA) approach, which jointly matches the domain-wise and class-wise distributions across the source and target in a unified adversarial learning process. Zhang et al. [58] proposed a new divergence named Margin Disparity Discrepancy for distribution comparison, and designed an adversarial learning algorithm based on this divergence. Generally, the neural network adaptation approaches can present a better performance on large datasets due to the expressive neural network structure.

However, almost all these approaches focus on matching the marginal distributions and/or the class-conditional distributions between the source and target domains. In this paper, we assume that the distribution mismatch in domain adaptation is the joint distribution mismatch. To measure the distance between joint distributions, an Extended Maximum Mean Discrepancy (EMMD) metric is proposed. The metric extends the kernel function of the Maximum Mean Discrepancy (MMD) [19] to a product kernel of the feature and the label. Using this metric, we propose a simple yet effective method named Joint Distribution Matching Embedding (JDME). The proposed method seeks a mapping matrix to project the samples into a latent space, where the EMMD between the source and target joint distributions is minimized. In particular, we optimize the objective function by constraining the matrix variable as an orthogonal matrix, which has been well practiced in previous domain adaptation works [3], [22]. From a geometrical viewpoint, this constrained problem can be regarded as an unconstrained one on the Grassmann manifold [13]. Extensive experiments are conducted to demonstrate the benefits of our method. The main contributions of this paper are summarized as follows:
1) An Extended Maximum Mean Discrepancy (EMMD) metric is proposed to measure the distance between joint distributions of the feature and the label.

2) A simple yet effective method named JDME is proposed to address the UDA problem by learning a projection matrix so that the joint distributions are similar between the two domains.

3) Extensive experiments on real-world image and text datasets show the superiority of the proposed method.


The remainder of this paper is organized as follows: Section 2 introduces the problem formulation, the EMMD metric, the JDME model and the corresponding optimization algorithm. In Section 3, we conduct extensive experiments to evaluate the proposed method and compare it with the state-of-the-art UDA methods. Section 4 concludes this paper and indicates possible research directions in the future

TL;DR: We propose to explicitly model deep feature distributions of source and target data as Gaussian mixture distributions for Unsupervised Domain Adaptation (UDA) and achieve superior results in multiple UDA tasks than state-of-the-art methods.
Abstract: State-of-the-art Unsupervised Domain Adaptation (UDA) methods learn transferable features by minimizing the feature distribution discrepancy between the source and target domains. Different from these methods which do not model the feature distributions explicitly, in this paper, we explore explicit feature distribution modeling for UDA. In particular, we propose Distribution Matching Prototypical Network (DMPN) to model the deep features from each domain as Gaussian mixture distributions. With explicit feature distribution modeling, we can easily measure the discrepancy between the two domains. In DMPN, we propose two new domain discrepancy losses with probabilistic interpretations. The first one minimizes the distances between the corresponding Gaussian component means of the source and target data. The second one minimizes the pseudo negative log likelihood of generating the target features from source feature distribution. To learn both discriminative and domain invariant features, DMPN is trained by minimizing the classification loss on the labeled source data and the domain discrepancy losses together. Extensive experiments are conducted over two UDA tasks. Our approach yields a large margin in the Digits Image transfer task over state-of-the-art approaches. More remarkably, DMPN obtains a mean accuracy of 81.4% on VisDA 2017 dataset. The hyper-parameter sensitivity analysis shows that our approach is robust w.r.t hyper-parameter changes.

In the paper titled "Distribution Matching Prototypical Network for Unsupervised Domain Adaptation," presented at the ICLR 2020 Conference, the authors Lei Zhu, Wei Wang, Mei Hui Zhang, Beng Chin Ooi, and Chang Yao introduce a novel approach to Unsupervised Domain Adaptation (UDA). Unlike conventional methods that minimize feature distribution discrepancies between the source and target domains without explicitly modeling feature distributions, this work proposes an explicit feature distribution modeling strategy.
The paper introduces the Distribution Matching Prototypical Network (DMPN), which models the deep features from both domains as Gaussian mixture distributions. Through this explicit modeling, the discrepancy between the domains can be more accurately measured. The DMPN incorporates two novel domain discrepancy losses with probabilistic interpretations: one minimizing the distances between the corresponding Gaussian component means of the source and target data, and the other minimizing the pseudo negative log-likelihood of generating the target features from the source feature distribution.
By combining these domain discrepancy losses with the classification loss on the labeled source data, the DMPN is trained to learn both discriminative and domain-invariant features. Extensive experiments show that the approach achieves superior results in multiple UDA tasks, including significant improvements in the Digits Image transfer task and a mean accuracy of 81.4% on the VisDA 2017 dataset. Additionally, a hyper-parameter sensitivity analysis confirms the robustness of the method to hyper-parameter changes. In summary, the DMPN represents a significant advancement in UDA by explicitly modeling deep feature distributions, leading to improved performance in various UDA tasks.

Abstract 
Adversarial learning has demonstrated good performance in the unsupervised 
domain adaptation setting, by learning domain-invariant representations. However, 
recent work has shown limitations of this approach when label distributions differ 
between the source and target domains. In this paper, we propose a new assumption, 
generalized label shift (GLS), to improve robustness against mismatched label 
distributions.GLSstates that, conditioned on the label, there exists a representation 
of the input that is invariant between the source and target domains. UnderGLS, 
we provide theoretical guarantees on the transfer performance of any classif i er. 
We also devise necessary and suff i cient conditions forGLSto hold, by using 
an estimation of the relative class weights between domains and an appropriate 
reweighting of samples. Our weight estimation method could be straightforwardly 
and generically applied in existing domain adaptation (DA) algorithms that learn 
domain-invariant representations, with small computational overhead. In particular, 
we modify three DA algorithms, JAN, DANN and CDAN, and evaluate their 
performance on standard and artif i cial DA tasks. Our algorithms outperform the 
base versions, with vast improvements for large label distribution mismatches. Our

1Introduction 
In spite of impressive successes, most deep learning models [22] rely on huge amounts of labelled 
data and their features have proven brittle to distribution shifts [39,55]. Building more robust models, 
that learn from fewer samples and/or generalize better out-of-distribution is the focus of many recent 
works [2,5,53]. The research direction of interest to this paper is that of domain adaptation, which 
aims at learning features that transfer well between domains. We focus in particular on unsupervised 
domain adaptation (UDA), where the algorithm has access to labelled samples from a source domain 
and unlabelled data from a target domain. Its objective is to train a model that generalizes well to 
the target domain. Building on advances in adversarial learning [23], adversarial domain adaptation 
(ADA) leverages the use of a discriminator to learn an intermediate representation that is invariant 
between the source and target domains. Simultaneously, the representation is paired with a classif i er, 
trained to perform well on the source domain [20,32,49,60]. ADA is rather successful on a variety

of tasks, however, recent work has proven an upper bound on the performance of existing algorithms 
when source and target domains have mismatched label distributions [62]. Label shift is a property 
of two domains for which the marginal label distributions differ, but the conditional distributions of 
input given label stay the same across domains [48, 58]. 
In this paper, we study domain adaptation under mismatched label distributions and design methods 
that are robust in that setting. Our contributions are the following. First, we extend the upper bound 
by Zhao et al.[62]tok-class classif i cation and to conditional domain adversarial networks, a recently 
introduced domain adaptation algorithm [37]. Second, we introduce generalized label shift (GLS), a 
broader version of the standard label shift where conditional invariance between source and target 
domains is placed in representation rather than input space. Third, we derive performance guarantees 
for algorithms that seek to enforceGLSvia learnt feature transformations, in the form of upper 
bounds on the error gap and the joint error of the classif i er on the source and target domains. Those 
guarantees suggest principled modif i cations to ADA to improve its robustness to mismatched label 
distributions. The modif i cations rely on estimating the class ratios between source and target domains 
and use those as importance weights in the adversarial and classif i cation objectives. The importance 
weights estimation is performed using a method of moment by solving a quadratic program, inspired 
from Lipton et al.[31]. Following these theoretical insights, we devise three new algorithms based 
on learning importance-weighted representations,DANNs [20],JANs [36] andCDANs [37]. We 
apply our variants to artif i cial UDA tasks with large divergences between label distributions, and 
demonstrate signif i cant performance gains compared to the algorithms��� base versions. Finally, we 
evaluate them on standard domain adaptation tasks and also show improved performance.

In the paper presented at NeurIPS 2020, the authors focus on the challenge of domain adaptation, particularly on unsupervised domain adaptation (UDA), and the limitations of adversarial domain adaptation (ADA) when there are mismatched label distributions between the source and target domains. They introduce a concept called generalized label shift (GLS), extending the idea of label shift to provide robustness against such mismatches.
GLS asserts that, conditioned on the label, an invariant representation exists between the source and target domains. This concept comes with theoretical guarantees on the transfer performance of classifiers and offers necessary and sufficient conditions for its applicability. By estimating relative class weights between domains and reweighting samples, the authors develop methods that can be straightforwardly applied to existing domain adaptation algorithms, with minimal computational overhead.
Three specific domain adaptation algorithms, JAN, DANN, and CDAN, are modified in accordance with the proposed GLS assumption. The performance evaluation on standard and artificial domain adaptation tasks demonstrates that the modified algorithms significantly outperform their base versions, especially when there are large mismatches in label distribution.
This research extends the understanding of domain adaptation by providing insights into handling mismatched label distributions. By introducing the concept of GLS, providing theoretical support, and demonstrating its application to existing algorithms, the paper contributes to building more robust models that can better handle distribution shifts.

6Conclusion and Future Work 
We have introduced the generalized label shift assumption,GLS, and theoretically-grounded vari- 
ations of existing algorithms to handle mismatched label distributions. On tasks from classic 
benchmarks as well as artif i cial ones, our algorithms consistently outperform their base versions. 
The gains, as expected theoretically, correlate well with the JSD between label distributions across 
domains. In real-world applications, the JSD is unknown, and might be larger than in ML datasets 
where classes are often purposely balanced. Being simple to implement and adding barely any 
computational cost, the robustness of our method to mismatched label distributions makes it very 
relevant to such applications. 
ExtensionsThe framework we def i ne in this paper relies on appropriately reweighting the domain 
adversarial losses. It can be straightforwardly applied to settings where multiple source and/or target 
domains are used, by simply maintaining one importance weights vectorwfor each source/target 
pair [43,59]. In particular, label shift could explain the observation from Zhao et al.[59]that too 
many source domains hurt performance, and our framework might alleviate the issue. One can also 
think of settings (e.g. semi-supervised domain adaptation) where estimations ofDY 
T can be obtained 
via other means. A more challenging but also more interesting future direction is to extend our 
framework to domain generalization, where the learner has access to multiple labeled source domains 
but no access to (even unlabelled) data from the target domain.

In the conclusion of the paper, the authors summarize their introduction of the generalized label shift assumption (GLS) and its application to handle mismatched label distributions. Their approach consistently outperforms the base versions of existing algorithms, and its robustness makes it especially relevant to real-world applications where Jensen-Shannon divergence (JSD) between label distributions might be large.
They also outline future work, noting that their framework can be extended to settings with multiple source and/or target domains. One potential application is in semi-supervised domain adaptation. The authors also express interest in exploring the challenging direction of domain generalization, where there's no access to data from the target domain. This conclusion emphasizes the practical relevance of the study and leaves open avenues for further exploration, enhancing both the theoretical understanding and applicability of domain adaptation techniques.

FedDM: Iterative Distribution Matching 
for Communication-Eff i cient Federated Learning

Abstract 
Federated learning (FL) has recently attracted increas- 
ing attention from academia and industry, with the ultimate 
goal of achieving collaborative training under privacy and 
communication constraints.Existing iterative model av- 
eraging based FL algorithms require a large number of 
communication rounds to obtain a well-performed model 
due to extremely unbalanced and non-i.i.d data partitioning 
among different clients. Thus, we propose FedDM to build 
the global training objective from multiple local surrogate 
functions, which enables the server to gain a more global 
view of the loss landscape.In detail, we construct syn- 
thetic sets of data on each client to locally match the loss 
landscape from original data through distribution match- 
ing. FedDM reduces communication rounds and improves 
model quality by transmitting more informative and smaller 
synthesized data compared with unwieldy model weights. 
We conduct extensive experiments on three image classif i ca- 
tion datasets, and show that our method outperforms other 
FL counterparts in terms of eff i ciency and model perfor- 
mance given a limited number of communication rounds. 
Moreover, we demonstrate that FedDM can be adapted to 
preserve differential privacy with Gaussian mechanism and 
train a better model under the same privacy budget. 
1. Introduction 
Traditional machine learning methods are designed with 
the assumption that all training data can be accessed from 
a central location. However, due to the growing data size 
together with the model complexity [10,23,26], distributed 
optimization [7,8,43] is necessary over different machines. 
This leads to the problem of Federated Learning [32] (FL) ��� 
multiple clients (e.g. mobile devices or local organizations) 
collaboratively train a global model under the orchestration 
of a central server (e.g. service provider) while the training

data are kept decentralized and private. Such a practical set- 
ting poses two primary challenges [20,24,29,31,32]: train- 
ing data of the FL system are highly unbalanced and 
non-i.i.d. across downstream clients and more eff i cient 
communication with fewer costs is expected because of 
unreliable devices with limited transmission bandwidth. 
Most of the existing FL methods [22,28,31,32,48] adopt 
an iterative training procedure from FedAvg [32], in which 
each round takes the following steps: 1) The global model 
is synchronized with a selected subset of clients; 2) Each 
client trains the model locally and sends its weight or gra- 
dient back to the server; 3) The server updates the global 
model by aggregating messages from selected clients. This 
framework works effectively for generic distributed opti- 
mization while the diff i cult and challenging setting of FL, 
unbalanced data partition in particular, would result in sta- 
tistical heterogeneity in the whole system [30] and make 
the gradient from each client inconsistent. It poses a great 
challenge to the training of the shared model, which re- 
quires a substantial number of communication rounds to 
converge [28].Although some improvements have been 
made over FedAvg [32] including modifying loss func- 
tions [31], correcting client-shift with control variates [22] 
and the like, the reduced number of communication round 
is still considerable and even the amount of information re- 
quired by the server rises [56]. 
In our paper, we propose a different iterative surrogate 
minimization based method, FedDM, referred to Federated 
Learning with iterative Distribution Matching. Instead of 
the commonly-used scheme where each client maintains 
a locally trained model respectively and sends its gradi- 
ent/weight to the server for aggregation, we take a distinct 
perspective at the client���s side and attempt to build a lo- 
cal surrogate function to approximate the local training ob- 
jective. By sending those local surrogate functions to the 
server, the server can then build a global surrogate function 
around the current solution and conduct the update by min- 
imizing this surrogate. The question is then how to build 
local surrogate functions that are informative and with a rel-

ative succinct representation. Inspired by recent progresses 
in data condensation [54,55] we build local surrogate func- 
tions by learning a synthetic dataset to replace the origi- 
nal one to approximate the objective. It can be achieved 
by matching the original data distribution in the embed- 
ding space [16]. After the optimization of synthesized data, 
the client can transmit them to the server, which can then 
leverage the synthetic dataset to recover the global objec- 
tive function for training. Our method enables the server 
to have implicit access to the global objective def i ned by 
the whole balanced dataset from all clients, and thus out- 
performs previous algorithms involved in training a local 
model with unbalanced data in terms of communication ef- 
i ciency and effectiveness. We also demonstrate that our 
method can be adapted to preserve differential privacy un- 
der, an important factor to the deployment of FL systems. 
Our contributions are primarily summarized as follows: 
��� We propose FedDM, which is based on iterative distri- 
bution matching to learn a surrogate function. It sends 
synthesized data to the server rather than commonly- 
used local model updates and improves communica- 
tion eff i ciency and effectiveness signif i cantly. 
��� We analyze how to protect privacy of client���s data for 
our method and show that it is able to guarantee (��,��)- 
differential privacy with the Gaussian mechanism and 
train a better model under the same privacy budget. 
��� We conduct comprehensive experiments on three tasks 
and demonstrate that FedDM is better than its FL 
counterparts in communication eff i ciency and the i nal

The abstract and introduction of the paper describe a new method called FedDM (Federated Learning with iterative Distribution Matching) to address challenges in Federated Learning (FL). FL is a technique where multiple clients (e.g., mobile devices) collaboratively train a global model while keeping the data decentralized and private.
The typical challenges in FL include:
Unbalanced and non-i.i.d data partitioning
among different clients, which leads to statistical heterogeneity in the system.
Communication efficiency
, especially in environments with unreliable devices and limited transmission bandwidth.
Current methods, including FedAvg, rely on iterative model averaging and require a substantial number of communication rounds, leading to inefficiency, especially when dealing with unbalanced data partitions.
FedDM aims to improve upon these existing methods by:
Constructing synthetic data sets on each client to locally match the loss landscape from the original data through distribution matching.
Building the global training objective from multiple local surrogate functions, thus enabling the server to have a more global view of the loss landscape.
Reducing communication rounds and enhancing model quality by transmitting more informative and smaller synthesized data.
Key contributions of the method include:
Improved communication efficiency and effectiveness through iterative distribution matching, and transmitting synthesized data instead of local model updates.
Adaptation to preserve (��,��)-differential privacy with the Gaussian mechanism.
Superior performance compared to other FL methods in terms of both communication efficiency and final model performance.
In summary, FedDM presents an innovative approach to federated learning by focusing on the construction of local surrogate functions and synthetic datasets. This approach appears to offer advantages in terms of efficiency, privacy, and overall model performance.

Explain domain adaptation through distribution matching
1 / 1
ChatGPT
Domain adaptation is a concept in machine learning where a model trained on data from one domain (source domain) is adapted to work on data from another domain (target domain). Distribution matching plays a key role in this process, particularly when the source and target domains have different data distributions.
Here's how domain adaptation through distribution matching generally works:
Identifying the Mismatch
: Understand the differences between the distributions of the source and target domains. This can include differences in features, labels, and overall data structure.
Distribution Matching
: The goal here is to find a transformation that makes the source domain more similar to the target domain. This can be done by:
Re-weighting
: Assigning different weights to instances in the source domain to make its distribution closer to the target domain.
Feature Mapping
: Finding a function that maps the features in the source domain to a new feature space where the source and target distributions are more similar.
Synthesizing Data
: Creating synthetic data in the source domain that has similar distribution properties to the target domain.
Model Training and Adaptation
: Train the model on the transformed source domain data, and possibly some target domain data if available (semi-supervised adaptation). The idea is that the model will learn patterns that are more applicable to the target domain due to the matched distributions.
Evaluation and Fine-Tuning
: Evaluate the model on the target domain and perform any necessary fine-tuning. The adaptation might involve iterative processes of matching and fine-tuning.
Preserving Key Properties
: While aligning the distributions, it's essential to ensure that key properties and patterns in the source domain that are relevant to the task are not lost.
One well-known technique for distribution matching in domain adaptation is the Maximum Mean Discrepancy (MMD) method, which aims to minimize the distance between the means of the source and target distributions in a Reproducing Kernel Hilbert Space (RKHS).
The ultimate goal of domain adaptation through distribution matching is to create a model that performs well on the target domain by leveraging knowledge and patterns learned from the source domain, despite differences in their underlying distributions. It's a vital technique when labeled data in the target domain are scarce or unavailable.

impossibly hard. We then apply HF to character-level language modelling and get excellent results. 
We also apply HF to optimal control and obtain RNN control laws that can successfully operate 
under conditions of delayed feedback and unknown disturbances. 
Finally, we describe a random parameter initialization scheme that allows gradient descent with mo- 
mentum to train RNNs on problems with long-term dependencies. This directly contradicts widespread 
beliefs about the inability of i rst-order methods to do so, and suggests that previous attempts at training 
RNNs failed partly due to l aws in the random initialization.

Introduction 
Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs) are artif i cial neural network models that are well-suited for pattern 
classif i cation tasks whose inputs and outputs are sequences. The importance of developing methods for 
mapping sequences to sequences is exemplif i ed by tasks such as speech recognition, speech synthesis, 
named-entity recognition, language modelling, and machine translation. 
An RNN represents a sequence with a high-dimensional vector (called the hidden state) of a i xed 
dimensionality that incorporates new observations using an intricate nonlinear function. RNNs are 
highly expressive and can implement arbitrary memory-bounded computation, and as a result, they can 
likely be conf i gured to achieve nontrivial performance on diff i cult sequence tasks. However, RNNs 
have turned out to be diff i cult to train, especially on problems with complicated long-range temporal 
structure ��� precisely the setting where RNNs ought to be most useful. Since their potential has not been 
realized, methods that address the diff i culty of training RNNs are of great importance. 
WebecameinterestedinRNNswhenwesoughttoextendtheRestrictedBoltzmannMachine(RBM; 
Smolensky,1986), awidely-useddensitymodel, tosequences. DoingsowasworthwhilebecauseRBMs 
are not well-suited to sequence data, and at the time RBM-like sequence models did not exist. We in- 
troduced the Temporal Restricted Boltzmann Machine (TRBM; Sutskever, 2007; Sutskever and Hinton, 
2007) which could model highly complex sequences, but its parameter update required the use of crude 
approximations, which was unsatisfying. To address this issue, we modif i ed the TRBM and obtained an 
RNN-RBM hybrid of similar representational power whose parameter update can be computed nearly 
exactly. This work is described in Chapter 3 and by Sutskever et al. (2008). 
Martens (2010)���s recent work on the Hessian-Free (HF) approach to second-order optimization at- 
tracted considerable attention, because it solved the then-impossible problem of training deep autoen- 
coders from random initializations (Hinton and Salakhutdinov, 2006; Hinton et al., 2006). Because of 
its success with deep autoencoders, we hoped that it could also solve the diff i cult problem of training 
RNNs on tasks with long-term dependencies. While HF was fairly successful at these tasks, we sub- 
stantially improved its performance and robustness using a new idea that we call structural damping. It 
was exciting, because these problems were considered hopelessly diff i cult for RNNs unless they were 
augmented with special memory units. This work is described in Chapter 4. 
Having seen that HF can successfully train general RNNs, we applied it to character-level language 
modelling, the task of predicting the next character in natural text (such as in English books; Sutskever 
et al., 2011). Our RNNs outperform every homogeneous language model, and are the only non-toy 
language models that can exploit long character contexts. For example, they can balance parentheses 
and quotes over tens of characters. All other language models (including that of Mahoney, 2005) are 
fundamentally incapable of doing so because they can only rely on the exact context matches from the 
training set. Our RNNs were trained with 8 GPUs for 5 days and are among the largest RNNs to date.

CHAPTER1. INTRODUCTION2 
This work is presented in Chapter 5. 
We then used HF to train RNNs to control a simulated limb under conditions of delayed feedback 
and unpredictable disturbances (such as a temperature change that introduces friction to the joints) with 
the goal of solving reaching tasks. RNNs are well-suited for control tasks, and the resulting controller 
was highly effective. It is described in Chapter 6. 
The i nal chapter shows that a number of strongly-held beliefs about RNNs are incorrect, including 
many of the beliefs that motivated the research described in the previous chapters. We show that gradient 
descent with momentum can train RNNs to solve problems with long-term dependencies, provided the 
RNNsareinitializedproperlyandanappropriatemomentumscheduleisused. Thisissurprisingbecause 
i rst-order methods were believed to be fundamentally incapable of training RNNs on such problems 
(Bengio et al., 1994). These results are presented in Chapter 7.

The introduction section of Ilya Sutskever's Ph.D. thesis "Training Recurrent Neural Networks" further elaborates on the contents and contributions of the research. Here's a breakdown of the key points:
Relevance of RNNs
: RNNs are particularly suited for sequence-to-sequence tasks like speech recognition, named-entity recognition, and machine translation. Despite their potential, RNNs are challenging to train, especially for problems with complex long-range temporal structures.
Temporal Restricted Boltzmann Machine (TRBM)
: Sutskever's interest in extending Restricted Boltzmann Machines (RBMs) to sequences led to the development of TRBMs and later the RNN-RBM hybrid, capable of modeling complex sequences with nearly exact parameter updates.
Hessian-Free (HF) Optimization
: Inspired by recent success with deep autoencoders, Sutskever applied the HF approach to RNN training. He introduced structural damping to improve performance, allowing RNNs to tackle problems considered highly difficult without the use of specialized memory units.
Character-level Language Modeling
: Using HF, Sutskever's RNNs achieved significant success in predicting characters in natural text, outperforming other models and demonstrating the ability to manage long character contexts, like balancing parentheses over many characters.
Control of Simulated Limb
: Sutskever applied RNNs to control a simulated limb under complex conditions like delayed feedback and unpredictable disturbances. The resulting controller was highly effective and demonstrated RNNs' suitability for control tasks.
Challenging Beliefs About RNNs
: In the final chapter, Sutskever contradicts many previously held beliefs about RNNs, demonstrating that first-order methods like gradient descent can train RNNs on problems with long-term dependencies, provided the right initialization and momentum schedule are used.
Overall, the introduction outlines an extensive and impactful research effort that not only addresses the fundamental challenges in training RNNs but also broadens their applicability across various domains.

Background 
This chapterprovides thenecessary backgroundon machine learningand neuralnetworks that willmake 
this thesis relatively self-contained. 
2.1Supervised Learning 
Learning is useful whenever we want a computer to perform a function or procedure so intricate that 
it cannot be programmed by conventional means. For example, it is simply not clear how to directly 
write a computer program that recognizes speech, even in the absence of time and budget constraints. 
However, it is in principle straightforward (if expensive) to collect a large number of example speech 
signals with their annotated content and to use a supervised learning algorithm to approximate the input- 
output relationship implied by the training examples. 
We now def i ne the supervised learning problem. Let X be an input space, Y be an output space, 
and D be the data distribution over X �� Y that describes the data that we tend to observe. For every 
draw (x,y) from D, the variable x is a typical input and y is the corresponding (possibly noisy) desired 
output. The goal of supervised learning is to use a training set consisting of n of i.i.d. samples, S = 
{(xi,yi)}n 
i=1 ��� Dn, in order to i nd a function f : X ��� Y whose test error 
TestD(f) ��� E(x,y)���D[L(f(x);y)](2.1) 
is as low as possible. Here L(z;y) is a loss function that measures the loss that we suffer whenever we 
predict y as z. Once we i nd a function whose test error is small enough for our needs, the learning 
problem is solved. 
Although it would be ideal to i nd the global minimizer of the test error 
f���= argmin 
f is a function 
TestD(f)(2.2) 
doing so is fundamentally impossible. We can approximate the test error with the training error 
TrainS(f) ��� E(x,y)���S[L(f(x);y)] ��� TestD(f)(2.3) 
(where we def i ne S as the uniform distribution over training cases counting duplicate cases multiple 
times) and i nd a function f with a low training error, but it is trivial to minimize the training error 
by memorizing the training cases. Making sure that good performance on the training set translates 
into good performance on the test set is known as the generalization problem, which turns out to be 
3 
CHAPTER2. BACKGROUND4 
conceptually easy to solve by restricting the allowable functions f to a relatively small class of functions 
F: f���= argmin 
f���F 
TrainS(f)(2.4) 
Restricting f to F essentially solves the generalization problem, because it can be shown (as we do in 
sec. 2.6) that when log|F| is small relative to the size of the training set (so in particular, |F| is i nite, 
although similar results can be shown for inf i nite F���s that are small in a certain sense (Vapnik, 2000)), 
the training error is close to the test error for all functions f ��� F simultaneously. This lets us focus 
on the algorithmic problem of minimizing the training error while being reasonably certain that the test 
error will be approximately minimized as well. The cost of restricting f to F is that the best attainable 
test error may be inadequately high for our needs. 
Since the necessary size of the training set grows with F, we want F to be as small as possible. At 
the same time, we want F to be as large as possible to improve the performance of its best function. In 
practice, it is sensible to choose the largest possible F that can be supported by the size of the training 
set and the available computation. 
Unfortunately, there is no general recipe for choosing a good F for a given machine learning prob- 
lem. The theoretically best F consists of just one function that achieves the best test error among all 
possible functions, but our ignorance of this function is the reason we are interested in learning in the 
i rst place. The more we know about the problem and about its high-performing functions, the more we 
can restrict F while being reasonably sure that it contains at least one good function. In practice, it is 
best to experiment with function classes that are similar to ones that are successful for related problems1.

2.2Optimization 
Once we have chosen an appropriate F and collected a suff i ciently large training set, we are faced with 
the problem of i nding a function f ��� F that has a low training error. Finding the global minimizer of 
the training error for most interesting choices of F is NP-hard, but in practice there are many choices 
of smoothly-parameterized Fs that are relatively easy to optimize with gradient methods. 
Let the function f����� F be a differentiable parameterization of F where �� ��� R|��|and |��| is the 
number of parameters. Let us also assume that the loss L is a differentiable function of its arguments. 
Then the function TrainS(��) ��� TrainS(f��)

isdifferentiable. Iff��(x)iseasytocompute, thenitimmediatelyfollowsthatthetrainingerrorTrainS(��) 
and its derivative ���TrainS(��) can be computed at the cost of |S| evaluations of f��(x) and ���f��(x). In 
this setting, we can use Gradient Descent (GD), which is a greedy method for minimizing arbitrary dif- 
ferentiablefunctions. GivenafunctionF(��), GDoperatesasfollows:

The learning rate �� is a tunable problem-dependent parameter that has a considerable effect on the speed 
of the optimization. 
1It is important to evaluate a given F with its performance on a set examples called the validation set which is distinct from 
the test set. Otherwise, our choice of F will be informed by the spurious regularities of the test set, which can cause serious 
problems when the test set is small. 
CHAPTER2. BACKGROUND5 
GD has been extensively analyzed in a number of settings. If the objective function F is a positive 
def i nite quadratic, then GD will converge to its global minimum at a rate of 
F(��t) ��� F(�����) = O((1 ��� 1/R)t)(2.6) 
where �����is the global minimum, R is the condition number of the quadratic (given by the ratio of the 
largest to the smallest eigenvalues R = ��max/��min), provided that �� = 1/��max. When F is a general 
convex function, the rate of convergence can be bounded by 
F(��t) ��� F(�����) ��� k��1��� �����k2 
��t 
(2.7) 
provided that 1/�� is greater than the Lipshitz coeff i cient of ���F,2which in the quadratic case is ��max 
(Nocedal and Wright, 1999). This rate of convergence is valid across the entire parameter space and not 
just in the neighborhood of the global minimum, and at i rst sight appears to be weaker than eq. 2.6 since 
it is not exponential. However, it is easy to show that when F has a i nite condition number, eq. 2.6 is a 
direct consequnce of eq. 2.7 3.

Learning Rate
: The learning rate is a crucial parameter in GD, significantly affecting the optimization's speed. It must be carefully chosen to suit the specific problem.

In conclusion, this section explains how optimization is performed in the context of supervised learning, emphasizing gradient-based methods and the considerations for using them effectively. The analysis of convergence rates gives insights into the behavior of GD, one of the fundamental algorithms in machine learning optimization.

Stochastic Gradient Descent (SGD) is an important generalization of GD that is well-suited for 
machine learning applications. Unlike standard GD, which computes ���TrainS(��) 
on the entire training 
set S, SGD uses the unbiased approximation ���Trains(��), where s is a randomly chosen subset of the 
training set S. The ���minibatch��� s can consist of as little as one training case, but using more training 
cases is more cost-effective. SGD tends to work better than GD on large datasets where each iteration 
of GD is very expensive, and for very large datasets it is not uncommon for SGD to converge in the time 
that it takes batch GD to complete a single parameter update. On the other hand, batch GD is trivially 
parallelizeable, so it is becoming more attractive due to the availability of large computing clusters. 
Momentum methods (Hinton, 1978; Nesterov, 1983) use gradient information to update the param- 
eters in a direction that is more effective than steepest descent by accumulating speed in directions that 
consistently reduce the cost function. Formally, a momentum method maintains a velocity vector vt 
which is updated as follows: vt+1=��vt��� �����F(��t)(2.8) 
��t+1=��t+ vt+1(2.9) 
The momentum decay coeff i cient �� ��� [0,1) controls the rate at which old gradients are discarded. Its 
physical interpretation is the ���friction��� of the surface of the objective function, and its magnitude has an 
indirect effect on the magnitude of the velocity. 
2The Lipshitz coeff i cient of an arbitrary function H : Rm ��� Rkis def i ned as the smallest positive real number L such that 
kH(x) ��� H(y)k ��� Lkx ��� yk for all x,y ��� Rm; 
if no such real number exists, the Lipshitz constant is def i ned to be inf i nite. 
If L ��� ���, the function is continuous. 
3 We can prove an even stronger statement using proof similar to that of O���Donoghue and Candes (2012): 
Theorem 2.2.1. If F is convex, ���F is L-Lipshitz (so k���F(��) ��� ���F(��0)k ��� Lk�� ��� ��0k for all ��,��0), and F is ��-strongly 
convex (so, in particular, ��k�� ��� �����k2/2 ��� F(��) ��� F(�����) for all ��, where �����is the minimum of F), then F(��t) ��� F(�����) 
< 
(1 ��� ��/6L)t. 
Note that when F is quadratic, the above condition implies that its condition number is bounded by L/�� (recall that 
�� = 1/L). 
Proof. The def i nition of strong convexity gives k��1��� �����k2< 2/��(F(��1) ��� F(�����)). Applying it into eq. 2.7, we get 
F(��t) ��� F(�����) 
< 2L/(t��)(F(��1) ��� F(�����)). Thus after t = 4L/�� iterations, F(��t) ��� F(�����) 
< (F(��1) ��� F(�����))/2. Since 
this bound can be applied at any point, we get that F(��t) ��� F(�����) is halved every 4L/�� iterations. Algebraic manipulations 
imply a convergence rate of (1 ��� ��/6L)t. 
CHAPTER2. BACKGROUND6 
Figure 2.1:A momentum method accumulates velocity in directions of persistent reduction, which 
speeds up the optimization. 
A variant of momentum known as Nesterov���s accelerated gradient (Nesterov, 1983, described in 
detail in Chap. 7) has been analyzed with certain schedules of the learning rate and of the momentum 
decay coeff i cient ��, and was shown by Nesterov (1983) to exhibit the following convergence rate for 
convex functions F whose gradients are noiseless: 
F(��t) ��� F(�����) ��� 4k��1 ��� �����k2 
��(t + 2)2 (2.10) 
where, as in eq. 2.7, 1/�� is larger than the Lipshitz constant of ���F. This convergence rate is also global 
and does not assume that the parameters were initialized in the neighborhood of the global minimum.4 
Momentum methods are faster than GD because they accelerate the optimization along directions 
of low but persistent reduction, similarly to the way second-order methods accelerate the optimization 
along low-curvature directions (but second-order methods also decelerate the optimization along high- 
curvature directions, which is not done by momentum methods; Nocedal and Wright, 1999) (f i g. 2.1). 
In fact, it has been shown that when Nesterov���s accelerated gradient is used with the optimal momentum 
on a quadratic, its convergence rate is identical to the worst-case convergence rate of the linear conju- 
gate gradient (CG) as a function of the condition number (O���Donoghue and Candes, 2012; Shewchuk, 
1994; Nocedal and Wright, 1999). This may be surprising, since CG is the optimal iterative method 
for quadratics (in the sense that it outperforms any method that uses linear combinations of previously- 
computed gradients; although CG can be obtained from eqs. 2.8-2.9 using a certain formula for �� 
(Shewchuk, 1994)). Thus momentum can be seen as a second-order method that accelerates the op- 
timization in directions of low-curvature. They can also decelerate the optimization along the high- 
curvature directions by cancelling the high-frequency oscillations that cause GD to diverge.

This segment builds on the previous discussion by introducing Stochastic Gradient Descent (SGD), Momentum methods, and Nesterov���s accelerated gradient. Here's an overview:
Stochastic Gradient Descent (SGD)
:
Generalization of GD
: Unlike GD, which uses the entire training set, SGD uses a randomly chosen subset or "minibatch" to compute gradients. This leads to an unbiased approximation.
Advantages
: More efficient on large datasets and can converge quicker than batch GD.
Parallelization
: Although batch GD is trivially parallelizable and therefore attractive with large computing clusters, SGD is preferred for very large datasets.
Momentum Methods

Nesterov���s Accelerated Gradient

Comparison to GD
: Momentum methods are faster than GD as they accelerate optimization along directions of low but persistent reduction.
Convergence with Optimal Momentum

Quadratics
: When used with optimal momentum on a quadratic, the convergence rate of Nesterov���s accelerated gradient is identical to the worst-case convergence rate of the linear conjugate gradient (CG), which is optimal for quadratics.
Second-Order Method Analogy
: Momentum is seen as a second-order method that can accelerate optimization in low-curvature directions and decelerate it along high-curvature directions.
Importance of Lipshitz Coefficient
:
Definition
: The Lipshitz coefficient of a function bounds how much the function's output can change concerning its input. It plays a key role in understanding the convergence properties of the optimization methods.
Strong Convexity and Convergence
:
Theorem
: A stronger convergence statement can be proved for strongly convex functions, implying a specific convergence rate.
These concepts play a crucial role in training deep learning models, as they offer different ways to optimize large-scale problems. SGD and Momentum methods, in particular, are fundamental to deep learning optimization, allowing practitioners to handle large datasets and complicated cost landscapes efficiently.

2.5.1The diff i culty of training RNNs 
Although the gradients of the RNN are easy to compute, RNNs are fundamentally diff i cult to train, espe- 
cially on problems with long-range temporal dependencies (Bengio et al., 1994; Martens and Sutskever, 
2011; Hochreiter and Schmidhuber, 1997), due to their nonlinear iterative nature. A small change to 
an iterative process can compound and result in very large effects many iterations later; this is known 
CHAPTER2. BACKGROUND11 
colloquially as ���the butterf l y-effect���. The implication is that in an RNN, the derivative of the loss func- 
tion at one time can be exponentially large with respect to the hidden activations at a much earlier time. 
Thus the loss function is very sensitive to small changes, so it becomes effectively discontinuous. 
RNNs also suffer from the vanishing gradient problem, i rst described by Hochreiter (1991) and 
Bengio et al. (1994). Consider the term ���L(zT;yT) 
���Whh 
, which is easy to analyze by inspecting line 10 of 
the BPTT algorithm: ���L(zT;yT)

will rapidly diminish because dzttends to zero exponentially as T ���t increases. The latter phenomenon 
is known as the vanishing gradient problem, and it is guaranteed to occur in any RNN that can store one 
bit of information indef i nitely while being robust to at least some level of noise (Bengio et al., 1994), 
a condition that ought to be satisf i ed by most RNNs that perform interesting computation. A vanishing 
dztis undesirable, because it turns BPTT into truncated-BPTT, which is likely incapable of training 
RNNs to exploit long-term temporal structure (see sec. 2.8.6). 
The vanishing and the exploding gradient problems make it diff i cult to optimize RNNs on sequences 
with long-range temporal dependencies, and are possible causes for the abandonment of RNNs by ma- 
chine learning researchers. 
2.5.2Recurrent Neural Networks as Generative models 
Generative models are parameterized families of probability distributions that extrapolate a i nite train- 
ing set to a distribution over the entire space. They have many uses: good generative models of spec- 
trograms can be used to synthesize speech; generative models of natural language can improve speech 
recognition by deciding between words that the acoustic model cannot accurately distinguish; and im- 
prove machine translation by evaluating the plausibility of a large number of candidate translations in 
order to select the best one.

1,...,v1) = ���t p(vt; zt), where zt is computed by the RNN as described in the previous algorithm.
Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs) can be considered as generative models, as they have the capacity to generate new sequences that resemble the training data. By defining the loss in the way described, the RNN can be trained to learn a probability distribution over the sequences, which can then be sampled to create new sequences.
In the context of machine learning, this approach can be used in various applications like speech synthesis, speech recognition, machine translation, etc. However, training RNNs can be complex and difficult, especially when dealing with long-range temporal dependencies, as indicated by the problems of vanishing and exploding gradients. The latter problems can lead to significant challenges in optimizing the network's parameters, hindering its ability to learn and represent complex temporal structures.

Chapter 3 
The Recurrent Temporal Restricted 
Boltzmann Machine 
In the i rst part of this chapter, we describe a new family of non-linear sequence models that are sub- 
stantially more powerful than hidden Markov models (HMM) or linear dynamical systems (LDS). Our 
models have simple approximate inference and learning procedures that work well in practice. Mul- 
tilevel representations of sequential data can be learned one hidden layer at a time, and adding extra 
hidden layers improves the resulting generative models. The models can be trained with very high- 
dimensional, very non-linear data such as raw pixel sequences. Their performance is demonstrated 
using synthetic video sequences of two balls bouncing in a box. In the second half of the chapter, we 
show how to modify the model to make it easier to train by introducing a deterministic hidden state that 
makes it possible to apply BPTT. 
3.1Motivation 
Many different models have been proposed for high-dimensional sequential data such as video se- 
quences or the sequences of coeff i cient vectors that are used to characterize speech. Models that use 
latent variables to propagate information through time can be divided into two classes: tractable mod- 
els for which there is an eff i cient procedure for inferring the exact posterior distribution over the latent 
variables and intractable models for which there is no exact and eff i cient inference procedure. Tractable 
models such as linear dynamical systems and hidden Markov models have been widely applied but they 
are very limited in the types of structure that they can model. To make inference tractable when there is 
componential hidden state1, it is necessary to use linear models with Gaussian noise so that the posterior 
distribution over the latent variables is Gaussian. Hidden Markov Models combine non-linearity with 
tractable inference by using a posterior that is a discrete distribution over a i xed number of mutually 
exclusive alternatives, but the mutual exclusion makes them exponentially ineff i cient at dealing with 
componential structure: to allow the history of a sequence to impose N bits of constraint on the future 
of the sequence, an HMM requires at least 2Nnodes. Inference remains tractable in mixtures of linear 
dynamical systems (Ghahramani and Hinton, 2000), but if we want to switch from one linear dynami- 
cal system to another during a sequence, exact inference becomes intractable (Ghahramani and Hinton, 
1A componential hidden state differs from a non-componential hidden state chief l y by its number of possibly conf i gura- 
tion. The number of conf i gurations of a componential hidden state are exponential in its size. In contrast, the number of 
conf i guration of a non-componential hidden state, such as the hidden state of the HMM, is linear in its size.

2000). Inference is also tractable in products of hidden Markov models (Brown and Hinton, 2001). 2 
To overcome the limitations of the tractable models, many different schemes have been proposed for 
performing approximate inference (Isard and Blake, 1996; Ghahramani and Jordan, 1997). Boyen and 
Koller (1998) investigated the properties of a class of approximate inference schemes in which the true 
posterior density in the latent space is approximated by a simpler ���assumed��� density such as a mixture 
of a modest number of Gaussians (Ihler et al., 2004). At each time step, the model dynamics and/or 
the likelihood term coming from the next observation causes the inferred posterior density to become 
more complicated, but the inferred posterior is then approximated by a simpler distribution that lies in 
the space of assumed distributions. Boyen and Koller showed that the stochastic dynamics attenuates 
the approximation error created by projecting into the assumed density space and that this attenuation 
typically prevents the approximation error from diverging. 
In this chapter we describe a family of generative models for sequential data that can capture many 
of the regularities that cannot be modeled eff i ciently by hidden Markov models or linear dynamical 
systems. The key idea is to use an undirected model for the interactions between the hidden and visible 
variables. This ensures that the contribution of the likelihood term to the posterior over the hidden 
variables is approximately factorial, which greatly facilitates inference. The model family has some 
attractive properties: 
��� It has componential hidden state which means it has an exponentially large state space3. 
��� It has non-linear dynamics and it can make multimodal predictions. 
��� There is a very simple on-line i ltering procedure which provides a reasonable approximation to 
the true conditional distribution over the hidden variables given the data observed so far. 
��� Even though maximum likelihood learning is intractable, there is a simple and eff i cient learning 
algorithm that i nds good values for the parameters. 
��� There is a simple way to learn multiple layers of hidden variables and this can greatly improve 
the overall generative model. 
Byusingapproximationsforbothinferenceandlearning, weobtainafamilyofmodelsthataremuch 
more powerful than those that are normally used for modeling sequential data. The empirical question 
is whether our approximations are good enough to allow us to exploit the power of this family for

modeling complex and high-dimensional sequential data, such as video sequences or speech patterns.
The Recurrent Temporal Restricted Boltzmann Machine (RTRBM) provides an intriguing solution to this challenge. Unlike more restricted models like HMMs or LDS, the RTRBM is capable of dealing with nonlinear dynamics and multimodal predictions. Its componential hidden state allows for an exponentially large state space, offering a rich capability to capture complex structures in sequential data.
The key advantage lies in its undirected model for the interactions between hidden and visible variables, which simplifies the contribution of the likelihood term to the posterior over the hidden variables. This, in turn, makes inference more manageable, even though it still requires approximations.
The RTRBM also provides practical learning and inference procedures. While maximum likelihood learning might be intractable, the model offers an efficient learning algorithm that finds suitable parameters. Moreover, it allows for the learning of multiple layers of hidden variables, which can significantly enhance the generative model's capabilities.
The deterministic hidden state modification and the application of backpropagation through time (BPTT) further enhance the model's trainability, making it a potentially powerful tool for modeling sequential data. Its ability to handle very non-linear and high-dimensional data such as raw pixel sequences opens up exciting possibilities for applications in various domains like video processing and speech recognition.
In summary, the RTRBM presents a robust and versatile approach to sequential data modeling, overcoming some of the limitations found in traditional models, and holds promise for advancing our ability to understand and generate complex sequences.

3.2.1Approximate Filtering 
Ourmodelisdesignedtomakeiteasytoapproximatethef i lteringdistributionP(ht|vt 1). LetPapprox(ht,i = 
1|vt 1) be the probability that the ithhidden unit is one in the factorial approximation to the i ltering dis- 
tribution. For each time t we maintain a vector pt��� [0,1]Nhsuch that pt,i= Papprox(ht,i= 1|vt 1). We 
show how to compute pt, which clearly shows how to immediately obtain Papprox. 
We derive our factorial approximation from the following observation. Suppose that vt 
1 and ht���1 
1 
are known with certainty. In that case, the i ltering distribution is truly factorial and is given by 
P(ht,i= 1|vt 1,h t���1 
1 ) = sigmoid ?(Wv 
t)i+ Bh ?vt���1 
t���m,h t���1 
t���m ?

,(3.4) 
In the general case, we assume that vt 
1 is given by the data with certainty but ht���1 
1 is unknown and 
its uncertainty is represented by a factorial distribution Papprox(that is summarized by p). We use the 
mean-f i eld equations (Peterson and Anderson, 1987) to compute ptfrom pt���1 
1 and vt 1. The resulting 
equation is very similar to equation 3.4, except that we replace the values of the variables htwith their 
probabilities pt, thus getting the equation 
pt,i= sigmoid ?(Wv 
t)i+ Bh ?vt���1 
t���m,p 
t���1 
t���m ?

,(3.5) 
where we note that the def i nition of the bias function Bhis valid for real-valued arguments. 
3.2.2Learning 
To allow online learning, we ignore the effect of future data on the inferred distribution over htand 
use the approximate i ltering distribution as an approximate posterior (i.e., our distribution over htis a 
function of vt 1and not vT1). Once no hidden variables remain, learning is done by a CD update for each 
time step separately. 
Consider the standard lower bound to the log likelihood (Jordan et al., 1999): 
logP(vT 1) ��� EPapprox ?logP?vT 
1,h 
T 
1 ?? 
+ H ?P 
approx ? 
,(3.6) 
where H is the entropy of a distribution, and Papprox(hT 1|vT1) is the approximate i ltering distribution. We 
would like to maximize this lower bound with respect to P and Papprox; doing so enables us to obtain 
CHAPTER3. THERECURRENTTEMPORALRESTRICTEDBOLTZMANNMACHINE28 
the weight updates necessary for learning. Maximizing this lower bound with respect to P amounts 
precisely to learning each TRBM separately using the factorial hidden distribution provided by Papprox, 
but as a result of this maximization with respect to P, the distribution Papproxchanges as well, and can 
possibly reduce the value of the bound. The fact that the learning works in practice suggests that this 
ignored effect is not too serious at least in some situations. Even though the lower bound is described 
with respect to one vector vT 1, we maximize the average of these lower bounds over the training set, 
thus maximizing a lower bound to the average log likelihood. It is, in principle, possible to compute the 
correct derivatives of the bound w.r.t. the parameters of Papprox, but the variance of the gradient estimate 
will be infeasibly large, so we do not do so. 
Learning a TRBM when the hidden states are known is simple. It is just an RBM with dynamic 
biases which can be learned in the same way as normal biases. In the equation below we write the 
weight update for a single TRBM. There are T such TRBMs, and the sum of their weight updates 
constitutes the full weight update. To simplify the notation we assume that there is only one training 
sequence in which case the weight update for time step t is 
���W���EQ1 h

(the distribution of Qt

of ht���1

the values of each coordinate of ht���1 
1 by pt���1 
1 , the vector of probabilities of each coordinate being 1 
under the i ltering distribution Q1of vT 1. This makes the biases to the TRBM deterministic and eases 
learning. We also cannot evaluate the expectations with respect to the TRBM distribution, so we use 
CD by replacing Qt 2(vt,ht) by the distribution obtained from running Gibbs sampling in the TRBM at 
time t for one step starting at vt, exactly as for an RBM (sec. 2.7). We assumed that there was only 
one datapoint in the training set in the above description, but actually the datapoint is sampled from the 
training set, so the gradients are averaged by the empirical data distribution.

3.2.2 Learning
The learning process of the RTRBM is designed to function online, meaning that it can adapt to new data as it arrives, without considering future unknown data. By using the approximate filtering distribution as an approximate posterior, and implementing a Contrastive Divergence (CD) update for each time step separately, the model can effectively learn from sequential data.
The equations (3.6 to 3.11) detail the mechanics of the learning process, which involves maximizing a lower bound to the log likelihood. The weight updates, indicated by ���W, are governed by several equations considering filtering distributions, dynamic biases, and the unique nature of the TRBM. The use of Gibbs sampling further aids in the learning process, allowing the model to learn the underlying structure of the data.
This learning process considers not only the current state but also previous states, creating a dynamic learning system that can adapt and adjust to the sequential data's inherent patterns.
Conclusion
The description of approximate filtering and learning in the Recurrent Temporal Restricted Boltzmann Machine provides an insightful look into how this model functions. By leveraging factorial approximations and the specific dynamics of hidden and visible variables, the RTRBM enables a powerful way to model and learn from high-dimensional sequential data.
Its structure allows for a more intricate understanding of underlying patterns, which, coupled with an effective learning process, positions the RTRBM as a promising tool for applications requiring complex sequential modeling, such as in video analysis or speech recognition. The approximations and assumptions made in the learning process appear to work well in practice, although understanding their limitations and potential improvements might be an area for further exploration and research.

3.12Conclusions 
In this chapter we introduced the RTRBM, a probabilistic model as powerful as the intractable TRBM 
that has an exact inference and an almost exact learning procedure. The main disadvantage of the 
RTRBM is that it is a recurrent neural network, which is relatively diff i cult to train. However, this 
disadvantage is common to many other probabilistic sequence models, and it can be partially alleviated 
using techniques such as the long short term memory RNN (Hochreiter and Schmidhuber, 1997), as 
well as with the initialization techniques that are described in Chap. 7. 
Chapter 4 
Training RNNs with Hessian-Free 
Optimization 
In this chapter, we show that recent advances in the Hessian-free (HF) optimization approach of Martens 
(2010) together with a novel damping scheme can successfully train RNNs on problems with pathologi- 
cal long range temporal dependencies. Prior to the work described in this chapter, standard RNNs (with 
the exception of the LSTM) were widely believed to impossible to train on such problems. 
4.1Motivation 
Recently, a carefully designed and improved version of the Hessian-Free (HF) optimization approach, 
which is a practical large scale implementation of Newton���s method, was successfully applied to learn- 
ing deep neural networks from random initializations (Martens, 2010), which was considered to be in- 
feasible with other optimization approaches until very recently (Glorot and Bengio, 2010, and Chap. 7). 
We were inspired by the success of the HF approach on deep neural networks and were com- 
pelled to revisit the basic problem of RNN training. Our results show that HF, augmented with a novel 
���structural-damping��� which we develop, can effectively train RNNs on the long-term dependency prob- 
lems (adapted directly from Hochreiter and Schmidhuber (1997)) that span over 100 timesteps, thus 
overcoming the main objection made against using RNNs. From there we go on to address the question 
of whether these advances generalize to real-world sequence modeling problems by considering both a 
high-dimensional motion video prediction task, a MIDI-music modeling task, and a speech modelling 
task. We i nd that RNNs trained using our method are highly effective on these tasks and signif i cantly 
outperform similarly sized LSTMs. 
Other contributions we make include the development of the aforementioned structural damping 
scheme which, as we demonstrate through experiments, signif i cantly improves the robustness of the HF 
optimizer in the setting of RNN training, and a new interpretation of the generalized Gauss-Newton 
matrix of Schraudolph (2002) which forms a key component of the HF approach of Martens (2010). 
4.2Hessian-Free Optimization 
Hessian-Free optimization is concerned with the minimization of an objective f : RN��� R, with 
respect to N-dimensional input vector ��. Its operation is viewed as the iterative minimization of simpler 
sub-objectives based on local approximations to f(��).

The given text concludes the chapter on the Recurrent Temporal Restricted Boltzmann Machine (RTRBM) and introduces a new chapter focusing on training Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs) using Hessian-Free (HF) optimization. Here's an overview of both topics:
3.12 Conclusions on RTRBM
The RTRBM is presented as a powerful probabilistic model with exact inference and almost exact learning procedures. Its major downside is the difficulty associated with training, which is a common issue with many probabilistic sequence models. Techniques such as long short-term memory RNNs (LSTM) and specific initialization techniques (to be detailed in Chapter 7) can partially mitigate this drawback.
Chapter 4: Training RNNs with Hessian-Free Optimization
The subsequent chapter shifts the focus towards RNNs and their training using the Hessian-Free (HF) optimization approach.
4.1 Motivation
HF optimization is a large-scale implementation of Newton's method, which was found to be effective in learning deep neural networks from random initializations. This success motivated the authors to investigate its application to the notorious problem of RNN training, particularly for dealing with long-range temporal dependencies, which were traditionally considered nearly impossible to tackle.
The HF method, augmented with a novel "structural-damping" scheme, was found to effectively train RNNs on problems spanning over 100 timesteps. This achievement challenges previous objections to using RNNs and demonstrates effectiveness in real-world tasks such as motion video prediction, MIDI-music modeling, and speech modeling. Surprisingly, the RNNs trained using this method were found to outperform LSTMs.
4.2 Hessian-Free Optimization
HF optimization is defined as the minimization of an objective function with respect to an N-dimensional input vector. It iteratively minimizes sub-objectives based on local approximations of the objective function.
Summary
Chapter 3 concludes with the introduction of the RTRBM, highlighting its advantages and acknowledging the difficulty of training. Chapter 4 introduces the subject of Hessian-Free optimization as a method to train RNNs, focusing on its successful application to problems with long-range dependencies, where standard approaches have failed. The new "structural-damping" scheme, along with the new interpretation of the generalized Gauss-Newton matrix, contributes to the success and robustness of this method. Future sections in Chapter 4 are likely to delve deeper into the technicalities of Hessian-Free optimization and its application to RNNs.

Thus the Levenberg-Marquardt heuristic reduces �� if the quadratic approximation q��naccurately pre-

We now def i ne the aforementioned Gauss-Newton matrix Gf, discuss its properties, and describe the 
algorithm for computing the curvature matrix-vector product Gfv (which was i rst applied to neural

where the Jo,��is the Jacobian of o w.r.t. ��, and (L���g)00is the Hessian of the function L(g(o);y) with re- 
spect to o. To compute the curvature matrix-vector product Gfv we i rst compute Jo,��v = Ro products 
using the ���R{}-method��� given in Pearlmutter (1994) and sec. 2.3. Next, we run standard backpropaga-

If o and the hidden state sequence h is precomputed then the total cost of this operation is the same as a 
standard forward pass and back-propagation through time operation ��� i.e., it is essentially linear in the 
number of parameters. 
A very important property of the Gauss-Newton matrix is that it is positive semi-def i nite when 
(L���g)00is, 
which happens precisely when L(z(o);y) is convex w.r.t. o. The usual view of the Gauss- 
Newton matrix is that it is simply a positive semi-def i nite approximation to the Hessian. There is 
an alternative view, which is usually seen in the context of non-linear least-squares problems, which 
we now extended to encompass Schraudolph���s generalized Gauss-Newton formulation. Consider the 
approximation �� 
f of f obtained by ���linearizing��� the the network up to the activations of the output units 
o, after which the i nal nonlinearity g and the usual error function are applied. To be precise, we replace

so because it is a damping strategy that makes use of the specif i c structure of the objective function). 
In general, 2nd-order optimization algorithms, and HF in particular, perform poorly when the 
quadratic approximation M��nbecomes highly inaccurate as ��napproaches the optimum of the quadratic 
sub-objective q��n. Damping, which is critical to the success of HF, encourages the optimal point to be 
close to ��n= 0, where the quadratic approximation becomes exact but trivial. The basic damping strat- 
egy used by Martens (2010) is the classic Tikhonov regularization, which penalizes ��nby ��R(��n) for 
R(��n) = 
1 2k��nk 2. This is accomplished by adding ��I to the curvature matrix B. 
Our initial experience training RNNs with HF on long-term dependency tasks was that when �� 
was small there would be a rapid decrease in the accuracy of the quadratic approximation M��nas ��n 
was driven by CG towards the optimum of q��n. This would cause the Levenburg-Marquardt heuristics to 
(rightly) compensate by adjusting �� to be much larger. Unfortunately, we found that such a scenario was 
associated with poor training outcomes on the more diff i cult long-term dependency tasks of Hochreiter 
and Schmidhuber (1997). In particular, we saw that the parameters seemed to approach a bad local 
minimum where little-to-no long-term information was being propagated through the hidden states. 
One way to explain this observation is that for large values of �� any Tikhonov-damped 2nd-order 
optimization approach (such as HF) will behave similarly to a 1st-order approach2and crucial low- 
curvaturedirectionswhoseassociatedcurvatureissignif i cantlysmallerthan��willbeeffectivelymasked- 
out. Martens (2010) found that the Tikhonov damping strategy was very effective for training deep 
auto-encoders, presumably because during any point in the optimization, there was a value of �� which 
would allow M��nto remain an accurate approximation of f (at q��n���s optimum) without being so high

CHAPTER4. TRAININGRNNS WITHHESSIAN-FREEOPTIMIZATION43 
as to reduce the method to mostly 1st-order approach. Unfortunately our experience seems to indicate 
that is less the case with RNNs. 
Our hypothesis is that for certain small changes in �� there can be large and highly non-linear changes 
in the hidden state sequence h (given that Whhis applied iteratively to potentially hundreds of temporal 
���layers���) and these will not be accurately approximated by M��n. Furthermore, preventing these large 
changes may also be helpful in situations where, while the changes do not negatively impact the objec- 
tive, they nonetheless cause damage to the benef i cial initial hidden-hidden dynamics determined by the 
random initial parameters. The most obvious example is when the hidden-output connections are weak 
and the hidden-hidden dynamics are not being strongly used. In such situations, the optimizer may be 
too aggressive and make a change to the parameters which cause the dynamics to become trivial, or 
completely chaotic. In some sense, we would prefer the RNN to behave a bit like an echo-state-network 
(Jaeger and Haas, 2004) during the initial stages of optimization. These ideas motivate the development 
of a damping function R that can penalize directions in parameter space that despite not being large in 
magnitude, can nonetheless lead to large changes in the hidden-state sequence. With such a damping 
scheme we can penalize said directions without requiring �� to be so high as to prevent the strong pursuit 
of other low-curvature directions whose effect on f are modeled more accurately. To this end we def i ne 
the ���structural damping function��� as R��n(��) = 
1 2k��nk 
2 + ��S��n(��)(4.7) 
where �� > 0 is a weighting constant and S��n(��) is a function which quantif i es change in the hidden 
units as a function of the change in parameters. Recalling that h(��) is the hidden state sequnece of an 
RNN with parameters ��, the function S is given by 
S��n(��) ��� D( h(��) ; h(��n) 
), 
where D is a distance function similar to the loss L. Note that we still include the usual Tikhonov term 
within this new damping function and so just as before, if �� becomes too high, all of the low curvature 
directions become essentially ���masked out���. However, with the inclusion of the ��S��n(��) term we hope 
that the quadratic model will tend to be more accurate at its optimum even for smaller values of ��. 
Fortunately this is what we observed in practice, along with improved performance on the pathological 
long-term dependency problems. 
When the damping function R��n(��) is given by k��nk2/2, 
the function q��nis a quadratic with respect 
to ��nand thus CG can be directly applied with B = Gf+��I in order to minimize it. However, CG will 
not work with the structural damping function because S is not generally quadratic in ��. Thus, just as 
we approximated f by the quadratic function M, so too must we approximate S. 
One option is to use the standard Taylor-series approximation:

The text you've provided seems to be detailing a specific optimization approach, called the Hessian-free (HF) optimization method, for training Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs). This method is enhanced by strategies like structural damping to provide a more robust and accurate optimization.
In the given context, structural damping is introduced as a way to penalize directions in parameter space that may lead to large changes in the hidden state sequence of the RNN, even when the changes in parameters are not large in magnitude. This aims to handle specific challenges when training RNNs, especially when dealing with long-term dependencies.

4.3.1Pathological synthetic problems 
In this section, we train RNNs on seven problems that exhibit pathological long-term dependencies. All 
of these problems have a similar form, where the inputs are long sequences whose start (and possibly 
middle) are relevant, and the goal is to output a particular function of the relevant inputs at the i nal 
few time-steps. The irrelevant part of the sequence is usually random, which makes the problem harder. 
A typical problem is illustrated in i gure 4.2. The diff i culty of these problems increases with T (the 
sequence length), since longer sequences exhibit longer range dependencies. Problems 1-6 are taken 
from Hochreiter and Schmidhuber (1997), so we will move their description to the appendix. 
In our experiments, we trained RNNs with 100 hidden units using HF, with and without structural 
damping, on problems 1-7 for T = 30,50,100,200. Our goal is to determine the amount of work the 
optimizer requires to train the RNN to solve each problem. To decide if the optimizer has succeeded we 
use the same criterion as Hochreiter and Schmidhuber (1997). 
The addition problem: In this problem, the input to the RNN is a sequence of random numbers, and 
its target output, which is located at the end of the sequence, is the sum of the two ���marked��� numbers. 
The marked numbers are far from the sequence���s end, their position varies, and they are distant from 
each other. We refer to Hochreiter and Schmidhuber (1997) for a formal description of the addition 
problem, and to i g. 4.2 for an intuitive illustration. 
This problem and others like it are challenging not only because of their obvious long-term depen- 
dencies, but also because the RNN���s hidden state, which is exposed to both the relevant and irrelevant 
inputs in the same manner (since they share the same input unit vt), must learn to accurately remember 
one and ignore the other. These two conditions are so contradictory as to appear unimplementable by a 
standard RNN, which, unlike an LSTM, does not have a built-in means to protect its hidden state from 
irrelevant inputs. Yet, as we will see, our methods can solve this and related tasks for T as large as 200. 
The multiplication problem: The multiplication problem is precisely analogous to the addition 
problem except for the different operation. 
The Xor problem: This problem is similar to the addition problem, but the noisy inputs are binary 
and the operation is the Xor. This task is diff i cult for both our method and for LSTMs (Hochreiter 
and Schmidhuber, 1997, sec. 5.6) because the RNN cannot obtain a partial solution by discovering a 
relationship between one of the marked inputs and the target. 
The temporal order problem: See Hochreiter and Schmidhuber (1997), task 6a. 
The 3-bit temporal order problem: See Hochreiter and Schmidhuber (1997), task 6b. 
The random permutation problem: See Hochreiter and Schmidhuber (1997), task 2b. 
Noiseless memorization: The goal of this problem is to learn to memorize and reproduce long 
sequences of bits. The input sequence starts with a string of 5 bits followed by T occurrences of a 
CHAPTER4. TRAININGRNNS WITHHESSIAN-FREEOPTIMIZATION47 
constant input. There is a target in every timestep, which is constant, except in the last 5 timesteps, 
which are the original 5 bits. There is also a special input in the 5th timestep before last signaling that 
the output needs to be presented. We also experimented with a harder variant of this problem, where the 
goal is to memorize and sequentially reproduce 10 random integers from {1,...,5} which contain over 
20 bits of information. 
4.3.2Results and discussion 
The results from our experiments with the pathological synthetic problems are shown in i gure 4.1. 
From these it is clear that the HF algorithm is capable of training RNNs to solve problems with very 
long-term dependencies. Moreover, the inclusion of structural damping adds some additional speed and 
robustness (especially in the 5 and 20 bit memorization tasks, where it appears to be required when 
the minimal time-lag is larger than 50 steps). For some random seeds the exploding/vanishing gradient 
problem seemed to be too extreme for the HF optimizer to handle and the parameters would converge 
to a bad local minimum (these are reported as failures in i gure 4.1). This is a problem that can likely be 
addressed with a more careful random initialization than the one we used. 
It should be noted that the total amount of computation required by our HF approach in order to suc- 
cessfully train an RNN is considerably higher than what is required to train the LSTM using its special- 
ized variant of stochastic gradient descent. However, the LSTM architecture was designed specif i cally 
so that long-term memorization and recall can occur naturally via the ���memory units���, so representa- 
tionally it is a model ideally suited for such tasks. In contrast, the problem of training a standard RNN to 
succeed at these tasks using only its general-purpose units, which lack the convenient ���gating neurons���

The text you've provided is part of a research description discussing the application of Hessian-Free (HF) optimization, possibly enhanced with structural damping, in training Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs). This part specifically delves into experiments conducted to train RNNs on problems that exhibit "pathological" long-term dependencies.
Here's a brief summary of the section:
Problems
: Seven problems with long-term dependencies are introduced. These problems challenge the RNN to handle sequences where only specific portions of the input are relevant, and the rest is irrelevant or noisy. This includes problems like addition, multiplication, XOR, and noiseless memorization of bit sequences. Some of the problems are sourced from prior work by Hochreiter and Schmidhuber (1997).
Challenges
: These problems are complex due to the need to manage long-range dependencies and selectively focus on relevant inputs while ignoring irrelevant ones. This can be especially challenging for standard RNNs, which don't have the specialized gating mechanisms found in structures like Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) networks.
Training with HF
: The experiments involved training RNNs using the HF method (with and without structural damping) on sequences of various lengths. The goal was to assess how well the optimizer could train the RNN to solve each problem.
Results and Discussion
: The results show that HF optimization can train RNNs to handle these complex problems, with structural damping adding robustness and speed in certain cases. There were also some challenges noted, such as failures with specific random seeds and higher computational requirements compared to training LSTMs. This could be due to the fact that LSTMs are specifically designed to handle long-term dependencies, whereas standard RNNs lack these specialized mechanisms.
The text seems to conclude with a comparison between LSTMs and standard RNNs in handling these problems, but it's cut off before completing that thought.
The described experiments contribute to the understanding of how HF optimization can be applied to RNN training, shedding light on the challenges and opportunities in this area. If you have any specific questions or need further clarification on any part of this text, please let me know!

Chapter 5 
Language Modelling with RNNs 
5.1Introduction 
In this chapter, we use Hessian-Free optimization to train large RNNs on the problem of predicting the 
next character in natural text. It is an important problem, because better language models improve the 
compression of text i les (Rissanen and Langdon, 1979), the quality of speech recognition (Dahl et al., 
2012) and machine translation (Papineni et al., 2002), and make it easier for people with physical dis- 
abilities to interact with computers (Ward et al., 2000). More speculatively, achieving the asymptotic 
limit in text compression requires an understanding that is ���equivalent to intelligence��� (Hutter, 2006). 
Good compression can be achieved by exploiting simple regularities such as the vocabulary and the syn- 
tax of the relevant languages and the shallow associations exemplif i ed by the fact that the word ���milk��� 
often occurs soon after the word ���cow���, but beyond a certain point any improvement in performance 
must result from a deeper understanding of the text���s meaning. 
Prior to our work, Recurrent Neural Networks were applied to work-level language modelling and 
trained using truncated backpropagation through time (Mikolov et al., 2010, 2011, 2009). They achieved 
real improvements over state-of-the-art word-level language models, which were substantial when the 
RNNs were averaged with an N-gram word-level language model. 
AlthoughstandardRNNsareveryexpressive, wefoundthatachievingcompetitiveresultsoncharacter- 
level language modeling required the development of a different type of RNN that was better suited to 
our application. This new ���MRNN��� architecture uses multiplicative connections to allow the current 
input character to determine the hidden-to-hidden weight matrix. We trained MRNNs on over a hun- 
dred megabytes of text for several days, using 8 Graphics Processing Units in parallel, to perform 
signif i cantly better than one of the best word-agnostic character-level language models: the sequence 
memoizer (Wood et al., 2009; Gasthaus et al., 2010), which is a hierarchical nonparametric Bayesian 
method. 
While our method performs at the state of the art for pure character-level models, its compression 
performance falls short of the best models which have explicit knowledge of words, the most powerful 
of these being PAQ8hp12 (Mahoney, 2005). PAQ is a mixture model of a large number of well-chosen 
context models whose mixing proportions are computed by a neural network. Its weights are a function 
of the current context and its predictions are further combined with a neural-network like model. Unlike 
standard compression techniques, some of PAQ���s context models not only consider contiguous contexts 
but also contexts with ���gaps���, allowing it to capture some types of longer range structures cheaply. 
More signif i cantly, PAQ is not word-agnostic, because it uses a combination of character-level and 
word-level models. PAQ also preprocesses the data with a dictionary of common English words which 
we disabled, because it gave PAQ an unfair advantage over models that do not use such task-specif i c 
53 
CHAPTER5. LANGUAGEMODELLING WITHRNNS54 
(and indeed, English-specif i c) explicit prior knowledge. The numerous mixture components of PAQ 
were chosen because they improved performance on a development set, so in this respect PAQ is similar 
in model complexity to the winning entry of the Netf l ix prize (Bell et al., 2007). 
Finally, language models can be used to ���generate��� language, and to our surprise, the text generated 
by the MRNNs we trained exhibited a signif i cant amount of interesting and high-level linguistic struc- 
ture, featuring a large vocabulary, a considerable amount of grammatical structure, and a wide variety of 
highly plausible proper names that were not in the training set. Mastering the vocabulary of English did 
not seem to be a problem for the MRNN: it generated very few uncapitalized non-words, and those that 
it did generate were often very plausible, like ���homosomalist��� or ���un-ameliary���. Of particular interest 
was the fact that the MRNN learned to balance parentheses and quotes over long distances (e.g., 30 
characters). A character-level N-gram language model could only do this by modeling 31-grams, and 
neither Memoizer nor PAQ are representationally capable of balancing parentheses because of their need 
for exact context matches. In contrast, the MRNN���s nonlinear dynamics enables it to extract higher level 
���knowledge��� from the text, and there are no obvious limits to its representational power because of the 
ability of its hidden states to perform general computation. 
5.2The Multiplicative RNN 
Having applied a modestly-sized standard RNN architecture to the character-level language modeling 
problem (where the target output at each time step is def i ned as the the input character at the next time- 
step), we found the performance somewhat unsatisfactory, and that while increasing the dimensionality 
of the hidden state did help, the per-parameter gain in test performance was not suff i cient to allow the 
method to be both practical and competitive with state-of-the-art approaches. We address this problem 
by proposing a new RNN architecture called the Multiplicative RNN (MRNN) which we will argue is 
better suited to the language modeling task. 
5.2.1The Tensor RNN 
The dynamics of the RNN���s hidden states depend on the hidden-to-hidden matrix and on the inputs. In 
a standard RNN (as def i ned in sec. 2.5) the current input vtis i rst transformed via the visible-to-hidden 
weight matrix Whvand then contributes additively to the input for the current hidden state. A more 
powerful way for the current input character to affect the hidden state dynamics would be to determine 
the entire hidden-to-hidden matrix (which def i nes the non-linear dynamics) in addition to providing an 
additive bias.

Learning Control Laws with Recurrent 
Neural Networks 
6.1Introduction 
Control is the problem of computing motor commands that produce a desired motion. A controller that 
can rapidly generate motion is useful for building robots, so designing such controllers is an important 
problem. In this chapter we show how to use Hessian-Free optimization (Martens, 2010) to learn Recur- 
rent Neural Networks that can control simulated arms in conditions of delayed feedback, disturbances, 
and actuator noise. To successfully reach a target under these conditions, the RNN controller needs to 
estimate the ongoing disturbance and look into the future to account for the delayed feedback. Learning 
RNN controllers is also interesting from a neuroscience perspective (Todorov, 2004; Scott, 2004) ��� the 
way in which neural circuits compute optimal sensorimotor control is not well-understood, and it is not 
clear how other promising engineering approaches to control (such as online trajectory optimization) 
might be implemented neurally. 
A simple way to control noiseless plants1that are easy to simulate and whose derivatives are read- 
ily available is to directly optimize the command sequence, which is stored in a table, to produce a 
satisfactory motion (also known as ���trajectory optimization���). Such methods, for example the itera- 
tive Linear Quadratic Regulator (iLQR; Li and Todorov, 2004), are effective when applicable, but are 
generally diff i cult to apply for two reasons. First, plants often have contact forces and that makes them 
non-differentiable. Second, realistic plants cannot be optimally controlled with a precomputed sequence 
of commands due to the unpredictable events that occur during the motion. For example, a plant may 
have actuator and/or sensor noise, unpredictable disturbances (e.g., one of the arm���s joints develops fric- 
tion due to an unexpected temperature change; the arm picks up an object, thus altering the movement 
dynamics; or an opponent pushes on the arm), and delayed feedback (i.e., if the system is to operate 
very quickly, it may observe the plant���s state with some delay, which is especially relevant to neural 
systems). In these situations, the controller must use feedback, memory, and foresight to identify and 
then counteract the unpredictable disturbance. The delayed feedback in particular complicates planning 
because a controller cannot rely on the current observation alone when choosing an action: such a con- 
troller would realize that it missed the target only after the fact. To be accurate the controller needs to 
infer that the target has been reached before it has observed that it is so. 
The above issues can be partially addressed by online trajectory optimization (OTO), which uses 
an iLQR-like method to recompute the sequence of commands after every timestep of the simulation, 
1A plant is a general term denoting any system that can be inf l uenced via control commands. 
62 
CHAPTER6. LEARNINGCONTROLLAWS WITHRECURRENTNEURALNETWORKS63 
allowingOTOtoreacttoadisturbancebyreplanningateachtimestep. Itisahighlyeffectivemethodthat 
operates well in all regions of the state space for which a detailed model of the plant exists. However, the 
method has several weaknesses. For example, it ignores disturbances when it recomputes trajectories, 
which causes it to undercompensate. If an OTO method needs to use a robotic arm to lift a heavy object, 
it will use too little force unless it explicitly models the forces created by the object. 
In this chapter we describe a method that, for a given known differentiable plant, produces a Re- 
current Neural Network controller that uses feedback to bring the plant to any state in the presence of 
the obstacles mentioned above. Our method derives its strength from the RNN���s ability to represent a 
controller that estimates and counteracts a disturbance on the l y, and takes the delayed feedback into 
account. Like iLQR, we rely on second order nonlinear optimization, but we aim to learn a globally 
applicable policy. Although optimizing global policies is considerably more challenging than optimiz- 
ing individual trajectories, RNNs have several advantages over trajectory-optimization methods. Key 
advantages are l exibility and the ability to specify more general notions of optimality. For example, it is 
trivial to formulate an RNN control objective that includes delayed feedback and disturbances spanning 
long periods of time, allowing the RNN (at least in principle) to compute optimal trajectories in these 
situations. In contrast, there is no obvious way to use such objectives in a trajectory optimization setting. 
Another aspect of the RNN���s l exibility is the ease of incorporating sensory information. For example, 
it is straightforward to connect an RNN controller to the output of a neural network that performs visual 
perception and to adapt the control with visual cues. 
RNN controllers are extremely diff i cult to optimize because at their heart lies a diff i cult RNN opti- 
mization problem (Bengio et al., 1994), which is ref l ected by the absence of successful RNN controllers 
in the literature. We have chosen to engage this diff i cult problem because of the recent advance in RNN 
training methods that was described in Chapter 4. So while previous work on RNN controllers was not 
particularly successful, we suspected that HF would be powerful enough to optimize RNN controllers. 
And indeed, we found the HF optimizer of Martens and Sutskever (2011) to be capable of learning 
controllers that work in the presence of unknown disturbances and delays. We relied on a new variant 
of HF called Augmented-HF (or AHF) which was found to be more robust and had a signif i cantly lower 
rate of optimization failure. 
As far as we are aware, our work is the i rst that successfully incorporates disturbances and delayed 
feedback into the control objective. Indeed, while approaches like online trajectory optimization can 
deal with disturbances, their trajectories will likely not be optimal, because their objective does not take 
the disturbances into consideration, and are fundamentally incapable of correctly dealing with delayed feedback. As a result, they may use excessive force when recovering from a disturbance, and oscillate 
around the target because of the delayed feedback. In contrast, by incorporating the delayed feedback 
and the disturbances into the control objective, our approach implicitly approximates the best possible 
trajectories subject to delayed feedback and disturbances.

Chapter 6 presents an innovative approach to learning control laws with Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs). It delves into the problem of computing motor commands to generate desired motions in robots, an essential aspect in robotics.
The chapter introduces the application of Hessian-Free optimization for learning RNN controllers that can navigate simulated arms through delayed feedback, disturbances, and actuator noise. These conditions represent realistic challenges in controlling a robotic system.
One main focus of this chapter is how to overcome the shortcomings of traditional methods, such as trajectory optimization and online trajectory optimization (OTO). While OTO can adapt to disturbances, it often fails to create optimal trajectories and cannot adequately deal with delayed feedback.
The proposed method employs Recurrent Neural Networks to develop controllers capable of estimating and counteracting disturbances in real-time. The RNN's flexibility allows for the incorporation of complex objectives, including delayed feedback and long-spanning disturbances. This flexibility also extends to integrating sensory information, like visual cues, into the control process.
However, the optimization of RNN controllers presents a complex challenge, requiring the use of a robust variant of Hessian-Free optimization called Augmented-HF (AHF). The success of this approach highlights a significant advancement in dealing with disturbances and delayed feedback within the control objective.
In conclusion, Chapter 6 offers an in-depth look at a novel method for learning control laws with RNNs, showing promise in addressing complex challenges in robot control that traditional methods cannot fully resolve.

Momentum Methods for Well-Initialized 
RNNs 
In this chapter, we show that using carefully crafted (but fairly simple) random initializations, deep 
autoencoders and recurrent neural networks can be trained effectively using stochastic gradient descent, 
and that these results can be signif i cantly improved through the use of aggressive momentum-based 
acceleration. For deep autoencoders we show that using any one of a variety of recently proposed 
random initialization schemes, deep autoencoders can be trained to a level of performance exceeding 
that reported by Hinton and Salakhutdinov (2006), and with the addition of Nesterov-type momentum, 
the results can be further improved to surpass those reported by Martens (2010). For RNNs we give 
a simple initialization scheme related to the one used for Echo State Networks and successfully train 
them on various datasets exhibiting long trem dependencies (spanning 50-200 timesteps, depending on 
the problem). 
Our results suggest that previous attempts to train deep and recurrent neural networks from random 
initializations failed mostly due to poor choices of their initializations, and that the curvature issues 
which are present in the training objectives of deep and recurrent neural networks can be addressed 
through the use of aggressive momentum-based acceleration, without the need for second-order meth- 
ods. 
7.1Motivation 
7.1.1Recent results for deep neural networks 
Several recent results have appeared to disagree with the commonly held belief that i rst-order methods 
are incapable of learning deep models from random initializations. Glorot and Bengio (2010) and Mo- 
hamed et al. (2012) reported little diff i culty training neural networks of depth 5 and 8 respectively from 
random initializations. Chapelle and Erhan (2011) used the random initialization of Glorot and Bengio 
(2010) and SGD to train the 11-layer autoencoder of Hinton and Salakhutdinov (2006). They were 
able to surpass the level of performance reported by Hinton and Salakhutdinov (2006) and approach the 
performance reported by Martens (2010) for HF. 
7.1.2Recent results for recurrent neural networks 
Echo-State Networks (ESNs; Jaeger and Haas, 2004, also described in sec. 2.8.4) are standard RNNs 
that use an unusual learning procedure that only trains the hidden-to-output connections, and relies on 
a carefully crafted random initialization to create random but useful hidden dynamics which remain 
73 
CHAPTER7. MOMENTUMMETHODS FORWELL-INITIALIZEDRNNS74 
i xed through training. Jaeger (2012b) successfully trained ESNs to very reliably achieve low test er- 
rors on a number of artif i cial datasets exhibiting pathological long-range dependencies (Hochreiter and 
Schmidhuber, 1997; Martens and Sutskever, 2011). It was far from obvious that ESNs could do well on 
these tasks, as they only learn the hidden-to-output weights, leaving the output-to-hidden and hidden- 
to-hidden weights i xed throughout the course of training. These results, while very impressive, are not 
directly comparable to those of Martens and Sutskever (2011) and Chapter 4, due to the ESNs��� use of 
much higher dimensionality for the hidden states. 
Despite the surprising power of ESNs on certain very diff i cult artif i cial problems, training the hidden 
dynamics still seems like a worthwhile pursuit, one that is necessary to fully exploit the theoretical 
representational power of RNNs. Moreover, since the number of free-parameters of an ESN grows only 
linearly with the hidden-state dimension, for rich and data-intensive sequence learning tasks that require 
millions of free parameters, an ESN-based approach would require the use of an infeasibly large hidden- 
state vector, although this problem could be mitigated, somewhat, by the use of a highly-optimized 
implementation of sparse multiplication. 
Nevertheless, there is a lot to be learned from the success of ESNs, not the least of which is a 
good method for randomly initializing an RNN���s parameters. In the ESN approach, the hidden-to- 
hidden weight matrices are drawn from a carefully chosen distribution. It is designed to encourage rich 
hidden dynamics that can convey information about the input, and various random transformations of it, 
across many time-steps. This suggests that ESN-based initializations may be useful for RNN training, 
especially for problems exhibiting long-range dependencies, where training has a tendency to get stuck 
in regions of the parameter space where no useful information is ever transmitted over a long range.

Chapter 7 focuses on momentum methods for well-initialized Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs) and deep autoencoders. The chapter asserts that with properly selected random initializations, these models can be effectively trained using stochastic gradient descent. Moreover, the results can be significantly enhanced through aggressive momentum-based acceleration.
The chapter makes some essential points:
Effect of Initializations
: The chapter emphasizes that previous failures in training deep and RNNs from random initializations were mostly due to incorrect choices of initializations, rather than the structure of the models themselves.
Momentum-Based Acceleration
: Aggressive momentum-based acceleration, such as Nesterov-type momentum, can address curvature issues in training objectives without needing second-order methods. It allows surpassing previous performance benchmarks set by Hinton and Salakhutdinov (2006) and Martens (2010).
Recent Findings in Deep Neural Networks
: It highlights that contrary to popular belief, first-order methods are capable of learning deep models from random initializations, citing works by Glorot and Bengio (2010), Mohamed et al. (2012), and Chapelle and Erhan (2011).
Echo-State Networks (ESNs)
: The chapter delves into the success of ESNs, a standard form of RNNs that only trains hidden-to-output connections. They rely on carefully crafted random initializations to produce useful hidden dynamics. The success of ESNs, especially on complex artificial problems, indicates the potential of their random initialization approach for general RNN training.
Potential Limitations of ESNs
: Despite ESNs' success, training the hidden dynamics is still considered valuable to fully exploit the theoretical power of RNNs. There's also an issue with scalability as the number of free parameters in an ESN grows linearly with hidden-state dimension, which can be impractical for extensive data-intensive tasks.
In essence, Chapter 7 presents a thorough investigation into the power of proper initialization and momentum methods in the training of deep autoencoders and RNNs. It provides valuable insights that challenge conventional wisdom and offers promising avenues for achieving superior performance in these neural network architectures.

7.3Deep Autoencoders 
The task of the neural network autoencoder is to reconstruct its own input subject to the constraint 
that one of its hidden layers is restricted to be of low-dimension. This ���bottleneck��� layer acts as a 
low-dimensional code for the original input, similar to other dimensionality reduction techniques like 
Principle component Analysis (PCA). Hinton and Salakhutdinov (2006) trained very deep autoencoders 
on several datasets (as described in table 7.1), achieving results that greatly surpassed those of PCA 
both numerically and qualitatively. These autoencoders are the deepest neural networks with published 
results, ranging between 7 and 11 layers. Unlike Martens (2010), we did not use L2 regularization, so 
we rerun HF without L2 regularization as well. 
Our main results are presented in i gure 7.2 and table 7.2. The i gure shows the learning curves of 
the deep autoencoders on the CURVES, MNIST, and FACES datasets. We examine only the training 
error in order to focus purely on the effectiveness of the optimization and to avoid the confounding factor 
of overf i tting. Using Nesterov���s accelerated gradient we achieved the lowest published errors for this 
set of problems, including those in Martens (2010). For Nesterov���s accelerated gradient we used a more 
aggressive ��-schedule than for momentum because the more aggressive schedule caused momentum to 
CHAPTER7. MOMENTUMMETHODS FORWELL-INITIALIZEDRNNS78 
diverge, which further supports our claim that Nesterov���s accelerated gradient is more robust to higher 
values of ��. The ��-schedule we used consists of the progression of values [0.8, 0.9, 0.95, 0.97, 0.99, 
0.995, 0.997, 0.999] placed (roughly) at exponentially spaced iterations. We used i xed learning rates 
of 0.005 for CURVES and MNIST and 0.0005 for FACES and did not use weight decay. For each 
i rst-order method we used 600,000 iterations with randomly sampled minibatches of size 200. By 
200,000 iterations �� reaches its maximum value of 0.999, and notably, the learning curve for Nesterov���s 
accelerated gradient exhibits large spikes starting at precisely this iteration (for MNIST and FACES). It 
would seem that the sudden increase in �� destabilizes the optimization temporarily, possibly due to the 
���desire��� of larger �� to have a wider minima. 
We found it benef i cial to reduce �� by a factor of 10 and �� down to 0.99 during the i nal 10% of 
the optimization. Doing so resulted in the following improvements in performance: 0.96 to 0.079 for 
CURVES, 1.20 to 0.73 for MNIST, and 10.83 to 7.52 for faces, and this effect is present for both Nes- 
terov���s accelerated gradient and for momentum (see i g. 7.2). It appears that reducing these constants 
allows for i ner convergence to take place whereas otherwise the overly aggressive nature of the mo- 
mentum method (especially with stochastic gradients) would prevent this. It may be tempting then to 
use lower values of �� and �� from the outset, or to reduce them immediately when progress in reducing 
the error appears to slow down. However, in our experiments we found that doing this was detrimental 
in terms of the i nal errors we could achieve, and that despite appearing to not make much progress, 
or even becoming signif i cantly non-monotonic, the optimizers were doing something useful over these 
extended periods of time at higher values of �� and ��. 
A speculative explanation as to why we see this behavior is as follows. With large constants the 
momentum methods are making useful progress along slow-changing directions of low-curvature even 
while appearing to not reduce the error very signif i cantly, due to their failure to converge in the more 
turbulent high curvature directions. This progress takes them to new regions of the parameter space 
where ���f i ner��� and more careful optimization will allow convergence in the high-curvature directions and 
quickly zero-in on the nearest local solution (which because of the previous progress made in the low 
curvature directions will be of superior quality). Moving to this i ne convergence regime by reducing 
the constants too early may make it diff i cult for the optimization to make signif i cant progress along 
the low-curvature directions, since i rst-order methods, when lacking momentum or a large learning 
rate, are notoriously bad at this (which is one of the motivations for second-order methods like HF for 
deep learning). Another reason why progress along low-curvature directions may be hampered in this 
situation, which is particular to non-convex objectives, is that the i ner and more careful optimization 
may more easily get stuck in small/narrow regions of the parameter space that are highly constrained by 
local high-curvature directions (appearing as small ripples or cracks in the error surface).

Section 7.3 of this chapter deals with deep autoencoders, specialized neural networks designed to reconstruct their inputs through a constrained, low-dimensional "bottleneck" layer. This is akin to dimensionality reduction techniques like Principal Component Analysis (PCA), but the deep autoencoders studied here have outperformed PCA both numerically and qualitatively. Here are the main insights from this section:
Autoencoder Structure
: The section describes autoencoders with 7 to 11 layers, focusing on achieving remarkable results on several datasets (including CURVES, MNIST, and FACES) without L2 regularization.
Nesterov���s Accelerated Gradient
: Nesterov's accelerated gradient was applied with impressive outcomes, yielding the lowest published errors for the problem set. A particular ��-schedule was used, showing that Nesterov's method is more robust to higher values of �� compared to momentum.
Learning Rates and Schedules
: Specific learning rates and an aggressive ��-schedule (i.e., the momentum parameter) were employed to fine-tune the training process. Some temporary destabilization was observed in the optimization due to the sudden increase in ��, but this was part of a strategic approach to achieving a wider minima.
Fine-Tuning Optimization
: There was a benefit in reducing certain constants during the final stages of optimization, leading to improvements in performance. This step allowed finer convergence, overcoming the overly aggressive nature of the momentum method that might otherwise prevent this.
The Importance of Timing
: The section emphasizes the importance of timing in adjusting the constants. Too early reductions may hamper the optimization's progress along the low-curvature directions.
Speculative Explanation
: A tentative explanation is provided for the observed behavior of the optimizers. The momentum methods seem to make progress along low-curvature directions, taking the optimization to new regions of the parameter space where finer adjustments can be made. There is a careful balance to maintain to avoid getting stuck in constrained, high-curvature regions of the error surface.
Results and Comparisons
: The results demonstrate significant progress in deep autoencoders training. The section highlights the success of the chosen strategies in surpassing previous benchmarks, offering insights into how momentum methods can be leveraged and tuned to improve deep learning optimization.
In summary, section 7.3 provides a detailed exploration of deep autoencoders, showing how Nesterov's accelerated gradient and careful tuning of momentum can lead to superior results. The insights offered are valuable for those working on deep learning optimization, especially in the context of autoencoders and dimensionality reduction.

Chapter 8 
Conclusions 
8.1Summary of Contributions 
The goal of this thesis was to understand the nature of the diff i culty of the RNN learning problem, to 
develop methods that mitigate this diff i culty, and to show that the RNN is a viable sequence model 
that can achieve excellent performance in challenging domains: character-level language modelling and 
motor control. Our training methods make it possible to train RNNs to solve tasks that have patholog- 
ical long-term dependencies, which was considered completely unsolvable by RNNs prior to our work 
(Bengio et al., 1994). Our i nal result shows that properly initialized RNNs can be trained by momentum 
methods, whose simplicity makes it easier to use RNNs in applications. 
Chapter 3 investigated RNN-based probabilistic sequence models. We introduced the TRBM, a 
powerful RBM-inspired sequence model, and presented an approximate parameter update that could 
train the TRBM to model complex and high-dimensional sequences. However, the update relied on 
crude approximations that prevented it from explicitly modelling the longer-term structure of the data. 
We showed that a minor modif i cation of the TRBM yields the i rst RNN-RBM hybrid, which has similar 
expressive power but whose parameter update is easy to compute with BPTT and CD. Although the 
RTRBM was still diff i cult to train (because it is an RNN), its hidden units learned to store relevant 
information over time, and thus allowed it to represent temporal structure considerably more faithfully 
than the TRBM. 
In Chapter 4, we attempted to directly address the diff i culty of the RNN learning problem using 
powerful second-order optimization. We showed that Hessian-free optimization with a novel ���struc- 
tural damping��� technique can train RNNs on problems that have long-term dependencies spanning 200 
timesteps. And while HF does not completely solve the RNN learning problem (since it fails as the 
span of the long-term dependencies increases), it performs well if the long-term dependencies span no 
more than 200 timesteps. Prior to this work, the learning problem of standard RNNs on these tasks was 
believed to be completely unsolvable, although we empirically found it diff i cult to train RNNs on long 
range dependencies that span much more than 200 timesteps. 
We then sought to use the Hessian-free optimizer to train RNNs on challenging problems. Chapter 
5 used HF to train RNNs on character-level language modelling. The RNN language model achieved 
high performance, and learned to balance parentheses and quotes over hundreds of characters. This is 
an example of a naturally-occurring long-term dependency that is impossible to model with all other 
existing language model due to their inability to utilize contexts of such length. 
In Chapter 6 we used HF to train RNNs to control a two-dimensional arm to solve reaching tasks. 
Although controlling such an arm is easy because it is low-dimensional and fully-actuated, the problem 
we considered was made diff i cult by the presence of the delayed feedback and unpredictable distur- 
84 
CHAPTER8. CONCLUSIONS85 
bances that prevent simpler control methods from achieving high performance. This setting is of in- 
terest because the motor cortex is believed to operate under these conditions. Delayed feedback makes 
the problem diff i cult because a high-quality controller must use a model of the future in order to, for 
instance, stop the arm at the target without overshooting. The unpredictable disturbances are similarly 
diff i cult to handle, because a good controller must rapidly estimate and then counteract the disturbance 
by observing the manner in which the arm responds to the muscle commands. 
Chapter 7 demonstrated that RNNs are considerably easier to train than was previously believed, 
provided they are properly initialized and are trained with a simple momentum method whose learning 
parameters are well-tuned. RNNs were believed to be impossible to train with plain momentum meth- 
ods, even after the results of Chapter 4 were published. This is signif i cant because momentum methods 
are relatively easy to implement, which makes it likely that RNNs (and deep neural networks) will be 
used in practice more frequently. 
8.2Future Directions 
There are several potential problems with RNNs that would be worthwhile to investigate. 
Faster learning. A fundamental problem is the high cost of computing gradients on long sequences. 
This makes it impossible to use the large number of parameter updates needed to achieve high perfor- 
mance. While the computation of the gradient of a single long sequence requires the same number of 
FLOPs as that of the gradients of many shorter sequences, the latter can be easily parallelized on a GPU 
and is therefore much more cost-effective. Hence, it is desirable to develop methods that approximate 
derivatives over long sequences quickly and eff i ciently. 
Representational capacity. Representationally, our RNNs may have failed to represent the ���seman- 
tic��� longer-term structure of natural text because of the relatively small size of their hidden states. Any 
RNN-like method that can model the high-level long-range structure of text must have a much larger 
hidden state, because natural text describes many events and entities that must be remembered if the text 
is to be modelled correctly. A similar effect occurs in melodies, which tend to be repetitive in subtle 
ways. Such long-range structure can be captured only with models that can remember the repetitions 
and references made in a given sequence. It is therefore important to develop RNNs with much larger 
hidden states that perform more computation at each timestep, in order to obtain a model that is not 
obviously incapable of representing this structure. 
Weights as states. We can vastly increase the hidden state of the RNN by introducing special 
rapidly-changing connections and treating them as part of the state (Mikolov et al., 2010; Tieleman and Hinton, 2009); this approach approximately squares the size of the hidden state (if the hidden-to-hidden 
matrix is fully connected) and allows the RNN to remember much more information about a given sequence. The challenge is to develop practical methods that can train such RNNs to make effective use 
of their rapidly-changing connections. 

The ultimate goal is to develop practical RNN models that can represent and learn the extremely complex long-range structure of natural text, music, and other sequences. But doing so will require new 
ideas.

As the computing power of modern hardware is increasing strongly, pre-trained deep learning models (e.g., BERT, GPT-3) learned on large-scale datasets have shown their effectiveness over conventional methods. The big progress is mainly contributed to the representation ability of transformer and its variant architectures. In this paper, we study the low-level computer vision task (e.g., denoising, super-resolution and deraining) and develop a new pre-trained model, namely, image processing transformer (IPT). To maximally excavate the capability of transformer, we present to utilize the well-known ImageNet benchmark for generating a large amount of corrupted image pairs. The IPT model is trained on these images with multi-heads and multi-tails. In addition, the contrastive learning is introduced for well adapting to different image processing tasks. The pre-trained model can therefore efficiently employed on desired task after fine-tuning. With only one pre-trained model, IPT outperforms the current state-of-the-art methods on various low-level benchmarks

Generative Pretraining from Pixels

Abstract 
Inspired by progress in unsupervised representa- 
tion learning for natural language, we examine 
whether similar models can learn useful repre- 
sentations for images. We train a sequence Trans- 
former to auto-regressively predict pixels, without 
incorporating knowledge of the 2D input structure. 
Despite training on low-resolution ImageNet with- 
out labels, we i nd that a GPT-2 scale model learns 
strong image representations as measured by lin- 
ear probing, i ne-tuning, and low-data classif i ca- 
tion. On CIFAR-10, we achieve 96.3% accuracy 
with a linear probe, outperforming a supervised 
Wide ResNet, and 99.0% accuracy with full i ne- 
tuning, matching the top supervised pre-trained 
models. An even larger model trained on a mix- 
ture of ImageNet and web images is competitive 
with self-supervised benchmarks on ImageNet, 
achieving 72.0% top-1 accuracy on a linear probe 
of our features. 
1. Introduction 
Unsupervised pre-training played a central role in the resur- 
gence of deep learning. Starting in the mid 2000���s, ap- 
proaches such as the Deep Belief Network (Hinton et al., 
2006) and Denoising Autoencoder (Vincent et al., 2008) 
were commonly used in neural networks for computer vi- 
sion (Lee et al., 2009) and speech recognition (Mohamed 
et al., 2009). It was believed that a model which learned 
the data distributionP(X)would also learn benef i cial fea- 
tures for the subsequent supervised modeling ofP(Y |X) 
(Lasserreetal.,2006;Erhanetal.,2010). However, advance- 
ments such as piecewise linear activation functions (Nair 
& Hinton, 2010), improved initializations (Glorot & Ben- 
gio, 2010), and normalization strategies (Ioffe & Szegedy, 
2015; Ba et al., 2016) removed the need for pre-training in 
order to achieve strong results. Other research cast doubt 
on the benef i ts of deep unsupervised representations and re-

Chen <mark@openai.com>. 
ported strong results using a single layer of learned features 
(Coates et al., 2011), or even random features (Huang et al., 
2014; May et al., 2017). The approach fell out of favor as 
the state of the art increasingly relied on directly encoding 
prior structure into the model and utilizing abundant su- 
pervised data to directly learn representations (Krizhevsky 
et al., 2012; Graves & Jaitly, 2014). Retrospective study of 
unsupervised pre-training demonstrated that it could even 
hurt performance in modern settings (Paine et al., 2014). 
Instead, unsupervised pre-training l ourished in a differ- 
ent domain. After initial strong results for word vectors 
(Mikolov et al., 2013), it has pushed the state of the art 
forward in Natural Language Processing on most tasks (Dai 
& Le, 2015; Peters et al., 2018; Howard & Ruder, 2018; 
Radford et al., 2018; Devlin et al., 2018). Interestingly, the 
training objective of a dominant approach like BERT, the 
prediction of corrupted inputs, closely resembles that of the 
Denoising Autoencoder, which was originally developed for 
images. 
As a higher dimensional, noisier, and more redundant modal- 
ity than text, images are believed to be diff i cult for genera- 
tive modeling. Here, self-supervised approaches designed to 
encourage the modeling of more global structure (Doersch 
et al., 2015) have shown signif i cant promise. A combination 
of new training objectives (Oord et al., 2018), more recent 
architectures (Gomez et al., 2017), and increased model ca- 
pacity (Kolesnikov et al., 2019) has allowed these methods 
to achieve state of the art performance in low data settings 
(H��enaff et al., 2019) and sometimes even outperform super- 
vised representations in transfer learning settings (He et al., 
2019; Misra & van der Maaten, 2019; Chen et al., 2020). 
Given that it has been a decade since the original wave of 
generative pre-training methods for images and considering 
their substantial impact in NLP, this class of methods is due 
for a modern re-examination and comparison with the recent 
progress of self-supervised methods. We re-evaluate genera- 
tive pre-training on images and demonstrate that when using 
a l exible architecture (Vaswani et al., 2017), a tractable and 
eff i cient likelihood based training objective (Larochelle & 
Murray, 2011; Oord et al., 2016), and signif i cant compute 
resources (2048 TPU cores), generative pre-training is com- 
petitive with other self-supervised approaches and learns 
Generative Pretraining from Pixels 
Figure 1.An overview of our approach. First, we pre-process raw images by resizing to a low resolution and reshaping into a 1D sequence. 
We then chose one of two pre-training objectives, auto-regressive next pixel prediction or masked pixel prediction. Finally, we evaluate 
the representations learned by these objectives with linear probes or i ne-tuning. 
representations that signif i cantly improve the state of the 
art in low-resolution unsupervised representation learning 
settings. 
This is especially promising as our architecture uses a dense 
connectivity pattern which does not encode the 2D spatial 
structure of images yet is able to match and even outperform 
approaches which do. We report a set of experiments charac- 
terizing the performance of our approach on many datasets 
and in several different evaluation settings (low data, linear 
evaluation, full i ne-tuning). We also conduct several exper- 
iments designed to better understand the achieved perfor- 
mance of these models. We investigate how representations 
are computed inside our model via the performance of linear probes as a function of model depth as well as studying how 
scaling the resolution and parameter count of the approach affects performance.

2. Approach 
Our approach consists of a pre-training stage followed by 
a i ne-tuning stage. In pre-training, we explore both the 
auto-regressive and BERT objectives. We also apply the 
sequence Transformer architecture to predict pixels instead 
of language tokens. 
One way to measure representation quality is to i ne-tune for 
image classif i cation. Fine-tuning adds a small classif i cation 
head to the model, used to optimize a classif i cation objective 
and adapts all weights. Pre-training can be viewed as a 
favorable initialization or as a regularizer when used in 
combination with early stopping (Erhan et al., 2010). 
Another approach for measuring representation quality uses 
the pre-trained model as a feature extractor. In particular, 
given labeled examples(X,Y ), the model is applied toX 
to produce featuresfX. Then, a linear classif i er is trained 
on(fX,Y ). Linear probing captures the intuition that good 
features should linearly separate the classes of transfer tasks. 
Furthermore, linear probes help disentangle feature quality 
from model architecture: in i ne-tuning, one model may 
outperform another because its architecture is more suited 
for the downstream task rather than because of better pre- 
training. 
We begin this section by def i ning the auto-regressive and 
BERT objectives in the context of images. Next, we outline 
implementation details for our transformer decoder. Finally, 
we describe how the transformer is used for i ne-tuning and 
how features are extracted for linear probes. 
2.1. Pre-training 
Given an unlabeled datasetXconsisting of high dimen- 
sional datax = (x1,...,xn), we can pick a permutation�� 
of the set[1,n]and model the densityp(x)auto-regressively 
as follows: p(x) = 
n Y 
i=1 p(x��i|x��1,...,x��i���1,��) 
When working with images, we pick the identity permuta- 
tion��i= ifor1 ��� i ��� n, also known as raster order. We 
train our model by minimizing the negative log-likelihood 
of the data: LAR=E 
x���X[���logp(x)] 
We also consider the BERT objective, which samples a 
sub-sequenceM ��� [1,n]such that each indexiindepen- 
dently has probability0.15of appearing inM. We callM 
the BERT mask, and we train our model by minimizing 
the negative log-likelihood of the ���masked��� elementsxM 
conditioned on the ���unmasked��� ones x[1,n]\M: 
LBERT=E 
x���X

M X 
i���M ?���logp?x 
i|x[1,n]\M ?? 
In pre-training, we pick one ofLARorLBERTand mini- 
mize the loss over our pre-training dataset. 
2.2. Architecture 
The transformer decoder takes an input sequencex1,...,xn 
of discrete tokens and produces ad-dimensional embedding 
for each position. The decoder is realized as a stack of 
Lblocks, thel-th of which produces an intermediate em- 
beddinghl1,...,hlnalso of dimensiond. We use the GPT-2 
Generative Pretraining from Pixels 
(Radford et al., 2019) formulation of the transformer de- 
coder block, which acts on an input tensor hlas follows: 
nl= layer norm(hl) 
al= hl+ multihead attention(nl) 
hl+1= al+ mlp(layer norm(al)) 
In particular, layer norms precede both the attention and 
mlp operations, and all operations lie strictly on residual 
paths. We i nd that such a formulation allows us to scale the 
transformer with ease. 
The only mixing across sequence elements occurs in the 
attention operation, and to ensure proper conditioning when 
training the AR objective, we apply the standard upper 
triangular mask to then��nmatrix of attention logits. When 
using the BERT objective, no attention logit masking is 
required: after applying content embeddings to the input 
sequence, we zero out the positions in M. 
Additionally, since we learn independent position embed- 
dings for each sequence element, our BERT model has no 
positional inductive biases (i.e. it is permutation invariant). 
Put another way, any spatial relationships between posi- 
tions must be learned by the model at train time. This is 
not entirely true for the AR model, as choosing the raster 
order also i xes a prespecif i ed ordering of the condition- 
als. Nevertheless, permutation invariance is a property in 
strong contrast to convolutional neural networks, which incorporate the inductive bias that features should arise from spatially proximate elements. 
Following the i nal transformer layer, we apply a layer norm 
nL= layer norm(hL), and learn a projection fromnLto 
logits parameterizing the conditional distributions at each sequence element. When training BERT, we simply ignore the logits at unmasked positions.

It seems like you've provided a detailed overview of the approach in a paper about Generative Pretraining from Pixels, focusing on using a sequence Transformer for image data. The section describes two main stages: pre-training and fine-tuning.
In pre-training, the authors explore auto-regressive and BERT objectives to train the model on high-dimensional data, using the negative log-likelihood of the data as the loss function.
The architecture part explains the application of the transformer decoder, consisting of a stack of L blocks and utilizing the GPT-2 formulation. The architecture employs techniques like multihead attention and layer normalization, and the way it's trained differs depending on whether it's being used for the auto-regressive or BERT objective.
The provided description shows a novel application of transformers to the domain of images and demonstrates how techniques from NLP can be leveraged to work on higher dimensional data like images. It reflects the evolution and flexibility of deep learning techniques, especially transformer models, and their applicability to different domains.

3.1. Dataset and Data Augmentation 
We use the ImageNet ILSVRC 2012 training dataset, split- 
ting off 4% as our experimental validation set and report 
results on the ILSVRC 2012 validation set as our test set. 
For CIFAR-10, CIFAR-100 and STL-10, we split off 10% 
of the provided training set instead. We ignore the provided 
unlabeled examples in STL-10, which constitute a subset of 
ImageNet. 
No data augmentation is used when pre-training on web 
images, and lightweight data augmentation is used when 
pre-training or i ne-tuning on ImageNet. Specif i cally, when 
employing data augmentation, we randomly resize an image 
such that the shorter sidelength is in the range[256,384] 
and then take a random224 �� 224crop. 
When evaluating 
on ImageNet, we resize the image such that the shorter 
sidelength is224, and use the single224 �� 224center crop. 
When full-network i ne-tuning on CIFAR-10 and CIFAR- 
100, we use the augmentation popularized by Wide Residual 
Networks: 4 pixels are ref l ection padded on each side, and 
a32��32crop 
is randomly sampled from the padded image 
or its horizontal l ip (Zagoruyko & Komodakis, 2016). 
Once optimal hyperparameters are found, we fold our ex- 
Generative Pretraining from Pixels 
perimental validation set back into the training set, retrain 
the model, and report numbers on the respective test set. 
3.2. Context Reduction 
Because the memory requirements of the transformer de- 
coder scale quadratically with context length when using 
dense attention, we must employ further techniques to re- 
duce context length. If we naively trained a transformer on 
a sequence of length2242��3, 
our attention logits would be 
tens of thousands of times larger than those used in language 
models and even a single layer would not i t on a GPU. To 
deal with this, we i rst resize our image to a lower resolution, 
which we call the input resolution (IR). Our models have 
IRs of either 322�� 3, 482�� 3, or 642�� 3. 
An IR of322�� 3is 
still quite computationally intensive. 
While working at even lower resolutions is tempting, prior 
work has demonstrated human performance on image classi- 
i cationbeginstodroprapidlybelowthissize(Torralbaetal., 
2008). Instead, motivated by early color display palettes, 
we create our own 9-bit color palette by clustering (R, G, 
B) pixel values usingk-means withk = 512. Using this 
palette yields an input sequence length 3 times shorter than 
the standard (R, G, B) palette, while still encoding color 
faithfully. A similar approach was applied to spatial patches 
by Ranzato et al. (2014). We call the resulting context length 
(322or482or642) the model resolution (MR). Note that 
this reduction breaks permutation invariance of the color 
channels, but keeps the model spatially invariant. 
3.3. Model 
Our largest model, iGPT-XL, containsL = 60layers and 
uses an embedding size ofd = 3072for a total of 6.8B pa- 
rameters. Our next largest model, iGPT-L, is essentially 
identical to GPT-2 withL = 48layers, but contains a 
slightly smaller embedding size ofd = 1536(vs1600) 
for a total of 1.4M parameters. We use the same model 
code as GPT-2, except that we initialize weights in the layer- 
dependent fashion as in Sparse Transformer (Child et al., 
2019) and zero-initialize all projections producing logits. 
We also train iGPT-M, a 455M parameter model withL = 
36andd = 1024and iGPT-S, a 76M parameter model with 
L = 24andd = 512to study the effect of model capacity 
on representation quality in a generative model. 
3.4. Training 
When pre-training iGPT-XL, we use a batch size of 64 and 
train for 2M iterations, and for all other models we use 
a batch size of 128 and train for 1M iterations. We use 
Adam with��1= 0.9and��2= 0.95and sequentially try the 
learning rates 0.01, 0.003, 0.001, 0.0003, ..., stopping once 
the i nal validation loss starts increasing. The learning rate 
is warmed up for one epoch, and then decays to0following 
a cosine schedule. No dropout is used. 
When i ne-tuning, we use the same batch size and Adam 
hyperparameters. Here, we do not employ a cosine sched- 
ule, and early stop once we reach the maximum validation 
accuracy. Again, no dropout is used. 
When running a linear probe on ImageNet, we follow recent 
literature and use SGD with momentum0.9and a high 
learning rate (we try the values 30, 10, 3, ... in the manner 
described above) (He et al., 2019). We train for1000000 
iterations with a cosine learning rate schedule. Finally, when 
running a linear probe on CIFAR-10, CIFAR-100, or STL- 
10, we use the L-BFGS algorithm for consistency with prior 
results (Pedregosa et al., 2011). 
4. Experiments and Results 
We begin with experiments and results from the autore- 
gressive formulation of iGPT. Comparisons with the BERT 
formulation appear in Section 4.6. 
4.1. What Representation Works Best in a Generative 
Model Without Latent Variables? 
Figure 2.Representation quality depends on the layer from which 
we extract features. In contrast with supervised models, the best 
representations for these generative models lie in the middle of the 
network. We plot this unimodal dependence on depth by showing 
linear probes for iGPT-L on CIFAR-10, CIFAR-100, and STL-10. 
In supervised pre-training, representation quality tends to 
increase monotonically with depth, such that the best rep- 
resentations lie at the penultimate layer (Zeiler & Fergus, 
2014). Indeed, since a linear layer produces class logits 
from pre-logits, a good classif i er necessarily achieves high 
accuracy on a linear probe of its pre-logits. If a downstream 
task also involves classif i cation, it is empirically validated 
that penultimate features perform well. 
With generative pre-training, it is not obvious whether a task 
like pixel prediction is relevant to image classif i cation. This 
suggests that the penultimate layer of a model trained for 
pixel prediction might not produce the most useful repre- 
sentations for classif i cation. Latent variable models such as 
VAEs can avoid this issue by explicitly learning a represen- 
tation of the input data, but deep autoregressive generative

5. Related Work 
Many generative models have been developed and evalu- 
ated for their representation learning capabilities. Notably, 
GANs (Goodfellow et al., 2014; Radford et al., 2015; Don- 
ahue et al., 2016) and VAEs (Kingma & Welling, 2013; 
Kingma et al., 2014; Higgins et al., 2017) have been well- 
studied. 
As of yet, most generative model based approaches have 
not been competitive with supervised and self-supervised 
methods in the image domain. A notable exception is Big- 
BiGAN (Donahue & Simonyan, 2019) which i rst demon- 
strated that suff i ciently high i delity generative models learn 
image representations which are competitive with other self- 
supervised methods. 
Many self-supervised approaches focus on designing aux- 
iliary objectives which support the learning of useful rep- 
resentations without attempting to directly model the input 
data. Examples include surrogate classif i cation (Dosovit- 
Generative Pretraining from Pixels 
skiy et al., 2015), jigsaw puzzle solving (Noroozi & Favaro, 
2016), and rotation prediction (Gidaris et al., 2018). A clus- 
ter of similar approaches based on contrastive losses com- 
paring various views and transformations of input images 
have recently driven signif i cant progress in self-supervised 
learning (Hjelm et al., 2018; Bachman et al., 2019; Tian 
et al., 2019). 
Among contrastive approaches, our work is most similar 
to Contrast Predictive Coding (Oord et al., 2018) which 
also utilizes a autoregressive prediction objective, but in a 
learned latent space, and to Self i e (Trinh et al., 2019) which 
trains a bidirectional self-attention architecture on top of a 
standard convolutional network to differentiate correct vs 
wrong patches. 
Our work is directly inspired by the success of generative 
pre-training methods developed for Natural Language Pro- 
cessing. These methods predict some parts of a piece of text 
conditioned on other parts. Our work explores two training 
objectives in this framework, autoregressive prediction as 
originally explored for modern neural sequence models by 
Dai & Le (2015), and a denoising objective, similar to BERT 
(Devlin et al., 2018). The context in-painting approach of 
Pathak et al. (2016) also explores pre-training by predict- 
ing corruptions but predicts large regions of high-resolution 
images. 
Kolesnikov et al. (2019); Goyal et al. (2019) conducted 
rigorous investigations of existing self-supervised methods. 
Several of our i ndings are consistent with their results, in- 
cluding the benef i ts of scale and the non-monotonic perfor- 
mance of representations with depth in certain architectures. 
Expressive autoregressive models tractably optimizing like- 
lihood were i rst applied to images by Uria et al. (2013) 
and popularized by Oord et al. (2016) serving for the ba- 
sis of several papers similarly adapting transformers to the 
problem of generative image modeling (Parmar et al., 2018; 
Child et al., 2019). 
Ke et al. (2018) introduced the pixel-by-pixel CIFAR10 task 
and i rst benchmarked the performance of a 1D sequence 
transformer on a competitive image classif i cation dataset. 
Rives et al. (2019) similarly investigates whether the recent 
success of unsupervised pre-training in NLP applies to other 
domains, observing promising results on protein sequence 
data. 
6. Discussion and Conclusion 
Our results suggest that generative image modeling contin- 
ues to be a promising route to learn high-quality unsuper- 
vised image representations. Simply predicting pixels learns 
state of the art representations for low resolution datasets. 
In high resolution settings, our approach is also competitive 
with other self-supervised results on ImageNet. 
However, our experiments also demonstrate several areas 
for improvement. We currently model low resolution in- 
puts with self-attention. By comparison, most other self- 
supervised results use CNN based encoders that easily work 
with high resolution images. It is not immediately obvious 
how to best bridge the gap between performant autoregres- 
sive and discriminative models. Additionally, we observed 
that our approach requires large models in order to learn 
high quality representations. iGPT-L has 2 to 3 times as 
many parameters as similarly performing models on Ima- 
geNet and uses more compute. 
Although dense self-attention was a deliberate choice for 
this work due to it being domain agnostic and widely used in 
NLP, it becomes very memory and computationally expen- 
sive due to its quadratic scaling with sequence length. We 
mitigated this via the context reduction techniques discussed 
in section 3.2 but it is still a signif i cant limitation. Future 
work could instead address this via architectural changes by 
exploring more eff i cient self-attention approaches. Several 
promising techniques have recently been developed such as 
local 2D relative attention (Bello et al., 2019; Ramachan- 
dran et al., 2019), sparse attention patterns (Child et al., 
2019), locality sensitive hashing (Kitaev et al., 2020), and 
multiscale modeling (Menick & Kalchbrenner, 2018). 
Finally, our results, considered together with Donahue & 
Simonyan(2019), suggestrevisitingtherepresentationlearn- 
ing capabilities of other families of generative models such 
as l ows (Dinh et al., 2014; Kingma & Dhariwal, 2018) 
and VAEs in order to study whether they show similarly 
competitive representation learning capabilities.

Abstract 
Adversarially trained generative models (GANs) have recently achieved compelling 
image synthesis results. But despite early successes in using GANs for unsuper- 
vised representation learning, they have since been superseded by approaches based 
on self-supervision. In this work we show that progress in image generation quality 
translates to substantially improved representation learning performance. Our ap- 
proach, BigBiGAN, builds upon the state-of-the-art BigGAN model, extending it to 
representation learning by adding an encoder and modifying the discriminator. We 
extensively evaluate the representation learning and generation capabilities of these 
BigBiGAN models, demonstrating that these generation-based models achieve the 
state of the art in unsupervised representation learning on ImageNet, as well as in 
unconditional image generation. Pretrained BigBiGAN models ��� including image 
generators and encoders ��� are available on TensorFlow Hub1. 
1Introduction 
In recent years we have seen rapid progress in generative models of visual data. While these models 
were previously conf i ned to domains with single or few modes, simple structure, and low resolution, 
with advances in both modeling and hardware they have since gained the ability to convincingly 
generate complex, multimodal, high resolution image distributions [1, 17, 18]. 
Intuitively, the ability to generate data in a particular domain necessitates a high-level understanding 
of the semantics of said domain. This idea has long-standing appeal as raw data is both cheap ��� 
readily available in virtually inf i nite supply from sources like the Internet ��� and rich, with images 
comprising far more information than the class labels that typical discriminative machine learning 
models are trained to predict from them. Yet, while the progress in generative models has been 
undeniable, nagging questions persist: what semantics have these models learned, and how can they 
be leveraged for representation learning? 
Thedreamofgenerationasameansoftrueunderstandingfromrawdataalonehashardlybeenrealized. 
Instead, the most successful approaches for unsupervised learning leverage techniques adopted from 
the i eld of supervised learning, a class of methods known as self-supervised learning [4,35,32,9]. 
These approaches typically involve changing or holding back certain aspects of the data in some way, 
and training a model to predict or generate aspects of the missing information. For example, [34,35] 
proposed colorization as a means of unsupervised learning, where a model is given a subset of the 
color channels in an input image, and trained to predict the missing channels. 
Generative models as a means of unsupervised learning offer an appealing alternative to self- 
supervised tasks in that they are trained to model the full data distribution without requiring any 
modif i cation of the original data. One class of generative models that has been applied to rep- 
resentation learning is generative adversarial networks (GANs) [11]. The generator in the GAN
framework is a feed-forward mapping from randomly sampled latent variables (also called ���noise���) 
to generated data, with learning signal provided by a discriminator trained to distinguish between 
real and generated data samples, guiding the generator���s outputs to follow the data distribution. 
The adversarially learned inference (ALI) [8] or bidirectional GAN (BiGAN) [5] approaches were 
proposed as extensions to the GAN framework that augment the standard GAN with an encoder 
module mapping real data to latents, the inverse of the mapping learned by the generator. 
In the limit of an optimal discriminator, [5] showed that a deterministic BiGAN behaves like an 
autoencoder minimizing���0reconstruction costs; however, the shape of the reconstruction error 
surface is dictated by a parametric discriminator, as opposed to simple pixel-level measures like the 
���2error. Since the discriminator is usually a powerful neural network, the hope is that it will induce 
an error surface which emphasizes ���semantic��� errors in reconstructions, rather than low-level details. 
In [5] it was demonstrated that the encoder learned via the BiGAN or ALI framework is an effective 
means of visual representation learning on ImageNet for downstream tasks. However, it used a 
DCGAN [26] style generator, incapable of producing high-quality images on this dataset, so the 
semantics the encoder could model were in turn quite limited. In this work we revisit this approach 
using BigGAN [1] as the generator, a modern model that appears capable of capturing many of the 
modes and much of the structure present in ImageNet images. Our contributions are as follows: 
���We show that BigBiGAN (BiGAN with BigGAN generator) matches the state of the art in 
unsupervised representation learning on ImageNet. 
��� We propose a more stable version of the joint discriminator for BigBiGAN. 
��� We perform a thorough empirical analysis and ablation study of model design choices. 
���We show that the representation learning objective also improves unconditional image 
generation, and demonstrate state-of-the-art results in unconditional ImageNet generation. 
��� We open source pretrained BigBiGAN models on TensorFlow Hub2. 
2BigBiGAN 
The BiGAN [5] or ALI [8] approaches were proposed as extensions of the GAN [11] framework 
which enable the learning of an encoder that can be employed as an inference model [8] or feature 
representation [5]. Given a distributionPxof datax(e.g., images), and a distributionPzof latentsz 
2See footnote1. 2 
(usually a simple continuous distribution like an isotropic GaussianN(0,I)), 
the generatorGmodels 
a conditional distributionP(x|z)of 
dataxgiven latent inputszsampled from the latent priorPz, 
as in the standard GAN generator [11]. The encoderEmodels 
the inverse conditional distribution 
P(z|x), predicting latents z given data x sampled from the data distribution Px. 
Besides the addition ofE, 
the other modif i cation to the GAN in the BiGAN framework is a joint 
discriminatorD, 
which takes as input data-latent pairs(x,z)(rather than just dataxas in a standard 
GAN), and learns to discriminate between pairs from the data distribution and encoder, versus 
the generator and latent distribution. Concretely, its inputs are pairs(x ��� Px,�� z ��� E(x))and 
(�� x ��� G(z),z ��� Pz), 
and the goal of theGandEis 
to ���fool��� the discriminator by making the two 
joint distributionsPxEandPGzfrom which these pairs are sampled indistinguishable. The adversarial 
minimax objective in [5, 8], analogous to that of the GAN framework [11], was def i ned as follows: 
min 
GE 
max 
D ?E 
x���Px,z���E��(x)[log(��(D(x,z)))] + Ez���Pz,x���G��(z)[log(1 ��� ��(D(x,z)))] ? 
Under this objective, [5,8] showed that with an optimalD,GandEminimize 
the Jensen-Shannon 
divergence between the joint distributionsPxEandPGz, and therefore at the global optimum, the 
two joint distributionsPxE= PGzmatch, analogous to the results from standard GANs [11]. 
Furthermore, [5] showed that in the case whereEandGare deterministic functions (i.e., the learned 
conditional distributionsPG(x|z)andPE(z|x)are Dirac��functions), these two functions are inverses 
attheglobaloptimum: e.g.,���x���supp(Px)x = G(E(x)), 
withtheoptimaljointdiscriminatoreffectively 
imposing ���0reconstruction costs on x and z. 
While the crux of our approach, BigBiGAN, remains the same as that of BiGAN [5,8], we have 
adopted the generator and discriminator architectures from the state-of-the-art BigGAN [1] generative 
image model. Beyond that, we have found that an improved discriminator structure leads to better 
representation learning results without compromising generation (Figure 1). Namely, in addition to 
the joint discriminator loss proposed in [5,8] which ties the data and latent distributions together, we

4Related work 
A number of approaches to unsupervised representation learning from images based on self- 
supervision have proven very successful. Self-supervision generally involves learning from tasks 
designed to resemble supervised learning in some way, but in which the ���labels��� can be created 
automatically from the data itself with no manual effort. An early example is relative location 
prediction [3], where a model is trained on input pairs of image patches and predicts their relative 
locations. Contrastive predictive coding (CPC) [32,14] is a recent related approach where, given 
an image patch, a model predicts which patches occur in other image locations. Other approaches 
include colorization [34,35], motion segmentation [25], rotation prediction [9,2], GAN-based dis- 
crimination [26,2], and exemplar matching [6]. Rigorous empirical comparisons of many of these 
approaches have also been conducted [4,20]. A key advantage offered by BigBiGAN and other 
approaches based on generative models, relative to most self-supervised approaches, is that their 
input may be the full-resolution image or other signal, with no cropping or modif i cation of the data 
needed (though such modif i cations may be benef i cial as data augmentation). This means the resulting 
representation can typically be applied directly to full data in the downstream task with no domain 
shift. 
A number of relevant autoencoder and GAN variants have also been proposed. Associative com- 
pression networks (ACNs) [12] learn to compress at the dataset level by conditioning data on other 
previously transmitted data which are similar in code space, resulting in models that can ���daydream��� 
semantically similar samples, similar to BigBiGAN reconstructions. VQ-VAEs [33] pair a discrete 
(vector quantized) encoder with an autoregressive decoder to produce faithful reconstructions with a 
high compression factor and demonstrate representation learning results in reinforcement learning 
settings. In the adversarial space, adversarial autoencoders [24] proposed an autoencoder-style 
encoder-decoder pair trained with pixel-level reconstruction cost, replacing the KL-divergence reg- 
ularization of the prior used in VAEs [19] with a discriminator. In another proposed VAE-GAN 
hybrid [21] the pixel-space reconstruction error used in most VAEs is replaced with feature space 
distance from an intermediate layer of a GAN discriminator. Other hybrid approaches like AGE [31] 
and��-GAN [27] add an encoder to stabilize GAN training. An interesting difference between many 
of these approaches and the BiGAN [8,5] framework is that BiGAN does not train the encoder or 
generator with an explicit reconstruction cost. Though it can be shown that (Big)BiGAN implicitly 
minimizes a reconstruction cost, qualitative reconstruction results (Section 3.3) suggest that this 
reconstruction cost is of a different l avor, emphasizing high-level semantics over pixel-level details. 
5Discussion 
We have shown that BigBiGAN, an unsupervised learning approach based purely on generative mod- 
els, achieves state-of-the-art results in image representation learning on ImageNet. Our ablation study 
lends further credence to the hope that powerful generative models can be benef i cial for representation 
learning, and in turn that learning an inference model can improve large-scale generative models. 
In the future we hope that representation learning can continue to benef i t from further advances in 
generative models and inference models alike, as well as scaling to larger image databases.

We propose a deep learning framework for modeling complex high-dimensional 
densities called Non-linear Independent Component Estimation (NICE). It is 
based on the idea that a good representation is one in which the data has a dis- 
tribution that is easy to model. For this purpose, a non-linear deterministic trans- 
formation of the data is learned that maps it to a latent space so as to make the 
transformed data conform to a factorized distribution, i.e., resulting in indepen- 
dent latent variables. We parametrize this transformation so that computing the 
determinant of the Jacobian and inverse Jacobian is trivial, yet we maintain the 
ability to learn complex non-linear transformations, via a composition of simple 
building blocks, each based on a deep neural network. The training criterion is 
simply the exact log-likelihood, which is tractable. Unbiased ancestral sampling 
is also easy. We show that this approach yields good generative models on four 
image datasets and can be used for inpainting. 
1INTRODUCTION 
One of the central questions in unsupervised learning is how to capture complex data distributions 
that have unknown structure. Deep learning approaches (Bengio, 2009) rely on the learning of a 
representation of the data that would capture its most important factors of variation. This raises the 
question: what is a good representation? Like in recent work (Kingma and Welling, 2014; Rezende 
et al., 2014; Ozair and Bengio, 2014), we take the view that a good representation is one in which 
the distribution of the data is easy to model. In this paper, we consider the special case where we 
ask the learner to i nd a transformation h = f(x) of the data into a new space such that the resulting 
distribution factorizes, i.e., the components hdare independent: 
pH(h) = Y 
d 
pHd(hd). 
The proposed training criterion is directly derived from the log-likelihood. More specif i cally, we 
consider a change of variables h = f(x), which assumes that f is invertible and the dimension of h 
is the same as the dimension of x, in order to i t a distribution pH. The change of variable rule gives 
us: pX(x) = pH(f(x))|det 
���f(x) 
���x |.(1) 
where 
���f(x) 
���x is the Jacobian matrix of function f at x. In this paper, we choose f such that the 
determinant of the Jacobian is trivially obtained. Moreover, its inverse f���1is also trivially obtained, 
allowing us to sample from pX(x) easily as follows: 
h ��� pH(h) 
x = f���1(h)(2)

the form: y1= x1 
y2= x2+ m(x1)(3)

The excerpt you provided is from the abstract and introductory sections of the paper titled "NICE: Non-linear Independent Components Estimation" by Laurent Dinh, David Krueger, and Yoshua Bengio, which was published as an arXiv preprint.
The paper introduces a deep learning framework called Non-linear Independent Component Estimation (NICE). This approach aims to model complex high-dimensional densities by learning a non-linear deterministic transformation of the data, mapping it to a latent space to make the transformed data conform to a factorized distribution. Essentially, it aims to find independent latent variables in the data.
The proposed transformation is carefully designed so that the determinant of the Jacobian and the inverse Jacobian are trivial to compute, while still allowing the ability to learn complex non-linear transformations. This is done through a composition of simple building blocks, each based on deep neural networks.
The training criterion is the exact log-likelihood, and unbiased ancestral sampling is straightforward. The paper shows that this approach can create good generative models on image datasets and be used for inpainting.
The structure described enables easy calculation of key properties and has a core idea where the data is split into blocks, and a specific transformation is applied that has a unit Jacobian determinant for any complex function.
This work contributes to the ongoing exploration of deep learning methodologies for unsupervised learning, providing a novel way to capture and represent the underlying structure of complex data distributions.

Explain how backpropagation solves circuit search
1 / 1
ChatGPT
Backpropagation doesn't exactly "solve circuit search" in the typical sense, but it is a crucial algorithm used in training artificial neural networks, which can be thought of as computational circuits. Here's how it connects:
Neural Network as a Circuit
: A neural network is often described as a computational graph or circuit where the neurons are computational nodes, and the connections between them represent the flow of information. The output of each neuron is computed based on its input, weights, and an activation function, similar to the way a complex electronic circuit computes outputs from inputs.
Forward Pass
: During the training of a neural network, the input data is passed through the network (a forward pass), calculating the output at each layer until the final output is reached. This is akin to a signal traveling through a circuit.
Calculating Loss
: The error or loss is then calculated by comparing this final output to the desired output (the target). The loss gives an indication of how far off the neural network's predictions are from the true values.
Backpropagation
: The backpropagation algorithm then calculates the gradients of this loss function with respect to each weight in the network by applying the chain rule of calculus, essentially determining how each weight should be altered to minimize the loss. This is performed in reverse, starting from the output layer and moving backward through the network, hence the name "backpropagation."
Updating Weights
: The computed gradients are used to update the weights in the network, typically using an optimization method like gradient descent. This process adjusts the network's "circuitry" to make its predictions more accurate.
Iteration
: Steps 2-5 are repeated many times with different inputs from the training data, iteratively refining the weights in the network.
So, in a sense, backpropagation is a method for "searching" the space of possible weights for the ones that minimize the error of the neural network's predictions. It does this by efficiently calculating gradients and using them to adjust the weights, much like tuning the components of a complex electronic circuit to get a desired output. It doesn't solve a "circuit search" in the traditional sense of searching for a specific circuit configuration, but rather optimizes the parameters of a given network structure.

I just mean it uses reinforcement learning where the agent is a neural network, and makes the problem more tractable
1 / 1
ChatGPT
Ah, I see! You're referring to a setup where backpropagation is used in a reinforcement learning (RL) context, with a neural network serving as the agent's policy or value function. In this context, backpropagation can indeed make the problem more tractable. Here's how:
Modeling the Agent
: In RL, an agent interacts with an environment to achieve a goal. The agent's behavior can be modeled using a neural network, where the inputs might include the current state of the environment, and the outputs represent either the value of different actions (in a value-based method) or the probabilities of taking each action (in a policy-based method).
Exploration and Learning
: The agent explores the environment, takes actions, and receives rewards based on those actions. The goal of the agent is to learn a policy that maximizes the cumulative reward over time.
Sample Collection
: The agent collects samples of states, actions, rewards, and next states by interacting with the environment. These samples form a dataset that captures the agent's experience.
Loss Function
: A loss function is defined based on the difference between the predicted values (from the neural network) and target values (calculated based on the rewards and next state values). This loss function captures how well the neural network is approximating the optimal policy or value function.
Backpropagation for Training
: Backpropagation is then used to minimize this loss by adjusting the weights of the neural network. This involves computing gradients of the loss with respect to the weights and updating the weights accordingly.
Iterative Improvement
: This process is iterated many times, with the agent continually interacting with the environment, collecting samples, and updating its neural network using backpropagation. Over time, the neural network (the agent's "circuit") becomes tuned to represent an effective policy or value function.
In summary, the use of a neural network and backpropagation in RL serves to approximate complex functions (such as the value function or policy) that might be intractable to represent explicitly. The neural network acts as a function approximator, and backpropagation is the tool used to adjust this approximator to better reflect the underlying function as the agent gains more experience in the environment. It makes the problem more tractable by allowing complex, nonlinear relationships to be captured without having to manually specify or discretize these relationships.

Elsewhere, Ilya Sutskever wrote this:

Reinforcement learning algorithms in a nutshell:

Add a bit of randomness to your actions

If the result was better than expected, so more of the same in the future
1 / 1
ChatGPT
Ilya Sutskever's statement provides a very concise and high-level summary of the core ideas behind many reinforcement learning (RL) algorithms. Here's what it means:
Add a bit of randomness to your actions
: In RL, exploration is essential for the agent to learn about its environment. If the agent only takes the actions that it currently believes to be best, it might miss out on discovering even better actions. By adding randomness to its actions, the agent occasionally tries something new, which might lead to discovering a more optimal policy.
If the result was better than expected, do more of the same in the future
: This captures the essence of learning from experience in RL. When the agent takes an action and observes that the result (usually measured in terms of reward) is better than what it expected, it updates its beliefs (e.g., its value function or policy) to favor that action in similar situations in the future. This update is typically done through methods like Q-learning, policy gradients, or other algorithms, which may indeed use backpropagation when the agent's policy or value function is represented by a neural network.
Sutskever's description abstracts away many of the complexities and nuances of RL but captures the intuitive idea at the heart of many RL algorithms: try different things, observe the results, and adjust your behavior to do more of what works. It's a simple yet powerful framework that underlies much of the success of RL in various domains.

It definitely made me think of random exploration in babbling and theory theory.
1 / 1
ChatGPT
The connection you're drawing between reinforcement learning (RL) and concepts like random exploration, babbling, and theory theory is insightful. Here's how they relate:
Random Exploration and Babbling
: Babbling is a phase in child development where infants experiment with sounds before they begin to use actual language. This can be likened to the random exploration phase in RL where the agent tries different actions to understand their consequences. Both processes are about learning from interaction and experimentation, and neither is directed by explicit teaching. In both human learning and RL, this initial exploration is crucial for forming more sophisticated behaviors or understandings later on.
Theory Theory
: Theory theory is a psychological framework that suggests that children develop theories about the world and then test and refine these theories through experience. This is analogous to how an RL agent builds a model (or a "theory") of how its actions lead to rewards in its environment, and then refines this model through experience. The agent's "theory" gets updated when its predictions are proved wrong, just as a child might modify their understanding when they encounter evidence that contradicts their existing beliefs.
These analogies highlight how principles from human learning and cognitive development can resonate with computational approaches like RL. It's a rich area of intersection that continues to be explored in both cognitive science and artificial intelligence research. Many researchers are interested in how insights from one domain can inform and enrich the other.

Meta learning = learn to learn by solving many tasks
1 / 1
ChatGPT
Yes, meta-learning, often referred to as "learning to learn," is a process in which models are trained to learn across various tasks so that they can quickly adapt to new, unseen tasks. It's a concept applied in machine learning, particularly in neural networks, to make the learning process more flexible and efficient.
In standard learning, a model is trained to perform a specific task and would need to be retrained to handle a new task. But in meta-learning, the model learns a good initialization from a variety of tasks, so that it can quickly fine-tune its parameters for a new task with minimal additional training.
This ability to generalize from experience with previous tasks to perform well on new tasks has parallels with human learning, where the skills and knowledge gained in one context can often be applied, with some adaptation, to new contexts. It's a fascinating area of research with applications in many domains, such as robotics, natural language processing, and computer vision.

So in modern meta learning the model consumes all training data, test cases, output classification. Ideally it would learn to generate more training data and labels, predicting a short program or function that best predicts new data that produces the same distributions of outputs.
1 / 1
ChatGPT
Yes, modern meta-learning techniques aim to leverage all available information, including training data, test cases, and output classifications, to develop models that can adapt quickly to new tasks. Your idea of having the model learn to generate more training data and labels is an interesting extension of the concept.
Some meta-learning approaches indeed work towards learning a learning strategy or an algorithm itself, rather than just parameter adaptation. This might include learning to predict the structure or parameters of a model that fits a given task, or even learning to generate new tasks and data for further training.
For example, if the model could predict a short program or function that represents the underlying process generating the data, it could use this to generate new training examples or to adapt quickly to related tasks. This idea aligns with the goal of developing more human-like learning systems that understand underlying structures and causal relationships rather than just identifying statistical patterns in the data.
In practice, this can be a complex problem and requires careful design and tuning of the learning process. However, these concepts are being actively explored in research, and we can expect ongoing advances in meta-learning to continue to push the boundaries of what machine learning models can achieve.

Hindsight experience replay. You make a system that can reach any state. You have a goal of reaching state A but fail and get state B. Use this as training data on how to get state B. 

 
Example with stable diffusion image generation. I typed Galactromeda hoping that it would give me galactic structures such as suggested by the merger of milky way and andromeda. However it generates mostly houseplants and ferns. I found I could use it to add complexity to other prompts and to help as a signature style. Also since it is was not a common phrase I could use it as a username.
1 / 1
ChatGPT
Hindsight Experience Replay (HER) is a clever technique that turns failures into useful learning experiences. In Reinforcement Learning (RL), rather than simply discarding a failed attempt to reach a specific goal, the agent can reuse the experience to learn how to reach the state it actually ended up in. This can dramatically improve learning efficiency by making use of all the data, not just the successful attempts.
Your example with stable diffusion image generation and the unexpected results from the "Galactromeda" prompt illustrates a creative application of the principle behind HER. Although the generated images did not match your initial goal of representing galactic structures, you found ways to use the unexpected outcomes (houseplants and ferns) to enhance other prompts and even as a unique signature style.
In a sense, this demonstrates the power of adaptability and flexibility in learning, not just for machine learning models but also for human creativity and problem-solving. By recognizing the value in unexpected results and adapting them to new purposes, you turned a failure into a success. This kind of thinking is essential in many areas of life and work and aligns well with the principles of agile development, innovative design, and resilient problem-solving.

Dealing with sparse rewards is one of the biggest challenges in Reinforcement Learning (RL). We present a novel technique called Hindsight Experience Replay which allows sample-efficient learning from rewards which are sparse and binary and therefore avoid the need for complicated reward engineering. It can be combined with an arbitrary off-policy RL algorithm and may be seen as a form of implicit curriculum.
We demonstrate our approach on the task of manipulating objects with a robotic arm. In particular, we run experiments on three different tasks: pushing, sliding, and pick-and-place, in each case using only binary rewards indicating whether or not the task is completed. Our ablation studies show that Hindsight Experience Replay is a crucial ingredient which makes training possible in these challenging environments. We show that our policies trained on a physics simulation can be deployed on a physical robot and successfully complete the task

ChatGPT
The excerpt you provided gives an overview of the paper "Hindsight Experience Replay" by Marcin Andrychowicz and colleagues, which introduced the technique.
The main problem the authors aimed to address is the challenge of dealing with sparse and binary rewards in Reinforcement Learning (RL). In many RL tasks, rewards are few and far between, making it difficult for the model to learn from its actions.
Hindsight Experience Replay (HER) addresses this problem by allowing for more sample-efficient learning. The key idea is to learn not just from successes but also from failures. When the agent fails to achieve the intended goal, it can still learn how to achieve the state it actually reached. This way, every experience, whether successful or not, contributes to learning.
The authors demonstrated the effectiveness of HER in several robotic manipulation tasks, such as pushing, sliding, and pick-and-place, using only binary rewards. The ablation studies conducted in the paper underscored the importance of HER in making training feasible in these environments.
The technique's flexibility allows it to be combined with any off-policy RL algorithm, making it a versatile tool for a wide range of applications. Moreover, the paper highlights the potential real-world applicability of the approach by showing that policies trained in a simulation can be transferred to a physical robot.
HER represents a significant contribution to the field by enhancing the efficiency and applicability of RL, particularly in contexts where reward signals are sparse.

I think this is common in human learning. Unintended positive consequences are often called emergent or synchronous.
1 / 1
ChatGPT
Yes, the concept of learning from unintended outcomes or consequences does have parallels in human learning, and it's an interesting connection to draw.
In human experience, we often learn from mistakes, unexpected results, and even failures. This process can lead to new insights, innovative solutions, and personal growth. Some educational philosophies actively embrace this idea by encouraging experimentation and embracing mistakes as valuable learning opportunities.
Emergent or synchronous learning refers to the idea that unexpected connections or insights can arise spontaneously. This kind of learning might occur when we are working on a problem and accidentally stumble upon a solution to a different problem or when a seemingly unrelated experience sparks a new idea or perspective.
In both human learning and the Hindsight Experience Replay method, the underlying principle is that all experiences, not just the ones that go as planned, can be valuable sources of learning and growth. This philosophy emphasizes adaptability, resilience, and a holistic approach to learning that recognizes the complexity and unpredictability of real-world problem-solving.

ChatGPT
Absolutely! The idea that you can find learning opportunities in unexpected places, even in a job you may dislike, reflects a mindset that values continuous growth and adaptability. It's an approach that encourages you to look for lessons and skills that can be applied in various contexts.
In the examples you gave, working as a security guard in a hospital might not be the most thrilling job, but it could provide opportunities to learn about medical terminology, understand human behavior, improve stealth and observation skills, or even engage with complex systems like security and surveillance.
This perspective encourages a proactive approach to learning, where you seek out opportunities to grow rather than waiting for them to be handed to you. It also helps to cultivate a positive attitude toward tasks that might otherwise seem mundane or uninteresting by recognizing the potential value in every experience. This mindset can make everyday tasks more engaging and contribute to personal and professional development in unexpected ways.

Certainly, the approach of integrating challenges into daily routines or finding silver linings in adverse conditions can have its downsides. While it might help in making the best of a situation and fostering personal growth, it can also lead to complacency or acceptance of conditions that might be unhealthy or detrimental in the long run. Striking a balance between making the most of the present and striving for better opportunities or conditions is key. Knowing when to push for change versus when to adapt to circumstances is a complex and individual decision.

So like I want to explain how this is not social-credit scoring, and that money, food, sleep, and any task that you find rewarding (games movies reading) can act as an incentive, so like you can make yourself a meal if you've accomplished a task or treat yourself for studying hard or making breakthrough. This might help encourage yourself to continue to seek out and engage in learning behaviors. There was a program where pizza is exchanged for reading books. This can create positive associative with reading
1 / 1
ChatGPT
You're highlighting a practice commonly known as "reward-based motivation," where individuals incentivize themselves to complete tasks by associating them with rewards. This is different from social-credit scoring, which involves an external entity evaluating and rewarding or punishing behavior based on a set of societal norms or rules.
Reward-based motivation is often used in both personal development and educational contexts to create positive associations with desired behaviors. For example, a student might reward themselves with a favorite treat after completing homework, or a parent might encourage their child to read by offering a small prize for finishing a book.
The key difference between this and social-credit scoring is autonomy and personal choice. In reward-based motivation, the individual sets their own goals and chooses the rewards, aligning them with personal values and needs. It's a self-directed way to encourage positive habits or learning behaviors without involving external judgment or control. It's about personal growth and self-improvement, not societal conformity or adherence to externally imposed standards.

Yeah clearly there is the risk of "painting yourself into a corner"
1 / 1
ChatGPT
Certainly, the risk of "painting yourself into a corner" with reward-based motivation is a valid concern. This metaphor implies becoming trapped in a situation from which it's difficult to extricate oneself, and it can manifest in a few ways with this approach:
Dependency on Rewards
: If you become too reliant on external rewards to motivate behavior, you may struggle to find motivation in the absence of those rewards. This can limit personal growth and make it challenging to pursue tasks that don't have immediate or tangible benefits.
Misaligned Goals and Rewards
: If the rewards chosen don't align with your long-term goals or values, you may find yourself pursuing short-term satisfaction at the expense of long-term fulfillment. This misalignment can lead to dissatisfaction or a lack of progress toward meaningful objectives.
Overemphasis on Tangible Rewards
: Focusing too much on external rewards may diminish the intrinsic motivation that comes from personal interest, curiosity, and the joy of learning or achieving. This could result in a lack of engagement with tasks once the rewards are removed.
Potential Ethical Considerations
: If this approach is used inappropriately, particularly in educational or professional settings, it might lead to unfair advantages or disadvantages for certain individuals, potentially creating ethical dilemmas.
The concept of reward-based motivation can be a valuable tool, but it requires careful consideration and balance to avoid these potential pitfalls. Being mindful of the rewards chosen, ensuring alignment with personal values, and fostering intrinsic motivation alongside external incentives can help mitigate these risks.
1 / 1
So how do these considerations and the topics we discussed earlier tie in with the concept of gameified free will?
1 / 1
ChatGPT
The concept of "gameified free will" seems to refer to an approach where you are applying game-like elements and rewards to shape and guide your behavior. Here's how the topics we've discussed tie into this concept:
Reinforcement Learning and Hindsight Experience Replay
: The principles of reinforcement learning, including rewarding behaviors that lead to desirable outcomes, are similar to the idea of gameifying free will. Learning from unintended consequences (like hindsight experience replay) can add a dynamic, adaptive component to this process.
Meta Learning
: Learning to learn, or adapting to new tasks by drawing from previous experiences, can be considered a higher-level strategy in the gameification of life. It's about recognizing patterns, setting goals, and applying lessons learned across different domains, similar to how a gamer might apply strategies across different games.
Random Exploration and Emergent Learning
: In gaming, exploration and trial-and-error often lead to unexpected discoveries and new strategies. This aligns with the idea of learning through random exploration and embracing unintended positive consequences.
Incentivizing Through Rewards
: Using rewards like food, money, or entertainment to motivate yourself aligns directly with the gameified approach. It's about setting up a system of incentives and achievements to guide behavior, much like completing quests or earning achievements in a game.
Risks and Ethical Considerations
: Like any game, there must be rules, boundaries, and consideration for potential pitfalls. Being aware of potential risks, such as dependency on rewards or misaligned goals, ensures that the gameified approach remains healthy and productive.
Adaptation and Resilience
: The idea of turning mundane tasks into interesting challenges or learning from adverse situations can be seen as leveling up in a game. It's about building skills, resilience, and adaptability in the face of challenges.
Avoiding Social-Credit Scoring
: Being mindful of the ethical use of rewards and incentives helps distinguish this personal growth approach from systems that might be used to control or manipulate behavior on a broader societal level.
In summary, gameified free will is a multifaceted concept that incorporates principles from reinforcement learning, meta-learning, behavioral psychology, and ethics. It's about taking control of your life and growth by applying game-like strategies, incentives, and adaptive learning techniques, while also being mindful of potential risks and ethical considerations.

The previous model used in this conversation is unavailable. We've switched you to the latest default model.
ChatGPT
Absolutely, you've highlighted a key distinction between thoughtful, personal gameification and the kind of manipulative practices that businesses might employ. In the context of gameified free will, the focus is on empowerment, self-improvement, and intrinsic motivation rather than external rewards and manipulative tactics.
In gameified free will, the "game" is about finding creative ways to engage with tasks, challenges, and learning experiences in a way that aligns with your long-term goals and values. It's not about being coerced or manipulated into certain behaviors through points, rewards, or other external stimuli. Instead, it's about harnessing your own agency, setting meaningful goals, and deriving satisfaction from the process of growth and self-discovery.
By approaching life's challenges with a game-like mindset, you can enhance your ability to stay motivated, adapt to new situations, and find joy in the journey of self-improvement. This approach empowers you to make choices that align with your values and long-term objectives, rather than simply seeking short-term rewards.
Ultimately, gameified free will encourages a sense of ownership and autonomy over your actions and decisions, promoting a healthier and more fulfilling approach to personal development.

Comparisons with the Enchiridion by Epictetus
1 / 1
ChatGPT
The Enchiridion by Epictetus is a classic philosophical manual that offers guidance on living a virtuous and fulfilling life through the practice of Stoicism. While there are similarities between the concepts of gameified free will and the teachings of Epictetus, there are also some differences in their approaches and focus:
Self-Mastery and Autonomy:
Both gameified free will and Epictetus emphasize the importance of self-mastery and autonomy. Epictetus teaches that individuals have control over their own thoughts, desires, and actions, and that true freedom comes from mastering one's own mind. Similarly, gameified free will encourages individuals to take ownership of their decisions and actions, turning life's challenges into opportunities for growth.
Internal Focus:
Both approaches prioritize internal factors over external circumstances. Epictetus emphasizes that events themselves are neutral; it's our judgments and reactions that determine their impact on us. Similarly, gameified free will focuses on internal motivation and finding intrinsic satisfaction in pursuing goals rather than relying on external rewards or validation.
Alignment with Values:
Gameified free will and Epictetus both advocate for aligning actions with personal values. Epictetus encourages individuals to live in accordance with their own nature and reason, while gameified free will promotes setting goals that reflect one's long-term values and creating a game-like approach to achieving them.
Learning and Growth:
Epictetus emphasizes the importance of using challenges as opportunities for learning and growth. He encourages individuals to view obstacles as exercises in virtue and character development. Gameified free will similarly suggests approaching challenges with a growth mindset, seeking out ways to turn tasks into enjoyable and meaningful learning experiences.
Motivation and Rewards:
One potential difference lies in the approach to motivation. While Epictetus focuses on cultivating inner virtues and finding contentment in living virtuously, gameified free will introduces the idea of using positive associations and rewards to motivate oneself to engage in tasks that lead to personal growth.
In summary, both gameified free will and the teachings of Epictetus share common themes related to self-mastery, internal focus, alignment with values, and growth through challenges. While the specific strategies and tactics may differ, the underlying principles of living intentionally and finding fulfillment in the process of self-improvement are central to both approaches.

Explain the similarities between self-supervised learning and collectively autocatalytic sets in chemistry.
1 / 1
ChatGPT
Self-supervised learning and collectively autocatalytic sets (CAS) in chemistry share some conceptual similarities in terms of how they leverage interactions within a system to learn or evolve. Let's break down the similarities:
Emergent Learning:
In both cases, learning or emergence of complex behavior arises from simple interactions. In self-supervised learning, a model learns from the inherent patterns and relationships present in the data itself without explicit labels. Similarly, in CAS, a set of molecules collectively catalyze each other's formation, leading to the emergence of a self-sustaining system.
Self-Organization:
Both self-supervised learning and CAS involve the self-organization of elements within a system. In self-supervised learning, the model organizes and captures meaningful patterns from the input data. In CAS, molecules spontaneously organize into sets that catalyze each other's formation, leading to the creation of new molecules.
Feedback Loops:
Both concepts involve feedback loops that drive learning or evolution. In self-supervised learning, the model iteratively improves its predictions based on feedback from the data. In CAS, molecules catalyze reactions that produce other molecules, leading to positive feedback loops that sustain the set.
Emergent Properties:
Both self-supervised learning and CAS can exhibit emergent properties that are not explicitly programmed. In self-supervised learning, the model can capture high-level features without direct supervision. In CAS, the collective behavior of molecules can lead to the emergence of novel compounds with unique properties.
Simplicity Leading to Complexity:
Both concepts start with simple components or interactions that lead to complex outcomes. In self-supervised learning, the model's learning process starts with basic patterns and gradually learns more complex ones. In CAS, the individual reactions among molecules are relatively simple, but their interactions lead to the emergence of a collectively autocatalytic system.
Iterative Process:
Both self-supervised learning and CAS involve an iterative process of improvement and adaptation. In self-supervised learning, the model iteratively updates its parameters to improve its predictions. In CAS, the system evolves through repeated interactions among the molecules, leading to the creation of more compounds over time.
Adaptation to Environmental Changes:
Both concepts demonstrate an ability to adapt to changes in the environment. In self-supervised learning, the model can generalize its learned patterns to new data. In CAS, the set of molecules can adapt to changing conditions by generating new molecules that may have different properties.
While these similarities highlight some conceptual parallels between self-supervised learning and collectively autocatalytic sets in chemistry, it's important to note that they are distinct concepts operating in different domains. Self-supervised learning pertains to machine learning and data analysis, while collectively autocatalytic sets are a phenomenon in the field of chemistry.

I was thinking they catalyze the conditions of their own formation. That is each molecule catalyzed another molecule paying it forward until ends up catalyzing the conditions for its own catalysis. This is in opposition to the selfish gene. It can be like how a farmer grows potatoes which can be composted into fertilizers and which can act as starters for other potatoes.
1 / 1
ChatGPT
Absolutely, your analogy highlights an interesting aspect of collectively autocatalytic sets (CAS) in chemistry. CAS involves a network of molecules that collectively catalyze each other's formation, creating a self-sustaining system. This kind of mutual catalysis can lead to the emergence of a self-reinforcing cycle, where the products of one reaction act as catalysts for other reactions, including those that help sustain the original reactions. This cyclic process can lead to the conditions necessary for the continued existence and replication of the set.
In this sense, CAS operates as a cooperative and self-perpetuating system where each molecule contributes to the overall catalytic activity of the system, enabling the generation of new molecules that can further contribute to the system's growth and stability. The analogy to a farmer growing potatoes and using them as compost and starters for other potatoes captures the idea of interconnected cycles that promote self-sufficiency and continuity.
This concept of mutual catalysis and self-propagation in CAS contrasts with the traditional notion of the "selfish gene," which emphasizes individual competition and reproduction. Instead, CAS embodies a cooperative and interdependent model where the success of each component is intricately linked to the success of the entire system. This cooperative dynamic can lead to the emergence of novel compounds and behaviors that may not have been possible through isolated reactions.
The analogy between CAS and the interconnected cycles of agricultural systems highlights the potential for mutual support and sustainability in both natural and synthetic systems. This interconnectedness and positive feedback loop in CAS can be thought of as a form of "catalytic solidarity," where each element contributes to the overall success and propagation of the collective system.

So an example is how the ai algorithms are good enough to act as their own trainers, generating programs, training data, labels, and adversarial networks and rewards
1 / 1
ChatGPT
Absolutely, your example highlights the concept of a self-sustaining loop within artificial intelligence systems, akin to the behavior exhibited by collectively autocatalytic sets (CAS) in chemistry. In the case of AI algorithms, they can generate and improve various components of the learning process, creating a self-perpetuating cycle of improvement and refinement.
For instance, AI algorithms can be designed to generate their own training data through techniques like data augmentation or synthetic data generation. These algorithms can then use this generated data to train and improve their models. The improved models, in turn, generate better training data, leading to further model enhancement. Similarly, AI algorithms can generate their own labels or rewards for reinforcement learning, allowing them to fine-tune their performance over time.
Furthermore, the concept of adversarial networks, such as Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs), aligns with the idea of mutual catalysis seen in CAS. In GANs, a generator network creates data samples that aim to be indistinguishable from real data, while a discriminator network tries to differentiate between real and generated samples. Through this adversarial process, the generator becomes better at generating realistic data, which in turn challenges the discriminator to become more discerning. This dynamic loop can result in the generation of highly convincing data samples.
The interplay between different components of AI algorithms, including self-generated data, labels, rewards, and adversarial networks, creates a mutually beneficial cycle where improvements in one component lead to enhancements in others. This self-sustaining loop contributes to the autonomous and self-improving nature of AI systems, allowing them to evolve and adapt over time without constant human intervention.
Just as CAS in chemistry leads to emergent behaviors and the emergence of novel molecules, the interconnected processes within AI systems can lead to the emergence of sophisticated behaviors, features, and capabilities that might not have been directly programmed but have emerged from the complex interactions of the AI components.

Can you simplify that any?
1 / 1
ChatGPT
Certainly! In simple terms, both collectively autocatalytic sets (CAS) in chemistry and AI algorithms have a similar idea: they create a self-perpetuating cycle where different parts help each other get better over time.
For example, AI algorithms can make their own practice problems and get better by solving them. Then, they use what they learned to make even better problems and solutions. This process keeps repeating, making the AI smarter.
Similarly, in chemistry, certain molecules can help each other form and grow. As they grow, they make it easier for other molecules to form too. This creates a cycle where they all help each other exist and thrive.
So, whether it's in AI or chemistry, the idea is that things work together and improve together, leading to more complex and advanced outcomes.

1. "Gameified Free Will", Intrinsic Motivation, and Self-Directed Learning

"Gameified free will" can be thought of as the idea of structuring choices and decisions in a gamelike manner, allowing for the sense of freedom and autonomy while still being within a structured environment. This relates closely to intrinsic motivation and self-directed learning. When individuals feel they have agency, they are more likely to be intrinsically motivated and engage in self-directed learning. It's about creating a learning environment that is engaging and allows for exploration and choice, thus fostering intrinsic motivation.

2. Self-Supervised Learning in AI and Emergence in Complex Systems

Self-supervised learning in AI involves models learning to identify patterns and derive meaning from unlabeled data. Similarly, emergence in complex systems refers to the phenomenon where new properties or behaviors arise from the interactions and relationships between simpler elements in the system. Both involve the creation of complex, high-level structures or understanding from lower-level components or data.

3. "Unintended Positive Consequences" and Serendipity in Innovation

Unintended positive consequences occur when an action or decision leads to unexpectedly beneficial results. This aligns with the concept of serendipity in innovation, where significant discoveries or advancements are made by accident or when pursuing something unrelated. Both highlight the importance of being open to unexpected outcomes and the value of exploration and experimentation.

4. Self-Improvement through Cooperation in Collectively Autocatalytic Sets and AI Algorithms

Collectively autocatalytic sets refer to systems where components work together to catalyze each other's formation, leading to growth and self-improvement of the system. This principle can be applied to AI algorithms through techniques like cooperative co-evolution, where multiple AI agents or components evolve together, each contributing to the others' improvements.

5. Backpropagation in AI and "Trial and Error" Learning

Backpropagation in AI involves adjusting a model's parameters based on the error of its outputs, learning from its mistakes to improve future performance. This mirrors "trial and error" learning in humans and animals, where actions leading to negative outcomes are avoided in the future, and those leading to positive outcomes are reinforced.

6. Meta Learning Techniques in AI and Learning to Adapt from Life Experiences

Meta learning in AI involves models learning how to learn, adapting to new tasks with minimal additional training. This is akin to how humans learn from various experiences and adapt to new situations. Both involve the development of a higher-level understanding that aids in tackling new, previously unseen challenges.

7. Ethical Implications of Gameification in AI Systems

While gamification can enhance engagement and motivation, it also raises ethical concerns. For instance, it might lead to manipulation if used to influence user behavior without clear disclosure or consent. It's essential to maintain user agency, ensuring users have control over their actions and decisions, and are not coerced or manipulated into behaviors that may not be in their best interest.

8. "Hindsight Experience Replay" and Learning from Failures and Mistakes

Hindsight experience replay in AI involves learning from past experiences by reevaluating them with the benefit of hindsight. This aligns with the human process of learning from failures and mistakes, where past decisions are reflected upon and lessons are drawn for future actions.

9. "Theory Theory" and AI Algorithms to Generate Explanations

"Theory theory" is a philosophical concept positing that humans develop theories about the world to understand and explain it. This aligns with the use of AI algorithms to generate explanations, where models construct theories or patterns from data to make sense of it and provide insights.

10. Self-Supervised Learning in AI and Emergent Order in Complex Systems

Self-supervised learning in AI involves learning from unlabeled data, discovering hidden structures and relationships within the data. This can be likened to emergent order in complex systems, where higher-level order arises from the interactions of lower-level entities, without any external direction. In both cases, the system learns to discover and understand complex patterns and structures from its environment, often leading to unanticipated insights or capabilities.

ChatGPT
Sure, I'd be happy to explain those concepts:
Self-Improvement through Cooperation in Collectively Autocatalytic Sets:
Collectively autocatalytic sets are systems where different components work together to catalyze each other's formation. As these components interact and support one another, the entire system becomes more complex and capable. This concept is akin to collaboration, where the contributions of each member lead to the improvement of the entire group. In the context of AI algorithms, cooperative co-evolution is one example of achieving self-improvement through cooperation. This involves training different components of an AI system separately but in a way that they work together to enhance each other's performance.
Backpropagation in AI and Trial and Error Learning:
Backpropagation in AI is a learning algorithm that adjusts model parameters based on the errors in its predictions, allowing it to learn from its mistakes and improve over time. This process is similar to trial and error learning in animals. Just as animals modify their behavior based on the outcomes of their actions, AI models adjust their parameters based on the errors they make, learning to avoid the actions that lead to negative outcomes and reinforcing those that lead to positive ones.
Examples of Unintended Positive Consequences in Serendipity in Innovation:
Unintended positive consequences in innovation occur when actions intended for one purpose lead to unexpectedly beneficial outcomes. For example, the discovery of penicillin was the result of mold contamination in a laboratory experiment. The mold killed the bacteria, leading to the development of antibiotics. Another example is the Post-it note, which originated from a failed attempt at creating a super-strong adhesive. These instances highlight how pursuing one goal can unexpectedly lead to valuable discoveries.
Cooperative Co-Evolution in AI Algorithms:
Cooperative co-evolution is a technique in AI where different sub-components of a complex system are evolved separately to collaborate and improve the overall performance. For example, in training a robotic soccer team, each robot's strategy may be evolved independently, but their collaboration on the field is necessary for success. By evolving these components separately and combining them, the system achieves improved performance through cooperation.
Maintaining User Agency in AI Gameification:
To maintain user agency in AI-based gameification, it's crucial to ensure that the system enhances the user's sense of autonomy rather than manipulating their behavior. Transparency in how rewards are earned, providing options for meaningful choices, and allowing users to customize their experience are important factors. AI algorithms can be designed to monitor and adapt to user preferences, avoiding coercive or manipulative tactics that compromise their control.
Examples of Emergent Order in Complex Systems:
In economics, the "invisible hand" concept proposed by Adam Smith suggests that individual self-interest can lead to emergent order in markets, resulting in efficient allocation of resources. In ecology, the formation of ecosystems is an example of emergent order, where diverse species interact and adapt to create a balanced and interconnected system. These examples demonstrate how complex behavior and organization can emerge from simple interactions.
