Abstract
Gap junctions containing connexin 36 electrically couple interneurons in many brain regions and synchronize their activity. We used connexin-36 knock-out mice (Cx36(-/-)) to study the importance of electrical coupling between interneurons for spatial coding in the hippocampus and for different forms of hippocampus-dependent spatial memory. Recordings in behaving mice revealed that the spatial selectivity of hippocampal pyramidal neurons was reduced and less stable in Cx36(-/-) mice. Altered network activity was reflected in slower theta oscillations in the mutants. Temporal coding, assessed by determining the presence and characteristics of theta phase precession, had different dynamics in Cx36(-/-) mice compared with controls. At the behavioral level, Cx36(-/-) mice displayed impaired short-term spatial memory but normal spatial reference memory. These results highlight the functional role of electrically coupled interneurons for spatial coding and cognition. Moreover, they suggest that the precise spatial selectivity of place cells is not essential for normal performance on spatial tasks assessing associative long-term memory

This research by Kevin Allen and his team explores the importance of electrical connections, known as gap junctions, between interneurons in the brain. These junctions contain a protein called connexin 36, and they help synchronize the activity of interneurons.
The team used mice that had been genetically engineered to lack connexin 36 (Cx36(-/-) mice) to study the role of these junctions in spatial coding in the hippocampus, a part of the brain crucial for spatial memory, and in different types of spatial memory dependent on the hippocampus.
By recording the activity of neurons in behaving mice, they found that the spatial selectivity of the pyramidal neurons in the hippocampus (commonly known as place cells) was less precise and less stable in Cx36(-/-) mice. Additionally, they observed slower theta oscillations, a type of brain wave associated with spatial navigation and memory, in the mutant mice. The timing of neuronal firing, assessed by examining theta phase precession, was also different in the mutant mice compared to controls.
At a behavioral level, the Cx36(-/-) mice showed impaired short-term spatial memory but their long-term spatial memory, specifically spatial reference memory, was normal.
The findings from this study highlight the important role that electrical coupling between interneurons plays in spatial coding and cognition. They also suggest that precise spatial selectivity of place cells is not essential for normal performance on tasks assessing associative long-term memory.

Abstract
Electrical synapses are a type of cellular membrane junction referred to as gap junctions (GJs). They provide a direct way to exchange ions between coupled cells and have been proposed as a structural basis for fast transmission of electrical potentials between neurons in the brain. For this reason GJs have been regarded as an important component within the neuronal networks that underlie synchronous neuronal activity and field potential oscillations. Initially, GJs appeared to play a particularly key role in the generation of high frequency oscillatory patterns in field potentials. In order to assess the scale of neuronal GJs contribution to field potential oscillations in the hippocampal formation, in vivo and in vitro studies are reviewed here. These investigations have shown that blocking the main neuronal GJs, those containing connexin 36 (Cx36-GJs), or knocking out the Cx36 gene affect field potential oscillatory patterns related to awake active behavior (gamma and theta rhythm) but have no effect on high frequency oscillations occurring during silent wake and sleep. Precisely how Cx36-GJs influence population activity of neurons is more complex than previously thought. Analysis of studies on the properties of transmission through GJ channels as well as Cx36-GJs functioning in pairs of coupled neurons provides some explanations of the specific influence of Cx36-GJs on field potential oscillations. It is proposed here that GJ transmission is strongly modulated by the level of neuronal network activity and changing behavioral states. Therefore, contribution of GJs to field potential oscillatory patterns depends on the behavioral state. I propose here a model, based on large body of experimental data gathered in this field by several authors, in which Cx36-GJ transmission especially contributes to oscillations related to active behavior, where it plays a role in filtering and enhancing coherent signals in the network under high-noise conditions. In contrast, oscillations related to silent wake or sleep, especially high frequency oscillations, do not require transmission by neuronal GJs. The reliability of neuronal discharges during those oscillations could be assured by conditions of higher signal-to-noise ratio and some synaptic changes taking place during active behavior.

This research by Anna Posłuszny examines the role of electrical synapses, also known as gap junctions (GJs), in field potential oscillations in the hippocampal formation of the brain. These junctions, which allow for the direct exchange of ions between coupled cells, are considered essential for the fast transmission of electrical potentials between neurons and for synchronous neuronal activity.
Gap junctions, particularly those containing the protein connexin 36 (Cx36-GJs), were thought to play a significant role in the generation of high-frequency oscillatory patterns in field potentials. Posłuszny reviews both in vivo and in vitro studies to determine the extent of the contribution of neuronal GJs to these oscillations.
The research found that blocking Cx36-GJs or knocking out the Cx36 gene affects field potential oscillatory patterns associated with awake active behavior (gamma and theta rhythm), but not high-frequency oscillations that occur during silent wake and sleep.
Posłuszny proposes that the influence of Cx36-GJs on neuron population activity is more complex than previously assumed. The transmission through GJ channels and the function of Cx36-GJs in pairs of coupled neurons can offer explanations for the specific influence of Cx36-GJs on field potential oscillations. It is suggested that GJ transmission is significantly modulated by the level of neuronal network activity and changing behavioral states.
In a model proposed by Posłuszny, Cx36-GJ transmission contributes especially to oscillations related to active behavior. Here, they play a role in filtering and enhancing coherent signals in the network under high-noise conditions. In contrast, oscillations related to

silent wake or sleep, especially high frequency oscillations, do not require transmission by neuronal GJs. The reliability of neuronal discharges during these oscillations could be assured by conditions of higher signal-to-noise ratio and certain synaptic changes that occur during active behavior.
In summary, this research suggests that gap junctions play a crucial role in modulating neuronal activity and field potential oscillations in the hippocampus, with their influence being particularly pronounced during periods of active behavior. However, they appear to be less necessary during periods of silent wake or sleep. This indicates that the role of gap junctions in neuronal activity is complex and can vary depending on the state of the organism.

One gap junction channel is composed of two protein hexamers (or hemichannels) called connexons in vertebrates and innexons in invertebrates. The hemichannel pair connect across the intercellular space bridging the gap between two cells.[4][5][6] Gap junctions are analogous to the plasmodesmata that join plant cells.[7]

Gap junctions occur in virtually all tissues of the body, with the exception of adult fully developed skeletal muscle and mobile cell types such as sperm or erythrocytes. Gap junctions are not found in simpler organisms such as sponges and slime molds.

A gap junction may also be called a nexus or macula communicans. There has been some confusion with gap junctions being related to ephapses in the past. While an ephapse like a gap junction involves the transmission of electrical signals the two are different. Ephaptic coupling involves electrical signals external to the cells. Ephapses are often studied in the context of electrically induced potentials propogated amoung groups of nerve cell membranes even in the absence of gap junction communication with no discrete

Gap junctions are formed by two connexons (in vertebrates) or innexons (in invertebrates), each of which is a hexameric protein structure, or hemichannel. These hemichannels pair up and connect across the intercellular space, effectively bridging the gap between two cells. They are analogous to the plasmodesmata that connect plant cells.
Gap junctions are found in almost all tissues in the body, except for fully developed adult skeletal muscle and mobile cell types such as sperm or erythrocytes. They are not found in simpler organisms like sponges and slime molds.
Despite being also referred to as a nexus or macula communicans, gap junctions should not be confused with ephapses. Both involve the transmission of electrical signals, but they function differently. Ephaptic coupling involves electrical signals that are external to the cells, and ephapses are often studied in the context of electrically induced potentials that are propagated among groups of nerve cell membranes, even in the absence of gap junction communication and without discrete intercellular space.
