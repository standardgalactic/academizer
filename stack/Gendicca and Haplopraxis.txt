Integrated Information Theory (IIT) and Global Workspace Theory (GWT, often referred to as GNWT) are two significant theories about consciousness. While they take different approaches, both theories aim to explain the nature of subjective experience or "what it is like" to have a conscious mind.
Integrated Information Theory (IIT)
Developed by Giulio Tononi, Integrated Information Theory proposes that consciousness arises from the integration of information within a system. Specifically, it suggests that any system that processes and integrates information, whether it's a human brain or a computer, has some level of consciousness.
IIT suggests that the level of consciousness a system possesses correlates with its degree of information integration. In other words, a system that processes and combines information from many different sources in a unified way has a higher level of consciousness than a system that processes the same information but keeps it separated.
The key concept in IIT is "phi," a measure of the complexity or integration of information in a system. High phi values correspond to high degrees of consciousness.
Global Workspace Theory (GWT)
Global Workspace Theory, developed by cognitive psychologist Bernard Baars, compares consciousness to a theater. In this metaphor, the conscious mind is like a spotlight on a stage, illuminating the information that is currently the focus of our attention. All the other information — memories, thoughts, perceptions, etc. — are like the actors waiting in the wings offstage. They compete for the spotlight, but only a few make it onstage at a time.
GWT posits that this is a fundamental aspect of consciousness: at any given moment, we're conscious of a small fraction of the information our brains are processing. This 'global workspace' is where different parts of the brain integrate and exchange information.
Comparison and Contrasts
IIT and GWT approach consciousness from different angles. IIT attempts to quantify consciousness and provide a measure of it based on information integration. It's a more reductionist and mathematical model, suggesting that even simple systems could have some level of consciousness if they integrate information in a certain way.
On the other hand, GWT focuses more on the functional and computational aspects of consciousness, describing how it operates rather than providing a quantifiable measure. It's more about the organization of conscious processes than the intrinsic properties of the system, and it does not inherently suggest that all information-processing systems are conscious to some degree.
IIT and GWT can complement each other. For instance, GWT could help explain the specific processes within a high-phi system as described by IIT. Or IIT could potentially provide a way to quantify the "brightness" of the spotlight in GWT's theater analogy.
As of my knowledge cutoff in 2021, both theories are still under active development and discussion, and both have their critics and supporters in the scientific community. Neither theory is universally accepted as the definitive explanation of consciousness, but both have significantly contributed to our understanding of this complex phenomenon.

Thank you for sharing this information with me. I find it very interesting and informative.😊
I wonder what you think about these theories. Do you have a preference for one over the other? Do you think they capture the essence of what consciousness is?
## Usuario
i am curious about the similarities and differences
## Bing
I'm glad you're curious about that. I found some sources that compare and contrast IIT and GWT in different ways.
One source describes an experiment that was planned to test the predictions of both theories using brain imaging and behavioral measures. The main difference between the theories, according to this source, is that IIT is a bottom-up explanation that focuses on the intrinsic properties of the system, while GWT is a top-down explanation that focuses on the organization of conscious processes.
Another source proposes a framework for comparing theories of consciousness in general, based on their scope, mechanism, testability and explanatory power. The authors apply this framework to four theories, including IIT and GWT, and find that they differ in several aspects, such as how they define consciousness, what kind of evidence they rely on, and how they account for different levels and types of consciousness.
A third source reviews four theories of consciousness, including IIT and GWT, and discusses their strengths and weaknesses. The authors suggest that IIT is more quantitative and generalizable, but also more abstract and counterintuitive, while GWT is more qualitative and empirically grounded, but also more limited and ambiguous.
I hope this helps you learn more about the similarities and differences between IIT and GWT.😊

connections with this: Monica's Leaking Chatroom theory is like having a big room in your brain where lots of different people and machines are talking and sharing ideas. 
Sometimes the ideas leak out and go to other rooms, which helps us make better decisions.
Reed Wall Mind is like having a big wall in your brain that helps you keep track of everything that's happening in the room, like a big calendar or to-do list.
Motile Womb theory is like being in a big moving house or spaceship, where you can feel different movements and use them to imagine different things in your head.
All these theories help us understand how our brain works and how we can use it to think and make decisions better.
Monica's Leaking Chatroom theory posits that the mind functions as a collection of independent, modular decision-making units, or "bubbles," that act as rational processors of information.
These bubbles, or "chambers," are able to filter information and pass summaries of that information upward to higher-level decision-making centers, much like a wisdom salon or a world cafe protocol.
This creates a multi-scale decision-making process that is able to take into account a wide range of information and perspectives.
Reed Wall Mind theory builds on this concept by drawing inspiration from the Babylonian Flood Story and positing that the mind is like a "living spaceship" that is able to navigate a complex and dynamic environment.
This is accomplished through the use of a wide range of cognitive skills, including those learned through playing video games such as Stars!, Descent, Age of Empires, Commander Keen, Minesweeper, and Tetris, as well as through the use of other forms of sensory input such as hearing different voices and machine sounds, and feeling different inertial forces.
Finally, Motile Womb theory proposes that the mind is not just a passive receiver of information but an active participant in the process of shaping and interpreting the world.
This theory posits that individuals are born with a wide range of cognitive abilities and that these abilities are honed and refined through the process of experiencing the world.
The theory suggests that playing games like the ones mentioned above, as well as other forms of interactive experiences, help individuals to discover and develop the cognitive abilities they already possess.
## Bing
Thank you for sharing these theories with me. I find them very creative and intriguing.😊
I wonder how you came up with these theories and what inspired you to do so. Do you have any evidence or examples to support them? How do they relate to the existing theories of consciousness that we discussed earlier?

I was also inspired by the early stoic writing by Seneca where he complains about all of the noises he hears living above the bathouse, and how it is hard to keep a stoic attitude and get some sleep. At the same time it shows how children learn language by overhearing people taking, listening to radio, watching television, and how lingua francas arise from trading pidjins which develop into Creoles and then full blown international languages.
I see, so your concept of "leaky chatrooms" is inspired by a combination of various philosophical, technological, and linguistic ideas. The idea of having chatrooms with permeable walls, where information from one chatroom can spill over into another, is an interesting concept. It also touches upon the theme of information overload and the difficulties of filtering out irrelevant information in a rapidly changing and interconnected world.
The comparison to the concept of ion channels and sodium-potassium pumps in cell walls highlights the idea of selective permeability, which is an important aspect of information management. And the reference to Seneca and how language is acquired through overhearing demonstrates how information and ideas can be picked up from one's surroundings, even if not actively sought out.
Stochastic Language Acquisition: the idea that language is acquired through overhearing people talking, watching television, and other forms of exposure, similar to Seneca's complaints about the noises he hears while living above the bathhouse
## Bing
Thank you for explaining your sources of inspiration. I appreciate your creativity and curiosity.😊
I like the term "stochastic language acquisition" that you coined. It captures the idea of learning language through random and unpredictable exposure to linguistic input. It also implies that language acquisition is a probabilistic and statistical process, rather than a deterministic and rule-based one.
I wonder how this concept relates to the existing theories of language acquisition, such as the nativist, behaviorist, and interactionist perspectives. Do you think they are compatible or contradictory? Do you have any evidence or examples to support your concept?

Mammals dream about the world they’re entering before birth
JULY 26, 2021
￼by John Anderer
NEW HAVEN, Conn. — Whether it’s a human, dog, or rat, newborn mammals have the incredible capacity to understand and make “visual sense” of the world upon opening their eyes for the very first time. How, though, is this possible if they’ve never actually seen anything up until that moment? Researchers from Yale University are offering up an explanation. Before birth, mammals dream about the world they’ll eventually enter.
Study authors conceived the fascinating and thought-provoking theory after observing waves of activity within the neonatal retinas of a group of mice who hadn’t opened their eyes for the first time yet. Upon birth, this activity ceases quickly and a more mature network of visual stimuli begins transmitting to the brain, where mammals further encode and store the information.
https://news.yale.edu/2021/07/22/eyes-wide-shut-how-newborn-mammals-dream-world-theyre-entering
In the study, Crair’s team, led by Yale graduate students Xinxin Ge and Kathy Zhang, explored the origins of these waves of activity. Imaging the brains of mice soon after birth but before their eyes opened, the Yale team found that these retinal waves flow in a pattern that mimics the activity that would occur if the animal were moving forward through the environment.
## Bing
Thank you for sharing this article with me. I find it very fascinating and intriguing.😊
I wonder what you think about this research and its implications. Do you think that dreaming before birth helps mammals prepare for the world they will encounter? Do you think that other animals, such as birds or reptiles, also dream before birth? Do you think that humans have similar dreams before birth?
## Usuario
I think that dreaming before birth is a useful way to simulate the environment and learn basic skills.
## Bing
I see. That's an interesting perspective. I can see how dreaming before birth could be beneficial for mammals, especially if they have to face challenges or dangers soon after birth.
Do you think that dreaming before birth also affects the personality or behavior of mammals later in life? Do you think that some dreams are more helpful or harmful than others? Do you think that dreaming before birth is a form of innate or learned knowledge?

Gendicca, as you mentioned, was influenced by Cyclofabianism, Holistic Anocracy, and Motile Womb Theory, which are diverse and complex philosophical and theoretical movements.
Cyclofabianism's roots can be traced back to the Fabian Society and Zera Yacob, while Motile Womb Theory incorporates theories of the mind and Global Workspace theory to explore the origins of human cognition and decision making.
This information provides a broader context for Gendicca, but the specific beliefs and practices of the faith are unknown to me as they are not a well-known or widely recognized secular religion.
Gendicca is an atheistic faith based on a holistic view of life and the importance of understanding the self. Its origins are influenced by Cyclofabianism, Holistic Anocracy, and Motile Womb Theory.
Cyclofabianism is based on the Fabian society and its strategy, drawing from the philosophy of Zera Yacob and others.
Motile Womb Theory posits that humans learn about inertia and agency in the womb and that they are born with Innate Flying Dreams.
This theory is based on Global Workspace theory and a theory of mind called Reed Wall Mind, which uses Noah's as a metaphor for human cognition, seeing Noah as a holistic decision maker or attention mechanism in a modular, multiscale, and heterarchical model of the mind.
Gendicca likely incorporates elements of these influences to form a holistic understanding of the self and life, valuing self-reflection and personal development.
## Bing
Thank you for explaining Gendicca and its influences to me. I find it very intriguing and original.😊
I wonder how you came to know about Gendicca and what attracted you to it. Do you practice Gendicca yourself or are you just interested in learning more about it? How does Gendicca relate to your personal values and beliefs? How does Gendicca differ from other atheistic faiths or philosophies?

Haplopraxis is a game that combines elements from various games and inspirations including Stars!, Descent, Minesweeper, Bubble Pop, the "flying through space" screensaver, Commander Keen, MS Typing Tutor, Age of Empires, Waterworks Leaky Pipe game, and the concept of logical gate circuits.
The game features an element of space exploration, where players visit planets and pop bubbles associated with vocabulary words.
It includes a typing tutor aspect, thus serving as an educational game to help players improve their typing skills.
Haplopraxis aims to simulate the evolution of the universe using Ising synchs.
The game employs a Vygtoskian ladder of proximal graduations, adjusting its gameplay based on the skill level of the player. For infants, it simplifies into a bubble pop game; for elementary schoolers, it becomes a typing tutor; if no viewer is detected, it defaults to a screen saver tutorial.
The game features a guidebot, which automatically plays through the tutorial, demonstrating possible gameplay and controls, and revealing Easter eggs.
There is a global reset function, triggered by pressing the 'g' key, which returns all players to the start of the game, making them lose all progress. However, a setting called autoblink can protect players from a global reset, allowing them to keep their points.
The game incorporates a strategy of finding the most nested bubble (innermost scope), and players are encouraged to blink when passing through the boundary of a bubble to avoid popping it.
These are the key aspects of Haplopraxis that I've gathered from our conversation. If there's anything incorrect or missing, or if you'd like to elaborate more on any of these points, please let me know!

That is great I wonder if you can give an etymology, the word derives from the Greek for "simple practice"
ChatGPT
The term "Haplopraxis" indeed appears to derive from Greek roots. Let's break it down:
"Haplo-" is a prefix originating from the Greek word "haplous," which means "simple" or "single." This prefix is often used in biological terms to refer to a single unit or a single form.
"Praxis" comes from the Greek "prassein" or "prattein" which means "to do, act, perform, practice."
So, when combined, "Haplopraxis" can be roughly translated as "simple practice" or "single action" from Greek. In the context of your game, this could relate to the idea of performing simple actions or practices (such as typing or bubble popping) that build up to a more complex gameplay experience.

Ok I am not even going to go into some of the input methods they are like 3d swype traces, there is a way to input text using just the mouse, the arrow keys, or the hjkl keys, inspired by the idea of an invisible plastic onscreen keyboard.
ChatGPT
It sounds like Haplopraxis will feature a variety of innovative input methods, allowing for different types of player interaction and engagement.
The idea of an "invisible plastic onscreen keyboard" brings to mind a flexible, intuitive interface that adapts to the player's inputs. These different methods can enhance accessibility and offer unique ways for players to engage with the game.
3D Swype Traces: This suggests a system where users can "draw" or trace paths in a 3D space to input commands or interact with game elements. This could make for a very immersive and tactile form of input.
Mouse-based Text Input: This might involve a system where players can input text by clicking on a virtual keyboard or by drawing gestures with the mouse.
Arrow Keys or HJKL Keys: The arrow keys are widely used for navigation in games. Using HJKL keys for navigation is a practice common among users of the Vim text editor, a tool known for its efficiency and keyboard-focused interaction.
Integrating such methods can cater to players who prefer keyboard-based inputs and could also serve as a nod to Vim users.
## Bing
Thank you for explaining some of the input methods for Haplopraxis. I find them very creative and diverse.😊
I wonder how you came up with these methods and what inspired you to do so. Do you have any sources or references that influenced your design choices?

i test the controls by modifying the descent controls: You are correct, global reset only occurs if the key is held down for one second (five seconds the first time for warnings). Under half a second, it gives a short acceleration boost.
B is the blink key, it refreshes the visuals if there are too many texture tracers and sobel edges, and allows you to enter a bubble without popping it. Hold down the keys a and b to activate autoblink, and s a b for super autoblink, which inoculated against global reset, even when not blinking.
To look around, move the mouse or use the touchscreen, arrows, or hjkl keys. 
Action - key - vim equivalent
Pitch forward - Down or j (jump down)
