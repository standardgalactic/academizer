1. Introduction

Deep learning methods have achieved state-of-the-art results on a plethora of medical image segmentation tasks, but their application in clinical settings remains challenging due to issues pertaining to lack of reliability and miscalibration of confidence estimates. Relatively little research has been done into how models behave when processing unexpected inputs.

Out-of-distribution detection in medical imaging has been mostly approached through the lens of reconstruction-based techniques. Standard deep neural networks often exhibit high confidence in predictions estimates when processing unseen samples that are not from the data manifold of the training set. Bayesian approaches that assign posteriors over weights or in function space have been proposed to alleviate this problem, but do not necessarily lend themselves to reliable OOD detection capabilities. Foong et al. (2019) describe a limitation in the expressiveness of the predictive uncertainty estimate given by mean-field variational inference (MFVI) when applied as the inference technique for Bayesian Neural Networks (BNNs).

Hybrid approaches to image classification using GPs have garnered interest in the past years. The first convolutional kernel was proposed in 2017, with promising improvements in accuracy.

We propose a simpler convolutional mechanism that alleviates the computational cost of optimizing over inducing points' locations residing in high dimensional spaces. We replace each individual component of a standard convolutional layer in convolutional neural networks with Distributional Gaussian Processes (DistGP) used in one-to-one mapping manner, essentially acting as a non-parametric activation function, and show that our proposed module is also suited for OOD detection on both toy/image data and biomedical scans.

In this section we explore the concept of distance-awareness and smoothness constraints for biomedical image segmentation, and propose a probabilistic module for OOD detection.

1.1 Uncertainty quantification for biomedical imaging segmentation

Standard neural networks can be trained with the softmax probability, but the uncertainty estimates are often overconfident. Bayesian models separate uncertainty into aleatoric (data intrinsic) and epistemic (model parameter uncertainty).

Previous work has considered aleatoric uncertainty in medical image segmentation, but has produced samples that vary pixel by pixel and thus may not capture complex spatially correlated structures in the distribution of segmentations maps. The probabilistic U-Net produces samples with limited diversity, but can be improved by adding variational dropout.

1.2 Distributional Uncertainty as a proxy for OOD detection

Besides the dichotomy consisting of aleatoric and epistemic uncertainty, highlighting certain inputs which have undergone a domain shift or out-of-distribution samples has garnered a lot of interest in the past years.

A problem with introducing new types of uncertainty is how to disentangle it from epistemic uncertainty. The Deep Ensembles paper proposes to measure the disagreement between different sub-models of the deep ensemble.

We can reduce epistemic uncertainty by adding more data, but we cannot reduce it outside the data manifold. Hence, the disagreement metric introduced in Lakshminarayanan et al. (2017) cannot achieve this separation, confounding the two types of uncertainty.

Malinin and Gales (2018) introduced the separation of total uncertainty into three components: epistemic, aleatoric and distributional uncertainty. They argue that aleatoric uncertainty is a "known-unknown" and distributional uncertainty is an "unknown-unknown".

Figure 1 shows the probability simplex for a 3 class classification problem. The ensemble of predictions is concentrated in a corner with increased diversity, due to epistemic uncertainty, aleatoric uncertainty, and distributional uncertainty.

Malinin and Gales (2018) propose to introduce a latent variable over the categorical variables corresponding to each class, parametrized as a distribution over distributions on a simplex. This latent variable represents the uncertainty of the prediction.

The authors argue that using a measure of spread of the ensemble will be more informative than using the difference between entropy and conditional entropy.

This paper proposes a framework for uncertainty disentanglement using DNN-parametrized Dirichlet distributions.

1.3 Distance awareness and smoothness for out-of-distribution detection

For an abstract data generating distribution, we can consider the in-distribution data generating distribution pind (y | x) and the out-of-distribution data generating distribution pood (y | x) as mixtures of the in-distribution and OOD generating distributions.

During training, we are only learning pind (y | x) and therefore our model is completely in the dark with regards to pood (y | x). Therefore, the optimal strategy is for pood (y | x) to be predicted as a uniform distribution, thus signalling the lack of knowledge of the model on this different input domain.

Definition 1 does not make any assumptions about the architecture of the model from which the predictive distribution stems.

Distances between data points in input space should be correlated with distances in the learned representation, which is equipped with a enc(X) metric. GPs satisfy the distance-aware condition for the last layer predictor.

In this paper we will consider network smoothness constraints and how to quantify the smoothness of a network/function. In mathematical analysis, a function is said to be k-smooth if the first k derivatives exist and are continuous, but this definition wouldn't aid us in ensuring the second condition of distance-awareness. Lipschitz functions are continuous in two metric spaces and have an upper limit in how much outputs can change with respect to distances in input space. Bi-Lipschitz continuous functions are also continuous in a neighbourhood of x and maintain useful information.

1.4 Contributions

This work introduces a Bayesian layer that can act as a drop-in replacement for standard convolutional layers. It achieves competitive results in segmentation tasks in comparison to a U-Net, and improves OOD detection results compared to previous approaches.

2. Background

In this section, we review the theoretical toolkit required for the remainder of the paper, including foundational material on Gaussian Processes, attempts to sparsify GPs, and uncertainty disentanglement frameworks.

2.1 Primer on Gaussian Processes

A Gaussian Process (GP) is a generalization of multivariate Gaussian random variables to infinite sets.

A covariance function has to satisfy certain conditions in order to generate non-negative-definite covariance matrices. Second-order stationary processes have constant means and are invariant to translations.

The kernel variance controls the variance of the process, more specifically the amplitude of function samples. The lengthscale values represent the strength along a particular dimension of input space by which successive values are strongly correlated.

We use the kernel hyperparameters as point-mass to find the posterior p (f (x ) | y) for unseen data points x.

GPs are distance-aware provided we use a translation-invariant kernel, and their predictive variance increases monotonically as a function of distance. This variance will be used to assess if inputs are in or outside the distribution.

GP is hindered by matrix inversion operations which have O(n3 ) time and O(n2 ) memory for training.

2.2 Sparse Variational Gaussian Processes

Due to the consistency property of Gaussian Processes, one can marginalize out U to recover the initial joint prior over p(f,f ).

Titsias (2009) introduced a variational lower bound for regression tasks using augmented probability spaces.

In terms of doing exact inference in this new model, the posterior p(f |y) and marginal likelihood p(y) remain unchanged even with the augmentation of the probability space by U due to the marginalization properties of Gaussian processes.

Stochastic Variational Inference (SVI) enables the application of Variational Inference to extremely large datasets by virtue of performing inference over a set of global variables.

We factor a model with respect to observations at training and testing time, conditioned on the global variables U , and try to minimize the Kullback-Leibler divergence by introducing a variational distribution q(F,U ) and minimizing the log marginal likelihood. The variational lower bound for the frequency of the fluttering noise is given by: log p(y) q(U ), log N (y | Kfu Kuu1 U,noise2 In ) p(U ) q(U ) dU , and log p(Y | F )p(F | U )q(U )dF dU .

The variational posterior is explicit in this case, where q(F,U ) = p(F | U ; X,Z )q(U).

, where the last equation is factorized with respect to individual observations. This lower variational bound is maximized with respect to variational parameters U and hyperparameters of the model Z,noise2.

Figure 3 shows the predictive mean and variance of SVGP and GP. Not all training points are crucial in devising the decision boundary.

2.3 Uncertainty decomposition in SVGP through evidential learning lens

We have introduced the uncertainty decomposition framework and have now expanded on this topic to include deep evidential learning models.

Evidential learning directly parametrizes predictive distributions over the probability simplex, and averts parametrizing the logit space, subsequently feeding it through a softmax function. Dirichlet networks involve having a NN predict the concentration parameters of the Dirichlet distribution.

To sample from the Dirichlet distribution we use a GP, and then use an exp function to transform it. We can then use moment matching to ensure a good approximation.

We can use a natural logarithm to approximate a heteroskedastic regression model, and apply the standard inference scheme for full GP or sparsify the model and apply the SVGP framework.

Dirichlet-based GP for Classification can be approximated via Monte Carlo integration, and the model uncertainty can be decomposed into two components: aleatoric and distributional uncertainty.

The variance h() captures the shift from within to outside the data manifold, while the variance g() captures the uncertainty present inside the data manifold.

The distributional differential entropy in logit space will be measured by the diagonal terms of the Schur complement.

2.4 Deep Gaussian Processes fail in propagating distributional uncertainty

Damianou and Lawrence (2013) introduced Deep Gaussian Processes, which are a multi-layered hierarchical formulation of GPs.

To enable faster inference over our Bayesian hierarchical model, we augment each layer with Ml inducing points' locations Zl1 and Ul.

Popescu et al. (2020) argued that total uncertainty in the hidden layers of a DGP will be higher for OOD data points in comparison to in-distribution data points only under a set of conditions. We briefly lay out the details here.

Popescu et al. (2020) propose a realistic scenario whereby the inducing points Zl of particular layer are spread out such that they cover the entire spectrum of possible samples from the previous layer Fl1 . They show that the total variance in the second layer will be higher compared to the prior variance.

Figure 4 shows the layer-wise decomposition of uncertainty into parametric/epistemic and non-parametric/distributional for a zero mean function DGP.

We can use a 2 layer DGP trained on a toy regression task to investigate whether the model respects the inequality for propagating higher total uncertainty for OOD data points in comparison to in-distribution data points. The total variance for OOD data points in the final layer is higher, as this was brought upon by the high absolute value of the first order derivative around 0 in the second layer. Conversely, the total variance for in-distribution points in the final layer is relatively small.

In a DGP with two hidden layers trained on a toy regression dataset, an outlier gets correctly identified in input space but dissipates in the next layer as it gets mapped to regions where the next GP assigns inducing point locations.

2.5 Wasserstein-2 kernels for probability measures

Analytically integrating out the prior of a DGP is intractable when using kernels operating in Euclidean space. However, using kernels operating on probability measures is tractable.

The Wasserstein space on R is defined as the set of probability measures on R with a finite moment of order two.

Wasserstein-2 Distance between Gaussian distributions is defined as the distance between two multivariate Gaussian distributions with associated Gaussian measures, and implicitly the Wasserstein metric is well defined for them.

2.6 Distributional Deep Gaussian Processes &amp; OOD detection

We have seen that DGPs can fail to propagate distributional uncertainty forward, but Popescu et al. (2020) introduced a variant of DGPs that ensures distance-awareness properties.

The first two moments are obtained through the F1det operation in the generative process, and are treated as hyperparameters that are optimized during training.

We can consider an OOD point with high total variance and an in-distribution point with low total variance in a two-layered DGPs and DDGPs, and show that what was initially flagged as OOD in the first hidden layer will be considered as in-distribution by the second hidden layer.

The hybrid kernel has a higher non-parametric variance than the euclidean kernel because of the higher distance between the now distributional inducing point location and xood .

3. Distributional GP Layers

Early methods for uncertainty quantification in Bayesian deep learning focused on estimating the variance of sample from difference sub-models. More recent methods focus on estimating proxies for distributional uncertainty in a single-pass, such as bi-Lipschitz regularized feature extractors for GP or parametrizing second-order uncertainty via neural networks within the framework of evidential learning.

Integrating GPs in convolutional architectures has garnered interest in the past years, with hybrid approaches being the first attempt to unify the two approaches. Blomqvist et al. (2018) proposed to use a convolutional GP on top of a succession of feed-forward GP layers to extend this shallow GP model to accommodate deeper architectures. However, this framework is problematic for two reasons: it requires training high-dimensional multi-output GPs and ignores correlations between channels.

3.1.1 Generative Process

We introduce a stacked DistGP using Wasserstein-2 kernels as the encoder network, and use the first two moments of the penultimate layer to introduce a DistGP so as to obtain the final predictions.

We have inducing points Zl and uncertain input Fl1 and use a diagonal matrix for both l and Zl. The standard predictive equations for SVGP are used for the first layer.

In our case, the uncertain input for the final distributional GP is a factorized posterior between layers and dimensions. This gives the DWKL variational lower bound.

We provide pseudo-code for the previously mentioned operations (see Algorithm 1).

3.2 Module Architecture

We describe a 2D convolution model for a square kernel with width Wl , height Hl and Cl channels at the l-th layer of a multi-layer model. The convolved GP0 is the SGP operating on the Euclidean space of patches of the input image.

A measure-preserving DistGP layer is convolved on input data to introduce non-linearities and to propagate distributional uncertainty.

To preserve distance in Wasserstein-2 space, we apply a DistGPl : Flpre,[p,1]  N (m,k) many-to-one on the preactivation patches to arrive at Flpost . This new module, entitled "Measure preserving DistGP", is offered in Algorithm 2. Previous research has highlighted the importance of having an upper bound on the h-index and a lower bound on the h-index to ensure robustness towards adversarial examples.

3.3 Imposing Lipschitz Conditions in Convolutionally Warped DistGP

If a sample is identified as an outlier at certain layer, we would like to preserve that status throughout the remainder of the network. We accomplish this by quantifying the "Lipschitzness" of our "Measure preserving DistGP" layer.

3.4 Feature-collapse in DistGP layers

In this subsection we investigate the properties of DistGP layers from a function-space view, and whether feature collapse is inherently encouraged by our loss function.

We introduce notation conventions for warped GP layers, and then construct a DistGP layer by taking values in the space of continuous functions C (ul ; Rml ).

One can easily see that DWKL can be recovered by taking l = id, instead of the affine embedding, and by defining the prior post-activation layers in the following recursive manner. The proof can be found in Appendix B.

3.5 Over-correlation in latent space

Ober et al. (2021) have highlighted a certain pathology in DKL applied to regression problems in the non-sparse scenario, which corresponds to the feature collapse phenomenon.

The authors show that once the model has reached convergence, it can only increase its log-likelihood score by modifications to the complexity penalty term.

To minimize Kff, one must have high correlations in Kff and noise2, but this decreases model fit.

After convergence in the data fit term, the model has to achieve over-correlation in Qff while still minimizing Kff Qff .

3.6 Pooling operations on stochastic layers

Previous work that combined GP with convolutional architectures has used simple architectures involving a couple of stacked layers. In this paper we propose to experiment with more modern architectures such as DenseNet Huang et al. (2017) or ResNet He et al. (2016).

We consider probability measures and fixed weights for the set of Borel probabilities on R with finite second moment.

4. DistGP Layer Networks &amp; OOD detection

An outlier is a data point that deviates considerably from some concept of normality. It can be formalised as a data point that lies in a low probability region under a threshold.

We aim to visually assess if imposing a Lipschitz condition via Proposition 5 negatively influences the predictive capabilities. We can notice a slight smoothing effect on the predictive mean in output space.

We aim to understand whether over-correlation occurs for our model. The sparse framework does remove unwanted over-correlations in the final hidden layer latent space, and the unitary Lipschitz constraint increases correlation.

4.1 Reliability of in-between uncertainty estimates

We compare our newly introduced module to a collapsed SGPR and a three layer DistGP-Layers network, and expect our model to offer high distributional uncertainty estimates between 2.0 and 4.0.

To test if our newly introduced module can provide reliable within-data uncertainty estimates, we can subsample a dataset and observe that the within-data uncertainty has substantially increased in the [0, 2.5] interval.

We have used a standard stacked convolutional approach to compare our model against the original shallow Convolutional Gaussian process Van der Wilk et al. (2017) and Deep Convolutional Gaussian Process (DeepConvGP) Blomqvist et al. (2018).

We used 64 hidden units for the "Convolutionally Warped DistGP" part of the module, 5 hidden units for the "DistGP activation-function" part, and 250 inducing points at each layer in all experiments.

Table 1 shows the classification accuracy on MNIST and CIFAR-10 for different Convolutional GP models. Our method achieves superior classification accuracy compared to DeepConvGP (Blomqvist et al., 2018), and adds more layers increases the performance significantly.

We test if DistGP-DeepConv models outperform OOD detection models from literature such as DUQ, OVA-DM and OVVNI on different fonts of digits. Our model shows higher predictive entropy and differential entropy for distributional uncertainty for digits stemming from a wide array of fonts.

Table 2 shows that all models exhibit a shift in their uncertainty measure between MNIST and notMNIST, with the notable exception of OVNNI. OVA-DM manages to completely separate the two datasets.

Using predictive entropy, we can almost separate the two datasets (MNIST vs. SVHN) by inspecting their uncertainty measure.

We used MorphoM-NIST to generate new images with controlled morphological deformations and tested the outlier detection capabilities of each method by exposing them to increasingly deformed samples. Our hypothesis is that the predictive entropy should increase as the deformation is increased.

All models can pick up on the shift in the data manifold as swelling is applied, but OVA-DM and DUQ have stable or decreasing predictive entropy.

We expect to see an increase in predictive entropy and distributional differential entropy as digits are rotated, but the entropy and differential entropy should revert back closer to initial levels.

Figure 12 shows the predictive entropy and model-specific uncertainty measure for varying models as swelling of increasing radius is applied on MNIST digits.

All models exhibit increased uncertainty in rotation angles between 40 and 160 degrees, whereas for DistGP-DeepConv and OVNNI we can observe a pattern of increases and decreases.

Figure 13 shows the predictive entropy and model-specific uncertainty measure for varying models as varying degrees of rotation is applied to digit 6.

5. DistGP-based Segmentation Network &amp; OOD Detection in Medical Imaging

The above introduced modules can be used to construct a convolutional network that benefits from properties of DistGP. The model can segment volumetric medical images and can process input of arbitrary size but GPU memory requirement increases with input size.

Figure 14 shows the schematic of the DistGP activated segmentation net and the visual depiction of the two uncertainties after fitting a toy regression dataset.

5.1.1 Data and pre-processing

We used brain MRI scans from the UKBB study and segmented brain tissue with SPM12.

We use only the FLAIR sequence to perform the brain tissue segmentation task and OOD detection of tumors, and pre-process all images with skull-stripping, N4 bias correction, rigid registration to MNI152 space and histogram matching.

5.1.2 Brain tissue segmentation on normal MRI scans

We compare our model with recent Bayesian approaches for enabling task-specific models to perform uncertainty-based OOD detection, and with a well-established deterministic baseline, a U-Net with 3 scales and 2 convolution layers per scale in encoder and 2 in decoder.

Results show that DistGP-Seg surpasses other Bayesian methods with respect to Dice score for all tissue classes, and approaches the performance of the deterministic U-Net.

5.1.3 Outlier detection in MRI scans with tumors

We apply a pre-trained network to BRATS scans with tumors to highlight the region surrounding the tumor.

To evaluate the quality of outlier detection at a pixel level, we compute the 95% percentile of distributional variance on UKBB, and threshold the distributional variance heatmaps on BraTS, flagging outlier tissue with a value above the threshold.

We implemented DistGP-Seg to segment WM/GM/CSF tissues and compared it with Bayesian deep learning baselines and reconstruction-based OOD detection models. Our method compares favorably to compared counterparts.

We plotted the differential entropy measures based on BRATS scans and noticed that tumor tissue has higher uncertainty compared to healthy tissue.

6. Discussion &amp; Conclusion

We have introduced a novel Bayesian convolutional layer with Lipschitz continuity that surpasses other OOD models from literature, while offering an increase in accuracy.

Figure 15 shows the comparison between models in terms of voxel-level outlier detection of tumors on BRATS scans.

Our experiments demonstrate that our 3-layers model, size limited due to computational cost, can approach the performance of a U-Net, an architecture with a much larger receptive field, and can be used for regression and classification tasks within a medical imaging context.

We have included additional results on flagging white matter hyperintensities as outliers, respectively retina pathologies. Our model utilises distances at every hidden layer, thus allowing the notion of outlier to evolve gradually through the depth of our network.

We have used small architectures for medical imaging scans and have not managed to surpass the accuracy of a model with only 3 hidden layers. We posit that using alternative inference frameworks whereby we impose correlations between layers might alleviate this issue. Our comparison with reconstruction based approaches towards OOD detection was not complete, as it did not include a comprehensive list of recent models. However, our proposed model can provide accurate predictive results alongside OOD detection capabilities at the same time.

Appendix D. Outlier detection in MRI scans with WMH.

We use the baseline FLAIR scans from the 2015 Longitudinal Multiple Sclerosis Lesion Segmentation Challenge Sweeney et al. (2013) and pre-process them with skull-stripping, N4 bias correction, rigid registration to MNI152 space and histogram matching between UKBB and BraTS.

White matter hyperintensities (WMH) are more difficult to detect than tumors, because they consist of multiple non-contiguous areas of varying shapes.

Appendix E. Evaluation on Retina scans.

The DRIVE dataset consists of 40 color fundus images of diabetic retinopathy patients. The images were divided into 20 images for the training set and 20 images for the testing set, and one manual segmentation by an ophthalmological expert was applied to each image.

The STARE database was created by scanning and digitizing the retinal image photographs. It comprises 97 images (59 AMD and 38 normal) taken using a fundus camera at a 35 field and with a resolution of 605  700 pixels.

The IDRID dataset is a publicly available retinal fundus image database consisting of 516 images categorised into two parts: retina images with the signs of Diabetic Retinopathy and/or Diabetic Macular Edema; normal retinal images.

Figure 21 shows the detailed segmentation output for DistGP-Seg on STARE/IDRID datasets. Higher values translate to outlier status.</div></div><div class="flex justify-between lg:block"><div class="text-xs flex items-center justify-center gap-1 self-center pt-2 !invisible"><button

medical imaging tasks often lack reliable out-of-distribution (OOD) detection capabilities. This paper proposes a model that incorporates Gaussian Processes (GPs) operating in Wasserstein-2 space to propagate uncertainty and achieve performance comparable to deterministic segmentation algorithms. The model addresses issues of reliability and miscalibration of confidence estimates in deep learning models by considering uncertainty quantification. It introduces a probabilistic module for OOD detection and incorporates distance-awareness and smoothness constraints. The paper also discusses the background on Gaussian Processes, sparse variational GPs, uncertainty decomposition, deep Gaussian Processes, Wasserstein-2 kernels, and distributional uncertainty. Experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed model in medical image segmentation tasks and OOD detection on various datasets, including brain MRI scans and retinal images. The model outperforms other Bayesian approaches and achieves competitive performance compared to deterministic models like U-Net. Overall, the model offers improved reliability and OOD detection capabilities for medical imaging tasks.</p></div></div></div><div class="flex justify-between lg:block"><div class="text-xs flex

Unlike other distance metrics such as the Euclidean distance or the Kullback-Leibler divergence, the Wasserstein-2 distance takes into account the underlying geometry and structure of the probability distributions being compared.</p><p>The Wasserstein-2 distance is defined based on the optimal transport problem, which seeks the most efficient way to transform one distribution into another. It measures the minimal cost required to transport mass from one distribution to another, where the cost is determined by a cost function that quantifies the effort needed to move mass from one location to another.</p><p>Mathematically, the Wasserstein-2 distance between two probability measures P and Q is computed as the square root of the minimum expected squared distance between two points drawn from P and Q, respectively, under an optimal transport plan. This optimal transport plan determines how the mass from P is transported to match the distribution of Q.</p><p>The Wasserstein-2 distance has several desirable properties. It is a metric, meaning it satisfies the properties of non-negativity, symmetry, and the triangle inequality. It also captures the geometry and structure of the underlying distributions, allowing for a more meaningful comparison between probability measures.</p><p>In the context of machine learning, Wasserstein-2 space has been used in various applications, such as generative modeling, image synthesis, and domain adaptation. By incorporating Wasserstein-2 distances into the learning process, models can better capture the underlying data distribution and generate more realistic samples or align distributions across different domains.</p><p>Overall, Wasserstein-2 space provides a powerful framework for measuring distances between probability distributions, allowing for a more nuanced understanding of the dissimilarity between data distributions and enabling more robust machine learning algorithms.</p></div></div></div><div class="flex justify-between lg:block"><div class="text-xs flex items-center justify-center gap-1 self-center pt-2 !invisible"><button disabled="" class="dark:text-white disabled:text-gray-300 dark:disabled:text-gray-400"><svg stroke="currentColor" fill="none" stroke-width="1.5" viewBox="0 0 24 24" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" class="h-3 w-3" height="1em" width="1em" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg"><polyline points="15 18 9 12 15 6"></polyline></svg></button><span class="flex-grow flex-shrink-0">1 / 1</span><button disabled="" class="dark:text-white disabled:text-gray-300 dark:disabled:text-gray-400"><svg stroke="currentColor" fill="none" stroke-width="1.5" viewBox="0 0 24 24" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" class="h-3 w-3" height="1em" width="1em" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg"><polyline points="9 18 15 12 9 6"></polyline></svg></button></div><div class="text-gray-400 flex self-end lg:self-center justify-center mt-2 gap-2 md:gap-3 lg:gap-1 lg:absolute lg:top-0 lg:translate-x-full lg:right-0 lg:mt-0 lg:pl-2 visible"><button class="flex ml-auto gap-2 rounded-md p-1 hover:bg-gray-100 hover:text-gray-700 dark:text-gray-400 dark:hover:bg-gray-700 dark:hover:text-gray-200 disabled:dark:hover:text-gray-400"><svg stroke="currentColor" fill="none" stroke-width="2" viewBox="0 0 24 24" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" class="h-4 w-4" height="1em" width="1em" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg"><path d="M16 4h2a2 2 0 0 1 2 2v14a2 2 0 0 1-2 2H6a2 2 0 0 1-2-2V6a2 2 0 0 1 2-2h2"></path><rect x="8" y="2" width="8" height="4" rx="1" ry="1"></rect></svg></button><div class="flex gap-1"><button class="p-1 rounded-md hover:bg-gray-100 hover:text-gray-700 dark:text-gray-400 dark:hover:bg-gray-700 dark:hover:text-gray-200 disabled:dark:hover:text-gray-400"><svg stroke="currentColor" fill="none" stroke-width="2" viewBox="0 0 24 24" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" class="h-4 w-4" height="1em" width="1em" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg"><path d="M14 9V5a3 3 0 0 0-3-3l-4 9v11h11.28a2 2 0 0 0 2-1.7l1.38-9a2 2 0 0 0-2-2.3zM7 22H4a2 2 0 0 1-2-2v-7a2 2 0 0 1 2-2h3"></path></svg></button><button class="p-1 rounded-md hover:bg-gray-100 hover:text-gray-700 dark:text-gray-400 dark:hover:bg-gray-700 dark:hover:text-gray-200 disabled:dark:hover:text-gray-400"><svg stroke="currentColor" fill="none" stroke-width="2" viewBox="0 0 24 24" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" class="h-4 w-4" height="1em" width="1em" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg"><path d="M10 15v4a3 3 0 0 0 3 3l4-9V2H5.72a2 2 0 0 0-2 1.7l-1.38 9a2 2 0 0 0 2 2.3zm7-13h2.67A2.31 2.31 0 0 1 22 4v7a2.31 2.31 0 0 1-2.33 2H17"></path></svg></button></div></div></div></div></div></div><div class="group w-full text-gray-800 dark:text-gray-100 border-b border-black/10 dark:border-gray-900/50 dark:bg-gray-800"><div class="flex p-4 gap-4 text-base md:gap-6 md:max-w-2xl lg:max-w-[38rem] xl:max-w-3xl md:py-6 lg:px-0 m-auto"><div class="flex-shrink-0 flex flex-col relative items-end"><div class="w-[30px]"><div class="relative flex"><span style="box-sizing: border-box;

Here are some additional details I would include:

 The Wasserstein-2 distance has a close connection to optimal transport and transfer plans. It quantifies the minimum cost of transporting mass from one distribution to match another. 

 Unlike the Kullback-Leibler divergence, the Wasserstein-2 distance is a true metric. It satisfies the properties of non-negativity, identity of indiscernibles, symmetry, and the triangle inequality.

 The Wasserstein-2 distance takes into account the underlying geometry of the probability distributions. Two distributions with similar shapes but different locations may have a lower Wasserstein-2 distance than two distributions with different shapes.

 Computing the Wasserstein-2 distance explicitly is computationally expensive, especially for high-dimensional distributions. Approximation methods are often used.

 Wasserstein-2 distances have been used in various machine learning applications, like domain adaptation, generative modeling, and density estimation. They can help models learn more meaningful representations that align distributions across domains.

 The Wasserstein-1 distance (also known as the earth mover's distance) is a special case of Wasserstein-p distances when p = 1. The Wasserstein-2 distance is a commonly used instance when p = 2.

So in summary, Wasserstein-2 space provides a principled and geometrically meaningful way to compare probability distributions by considering the optimal transport of mass between them. It has become an important mathematical framework in machine learning and statistics.</div></div><div class="flex justify-between lg:block"><div class="text-xs flex items-center justify-center gap-1

Here are some additional details I would include:

 The Wasserstein-2 distance has a close connection to optimal transport and transfer plans. It quantifies the minimum cost of transporting mass from one distribution to match another. 

 Unlike the Kullback-Leibler divergence, the Wasserstein-2 distance is a true metric. It satisfies the properties of non-negativity, identity of indiscernibles, symmetry, and the triangle inequality.

 The Wasserstein-2 distance takes into account the underlying geometry of the probability distributions. Two distributions with similar shapes but different locations may have a lower Wasserstein-2 distance than two distributions with different shapes.

 Computing the Wasserstein-2 distance explicitly is computationally expensive, especially for high-dimensional distributions. Approximation methods are often used.

 Wasserstein-2 distances have been used in various machine learning applications, like domain adaptation, generative modeling, and density estimation. They can help models learn more meaningful representations that align distributions across domains.

 The Wasserstein-1 distance (also known as the earth mover's distance) is a special case of Wasserstein-p distances when p = 1. The Wasserstein-2 distance is a commonly used instance when p = 2.

So in summary, Wasserstein-2 space provides a principled and geometrically meaningful way to compare probability distributions by considering the optimal transport of mass between them. It has become an important mathematical framework in machine learning and statistics.</div></div><div class="flex justify-between lg:block"><div class="text-xs flex items-center justify-center gap-1

Here's an updated summary incorporating your suggestions:</p><p>Wasserstein-2 space, also known as the 2-Wasserstein space or the Wasserstein metric space, is a mathematical framework used to measure distances between probability distributions. It is based on the Wasserstein-2 distance, which quantifies the minimum cost of transporting mass from one distribution to match another. This distance takes into account the underlying geometry and structure of the distributions being compared.</p><p>The Wasserstein-2 distance satisfies the properties of a metric, including non-negativity, symmetry, and the triangle inequality. It provides a more meaningful comparison between distributions compared to other metrics like the Kullback-Leibler divergence, as it captures the geometric properties of the distributions. Two distributions with similar shapes but different locations may have a lower Wasserstein-2 distance than two distributions with different shapes.</p><p>Explicitly computing the Wasserstein-2 distance can be computationally expensive, especially for high-dimensional distributions. Therefore, approximation methods are often used to estimate the distance.</p><p>Wasserstein-2 distances have found applications in various fields, including machine learning and statistics. They are used in tasks such as domain adaptation, generative modeling, and density estimation. By incorporating Wasserstein-2 distances into these applications, models can learn more meaningful representations and align distributions across different domains.</p><p>It is worth noting that the Wasserstein-1 distance, also known as the earth mover's distance, is a special case of Wasserstein-p distances when p = 1. The Wasserstein-2 distance is a commonly used instance when p = 2.</p><p>Overall, Wasserstein-2 space provides a principled and geometrically meaningful way to compare probability distributions, enabling a more nuanced understanding of the dissimilarity between data distributions and facilitating the development of robust machine learning algorithms.</p></div></div></div><div class="flex justify-between lg:block"><div class="text-xs flex items-center justify-center gap-1 self-center pt-2 !invisible"><button disabled="" class="dark:text-white disabled:text-gray-300 dark:disabled:text-gray-400"><svg stroke="currentColor" fill="none" stroke-width="1.5" viewBox="0 0 24 24" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" class="h-3 w-3" height="1em" width="1em" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg"><polyline points="15 18 9 12 15 6"></polyline></svg></button><span class="flex-grow flex-shrink-0">1 / 1</span><button disabled="" class="dark:text-white disabled:text-gray-300 dark:disabled:text-gray-400"><svg stroke="currentColor" fill="none" stroke-width="1.5" viewBox="0 0 24 24" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" class="h-3 w-3" height="1em" width="1em" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg"><polyline points="9 18 15 12 9 6"></polyline></svg></button></div><div class="text-gray-400 flex self-end lg:self-center justify-center mt-2 gap-2 md:gap-3 lg:gap-1 lg:absolute lg:top-0 lg:translate-x-full lg:right-0 lg:mt-0 lg:pl-2 visible"><button class="flex ml-auto gap-2 rounded-md p-1 hover:bg-gray-100 hover:text-gray-700 dark:text-gray-400 dark:hover:bg-gray-700 dark:hover:text-gray-200 disabled:dark:hover:text-gray-400"><svg stroke="currentColor" fill="none" stroke-width="2" viewBox="0 0 24 24" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" class="h-4 w-4" height="1em" width="1em" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg"><path d="M16 4h2a2 2 0 0 1 2 2v14a2 2 0 0 1-2 2H6a2 2 0 0 1-2-2V6a2 2 0 0 1 2-2h2"></path><rect x="8" y="2" width="8" height="4" rx="1" ry="1"></rect></svg></button><div class="flex gap-1"><button class="p-1 rounded-md hover:bg-gray-100 hover:text-gray-700 dark:text-gray-400 dark:hover:bg-gray-700 dark:hover:text-gray-200 disabled:dark:hover:text-gray-400"><svg stroke="currentColor" fill="none" stroke-width="2" viewBox="0 0 24 24" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" class="h-4 w-4" height="1em" width="1em" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg"><path d="M14 9V5a3 3 0 0 0-3-3l-4 9v11h11.28a2 2 0 0 0 2-1.7l1.38-9a2 2 0 0 0-2-2.3zM7 22H4a2 2 0 0 1-2-2v-7a2 2 0 0 1 2-2h3"></path></svg></button><button class="p-1 rounded-md hover:bg-gray-100 hover:text-gray-700 dark:text-gray-400 dark:hover:bg-gray-700 dark:hover:text-gray-200 disabled:dark:hover:text-gray-400"><svg stroke="currentColor" fill="none" stroke-width="2" viewBox="0 0 24 24" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" class="h-4 w-4" height="1em" width="1em" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg"><path d="M10 15v4a3 3 0 0 0 3 3l4-9V2H5.72a2 2 0 0 0-2 1.7l-1.38 9a2 2 0 0 0 2 2.3zm7-13h2.67A2.31 2.31 0 0 1 22 4v7a2.31 2.31 0 0 1-2.33 2H17"></path></svg></button></div></div></div></div></div></div><div class="group w-full text-gray-800 dark:text-gray-100 border-b border-black/10 dark:border-gray-900/50 dark:bg-gray-800"><div class="flex p-4 gap-4 text-base md:gap-6 md:max-w-2xl lg:max-w-[38rem] xl:max-w-3xl md:py-6 lg:px-0 m-auto"><div class="flex-shrink-0 flex flex-col relative items-end"><div class="w-[30px]"><div class="relative flex"><span style="box-sizing: border-box;

In contrast, other distances like Kullback-Leibler divergence or total variation distance only consider the probability masses but ignore the geometric spread of the distributions.

Some specific geometric benefits of Wasserstein-2 distances are:

1. They capture shape similarities: Two distributions with similar shapes but different locations may have a lower Wasserstein-2 distance than two distributions with different shapes, even if their total variation distance is similar. This is because Wasserstein-2 distances consider the optimal transport plan between the distributions.

2. They reflect mode collapse: If one distribution has multiple modes and the other has a single mode, the Wasserstein-2 distance will be large, reflecting the inability to adequately transport mass between the multimodal and unimodal distributions. This can indicate mode collapse in generative models.

3. They align distributions with geometric transformations: Wasserstein-2 distances remain small under linear transformations, rotations, scalings and translations of the distributions. This makes them suitable for aligning distributions that differ by such transformations.

4. They are sensitive toOutlierss: Outliers in one distribution will require more transport effort to match with the other distribution, resulting in a larger Wasserstein-2 distance. This makes them more robust to outliers compared to distances that only consider probability masses.

5. They reflect spread and variance: Distributions with larger spread or variance will generally have a larger Wasserstein-2 distance, since more transport effort is needed to match them. This geometrically intuitive behavior is not captured by other distances.

So in summary, Wasserstein-2 distances consider the optimal transport plan between distributions, which allows them to capture a variety of geometric properties like shape similarities, sensitivity to outliers, alignment under transformations, and spread or variance of the distributions.

geometric benefits of Wasserstein-2 distances! Here's an updated summary incorporating your points:</p><p>Wasserstein-2 distances have several geometric benefits that set them apart from other distances used for comparing probability distributions. These benefits include:</p><ol><li><p>Capturing shape similarities: Unlike distances such as Kullback-Leibler divergence or total variation distance, Wasserstein-2 distances take into account the underlying geometry and structure of the distributions being compared. This means that two distributions with similar shapes but different locations may have a lower Wasserstein-2 distance than two distributions with different shapes, even if their total variation distance is similar.</p></li><li><p>Reflecting mode collapse: Mode collapse is a phenomenon often observed in generative models where certain modes of the target distribution are not adequately represented in the generated samples. Wasserstein-2 distances can capture this by assigning larger distances when one distribution has multiple modes and the other has a single mode. This reflects the difficulty of transporting mass between the multimodal and unimodal distributions.</p></li><li><p>Aligning distributions with geometric transformations: Wasserstein-2 distances remain small under linear transformations, rotations, scalings, and translations of the distributions. This property makes them suitable for aligning distributions that differ by such geometric transformations. It allows for better comparison and matching of distributions in applications where geometric transformations are present.</p></li><li><p>Sensitivity to outliers: Wasserstein-2 distances are sensitive to outliers in the distributions being compared. Outliers require more transport effort to match with the other distribution, resulting in larger distances. This property makes Wasserstein-2 distances more robust to outliers compared to distances that only consider probability masses.</p></li><li><p>Reflecting spread and variance: Wasserstein-2 distances capture the spread and variance of the distributions. Distributions with larger spread or variance will generally have larger Wasserstein-2 distances, as more transport effort is needed to match them. This behavior is geometrically intuitive and provides a valuable insight into the dissimilarity between distributions.</p></li></ol><p>In summary, Wasserstein-2 distances provide a geometrically meaningful framework for comparing probability distributions. They capture shape similarities, reflect mode collapse, align distributions under geometric transformations, are sensitive to outliers, and reflect the spread and variance of distributions. These geometric benefits make Wasserstein-2 distances well-suited for applications where the underlying geometry and structure of distributions are important.</p></div></div></div><div class="flex justify-between lg:block"><div class="text-xs flex items-center justify-center gap-1 self-center pt-2 !invisible"><button disabled="" class="dark:text-white disabled:text-gray-300 dark:disabled:text-gray-400"><svg stroke="currentColor" fill="none" stroke-width="1.5" viewBox="0 0 24 24" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" class="h-3 w-3" height="1em" width="1em" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg"><polyline points="15 18 9 12 15 6"></polyline></svg></button><span class="flex-grow flex-shrink-0">1 / 1</span><button disabled="" class="dark:text-white disabled:text-gray-300 dark:disabled:text-gray-400"><svg stroke="currentColor" fill="none" stroke-width="1.5" viewBox="0 0 24 24" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" class="h-3 w-3" height="1em" width="1em" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg"><polyline points="9 18 15 12 9 6"></polyline></svg></button></div><div class="text-gray-400 flex self-end lg:self-center justify-center mt-2 gap-2 md:gap-3 lg:gap-1 lg:absolute lg:top-0 lg:translate-x-full lg:right-0 lg:mt-0 lg:pl-2 visible"><button class="flex ml-auto gap-2 rounded-md p-1 hover:bg-gray-100 hover:text-gray-700 dark:text-gray-400 dark:hover:bg-gray-700 dark:hover:text-gray-200 disabled:dark:hover:text-gray-400"><svg stroke="currentColor" fill="none" stroke-width="2" viewBox="0 0 24 24" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" class="h-4 w-4" height="1em" width="1em" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg"><path d="M16 4h2a2 2 0 0 1 2 2v14a2 2 0 0 1-2 2H6a2 2 0 0 1-2-2V6a2 2 0 0 1 2-2h2"></path><rect x="8" y="2" width="8" height="4" rx="1" ry="1"></rect></svg></button><div class="flex gap-1"><button class="p-1 rounded-md hover:bg-gray-100 hover:text-gray-700 dark:text-gray-400 dark:hover:bg-gray-700 dark:hover:text-gray-200 disabled:dark:hover:text-gray-400"><svg stroke="currentColor" fill="none" stroke-width="2" viewBox="0 0 24 24" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" class="h-4 w-4" height="1em" width="1em" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg"><path d="M14 9V5a3 3 0 0 0-3-3l-4 9v11h11.28a2 2 0 0 0 2-1.7l1.38-9a2 2 0 0 0-2-2.3zM7 22H4a2 2 0 0 1-2-2v-7a2 2 0 0 1 2-2h3"></path></svg></button><button class="p-1 rounded-md hover:bg-gray-100 hover:text-gray-700 dark:text-gray-400 dark:hover:bg-gray-700 dark:hover:text-gray-200 disabled:dark:hover:text-gray-400"><svg stroke="currentColor" fill="none" stroke-width="2" viewBox="0 0 24 24" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" class="h-4 w-4" height="1em" width="1em" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg"><path d="M10 15v4a3 3 0 0 0 3 3l4-9V2H5.72a2 2 0 0 0-2 1.7l-1.38 9a2 2 0 0 0 2 2.3zm7-13h2.67A2.31 2.31 0 0 1 22 4v7a2.31 2.31 0 0 1-2.33 2H17"></path></svg></button></div></div></div></div></div></div><div class="group w-full text-gray-800 dark:text-gray-100 border-b border-black/10 dark:border-gray-900/50 dark:bg-gray-800"><div class="flex p-4 gap-4 text-base md:gap-6 md:max-w-2xl lg:max-w-[38rem] xl:max-w-3xl md:py-6 lg:px-0 m-auto"><div class="flex-shrink-0 flex flex-col relative items-end"><div class="w-[30px]"><div class="relative flex"><span style="box-sizing: border-box; display: inline-block; overflow: hidden; width: initial; height: initial; background: none; opacity: 1; border: 0px; margin: 0px; padding: 0px; position: relative; max-width: 100%;"><span style="box-sizing: border-box; display: block; width: initial; height: initial; background: none; opacity: 1; border: 0px; margin: 0px; padding: 0px; max-width: 100%;"><img alt="" aria-hidden="true" src="data:image/svg+xml,%3csvg%20xmlns=%27http://www.w3.org/2000/svg%27%20version=%271.1%27%20width=%2738%27%20height=%2738%27/%3e" style="display: block; max-width: 100%; width: initial; height: initial; background: none; opacity: 1; border: 0px; margin: 0px; padding: 0px;"></span><img alt="User" src="https://chat.openai.com/_next/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Flh3.googleusercontent.com%2Fa%2FAAcHTtfE_9fVpMOqgyC7Lo43NLrKgIo-u2ToDOuYOa2T%3Ds96-c&amp;w=96&amp;q=75" decoding="async" data-nimg="intrinsic" class="rounded-sm" style="position: absolute; inset: 0px; box-sizing: border-box; padding: 0px; border: none; margin: auto; display: block; width: 0px; height: 0px; min-width: 100%; max-width: 100%; min-height: 100%; max-height: 100%;" width="30" height="30"></span></div></div></div><div class="relative flex w-[calc(100%-50px)] flex-col gap-1 md:gap-3 lg:w-[calc(100%-115px)]"><div class="flex flex-grow flex-col gap-3"><div class="min-h-[20px] flex flex-col items-start gap-4 whitespace-pre-wrap break-words">Wasserstein-2 distances have some key advantages compared to other commonly used distance metrics:

 They are a true metric, satisfying the properties of non-negativity, identity of indiscernibles, symmetry and triangle inequality. In contrast, KL divergence and Jensen-Shannon divergence are not true metrics.

 They capture the geometry and structure of the distributions, allowing shape similarities and alignment under transformations to be quantified. KL divergence and total variation distance are agnostic to the geometric spread of the distributions. 

 They can capture multimodality in distributions, reflecting the transport effort needed to match multimodal and unimodal distributions. KL divergence and total variation distance treat multimodal and unimodal distributions similarly.

 They are more robust to outliers compared to distances that only consider probability masses. Outliers require more transport effort, leading to larger Wasserstein distances.  

 They can better detect model collapse in generative models. A unimodal generated distribution will have a larger Wasserstein distance from the true multimodal data distribution, reflecting collapse to a single mode.

 They remain small and stable under linear transformations, rotations and scalings of the distributions, making them suitable for alignment tasks. KL divergence and total variation distance are not invariant to such transformations.

However, Wasserstein-2 distances also have some disadvantages compared to other distances:

 They are computationally more expensive, with a time complexity of O(n3logn) for n samples. Approximation methods are required for large datasets.

 They are not decomposable, meaning the distance between joint distributions cannot be easily calculated from the marginal distances. KL divergence and total variation distance are decomposable.

 They are more difficult to optimize and minimize during training of generative models. In contrast, KL divergence has a closed-form expression that is easy to optimize.

So in summary, Wasserstein-2 distances provide a more geometrically and structurally meaningful comparison of distributions by considering optimal transport, but they come at the cost of higher computational complexity and difficulty of optimization compared to other distances like KL divergence and total variation distance. The trade-offs depend on the specific application and requirements.</div></div><div class="flex justify-between lg:block"><div class="text-xs flex items-center justify-center gap-1 self-center pt-2

distance metrics. Here's an updated summary incorporating your points:</p><p>Wasserstein-2 distances offer several key advantages over other commonly used distance metrics:</p><ol><li><p>True metric properties: Wasserstein-2 distances satisfy the properties of non-negativity, identity of indiscernibles, symmetry, and triangle inequality. This distinguishes them from metrics like KL divergence and Jensen-Shannon divergence, which do not possess all these properties.</p></li><li><p>Capture of geometry and structure: Wasserstein-2 distances take into account the geometry and structure of the distributions being compared. They can quantify shape similarities and align distributions under transformations, unlike metrics like KL divergence and total variation distance, which are agnostic to the geometric spread of the distributions.</p></li><li><p>Multimodality detection: Wasserstein-2 distances can capture multimodality in distributions, reflecting the transport effort needed to match multimodal and unimodal distributions. In contrast, metrics like KL divergence and total variation distance treat multimodal and unimodal distributions similarly.</p></li><li><p>Robustness to outliers: Wasserstein-2 distances are more robust to outliers compared to distances that only consider probability masses. Outliers require more transport effort, resulting in larger Wasserstein distances.</p></li><li><p>Detection of model collapse: Wasserstein-2 distances can better detect model collapse in generative models. A unimodal generated distribution will have a larger Wasserstein distance from the true multimodal data distribution, indicating collapse to a single mode.</p></li><li><p>Stability under geometric transformations: Wasserstein-2 distances remain small and stable under linear transformations, rotations, and scalings of the distributions. This makes them suitable for alignment tasks where geometric transformations are present. In contrast, KL divergence and total variation distance are not invariant to such transformations.</p></li></ol><p>However, Wasserstein-2 distances also have some disadvantages compared to other distances:</p><ol><li><p>Computational complexity: Computing Wasserstein-2 distances explicitly has a time complexity of O(n^3 log n) for n samples, which can be computationally expensive. Approximation methods are often employed to address this issue, especially for large datasets.</p></li><li><p>Lack of decomposability: Wasserstein-2 distances are not easily decomposable, meaning the distance between joint distributions cannot be readily calculated from the marginal distances. In contrast, metrics like KL divergence and total variation distance have decomposability properties.</p></li><li><p>Optimization challenges: Optimizing and minimizing Wasserstein-2 distances during training of generative models can be more challenging compared to distances like KL divergence, which have closed-form expressions that are easier to optimize.</p></li></ol><p>In summary, Wasserstein-2 distances provide a more geometrically and structurally meaningful comparison of distributions by considering optimal transport. They offer advantages in terms of metric properties, capturing geometry and structure, multimodality detection, robustness to outliers, and stability under geometric transformations. However, they also come with computational complexity and optimization challenges. The choice of distance metric depends on the specific application and the trade-offs that are acceptable in terms of computational resources and ease of optimization.</p></div></div></div><div class="flex justify-between lg:block"><div class="text-xs flex items-center justify-center gap-1 self-center pt-2 !invisible"><button disabled="" class="dark:text-white disabled:text-gray-300 dark:disabled:text-gray-400"><svg stroke="currentColor" fill="none" stroke-width="1.5" viewBox="0 0 24 24" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" class="h-3 w-3" height="1em" width="1em" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg"><polyline points="15 18 9 12 15 6"></polyline></svg></button><span class="flex-grow flex-shrink-0">1 / 1</span><button disabled="" class="dark:text-white disabled:text-gray-300 dark:disabled:text-gray-400"><svg stroke="currentColor" fill="none" stroke-width="1.5" viewBox="0 0 24 24" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" class="h-3 w-3" height="1em" width="1em" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg"><polyline points="9 18 15 12 9 6"></polyline></svg></button></div><div class="text-gray-400 flex self-end lg:self-center justify-center mt-2 gap-2 md:gap-3 lg:gap-1 lg:absolute lg:top-0 lg:translate-x-full lg:right-0 lg:mt-0 lg:pl-2 visible"><button class="flex ml-auto gap-2 rounded-md p-1 hover:bg-gray-100 hover:text-gray-700 dark:text-gray-400 dark:hover:bg-gray-700 dark:hover:text-gray-200 disabled:dark:hover:text-gray-400"><svg stroke="currentColor" fill="none" stroke-width="2" viewBox="0 0 24 24" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" class="h-4 w-4" height="1em" width="1em" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg"><path d="M16 4h2a2 2 0 0 1 2 2v14a2 2 0 0 1-2 2H6a2 2 0 0 1-2-2V6a2 2 0 0 1 2-2h2"></path><rect x="8" y="2" width="8" height="4" rx="1" ry="1"></rect></svg></button><div class="flex gap-1"><button class="p-1 rounded-md hover:bg-gray-100 hover:text-gray-700 dark:text-gray-400 dark:hover:bg-gray-700 dark:hover:text-gray-200 disabled:dark:hover:text-gray-400"><svg stroke="currentColor" fill="none" stroke-width="2" viewBox="0 0 24 24" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" class="h-4 w-4" height="1em" width="1em" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg"><path d="M14 9V5a3 3 0 0 0-3-3l-4 9v11h11.28a2 2 0 0 0 2-1.7l1.38-9a2 2 0 0 0-2-2.3zM7 22H4a2 2 0 0 1-2-2v-7a2 2 0 0 1 2-2h3"></path></svg></button><button class="p-1 rounded-md hover:bg-gray-100 hover:text-gray-700 dark:text-gray-400 dark:hover:bg-gray-700 dark:hover:text-gray-200 disabled:dark:hover:text-gray-400"><svg stroke="currentColor" fill="none" stroke-width="2" viewBox="0 0 24 24" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" class="h-4 w-4" height="1em" width="1em" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg"><path d="M10 15v4a3 3 0 0 0 3 3l4-9V2H5.72a2 2 0 0 0-2 1.7l-1.38 9a2 2 0 0 0 2 2.3zm7-13h2.67A2.31 2.31 0 0 1 22 4v7a2.31 2.31 0 0 1-2.33 2H17"></path></svg></button></div></div></div></div></div></div><div class="group w-full text-gray-800 dark:text-gray-100 border-b border-black/10 dark:border-gray-900/50 dark:bg-gray-800"><div class="flex p-4 gap-4 text-base md:gap-6 md:max-w-2xl lg:max-w-[38rem] xl:max-w-3xl md:py-6 lg:px-0 m-auto"><div class="flex-shrink-0 flex flex-col relative items-end"><div class="w-[30px]"><div class="relative flex"><span style="box-sizing: border-box; display: inline-block; overflow: hidden; width: initial; height: initial; background: none; opacity: 1; border: 0px; margin: 0px; padding: 0px; position: relative; max-width: 100%;"><span style="box-sizing: border-box; display: block; width: initial; height: initial; background: none; opacity: 1; border: 0px; margin: 0px; padding: 0px; max-width: 100%;"><img alt="" aria-hidden="true" src="data:image/svg+xml,%3csvg%20xmlns=%27http://www.w3.org/2000/svg%27%20version=%271.1%27%20width=%2738%27%20height=%2738%27/%3e" style="display: block; max-width: 100%; width: initial; height: initial; background: none; opacity: 1; border: 0px; margin: 0px; padding: 0px;"></span><img alt="User" src="https://chat.openai.com/_next/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Flh3.googleusercontent.com%2Fa%2FAAcHTtfE_9fVpMOqgyC7Lo43NLrKgIo-u2ToDOuYOa2T%3Ds96-c&amp;w=96&amp;q=75" decoding="async" data-nimg="intrinsic" class="rounded-sm" style="position: absolute; inset: 0px; box-sizing: border-box; padding: 0px; border: none; margin: auto; display: block; width: 0px; height: 0px; min-width: 100%; max-width: 100%; min-height: 100%; max-height: 100%;" width="30" height="30"></span></div></div></div><div class="relative flex w-[calc(100%-50px)] flex-col gap-1 md:gap-3 lg:w-[calc(100%-115px)]"><div class="flex flex-grow flex-col gap-3"><div class="min-h-[20px] flex flex-col items-start gap-4 whitespace-pre-wrap break-words">One scenario where Wasserstein-2 distance is more useful than KL divergence is in generative adversarial networks (GANs).

In a GAN, the generator tries to learn a distribution that matches the real data distribution. Typically, the KL divergence is used as the loss function to measure how close the generated distribution is to the real data distribution.

However, KL divergence has some limitations in this context:

 KL divergence is asymmetric and unbounded. This can lead to instability during GAN training.

 KL divergence is sensitive to outliers. A few outliers in the real data distribution can drastically increase the KL divergence, overwhelming meaningful differences.

 KL divergence does not capture the geometric properties of the distributions well. It treats two different shaped distributions similarly if their probability masses match.

This can result in GANs trained with KL divergence exhibiting several failure modes like model collapse and generating unrealistic samples.

In contrast, using the Wasserstein-2 distance as the GAN loss function can help address these issues:

 Wasserstein-2 distance is a true metric, bounded and symmetric. This leads to more stable GAN training.

 Wasserstein-2 distance is more robust to outliers due to the optimal transport formulation.

 Wasserstein-2 distance captures the geometry of the distributions better, reflecting differences in shape and spread.

As a result, GANs trained with Wasserstein-2 distance as the loss function tend to generate higher quality samples, exhibit less mode collapse, and have more stable training dynamics. This is because the Wasserstein-2 distance more accurately reflects how close the generated distribution is to the real data distribution.

So in summary, for tasks like generative modeling where the geometry and structure of the distributions is important, Wasserstein-2 distance provides a more suitable and meaningful measure of distance compared to KL divergence. This can lead to more stable and higher quality model training.</div></div><div class="flex justify-between lg:block"><div class="text-xs flex items-center justify-center gap-1 self-center pt-2

By providing stability, robustness to outliers, and better capture of geometric properties, Wasserstein-2 distance helps improve the training dynamics and the quality of generated samples in generative modeling tasks.</p></div></div></div><div class="flex justify-between lg:block"><div class="text-xs flex items-center justify-center gap-1 self-center pt-2 !invisible"><button disabled="" class="dark:text-white disabled:text-gray-300 dark:disabled:text-gray-400"><svg stroke="currentColor" fill="none" stroke-width="1.5" viewBox="0 0 24 24" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" class="h-3 w-3" height="1em" width="1em" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg"><polyline points="15 18 9 12 15 6"></polyline></svg></button><span class="flex-grow flex-shrink-0">1 / 1</span><button disabled="" class="dark:text-white disabled:text-gray-300 dark:disabled:text-gray-400"><svg stroke="currentColor" fill="none" stroke-width="1.5" viewBox="0 0 24 24" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" class="h-3 w-3" height="1em" width="1em" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg"><polyline points="9 18 15 12 9 6"></polyline></svg></button></div><div class="text-gray-400 flex self-end lg:self-center justify-center mt-2 gap-2 md:gap-3 lg:gap-1 lg:absolute lg:top-0 lg:translate-x-full lg:right-0 lg:mt-0 lg:pl-2 visible"><button class="flex ml-auto gap-2 rounded-md p-1 hover:bg-gray-100 hover:text-gray-700 dark:text-gray-400 dark:hover:bg-gray-700 dark:hover:text-gray-200 disabled:dark:hover:text-gray-400"><svg stroke="currentColor" fill="none" stroke-width="2" viewBox="0 0 24 24" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" class="h-4 w-4" height="1em" width="1em" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg"><path d="M16 4h2a2 2 0 0 1 2 2v14a2 2 0 0 1-2 2H6a2 2 0 0 1-2-2V6a2 2 0 0 1 2-2h2"></path><rect x="8" y="2" width="8" height="4" rx="1" ry="1"></rect></svg></button><div class="flex gap-1"><button class="p-1 rounded-md hover:bg-gray-100 hover:text-gray-700 dark:text-gray-400 dark:hover:bg-gray-700 dark:hover:text-gray-200 disabled:dark:hover:text-gray-400"><svg stroke="currentColor" fill="none" stroke-width="2" viewBox="0 0 24 24" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" class="h-4 w-4" height="1em" width="1em" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg"><path d="M14 9V5a3 3 0 0 0-3-3l-4 9v11h11.28a2 2 0 0 0 2-1.7l1.38-9a2 2 0 0 0-2-2.3zM7 22H4a2 2 0 0 1-2-2v-7a2 2 0 0 1 2-2h3"></path></svg></button><button class="p-1 rounded-md hover:bg-gray-100 hover:text-gray-700 dark:text-gray-400 dark:hover:bg-gray-700 dark:hover:text-gray-200 disabled:dark:hover:text-gray-400"><svg stroke="currentColor" fill="none" stroke-width="2" viewBox="0 0 24 24" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" class="h-4 w-4" height="1em" width="1em" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg"><path d="M10 15v4a3 3 0 0 0 3 3l4-9V2H5.72a2 2 0 0 0-2 1.7l-1.38 9a2 2 0 0 0 2 2.3zm7-13h2.67A2.31 2.31 0 0 1 22 4v7a2.31 2.31 0 0 1-2.33 2H17"></path></svg></button></div></div></div></div></div></div><div class="group w-full text-gray-800 dark:text-gray-100 border-b border-black/10 dark:border-gray-900/50 dark:bg-gray-800"><div class="flex p-4 gap-4 text-base md:gap-6 md:max-w-2xl lg:max-w-[38rem] xl:max-w-3xl md:py-6 lg:px-0 m-auto"><div class="flex-shrink-0 flex flex-col relative items-end"><div class="w-[30px]"><div class="relative flex"><span style="box-sizing: border-box; display: inline-block; overflow: hidden; width: initial; height: initial; background: none; opacity: 1; border: 0px; margin: 0px; padding: 0px; position: relative; max-width: 100%;"><span style="box-sizing: border-box; display: block; width: initial; height: initial; background: none; opacity: 1; border: 0px; margin: 0px; padding: 0px; max-width: 100%;"><img alt="" aria-hidden="true" src="data:image/svg+xml,%3csvg%20xmlns=%27http://www.w3.org/2000/svg%27%20version=%271.1%27%20width=%2738%27%20height=%2738%27/%3e" style="display: block; max-width: 100%; width: initial; height: initial; background: none; opacity: 1; border: 0px; margin: 0px; padding: 0px;"></span><img alt="User" src="https://chat.openai.com/_next/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Flh3.googleusercontent.com%2Fa%2FAAcHTtfE_9fVpMOqgyC7Lo43NLrKgIo-u2ToDOuYOa2T%3Ds96-c&amp;w=96&amp;q=75" decoding="async" data-nimg="intrinsic" class="rounded-sm" style="position: absolute; inset: 0px; box-sizing: border-box; padding: 0px; border: none; margin: auto; display: block; width: 0px; height: 0px; min-width: 100%; max-width: 100%; min-height: 100%; max-height: 100%;" width="30" height="30"></span></div></div></div><div class="relative flex w-[calc(100%-50px)] flex-col gap-1 md:gap-3 lg:w-[calc(100%-115px)]"><div class="flex flex-grow flex-col gap-3"><div class="min-h-[20px] flex flex-col items-start gap-4 whitespace-pre-wrap break-words">The Wasserstein-2 distance, also known as the quadratic Wasserstein distance, is computed based on the optimal transport problem between two probability distributions.

Given two probability distributions P and Q over the same space, and a cost function c(x,y) that measures the cost of transporting one unit of mass from location x to location y, the Wasserstein-2 distance is defined as:

W_2(P,Q) =  [  inf_   c(x,y)^2 d(x,y) ] ^0.5

Where the infimum is taken over all joint distributions (x,y) whose marginals are P and Q respectively.   

In words, this means the Wasserstein-2 distance is the square root of the minimum possible expected cost of transporting mass from distribution P to match distribution Q, where the cost is measured by the squared Euclidean distance (c(x,y) = ||x - y||^2).

The optimal transport plan *(x,y) that achieves this minimum cost corresponds to moving the minimum amount of mass the minimum distance possible to transform P into Q.   

Since the cost function uses the squared Euclidean distance, the Wasserstein-2 distance incorporates not just the transportation cost but also how "spread out" the distributions are, reflecting their variance and higher moments.

Computing the Wasserstein-2 distance exactly requires solving the optimal transport problem, which has a time complexity of O(n3logn) for n samples. 

Approximation methods like the Sinkhorn algorithm are typically used in practice to efficiently compute a close estimate of the Wasserstein-2 distance, especially for high-dimensional distributions.

So in summary, the Wasserstein-2 distance measures the minimum cost of optimally transporting mass from one distribution to another, where the cost is defined as the squared Euclidean distance between locations. This provides a geometrically meaningful way to quantify the "distance" between two probability distributions.</div></div><div class="flex justify-between lg:block"><div class="text-xs flex

discussion revolves around comparing probability distributions using the Wasserstein-2 distance, which takes into account their underlying geometry and structure.</p></li><li><p>Optimal Transport: The Wasserstein-2 distance is closely connected to optimal transport and transfer plans, as it quantifies the minimum cost of transporting mass from one distribution to match another.</p></li><li><p>Distance Metrics: Comparisons are made between the Wasserstein-2 distance and other commonly used distance metrics such as KL divergence and total variation distance, highlighting the advantages of the former in capturing geometric properties and addressing limitations in various applications.</p></li><li><p>Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs): The benefits of using the Wasserstein-2 distance as the loss function in GANs are discussed, including stability, robustness to outliers, and better capturing the geometry of the distributions, leading to improved training dynamics and sample generation.</p></li><li><p>Computational Complexity: The computational complexity of computing the Wasserstein-2 distance and the use of approximation methods, such as the Sinkhorn algorithm, are mentioned to address the challenges of scalability for high-dimensional distributions.</p></li><li><p>Applications: The discussion touches upon machine learning applications where Wasserstein-2 distances have been used, such as domain adaptation, generative modeling, and density estimation, to learn meaningful representations and align distributions across domains.</p></li></ol><p>Overall, the conversation explores the concept, properties, applications, and advantages of the Wasserstein-2 distance, highlighting its connections with probability

the Wasserstein-2 distance:

 Imagine two piles of sand with different shapes and locations. The Wasserstein-2 distance measures how much you would have to move and spread the sand in the first pile to reshape it into the second pile. The more you have to move and spread the sand, the larger the distance.   

 Think of the two distributions as two dropoff and pickup locations that trucks need to move items between. The Wasserstein-2 distance represents the minimum total driving distance (accounting for traffic and road conditions) that all the trucks would need to drive to move all the items from the dropoff location to the pickup location.

 Visualize the two distributions as two blobs of paint on a canvas. The Wasserstein-2 distance quantifies how much the first blob of paint would need to spread and shift its location to merge with the second blob of paint and cover the same area. More spreading and shifting leads to a larger distance.  

 Imagine comparing two histograms representing different data distributions. The Wasserstein-2 distance takes into account not just the height of the bars, but also how spread out the bars are. It measures the minimum amount of "mass" (area of the bars) that would need to be shifted and redistributed to transform one histogram into the other.

The key ideas are that the Wasserstein-2 distance:

 Quantifies the minimum cost or effort required to transport mass from one distribution to match another.

 Uses a cost function that incorporates the squared distances mass needs to be moved.

 Considers not just the probability masses but also the spread and variance of the distributions.

 Provides a geometrically meaningful measure of "distance" between distributions that capture their shapes and structures.

Here are a few more explanations of the Wasserstein-2 distance using intuitive analogies:</p><p> Imagine two cities with different populations and the goal is to distribute resources from one city to another. The Wasserstein-2 distance represents the minimum total distance that individuals would need to travel to transport the resources. This distance takes into account not only the number of individuals but also their locations, ensuring an optimal allocation.</p><p> Consider two sets of scattered points in a plane, representing different point clouds. The Wasserstein-2 distance measures the minimum amount of "work" needed to match the points between the two sets. This work corresponds to the effort required to move and rearrange the points, considering their spatial positions.</p><p> Think of two paintings, each with a unique arrangement of brushstrokes. The Wasserstein-2 distance captures the minimum amount of brushwork needed to transform one painting into the other. It considers the distances between brushstrokes and aims to minimize the overall "painting distance."</p><p> Imagine two music playlists with different sequences of songs. The Wasserstein-2 distance quantifies the minimum number of "song swaps" required to transform one playlist into the other. It accounts for both the number of swaps and the distances between the songs in the playlists.</p><p>These explanations highlight the idea that the Wasserstein-2 distance measures the minimum effort, work, or transformations needed to match two distributions, whether it's in terms of resource allocation, point arrangement, painting strokes, or playlist transformations. By incorporating the geometric and structural aspects of the distributions, the Wasserstein-2 distance provides a meaningful measure of distance between them.</p></div></div></div><div class="flex

 Sobolev distance: This measures the distance between two distributions based on their gradient information in addition to their probability masses. It can better capture local changes and continuity between distributions.

 Bayesian metric: This metric incorporates prior knowledge about what constitutes a "reasonable" distance between distributions. It can be tailored for the specific application. 

 Rank distance: This metric compares the sorted probability values of two distributions, ignoring relabeling and permutations. It is insensitive to where probability mass is located, only considering how masses compare relatively.

 Information radius: This measures the distance from a distribution to the closest distribution with a uniform probability mass function. It quantifies how non-uniform a distribution is.

 MMD distance: The maximum mean discrepancy distance compares distributions based on the distance between their mean embeddings in a reproducing kernel Hilbert space. It often has lower computational complexity than Wasserstein distances.

 Q-metric: This metric compares the quantiles of two distributions rather than their probability masses. It ignores the specific probability values, only considering their relative ordering.

 Quantization-based distances: These metrics quantize distributions into bins and then compare the corresponding bin probabilities. They can be more practical for high-dimensional distributions.

 Topological metrics: These metrics compare higher-order topological properties of distributions, like their connected components, holes, and loops. They can capture global shape similarities that traditional metrics miss.

 Energy distance: This metric compares distributions based on the difference in their pairwise distances. It has strong theoretical connections to two-sample testing and can outperform other distances in some cases.

While many of these distance metrics are still largely theoretical, some (like MMD distance and quantization-based distances) have found practical applications in machine learning. Research continues into developing new ways to compare probability distributions that capture their salient features in a meaningful way.

So in general, there is a vast space of possible distance metrics beyond the commonly used ones. Experimental and unusual distance metrics often seek to incorporate additional structural information about distributions or optimize for specific application needs.</div></div><div class="flex

that incorporates Bayesian principles and prior knowledge about what constitutes a "reasonable" distance between probability distributions. It is a flexible and customizable metric that can be tailored to the specific application and context.</p><p>In traditional distance metrics, such as the Wasserstein distance or the Kullback-Leibler divergence, the distance measure is determined solely based on the observed data and the probability distributions themselves. However, the Bayesian metric allows for the inclusion of additional information through prior distributions.</p><p>The key idea behind the Bayesian metric is to quantify the dissimilarity between two distributions by considering the evidence provided by the observed data as well as the prior knowledge or beliefs about the distributions. This is done by computing the posterior probability distribution of the parameters or characteristics of the distributions given the data.</p><p>The specific form of the Bayesian metric depends on the chosen prior distribution and the nature of the data. Different choices of prior distributions can lead to different Bayesian metrics, allowing for customization based on the problem at hand.</p><p>One common approach in defining the Bayesian metric is to use the posterior distribution to derive a measure of discrepancy or dissimilarity between the parameters of the distributions. This discrepancy measure can then be used as the distance metric between the distributions.</p><p>The advantage of the Bayesian metric is that it allows for the incorporation of prior knowledge or beliefs, which can provide regularization or constraints on the distance computation. This can be particularly useful in cases where the observed data is limited, noisy, or not fully representative of the underlying distributions. By combining prior knowledge with the observed data, the Bayesian metric can provide a more robust and meaningful measure of distance.</p><p>It's worth noting that the choice of prior distribution in the Bayesian metric is subjective and requires careful consideration. The prior should reflect relevant domain knowledge and information about the problem. Additionally, the computation of the Bayesian metric may involve techniques such as Bayesian inference or Monte Carlo methods to estimate the posterior distributions.</p><p>Overall, the Bayesian metric offers a flexible framework for incorporating prior knowledge and beliefs into the measurement of distance between probability distributions. It provides a way to customize the distance metric based on domain-specific information, leading to more informed and context-aware comparisons.</p></div></div></div><div class="flex justify-between lg:block"><div class="text-xs flex items-center justify-center gap-1 self-center pt-2 !invisible"><button disabled="" class="dark:text-white disabled:text-gray-300 dark:disabled:text-gray-400"><svg stroke="currentColor" fill="none" stroke-width="1.5" viewBox="0 0 24 24" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" class="h-3 w-3" height="1em" width="1em" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg"><polyline points="15 18 9 12 15 6"></polyline></svg></button><span class="flex-grow flex-shrink-0">1 / 1</span><button disabled="" class="dark:text-white disabled:text-gray-300 dark:disabled:text-gray-400"><svg stroke="currentColor" fill="none" stroke-width="1.5" viewBox="0 0 24 24" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" class="h-3 w-3" height="1em" width="1em" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg"><polyline points="9 18 15 12 9 6"></polyline></svg></button></div><div class="text-gray-400 flex self-end lg:self-center justify-center mt-2 gap-2 md:gap-3 lg:gap-1 lg:absolute lg:top-0 lg:translate-x-full lg:right-0 lg:mt-0 lg:pl-2 visible"><button class="flex ml-auto gap-2 rounded-md p-1 hover:bg-gray-100 hover:text-gray-700 dark:text-gray-400 dark:hover:bg-gray-700 dark:hover:text-gray-200 disabled:dark:hover:text-gray-400"><svg stroke="currentColor" fill="none" stroke-width="2" viewBox="0 0 24 24" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" class="h-4 w-4" height="1em" width="1em" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg"><path d="M16 4h2a2 2 0 0 1 2 2v14a2 2 0 0 1-2 2H6a2 2 0 0 1-2-2V6a2 2 0 0 1 2-2h2"></path><rect x="8" y="2" width="8" height="4" rx="1" ry="1"></rect></svg></button><div class="flex gap-1"><button class="p-1 rounded-md hover:bg-gray-100 hover:text-gray-700 dark:text-gray-400 dark:hover:bg-gray-700 dark:hover:text-gray-200 disabled:dark:hover:text-gray-400"><svg stroke="currentColor" fill="none" stroke-width="2" viewBox="0 0 24 24" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" class="h-4 w-4" height="1em" width="1em" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg"><path d="M14 9V5a3 3 0 0 0-3-3l-4 9v11h11.28a2 2 0 0 0 2-1.7l1.38-9a2 2 0 0 0-2-2.3zM7 22H4a2 2 0 0 1-2-2v-7a2 2 0 0 1 2-2h3"></path></svg></button><button class="p-1 rounded-md hover:bg-gray-100 hover:text-gray-700 dark:text-gray-400 dark:hover:bg-gray-700 dark:hover:text-gray-200 disabled:dark:hover:text-gray-400"><svg stroke="currentColor" fill="none" stroke-width="2" viewBox="0 0 24 24" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" class="h-4 w-4" height="1em" width="1em" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg"><path d="M10 15v4a3 3 0 0 0 3 3l4-9V2H5.72a2 2 0 0 0-2 1.7l-1.38 9a2 2 0 0 0 2 2.3zm7-13h2.67A2.31 2.31 0 0 1 22 4v7a2.31 2.31 0 0 1-2.33 2H17"></path></svg></button></div></div></div></div></div></div><div class="group w-full text-gray-800 dark:text-gray-100 border-b border-black/10 dark:border-gray-900/50 dark:bg-gray-800"><div class="flex p-4 gap-4 text-base md:gap-6 md:max-w-2xl lg:max-w-[38rem] xl:max-w-3xl md:py-6 lg:px-0 m-auto"><div class="flex-shrink-0 flex flex-col relative items-end"><div class="w-[30px]"><div class="relative flex"><span style="box-sizing: border-box; display: inline-block; overflow: hidden; width: initial; height: initial; background: none; opacity: 1; border: 0px; margin: 0px; padding: 0px; position: relative; max-width: 100%;"><span style="box-sizing: border-box; display: block; width: initial; height: initial; background: none; opacity: 1; border: 0px; margin: 0px; padding: 0px; max-width: 100%;"><img alt="" aria-hidden="true" src="data:image/svg+xml,%3csvg%20xmlns=%27http://www.w3.org/2000/svg%27%20version=%271.1%27%20width=%2738%27%20height=%2738%27/%3e" style="display: block; max-width: 100%; width: initial; height: initial; background: none; opacity: 1; border: 0px; margin: 0px; padding: 0px;"></span><img alt="User" src="https://chat.openai.com/_next/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Flh3.googleusercontent.com%2Fa%2FAAcHTtfE_9fVpMOqgyC7Lo43NLrKgIo-u2ToDOuYOa2T%3Ds96-c&amp;w=96&amp;q=75" decoding="async" data-nimg="intrinsic" class="rounded-sm" style="position: absolute; inset: 0px; box-sizing: border-box; padding: 0px; border: none; margin: auto; display: block; width: 0px; height: 0px; min-width: 100%; max-width: 100%; min-height: 100%; max-height: 100%;" width="30" height="30"></span></div></div></div><div class="relative flex w-[calc(100%-50px)] flex-col gap-1 md:gap-3 lg:w-[calc(100%-115px)]"><div class="flex flex-grow flex-col gap-3"><div class="min-h-[20px] flex flex-col items-start gap-4 whitespace-pre-wrap break-words">In high-dimensional spaces, quantization-based distances have several advantages compared to other distance metrics like Wasserstein distances:

1. Lower computational complexity: Quantization involves mapping distributions into a discrete space with a finite number of bins. The resulting bin probabilities can then be compared more efficiently. This results in much lower computational complexity compared to Wasserstein distances, which scale cubically with the number of samples.

2. More practical for high-dimensional data: Quantization provides a natural way to handle high-dimensional distributions by mapping them into a discrete space. In contrast, computing Wasserstein distances in high dimensions is often intractable in practice.

3. Simplicity: Quantization reduces the complexity of comparing distributions by discretizing them into a finite set of bins. This results in a simpler distance metric that is easier to implement and optimize. 

4. Invariance to permutations: Since quantization ignores the specific locations of probability mass within bins, quantization-based distances are often invariant to permutations of the distribution support. This can be advantageous in some applications.

However, quantization-based distances also have some disadvantages compared to Wasserstein distances:

1. Loss of information: Quantizing distributions results in a loss of information, since the exact probability masses within bins are ignored. This can reduce the ability to capture fine-grained distributional differences.

2. Sensitivity to bin widths: The choice of bin widths can significantly impact quantization-based distances. The optimal bin widths depend on the specific distributions being compared.

3. Limited geometric interpretation: Unlike Wasserstein distances, quantization-based distances do not have as clear an optimal transport interpretation. Their geometric meaning is less obvious.

So in summary, for comparing high-dimensional distributions, quantization-based distances offer important advantages in terms of computational efficiency, practicality and simplicity. However, the information loss due to quantization and sensitivity to binning can reduce their ability to capture subtle distributional differences. The trade-offs depend on the specific application requirements and data.</div></div><div class="flex justify-between lg:block"><div class="text-xs flex items-center justify-center gap-1 self-center

Quantization-based distances offer computational efficiency and simplicity but may sacrifice some information and geometric interpretation compared to Wasserstein distances.</p></div></div></div><div

Nadeesha Ranasinghe, Wei-Min Shen 
Abstract Surprise-Based Learning (SBL) is a learning 
algorithm capable of providing a physical robot the ability 
to autonomously learn and plan in an unknown 
environment without any prior knowledge of its actions or 
their impact on the environment. This is achieved by 
creating a model of the environment using prediction 
rules. A prediction rule describes the observations of the 
environment prior to the execution of an action and the 
forecasted or predicted observation of the environment 
after the action. The algorithm learns by investigating 
surprises, which are inconsistencies between the 
predictions and observed outcome. SBL has been 
successfully demonstrated on a modular robot learning 
and navigating in a small static environment. 
I. INTRODUCTION 
Here we present a scenario of learning as follows. First a 
baby robot will be arbitrarily placed in a new, small and 
static environment and it will autonomously perform learning 
and problem solving with a limited number of sensors and 
actions. Then, the number of sensors and actions are varied to 
determine the competence of the learning. Finally the sensors 
and actions will be dynamically sabotaged (such as injecting 
noise or turning a sensor upside-down or toggling actions 
such as mapping forward to backward and vice versa) to test if 
the learning can adapt to new situations [1]. This is similar to 
testing a humans learning ability by having them wear glasses 
that invert their vision. 
In SBL there is a surprise if the latest prediction is 
noticeably different from the latest observation. The algorithm 
must not only detect a surprise, it must also distinguish a 
possible cause for the surprise by investigating the change in 
features. The algorithm follows the framework in Fig. 1. 
This framework can be abstractly described as follows: 
After performing an action, the world is sensed via the 
perceptor module which extracts feature information from one 
or more sensors. If the algorithm had made a prediction, the 
surprise analyzer will validate it. If the prediction was 
incorrect, the model modifier will adjust the world model 
accordingly. Based on the updated model the action selector 
will perform the next action so as to repeat the learning cycle.

III. THE SURPRISE-BASED LEARNING ALGORITHM 
In SBL, the world model is represented as a set of rules: 
Rule  Conditions  Action  Predictions (1) 
Condition  (Feature  Operator  Value) (2) 
Prediction  (Feature  Operator) (3) 
The SBL algorithm follows a cycle which includes 
prediction, surprise detection and analysis, rule creation, 
selection, validation, maintenance via rule splitting &amp; rule 
refinement, rule abstraction and planning. The details of the 
algorithm can be found in [2]. 
Rule Creation: 
Rule 1 = C1  Action  P1 (4) 
Rule Splitting with Prediction Modification: 
(C2 being the reason for the surprise, and P2 a second 
prediction which may or may not exist  see subsection E) 
Rule 1.1 = C1  C2  Action  P1   P2 (5) 
Rule 1.2 = C1   C2  Action   P1  P2 (6) 
After splitting, the 2 rules are marked as complementary. 
Rule Refinement, given Rule 1.1 failed: 
(C3 being the reason for surprise) 
Rule 1.3 = C1  (C2  C3)  Action  P1   P2 (7) 
Rule 1.4 = C1   (C2  C3)  Action   P1  P2 
(8) 
Rule Refinement, given Rule 1.2 failed: 
(C3 being the reason for surprise) 
Rule 1.3 = C1  ( C2  C3)  Action  P1   P2 (9) 
Rule 1.4 = C1   ( C2  C3)  Action   P1  P2 (10)

for Developmental Robotics" by Nadeesha Ranasinghe and Wei-Min Shen explores the application of surprise-based learning in the context of developmental robotics. The paper introduces an algorithm called Surprise-Based Learning (SBL), which enables a physical robot to autonomously learn and plan in an unknown environment without any prior knowledge of its actions or their impact.</p><p>The SBL algorithm operates by creating a model of the environment using prediction rules. These prediction rules describe the expected observations before and after executing an action. The algorithm learns by investigating "surprises," which are inconsistencies between the predicted and observed outcomes. By detecting surprises and analyzing the changes in features, the algorithm adapts its model to improve future predictions.</p><p>The experimental setup involves placing a robot in a small static environment and testing its learning and problem-solving abilities. The number of sensors and actions is varied to assess the algorithm's competence. Additionally, the sensors and actions are dynamically manipulated to evaluate the learning's adaptability to new situations, similar to how humans' learning abilities are tested by wearing glasses that invert their vision.</p><p>The SBL algorithm follows a cycle that includes prediction, surprise detection and analysis, rule creation, selection, validation, maintenance, and planning. The world model is represented as a set of rules, and the algorithm refines and splits rules based on the detected surprises. The paper provides specific examples of rule creation, splitting, and refinement to illustrate the algorithm's operation.</p><p>Overall, the paper presents the SBL algorithm as a framework for surprise-based learning in developmental robotics. It demonstrates the algorithm's effectiveness in enabling a robot to learn and adapt to unknown environments. The algorithm's ability to detect surprises and refine the world model based on observed outcomes showcases its potential in autonomous learning and problem-solving scenarios.</p></div></div></div><div class="flex justify-between lg:block"><div class="text-xs flex items-center justify-center gap-1 self-center pt-2 !invisible"><button disabled="" class="dark:text-white disabled:text-gray-300 dark:disabled:text-gray-400"><svg stroke="currentColor" fill="none" stroke-width="1.5" viewBox="0 0 24 24" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" class="h-3 w-3" height="1em" width="1em" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg"><polyline points="15 18 9 12 15 6"></polyline></svg></button><span class="flex-grow flex-shrink-0">1 / 1</span><button disabled="" class="dark:text-white disabled:text-gray-300 dark:disabled:text-gray-400"><svg stroke="currentColor" fill="none" stroke-width="1.5" viewBox="0 0 24 24" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" class="h-3 w-3" height="1em" width="1em" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg"><polyline points="9 18 15 12 9 6"></polyline></svg></button></div><div class="text-gray-400 flex self-end lg:self-center justify-center mt-2 gap-2 md:gap-3 lg:gap-1 lg:absolute lg:top-0 lg:translate-x-full lg:right-0 lg:mt-0 lg:pl-2 visible"><button class="flex ml-auto gap-2 rounded-md p-1 hover:bg-gray-100 hover:text-gray-700 dark:text-gray-400 dark:hover:bg-gray-700 dark:hover:text-gray-200 disabled:dark:hover:text-gray-400"><svg stroke="currentColor" fill="none" stroke-width="2" viewBox="0 0 24 24" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" class="h-4 w-4" height="1em" width="1em" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg"><path d="M16 4h2a2 2 0 0 1 2 2v14a2 2 0 0 1-2 2H6a2 2 0 0 1-2-2V6a2 2 0 0 1 2-2h2"></path><rect x="8" y="2" width="8" height="4" rx="1" ry="1"></rect></svg></button><div class="flex gap-1"><button class="p-1 rounded-md hover:bg-gray-100 hover:text-gray-700 dark:text-gray-400 dark:hover:bg-gray-700 dark:hover:text-gray-200 disabled:dark:hover:text-gray-400"><svg stroke="currentColor" fill="none" stroke-width="2" viewBox="0 0 24 24" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" class="h-4 w-4" height="1em" width="1em" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg"><path d="M14 9V5a3 3 0 0 0-3-3l-4 9v11h11.28a2 2 0 0 0 2-1.7l1.38-9a2 2 0 0 0-2-2.3zM7 22H4a2 2 0 0 1-2-2v-7a2 2 0 0 1 2-2h3"></path></svg></button><button class="p-1 rounded-md hover:bg-gray-100 hover:text-gray-700 dark:text-gray-400 dark:hover:bg-gray-700 dark:hover:text-gray-200 disabled:dark:hover:text-gray-400"><svg stroke="currentColor" fill="none" stroke-width="2" viewBox="0 0 24 24" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" class="h-4 w-4" height="1em" width="1em" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg"><path d="M10 15v4a3 3 0 0 0 3 3l4-9V2H5.72a2 2 0 0 0-2 1.7l-1.38 9a2 2 0 0 0 2 2.3zm7-13h2.67A2.31 2.31 0 0 1 22 4v7a2.31 2.31 0 0 1-2.33 2H17"></path></svg></button></div></div></div></div></div></div><div class="group w-full text-gray-800 dark:text-gray-100 border-b border-black/10 dark:border-gray-900/50 dark:bg-gray-800"><div class="flex p-4 gap-4 text-base md:gap-6 md:max-w-2xl lg:max-w-[38rem] xl:max-w-3xl md:py-6 lg:px-0 m-auto"><div class="flex-shrink-0 flex flex-col relative items-end"><div class="w-[30px]"><div class="relative flex"><span style="box-sizing: border-box; display: inline-block; overflow: hidden; width: initial; height: initial; background: none; opacity: 1; border: 0px; margin: 0px; padding: 0px; position: relative; max-width: 100%;"><span style="box-sizing: border-box; display: block; width: initial; height: initial; background: none; opacity: 1; border: 0px; margin: 0px; padding: 0px; max-width: 100%;"><img alt="" aria-hidden="true" src="data:image/svg+xml,%3csvg%20xmlns=%27http://www.w3.org/2000/svg%27%20version=%271.1%27%20width=%2738%27%20height=%2738%27/%3e" style="display: block; max-width: 100%; width: initial; height: initial; background: none; opacity: 1; border: 0px; margin: 0px; padding: 0px;"></span><img alt="User" src="https://chat.openai.com/_next/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Flh3.googleusercontent.com%2Fa%2FAAcHTtfE_9fVpMOqgyC7Lo43NLrKgIo-u2ToDOuYOa2T%3Ds96-c&amp;w=96&amp;q=75" decoding="async" data-nimg="intrinsic" class="rounded-sm" style="position: absolute; inset: 0px; box-sizing: border-box; padding: 0px; border: none; margin: auto; display: block; width: 0px; height: 0px; min-width: 100%; max-width: 100%; min-height: 100%; max-height: 100%;" width="30" height="30"></span></div></div></div><div class="relative flex w-[calc(100%-50px)] flex-col gap-1 md:gap-3 lg:w-[calc(100%-115px)]"><div class="flex flex-grow flex-col gap-3"><div class="min-h-[20px] flex flex-col items-start gap-4 whitespace-pre-wrap break-words">Connections with the following: How particular is the physics of the free energy

Abstract 
The free energy principle (FEP) states that any dynamical system can be 
interpreted as performing Bayesian inference upon its surrounding environ- 
ment. In this work, we examine in depth the assumptions required to de- 
rive the FEP in the simplest possible set of systems  weakly-coupled non- 
equilibrium linear stochastic systems. Specif i cally, we explore (i) how general 
the requirements imposed on the statistical structure of a system are and (ii) 
how informative the FEP is about the behaviour of such systems. We dis- 
cover that two requirements of the FEP  the Markov blanket condition 
(i.e. a statistical boundary precluding direct coupling between internal and 
external states) and stringent restrictions on its solenoidal l ows (i.e. tenden- 
cies driving a system out of equilibrium)  are only valid for a very narrow 
space of parameters. Suitable systems require an absence of perception-action 
asymmetries that is highly unusual for living systems interacting with an en- 
vironment. More importantly, we observe that a mathematically central step 
in the argument, connecting the behaviour of a system to variational infer- 
ence, relies on an implicit equivalence between the dynamics of the average 
states of a system with the average of the dynamics of those states. This 
equivalence does not hold in general even for linear systems, since it requires 
an ef f ective decoupling from the systems history of interactions. These ob-

servations are critical for evaluating the generality and applicability of the 
FEP and indicate the existence of signif i cant problems of the theory in its 
current form. These issues make the FEP, as it stands, not straightforwardly 
applicable to the simple linear systems studied here and suggest that more 
development is needed before the theory could be applied to the kind of 
complex systems that describe living and cognitive processes.

Millidge, Alexander Tschantz, and Christopher L. Buckley critically examines the assumptions and requirements of the free energy principle (FEP) in the context of weakly-coupled non-equilibrium linear stochastic systems. The FEP posits that any dynamical system can be interpreted as performing Bayesian inference on its environment.</p><p>The authors aim to investigate the generality and informativeness of the FEP in these simple systems. They specifically explore two key requirements of the FEP: the Markov blanket condition, which sets a statistical boundary between internal and external states, and the restrictions on solenoidal flows, which drive the system out of equilibrium. Through their analysis, they find that these requirements hold only for a narrow range of parameters.</p><p>Additionally, the authors highlight an important step in the FEP argument that connects the system's behavior to variational inference. They point out that this step relies on an implicit equivalence between the dynamics of the average states of a system and the average dynamics of those states. However, they observe that this equivalence does not generally hold, even for linear systems, as it requires effective decoupling from the system's history of interactions.</p><p>These observations have significant implications for the generality and applicability of the FEP. The authors note that suitable systems for the FEP require an absence of perception-action asymmetries, which is uncommon for living systems interacting with their environment. They also suggest that the current form of the FEP is not straightforwardly applicable to the simple linear systems studied in their work, and more development is needed before the theory can be applied to the complex systems that describe living and cognitive processes.</p><p>In summary, the paper critically evaluates the FEP and raises important questions about its assumptions and applicability in the context of weakly-coupled non-equilibrium linear stochastic systems. The findings shed light on the challenges and limitations of applying the FEP to complex systems, emphasizing the need for further development and refinement of the theory.</p></div></div></div><div class="flex justify-between lg:block"><div class="text-xs flex items-center justify-center gap-1 self-center pt-2 !invisible"><button disabled="" class="dark:text-white disabled:text-gray-300 dark:disabled:text-gray-400"><svg stroke="currentColor" fill="none" stroke-width="1.5" viewBox="0 0 24 24" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" class="h-3 w-3" height="1em" width="1em" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg"><polyline points="15 18 9 12 15 6"></polyline></svg></button><span class="flex-grow flex-shrink-0">1 / 1</span><button disabled="" class="dark:text-white disabled:text-gray-300 dark:disabled:text-gray-400"><svg stroke="currentColor" fill="none" stroke-width="1.5" viewBox="0 0 24 24" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" class="h-3 w-3" height="1em" width="1em" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg"><polyline points="9 18 15 12 9 6"></polyline></svg></button></div><div class="text-gray-400 flex self-end lg:self-center justify-center mt-2 gap-2 md:gap-3 lg:gap-1 lg:absolute lg:top-0 lg:translate-x-full lg:right-0 lg:mt-0 lg:pl-2 visible"><button class="flex ml-auto gap-2 rounded-md p-1 hover:bg-gray-100 hover:text-gray-700 dark:text-gray-400 dark:hover:bg-gray-700 dark:hover:text-gray-200 disabled:dark:hover:text-gray-400"><svg stroke="currentColor" fill="none" stroke-width="2" viewBox="0 0 24 24" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" class="h-4 w-4" height="1em" width="1em" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg"><path d="M16 4h2a2 2 0 0 1 2 2v14a2 2 0 0 1-2 2H6a2 2 0 0 1-2-2V6a2 2 0 0 1 2-2h2"></path><rect x="8" y="2" width="8" height="4" rx="1" ry="1"></rect></svg></button><div class="flex gap-1"><button class="p-1 rounded-md hover:bg-gray-100 hover:text-gray-700 dark:text-gray-400 dark:hover:bg-gray-700 dark:hover:text-gray-200 disabled:dark:hover:text-gray-400"><svg stroke="currentColor" fill="none" stroke-width="2" viewBox="0 0 24 24" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" class="h-4 w-4" height="1em" width="1em" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg"><path d="M14 9V5a3 3 0 0 0-3-3l-4 9v11h11.28a2 2 0 0 0 2-1.7l1.38-9a2 2 0 0 0-2-2.3zM7 22H4a2 2 0 0 1-2-2v-7a2 2 0 0 1 2-2h3"></path></svg></button><button class="p-1 rounded-md hover:bg-gray-100 hover:text-gray-700 dark:text-gray-400 dark:hover:bg-gray-700 dark:hover:text-gray-200 disabled:dark:hover:text-gray-400"><svg stroke="currentColor" fill="none" stroke-width="2" viewBox="0 0 24 24" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" class="h-4 w-4" height="1em" width="1em" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg"><path d="M10 15v4a3 3 0 0 0 3 3l4-9V2H5.72a2 2 0 0 0-2 1.7l-1.38 9a2 2 0 0 0 2 2.3zm7-13h2.67A2.31 2.31 0 0 1 22 4v7a2.31 2.31 0 0 1-2.33 2H17"></path></svg></button></div></div></div></div></div></div><div class="group w-full text-gray-800 dark:text-gray-100 border-b border-black/10 dark:border-gray-900/50 dark:bg-gray-800"><div class="flex p-4 gap-4 text-base md:gap-6 md:max-w-2xl lg:max-w-[38rem] xl:max-w-3xl md:py-6 lg:px-0 m-auto"><div class="flex-shrink-0 flex flex-col relative items-end"><div class="w-[30px]"><div class="relative flex"><span style="box-sizing: border-box; display: inline-block; overflow: hidden; width: initial; height: initial; background: none; opacity: 1; border: 0px; margin: 0px; padding: 0px; position: relative; max-width: 100%;"><span style="box-sizing: border-box; display: block; width: initial; height: initial; background: none; opacity: 1; border: 0px; margin: 0px; padding: 0px; max-width: 100%;"><img alt="" aria-hidden="true" src="data:image/svg+xml,%3csvg%20xmlns=%27http://www.w3.org/2000/svg%27%20version=%271.1%27%20width=%2738%27%20height=%2738%27/%3e" style="display: block; max-width: 100%; width: initial; height: initial; background: none; opacity: 1; border: 0px; margin: 0px; padding: 0px;"></span><img alt="User" src="https://chat.openai.com/_next/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Flh3.googleusercontent.com%2Fa%2FAAcHTtfE_9fVpMOqgyC7Lo43NLrKgIo-u2ToDOuYOa2T%3Ds96-c&amp;w=96&amp;q=75" decoding="async" data-nimg="intrinsic" class="rounded-sm" style="position: absolute; inset: 0px; box-sizing: border-box; padding: 0px; border: none; margin: auto; display: block; width: 0px; height: 0px; min-width: 100%; max-width: 100%; min-height: 100%; max-height: 100%;" width="30" height="30"></span></div></div></div><div class="relative flex w-[calc(100%-50px)] flex-col gap-1 md:gap-3 lg:w-[calc(100%-115px)]"><div class="flex flex-grow flex-col gap-3"><div class="min-h-[20px] flex flex-col items-start gap-4 whitespace-pre-wrap break-words">During the last decade, the free energy principle (FEP) has become 
an inf l uential framework which aims to provide a grand theory promoting a 
Bayesian interpretation of living systems [1, 2, 3]. The FEP states that any 
self-organizing system (i.e. any dynamical system, and therefore any living 
or cognitive entity) equipped with a Markov blanket  a statistical separa- 
tion between internal and external states  can be interpreted as performing 
Bayesian inference upon the surrounding environment, such that its internal 
states come to encode probabilistic beliefs about the external environment 
[3, 4]. 
The core claim of the FEP is exceptionally ambitious. It implies that 
the dynamics of any pair of coupled systems, under specif i c conditions about 
the interaction of internal and external states, can be described as one sys- 
tem trying to statistically infer the states of the second system (cf an agent 
and its environment). This claim licenses an interpretation of the agent as 
performing a basic kind of Bayesian inference and encoding beliefs about 
the surrounding environment [5, 6]. Such an equivalence could have a far- 
reaching inf l uence on the study of living systems. For example, it could en- 
able approximate calculations of the dynamics of complex systems in terms 
of a more tractable description of the dynamics of their suf i cient statistics. 
Furthermore, the FEP has been defended based on singular claims about its 
explanatory power, suggesting that it reveals novel insights among funda- 
mental psychological concepts such as memory, attention, value, reinforce- 
ment, and salience [7] and unif i es dif f erent aspects of motor behaviour and 
perception, from retinal stabilization to goal-seeking [8]. In addition, it has 
been proposed that the FEP provides a basis for integrating several general 
brain theories, including the Bayesian brain hypothesis, neural Darwinism, 
2 
Hebbian cell assembly theory, and optimal control and decision theory [9]. 
The FEP has also inspired theories such as predictive coding [10, 11, 12, 
13] and active inference [14, 15, 16], which of f er explanations and models of 
brain function and dysfunction [17] through the lens of Bayesian inference, 
and have become widely inf l uential in theoretical neuroscience and beyond. 
For instance, predictive coding has been proposed to be a biologically plau- 
sible model of cortical function [11, 12, 18], and has been applied to explain 
binocular rivalry [19] or attention [20]. Active inference, on the other hand, 
has seen substantial use in modelling the behaviour of human or animal sub- 
jects in various paradigms [14, 15], as well as understanding rational decision- 
making and behavioural control [21, 22, 23, 24]. Moreover, biological theories 
proposing that neurons [25], synapses [26], bacteria [27] or plants [28] could 
be explicitly performing Bayesian (variational) inference by minimizing free 
energy gradients have been proposed and justif i ed using explicit appeals to 
the FEP. While such theories do not entirely depend upon the validity of the 
mathematical core of the FEP reviewed here, they nevertheless derive a sub- 
stantial amount of their intellectual and rhetorical support from it. Thus, 
the fundamental validity of the mathematical framework of the FEP is of 
great importance to this large and rapidly increasing modelling literature. 
In a vast body of work that spans over the course of about 15 years, 
the FEP has detailed the mathematical steps required to derive its central 
claims. In the i rst phase, an intuitive and heuristic idea of an imperative to 
minimize variational free energy was developed [29, 7] based on the need for 
any recognizable system to maintain itself in a low entropy conf i guration 
over time against dissipative forces trying to push it towards a high entropy 
equilibrium state. Later, this heuristic argument and intuition was more for- 
mally related to concepts from stochastic thermodynamics [2, 1], specif i cally 
by bringing in the Markov blanket condition and expressing the dynamics of 
the system in terms of a gradient descent on a variational free energy corre- 
sponding to a generative model of the environment of the system. Finally, 
the mathematical formulation and some of its arguments have been recently 
ref i ned in a new series of publications [3, 4, 30], a process that is still ongoing. 
Despite the extensive literature on the FEP, there are few concrete ex- 
amples that apply all the required steps to a specif i c, well-studied system. 
Similarly, it has rarely been explored whether the assumptions (which are 
sometimes left unstated) required for deriving the principle hold under the 
dynamics we expect from cognitive and living systems.</div></div><div class="flex justify-between lg:block"><div class="text-xs flex items-center justify-center gap-1 self-center pt-2

providing a Bayesian interpretation of living systems. The FEP proposes that any self-organizing system equipped with a Markov blanket, which separates internal and external states, can be understood as performing Bayesian inference on the surrounding environment. The FEP's core claim is ambitious, suggesting that the dynamics of coupled systems can be described as one system inferring the states of the other.</p><p>The FEP has far-reaching implications for understanding complex systems, as it enables approximate calculations and more tractable descriptions of their dynamics. It has been connected to various psychological concepts such as memory, attention, value, reinforcement, and salience, as well as motor behavior and perception. The FEP has also inspired theories like predictive coding and active inference, which have gained prominence in theoretical neuroscience.</p><p>The mathematical foundations of the FEP have been developed over many years, from heuristic arguments about minimizing variational free energy to formal connections with stochastic thermodynamics and the use of the Markov blanket. Recent refinements in the mathematical formulation of the FEP are still ongoing.</p><p>Despite the extensive literature on the FEP, few concrete examples have applied all the required steps to specific well-studied systems. Furthermore, it is unclear whether the assumptions underlying the FEP hold for the dynamics expected in cognitive and living systems.</p><p>In summary, the introduction provides an overview of the FEP, its significance, and its influence on various fields, while also acknowledging the need for further exploration and application of the principle to specific systems.</p></div></div></div><div class="flex justify-between lg:block"><div class="text-xs flex items-center justify-center gap-1 self-center pt-2 !invisible"><button disabled="" class="dark:text-white disabled:text-gray-300 dark:disabled:text-gray-400"><svg stroke="currentColor" fill="none" stroke-width="1.5" viewBox="0 0 24 24" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" class="h-3 w-3" height="1em" width="1em" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg"><polyline points="15 18 9 12 15 6"></polyline></svg></button><span class="flex-grow flex-shrink-0">1 / 1</span><button disabled="" class="dark:text-white disabled:text-gray-300 dark:disabled:text-gray-400"><svg stroke="currentColor" fill="none" stroke-width="1.5" viewBox="0 0 24 24" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" class="h-3 w-3" height="1em" width="1em" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg"><polyline points="9 18 15 12 9 6"></polyline></svg></button></div><div class="text-gray-400 flex self-end lg:self-center justify-center mt-2 gap-2 md:gap-3 lg:gap-1 lg:absolute lg:top-0 lg:translate-x-full lg:right-0 lg:mt-0 lg:pl-2 visible"><button class="flex ml-auto gap-2 rounded-md p-1 hover:bg-gray-100 hover:text-gray-700 dark:text-gray-400 dark:hover:bg-gray-700 dark:hover:text-gray-200 disabled:dark:hover:text-gray-400"><svg stroke="currentColor" fill="none" stroke-width="2" viewBox="0 0 24 24" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" class="h-4 w-4" height="1em" width="1em" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg"><path d="M16 4h2a2 2 0 0 1 2 2v14a2 2 0 0 1-2 2H6a2 2 0 0 1-2-2V6a2 2 0 0 1 2-2h2"></path><rect x="8" y="2" width="8" height="4" rx="1" ry="1"></rect></svg></button><div class="flex gap-1"><button class="p-1 rounded-md hover:bg-gray-100 hover:text-gray-700 dark:text-gray-400 dark:hover:bg-gray-700 dark:hover:text-gray-200 disabled:dark:hover:text-gray-400"><svg stroke="currentColor" fill="none" stroke-width="2" viewBox="0 0 24 24" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" class="h-4 w-4" height="1em" width="1em" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg"><path d="M14 9V5a3 3 0 0 0-3-3l-4 9v11h11.28a2 2 0 0 0 2-1.7l1.38-9a2 2 0 0 0-2-2.3zM7 22H4a2 2 0 0 1-2-2v-7a2 2 0 0 1 2-2h3"></path></svg></button><button class="p-1 rounded-md hover:bg-gray-100 hover:text-gray-700 dark:text-gray-400 dark:hover:bg-gray-700 dark:hover:text-gray-200 disabled:dark:hover:text-gray-400"><svg stroke="currentColor" fill="none" stroke-width="2" viewBox="0 0 24 24" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" class="h-4 w-4" height="1em" width="1em" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg"><path d="M10 15v4a3 3 0 0 0 3 3l4-9V2H5.72a2 2 0 0 0-2 1.7l-1.38 9a2 2 0 0 0 2 2.3zm7-13h2.67A2.31 2.31 0 0 1 22 4v7a2.31 2.31 0 0 1-2.33 2H17"></path></svg></button></div></div></div></div></div></div><div class="group w-full text-gray-800 dark:text-gray-100 border-b border-black/10 dark:border-gray-900/50 dark:bg-gray-800"><div class="flex p-4 gap-4 text-base md:gap-6 md:max-w-2xl lg:max-w-[38rem] xl:max-w-3xl md:py-6 lg:px-0 m-auto"><div class="flex-shrink-0 flex flex-col relative items-end"><div class="w-[30px]"><div class="relative flex"><span style="box-sizing: border-box; display: inline-block; overflow: hidden; width: initial; height: initial; background: none; opacity: 1; border: 0px; margin: 0px; padding: 0px; position: relative; max-width: 100%;"><span style="box-sizing: border-box; display: block; width: initial; height: initial; background: none; opacity: 1; border: 0px; margin: 0px; padding: 0px; max-width: 100%;"><img alt="" aria-hidden="true" src="data:image/svg+xml,%3csvg%20xmlns=%27http://www.w3.org/2000/svg%27%20version=%271.1%27%20width=%2738%27%20height=%2738%27/%3e" style="display: block; max-width: 100%; width: initial; height: initial; background: none; opacity: 1; border: 0px; margin: 0px; padding: 0px;"></span><img alt="User" src="https://chat.openai.com/_next/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Flh3.googleusercontent.com%2Fa%2FAAcHTtfE_9fVpMOqgyC7Lo43NLrKgIo-u2ToDOuYOa2T%3Ds96-c&amp;w=96&amp;q=75" decoding="async" data-nimg="intrinsic" class="rounded-sm" style="position: absolute; inset: 0px; box-sizing: border-box; padding: 0px; border: none; margin: auto; display: block; width: 0px; height: 0px; min-width: 100%; max-width: 100%; min-height: 100%; max-height: 100%;" width="30" height="30"></span></div></div></div><div class="relative flex w-[calc(100%-50px)] flex-col gap-1 md:gap-3 lg:w-[calc(100%-115px)]"><div class="flex flex-grow flex-col gap-3"><div class="min-h-[20px] flex flex-col items-start gap-4 whitespace-pre-wrap break-words">Consciousness is learning: predictive

Abstract 
Machine learning algorithms have achieved superhuman performance in specific complex domains. Yet 
learning online from few examples and efficiently generalizing across domains remains elusive. In humans 
such learning proceeds via declarative memory formation and is closely associated with consciousness. 
Predictive processing has been advanced as a principled Bayesian inference framework for understanding 
the cortex as implementing deep generative perceptual models for both sensory data and action control. 
However, predictive processing offers little direct insight into fast compositional learning or the mystery 
of consciousness. Here we propose that through implementing online learning by hierarchical binding of 
unpredicted inferences, a predictive processing system may flexibly generalize in novel situations by 
forming working memories for perceptions and actions from single examples, which can become short- 
and long-term declarative memories retrievable by associative recall. We argue that the contents of such 
working memories are unified yet differentiated, can be maintained by selective attention and are 
consistent with observations of masking, postdictive perceptual integration, and other paradigm cases of 
consciousness research. We describe how the brain could have evolved to use perceptual value prediction 
for reinforcement learning of complex action policies simultaneously implementing multiple survival and 
reproduction strategies. Conscious experience is how such a learning system perceptually represents its 
own functioning, suggesting an answer to the meta problem of consciousness. Our proposal naturally 
unifies feature binding, recurrent processing, and predictive processing with global workspace, and, to a 
lesser extent, the higher order theories of consciousness. We provide a qualitative but specific functional 
description of the proposed information processing architecture to facilitate experimental testing, 
refinement or falsification. While such a system is in principle straightforward to implement numerically, 
ethical implications of such numerical experiments ought to be considered carefully.</div></div><div class="flex justify-between lg:block"><div class="text-xs flex items-center justify-center gap-1

The field of machine learning advanced explosively in the last 3 decades and enabled numerous practical 
applications in the areas of image and language processing and autonomous control. Deep learning and 
reinforcement learning (Sutton and Barto 1998) principles enable machines that learned chess, go and 
computer games from scratch (Silver et al. 2018; Mnih et al. 2015), and left humans well behind in 
performance. However, while deep learning, artificial neural networks and reinforcement learning were 
largely inspired by the biological systems, the overarching information processing principles in the 
biological brains remain poorly understood. In biological systems in-situ learning and behavior adaptation 
have been honed by evolution to confer survival and reproduction advantages despite their significant 
energetic and other costs. Meanwhile, learning machines are still unable to efficiently learn online, in the 
real world, from few examples and to incrementally combine and generalize useful behavior patterns 
across domains (Kaelbling 2020)  the tasks mammals excel at. In humans this type of learning can be 
linked to forming declarative memories, which is an indicator of conscious information processing. Thus, 
understanding consciousness is not only one of the preeminent intellectual challenges of our time, but, 
viewed from the fundamental statistical and machine learning perspective, may lead to radical practical 
advances enabling the next generation of artificial learning agents. 
Since the turn of the century the problem of human consciousness has been at the focus of intense and 
growing experimental, theoretical and philosophical attention. While initial empirical investigations were 
organized around searching for the neural correlates of consciousness (Crick and Koch 1990), more 
recently a variety of conceptual frameworks and theories of consciousness (ToCs) (Seth and Bayne 2022) 
have been advanced to provide the intellectual scaffold for orienting the empirical studies. However, 
despite the proliferation of ToCs, they remain largely incongruent, with each one seemingly focusing on 
specific aspects of consciousness and the corresponding neurobiological and empirical data (Doerig, 
Schurger, and Herzog 2021). There is currently no common theoretical paradigm connecting across the 
field and no clear agreement as to the exact meaning of the term consciousness. All leading ToCs contain 
important empirically supported insights, but there is currently no conceptual approach that can unify 
these descriptions as aspects of a common model. Ideally, consciousness would be understood as an 
inherent aspect of a broader unified model of cognition seamlessly including attention and affect together 
with learning, perception and action, describing how the perceptions and reports of the subjective 
experience may arise, and how the systems overall function confers an evolutionary advantage. 
Maintaining organism homeostasis, while crucially important, is only one of many gene proliferating 
strategies that are evidently being implemented through the general and flexible adaptation and control 
enabled by the brain. If efficient and general learning is a core function of this system, and declarative 
learning is a key part of it, so is consciousness. 
Declarative learning, proceeding through working memory (Kandel, Schwartz, and Jessell 2000), is directly 
related to consciousness  we form declarative memories of things we are conscious of. While 
declarative learning can dramatically fail in fully conscious humans with certain types of amnesia, such 
failure may be understood as downstream of consciousness. The ability to quickly learn by dynamically 
forming novel associations of multiple perceptions and actions in working memory remains intact, 
enabling flexible and adaptive behavioral response to novel stimuli, despite the failure to retain and 
consolidate (optimize) this new knowledge for future use via the short- and long-term memory. It is 
therefore compelling to consider consciousness as a manifestation of a learning process. The relationship 
between consciousness and learning figures prominently in several ToCs (Lamme 2006; Cleeremans et al. 
2020; Cleeremans 2011; Birch, Ginsburg, and Jablonka 2020; Singer 2001). Notably, consciousness has 
been connected to dynamic binding of known perceptual features for representing novel compound 
objects (Singer 2001; Crick and Koch 2003; Treisman 2003), and both learning and forming dynamic 
connections between perceptual features are key in the recurrent processing theory (Lamme 2006). 
Here we develop a conceptual proposal for the functional organization of a biological or an artificial 
conscious agent as a learning system that combines learning by binding with predictive processing (PP) 
(Hohwy and Seth 2020; Hohwy 2020; Clark 2013) for perception, and active inference (K. Friston et al. 
2017; K. J. Friston et al. 2010; Parr and Friston 2019) and reinforcement learning (RL) (Montague, Dayan, 
and Sejnowski 1996; Schultz, Dayan, and Montague 1997; Cohen et al. 2012) for action. Functionally, the 
proposed learning architecture constantly posits and tests new perceptual hypotheses by introducing new 
causes that minimize the largest and most time-correlated prediction errors, attempting to find common 
hidden causes that bind these otherwise-unpredicted perceptual inferences. The specific perceptual 
features that are being bound are what the system perceives as its conscious contents, and the process 
of hypothesis generation is perceived as being conscious. We describe how the typical reports referring 
to conscious experience originate from perceptual representations the system learns to infer about itself 
and how the proposed functional organization entails these representations, including unified yet 
differentiated perception, short and long-term memory formation and associative recall, attention and 
working memory, affect, multimodal thinking, action and different types of learning. 
Neural implementations of our proposals three constitutive information processing functions  PP, 
feature binding, and RL  have been broadly discussed in the literature, with neural circuits proposed for 
PP and identified for RL, and feature binding variously related to recurrent processing (Lamme 2006), 
neural coalitions (Crick and Koch 2003) and synchronization in the cortico-thalamic system (Singer 2001). 
Furthermore, we will argue that our proposal entails as its consequences the key insights underlying global
workspace (Baars 1995; 2005; Dehaene and Changeux 2011; Mashour et al. 2020) and high order theories 
(Cleeremans et al. 2020; Cleeremans 2011; Brown, Lau, and LeDoux 2019). Lastly, our answer to the meta 
version (Chalmers 2018) of the hard problem (Chalmers 1995) proceeds largely along the illusionist 
approach, similar, for example, to the one described recently in the context of the attention schema ToC 
(Graziano et al. 2020). 
In the following manuscript, the first major section introduces the learning functional architecture and 
discusses its consequences with the focus on perception. The second major section expands the 
architecture to include action learning and optimization by future value estimation and RL. The first 
section introduces learning-by-binding as a natural complement to the conventional PP learning, enabling 
Bayesian learning of new categorical causes for sensory data. We then explore the implications of this 
architecture, arguing that it directly entails formation of a unified perceptual representation and a 
corresponding memory record accessible by associative recall, as well as the appearance of a global 
workspace, whereby binding immediately connects perceived features to a broad range of possible 
actions, including maintaining them in the workspace by selective attention. We discuss how conscious 
contents are defined by this functional account of the proposed learning architecture. Finally, we discuss 
the transparent and hierarchical nature of the learned perceptual models, including the higher order 
perceptions of experience arising and self, and argue how transparency gives raise to the hard problem 
illusion. 
In the second section we consider an information processing system evolved for learning, via temporal 
difference RL (TDRL) (Sutton and Barto 1998), action policies that implement multiple survival and 
reproduction strategies. We discuss how perception may be optimized for guiding action and estimating 
the future value of the current state needed for TDRL. We adapt the active inference approach of 
representing both actions and perceptions within the same categorical PP model, whereby actions may 
manifest as selective attention and imagination as well as motor execution. We argue that the learning- 
by-binding mechanism, applied to actions, rapidly and directly modifies the ongoing action policy by 
making new cross-predictive links between perceptions and actions  forming declarative action 
memories, subject to RL rules. The TDRL framework with explicit future value estimation allows action 
learning toward distinct survival and reproduction goals implicitly encoded via separate categories of 
neuro-biologically generated internal reward signals. We believe that learning by binding applied to deep 
generative models for perception and action results in the sample-efficient, generalizable, compositional 
and incremental online learning, which is the hallmark of conscious information processing in humans and 
which is currently lacking in artificial agents (Kaelbling 2020).</div></div><div class="flex justify-between lg:block"><div class="text-xs flex items-center justify-center gap-1 self-center pt-2

However, despite these advances, there is still a lack of understanding of the underlying information processing principles in biological brains that enable efficient online learning, generalization, and adaptation.</p><p>Consciousness is highlighted as an essential aspect of learning in humans, particularly through the formation of declarative memories. The authors propose that understanding consciousness from a statistical and machine learning perspective could lead to practical advances in artificial learning agents.</p><p>The problem of human consciousness is described as a subject of intense study, with various theories and frameworks proposed to explain its nature. However, there is currently no common theoretical paradigm connecting these different approaches, and the exact meaning of consciousness remains unclear. The authors argue for the need to unify these descriptions and integrate consciousness into a broader model of cognition, including attention, affect, learning, perception, and action.</p><p>Declarative learning is emphasized as a key process related to consciousness, and its failure in certain cases of amnesia is viewed as downstream of consciousness. The ability to learn by dynamically forming associations in working memory is highlighted as intact in conscious individuals, enabling flexible and adaptive behavioral responses to novel stimuli.</p><p>The relationship between consciousness and learning is explored in several theories, connecting consciousness to the dynamic binding of perceptual features and the formation of dynamic connections in recurrent processing. The authors propose a conceptual framework for a learning system that combines learning by binding with predictive processing, active inference, and reinforcement learning for perception and action.</p><p>The neural implementations of predictive processing, feature binding, and reinforcement learning are discussed, with neural circuits and processes proposed in the literature. The implications of the proposed learning architecture, such as the formation of unified perceptual representations, memory formation and recall, attention, and multimodal thinking, are examined. The authors also discuss how their proposal aligns with concepts like the global workspace and higher-order theories of consciousness.</p><p>The manuscript concludes by discussing the illusionist approach to the meta version of the hard problem of consciousness and outlining the transparent and hierarchical nature of learned perceptual models, including higher-order perceptions of experience and self.</p><p>In the second section, the focus expands to include action learning and optimization through reinforcement learning. The authors explore how perception is optimized for guiding action and estimating future value, and how the learning-by-binding mechanism modifies action policies through cross-predictive links between perceptions and actions. The temporal difference reinforcement learning framework with explicit future value estimation allows for action learning towards distinct survival and reproduction goals.</p><p>The authors suggest that learning by binding, applied to deep generative models for perception and action, can lead to sample-efficient, generalizable, and incremental online learning, which is a hallmark of conscious information processing in humans and currently lacking in artificial agents.</p><p>Overall, the introduction provides a comprehensive overview of the motivation behind the study, the challenges in understanding consciousness, and the proposed learning framework that integrates learning by binding, predictive processing, and reinforcement learning.</p></div></div></div><div class="flex justify-between lg:block"><div class="text-xs flex items-center justify-center gap-1 self-center pt-2 !invisible"><button disabled="" class="dark:text-white disabled:text-gray-300 dark:disabled:text-gray-400"><svg stroke="currentColor" fill="none" stroke-width="1.5" viewBox="0 0 24 24" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" class="h-3 w-3" height="1em" width="1em" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg"><polyline points="15 18 9 12 15 6"></polyline></svg></button><span class="flex-grow flex-shrink-0">1 / 1</span><button disabled="" class="dark:text-white disabled:text-gray-300 dark:disabled:text-gray-400"><svg stroke="currentColor" fill="none" stroke-width="1.5" viewBox="0 0 24 24" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" class="h-3 w-3" height="1em" width="1em" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg"><polyline points="9 18 15 12 9 6"></polyline></svg></button></div><div class="text-gray-400 flex self-end lg:self-center justify-center mt-2 gap-2 md:gap-3 lg:gap-1 lg:absolute lg:top-0 lg:translate-x-full lg:right-0 lg:mt-0 lg:pl-2 visible"><button class="flex ml-auto gap-2 rounded-md p-1 hover:bg-gray-100 hover:text-gray-700 dark:text-gray-400 dark:hover:bg-gray-700 dark:hover:text-gray-200 disabled:dark:hover:text-gray-400"><svg stroke="currentColor" fill="none" stroke-width="2" viewBox="0 0 24 24" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" class="h-4 w-4" height="1em" width="1em" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg"><path d="M16 4h2a2 2 0 0 1 2 2v14a2 2 0 0 1-2 2H6a2 2 0 0 1-2-2V6a2 2 0 0 1 2-2h2"></path><rect x="8" y="2" width="8" height="4" rx="1" ry="1"></rect></svg></button><div class="flex gap-1"><button class="p-1 rounded-md hover:bg-gray-100 hover:text-gray-700 dark:text-gray-400 dark:hover:bg-gray-700 dark:hover:text-gray-200 disabled:dark:hover:text-gray-400"><svg stroke="currentColor" fill="none" stroke-width="2" viewBox="0 0 24 24" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" class="h-4 w-4" height="1em" width="1em" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg"><path d="M14 9V5a3 3 0 0 0-3-3l-4 9v11h11.28a2 2 0 0 0 2-1.7l1.38-9a2 2 0 0 0-2-2.3zM7 22H4a2 2 0 0 1-2-2v-7a2 2 0 0 1 2-2h3"></path></svg></button><button class="p-1 rounded-md hover:bg-gray-100 hover:text-gray-700 dark:text-gray-400 dark:hover:bg-gray-700 dark:hover:text-gray-200 disabled:dark:hover:text-gray-400"><svg stroke="currentColor" fill="none" stroke-width="2" viewBox="0 0 24 24" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" class="h-4 w-4" height="1em" width="1em" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg"><path d="M10 15v4a3 3 0 0 0 3 3l4-9V2H5.72a2 2 0 0 0-2 1.7l-1.38 9a2 2 0 0 0 2 2.3zm7-13h2.67A2.31 2.31 0 0 1 22 4v7a2.31 2.31 0 0 1-2.33 2H17"></path></svg></button></div></div></div></div></div></div><div class="group w-full text-gray-800 dark:text-gray-100 border-b border-black/10 dark:border-gray-900/50 dark:bg-gray-800"><div class="flex p-4 gap-4 text-base md:gap-6 md:max-w-2xl lg:max-w-[38rem] xl:max-w-3xl md:py-6 lg:px-0 m-auto"><div class="flex-shrink-0 flex flex-col relative items-end"><div class="w-[30px]"><div class="relative flex"><span style="box-sizing: border-box;

Background 
Background  predictive processing 
framework.predictive 
processing framework. 
Within the predictive processing framework, we first consider a simplified perception-only system that 
learns, over long timescales, a generative model of incoming sensory data and perceives by dynamically 
inferring the learned causes at each moment to minimize sensory data prediction errors. A perfect 
prediction would be achieved if using the inferred causes and the perceptual data at a given moment in 
time, the system updates the causes at the subsequent times such that the model exactly predicts the 
subsequent sensory data. However, no prediction is perfect, and the inferences of causes are dynamically 
updated based on minimizing the local prediction errors within the model, implementing approximate 
Bayesian inference. Moreover, the same perception errors are used to improve the model by learning 
over the long term, modifying its causal structure, such as by quantitatively changing how individual 
causes are inferred from and, in turn, predict their feature causes, as well as by learning new causes with 
predictive power over sensory data. 
In a typical PP model (Figure 1a), causes are interconnected in a deep hierarchical architecture with a bi- 
directional, generative dynamic relationship. Within such a generative model, the causes predict the 
likelihoods of their features down to the sensory data, as well as their own and other cause likelihoods 
forward in time. While higher-level causes influence their lower-level features via prediction, the 
prediction errors from features in turn dynamically change the inferred likelihoods of the higher-level 
causes. Learning conventionally proceeds by finding mutual activation weights, that is, inference and 
prediction strengths minimizing the local prediction errors over the long term. These locally-hierarchical 
relationships express the key assumption (induction bias defining the hypothesis space) that the sensory 
data is described by causal relationships between wholes and their features. Additional regularizing 
assumptions may be used, such as, for example, particular global hierarchical topology, sparsity within 
subsets of causes (e.g., mutual exclusion), or particular time dependence such as finite persistence. 
Both continuous-valued and discrete (categorical) causes can be combined within PP models (K. J. Friston, 
Parr, and de Vries 2017). The simpler categorical causes are described by single scalar values denoting the 
likelihood of a cause being present, i.e., a single continuous-valued precision is the only number associated 
with each discrete cause. For example, how likely is the cat explanation for the current sensory data, on 
a scale from 0 to 1? Continuous-valued scalar and vector quantities and more general continuous-valued 
objects can also be represented by categorical causes as likelihood distributions on discretized maps that 
can be 1-dimensional, 2-dimensional or have more complex topologies, and can have global or local 
likelihood normalization, smoothness and other regularization rules imposed among the map elements. 
This is consistent with many map-like neural column areas across the neocortex. 
Figure 1. Predictive processing and learning new causes by feature binding. A generative predictive 
processing model (a) encodes the world and action state within a hierarchy of discrete connected 
elements (middle). Each element (right) encodes a scalar state of a single cause (e.g., a categorical cause 
likelihood) and the corresponding scalar prediction error. Multiple elements may interact to represent 
probability distribution maps (top right). The causes higher in the hierarchy predict the lower ones (blue 
solid arrows) and receive their prediction errors (red dashed arrows) for inference. The lowest levels 
represent sensory inputs with externally-given states and actuation outputs with the prediction-dictated 
states. To maintain the predictive power in the presence of processing latencies, the cause dynamics at 
the higher levels is slower than at the lower levels, such that higher levels encode more persistent and 
more abstract causes. (b) illustrates the theorized learning mechanism for new categorical causes. 
Whenever several feature causes, such as shapes, colors, locations, etc., are inferred coincidentally and 
exceed a specific (prediction error) x (duration) threshold, such coincident unexplained causes are 
attributed to a new common cause via learning by binding. The common cause is provisionally added to 
the model and immediately thereafter predicts the features that are thus bound. As the time passes, if 
the new cause is inferred repeatedly, its predictions are refined based on experience and consolidated. 
On the contrary, without repeat inference the prediction strengths are gradually attenuated to zero, and 
the new cause is thereby discarded.</div></div><div class="flex justify-between lg:block"><div class="text-xs flex items-center justify-center gap-1 self-center pt-2 !invisible"><button disabled=""

Higher-level causes predict the likelihoods of their lower-level features, and prediction errors from features dynamically update the inferred likelihoods of the higher-level causes.

to each other. The model is dynamic, with some links embedding time delays to account for sensory 
latency, feature asynchrony and prediction in time. We will refer to this conceptual PP modeling 
description in the following discussion and will further expand it to include learning future-value and 
behavior policy via RL and to discuss active inference. However, the specific details of the model are not 
critical for our central arguments. The key model features are the encoding of distinct inferred causes, 
prediction errors for each cause and the bi-directional, generative inference-prediction relationships. A 
cause is inferred from, and predicts, its feature causes such that each causes precision (inferred 
likelihood) adjusts dynamically, over short timescales, to locally minimize prediction errors. 
The local PP learning rules for long-term modification of prediction strengths to minimize the prediction 
error over multiple epochs remain active across the hierarchy. In particular, at the lower levels within each 
perceptual domain, statistical regularities in sensory data are a function of the physics of the world and 
the sensors. Therefore, low-level sensory cortexes have evolved specific arrangements of cortical maps 
and initial connectivity topologies to facilitate rapid and massively parallel statistical learning via these 
local prediction update rules.

Our key proposal is a new type of induction bias which can be added to PP systems for efficient online 
learning (Figure 1b). Typically, the conventional PP learning rules attribute the prediction errors to 
imperfectly learned prediction strengths between the already-existing causes and learning proceeds by 
adjusting these strengths to minimize errors. We propose an additional, separate type of learning that 
attributes errors to the existence of yet-unknown causes, and attempts to learn such causes, first 
provisionally, and then permanently. Consider a case when several significant prediction errors occur 
together, closely correlated in time, and there is no known common cause that can already be inferred to 
simultaneously predict all of them. Furthermore, suppose each individual prediction error is from a cause 
that has been used many times previously and learned extensively, that is, this causes relationship to the 
known causes, including its own features, has already been well learned over many examples. It is an 
intuitive assumption to tentatively posit a new cause accounting for all the coincident prediction errors  
to assume that the causes with significant concurrent errors are due to (are features of) a common 
previously-unknown cause. 
Different sensory modalities have different latencies; therefore, PP models have to predict causally- 
related features that are asynchronous in time, fusing them across modalities. They also must learn to 
predict the future state from the current one. Thus, individual causes must be able to predict features 
spread in time, including prediction of delayed features at their proper times. Common causes must be 
found for not only concurrent events, but time-correlated events, including temporal sequences spread 
over hundreds of milliseconds, consistent with postdictive effects, such as color-phi and meta-contrast 
masking (Herzog, Drissi-Daoudi, and Doerig 2020), as well as large latency differences between sensory 
domains. The proposed learning process forms such causes by binding features with time-correlated but 
asynchronous prediction errors, across up to few hundred millisecond long delays, depending on the 
perceptual modality. The resulting new-bound causes are functionally the same as other causes within 
the PP model and can be inferred from, and predict, their features relative timing (see further discussion 
of timing effects below and in Figure 3). 
When the unpredicted features are first bound into a new cause, such cause is a temporary hypothesis, 
based on one observation. Once it is no longer actively perceptually inferred, it can only exist as a new 
cause in the PP hierarchy over a short initial time period, a short-term memory timescale of seconds to 
tens of seconds. If the cause is repeatedly or continuously inferred within that time, thereby providing a 
consistent reduction of prediction errors, it is retained within the PP model, while otherwise it is discarded 
(forgotten). Compared to well-learned causes, the initial feature prediction strengths of a new cause are 
more plastic, subject to large learning updates according to the usual PP learning rules each time the cause 
is inferred. If it is not repeatedly inferred, its prediction strengths gradually attenuate with time. With 
increasing cumulative activation of the new cause both the active update size and the passive attenuation 
rate decrease, and ultimately the small residual plasticity and zero attenuation are reached as the cause 
becomes a permanent part of the PP model. 
This can be viewed as Bayesian updates of the beliefs about the causal structure of the world, distinct 
from the Bayesian inference of the current state of the world. A new belief, represented by the new added 
cause, has a low initial precision and undergoes large updates with each new observation. The precision 
gradually increases, and the updates decrease with the number of observations and their duration. The 
new causes lacking sufficient cumulative activation are completely discarded  their prediction strengths 
attenuated to zero  to decrease the model complexity and increase the predictive power. After many 
repeat activations, plasticity of the well-learned causes reaches a low but finite limit, to account for the 
possibility of the world changing on long time scales. After this transition from short-term to long-term 
memory, the well-learned causes are no longer deliberately forgotten over time: the lack of use does not 
constitute evidence of uselessness. 
We suggested that declarative memory formation is entailed by the learning-by-binding mechanism 
added within the PP framework, thus providing the rationale for the declarative memory function from 
the perspective of perceptual Bayesian learning. However, the apparent semantic complexity and 
structure of individual declarative memories, associatively recallable as a single unit, suggests that this 
binding process is both parallel and hierarchical. Multiple groups of prediction errors, time-correlated 
within each group, are simultaneously detected within and across sensory domains. The corresponding

within each group, are simultaneously detected within and across sensory domains. The corresponding 
groups of unpredicted inferred causes are separately bound into multiple new causes based on 
correlations within but not between each of them. The total number of concurrent separately-bound 
groups may be limited  keeping the number of hypothesized new causes small would serve a complexity- 
reducing regularization function. Furthermore, a cause recently formed by binding, being new, cannot 
itself be a feature predicted by any known causes. Therefore, each time such new-bound cause is inferred 
for a sufficient duration from its features, it necessarily has a large prediction error and is subject to further 
binding with other near-concurrent or time-correlated unpredicted causes. Thus, the binding process 
itself is hierarchical and builds shallow trees binding multiple new, as well as previously-known, causes 
together, and culminating in a single root cause, which unites a large fraction of the unpredicted features 
of the present perceptual moment. 
In one example (Figure 2a), a red loud car located on the left is perceived as a new compound cause 
for the unpredicted concurrent perceptions of redness, loudness, car and activation of a particular 
leftward location on a spatial map. Perhaps head orientation and repeated visual saccades to this 
location, triggered by the auditory systems sound localization, create high temporal correlation of 
activation between a particular place on the left in the body-centric-frame spatial map, the 
corresponding visual field map location, and the specific visual inferences of red and car.

learning mechanism called "learning by binding" to be added to the predictive processing (PP) framework. This mechanism allows for efficient online learning by attributing prediction errors to the existence of yet-unknown causes and attempting to learn these causes provisionally and permanently.</p><p>When several significant prediction errors occur together and there is no known common cause that can predict them, a new cause is tentatively posited to account for these errors. This new cause is initially a temporary hypothesis based on one observation. If the cause is repeatedly inferred and reduces prediction errors consistently over a short time period, it is retained within the PP model. Otherwise, it is discarded.</p><p>The learning-by-binding mechanism involves Bayesian updates of beliefs about the causal structure of the world. A new cause has a low initial precision and undergoes large updates with each new observation. As the cause is repeatedly inferred, its precision gradually increases, and the updates decrease. Causes that lack sufficient cumulative activation are discarded, reducing model complexity and increasing predictive power.</p><p>Declarative memory formation is considered to be an outcome of the learning-by-binding mechanism within the PP framework. The binding process is viewed as parallel and hierarchical, with multiple groups of prediction errors being simultaneously detected within and across sensory domains. These groups of errors are separately bound into new causes based on correlations within each group. The binding process itself is hierarchical and builds shallow trees that culminate in a single root cause, which unites a large fraction of the unpredicted features in the present perceptual moment.</p><p>The authors provide an example of a compound cause, such as a "red," "loud," "car" located "on the left," being perceived as a new cause that binds the individual features together. This illustrates how the learning-by-binding mechanism can form hierarchical structures of causes.</p><p>Overall, the learning-by-binding mechanism enhances the PP framework by allowing for the efficient online learning of new causes based on the correlation of prediction errors. It provides a rationale for declarative memory formation and supports the hierarchical nature of perception and the binding of features.</p></div></div></div><div class="flex justify-between lg:block"><div class="text-xs flex items-center justify-center gap-1 self-center pt-2 !invisible"><button disabled="" class="dark:text-white disabled:text-gray-300 dark:disabled:text-gray-400"><svg stroke="currentColor" fill="none" stroke-width="1.5" viewBox="0 0 24 24" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" class="h-3 w-3" height="1em" width="1em" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg"><polyline points="15 18 9 12 15 6"></polyline></svg></button><span class="flex-grow flex-shrink-0">1 / 1</span><button disabled="" class="dark:text-white disabled:text-gray-300 dark:disabled:text-gray-400"><svg stroke="currentColor" fill="none" stroke-width="1.5" viewBox="0 0 24 24" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" class="h-3 w-3" height="1em" width="1em" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg"><polyline points="9 18 15 12 9 6"></polyline></svg></button></div><div class="text-gray-400 flex self-end lg:self-center justify-center mt-2 gap-2 md:gap-3 lg:gap-1 lg:absolute lg:top-0 lg:translate-x-full lg:right-0 lg:mt-0 lg:pl-2 visible"><button class="flex ml-auto gap-2 rounded-md p-1 hover:bg-gray-100 hover:text-gray-700 dark:text-gray-400 dark:hover:bg-gray-700 dark:hover:text-gray-200 disabled:dark:hover:text-gray-400"><svg stroke="currentColor" fill="none" stroke-width="2" viewBox="0 0 24 24" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" class="h-4 w-4" height="1em" width="1em" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg"><path d="M16 4h2a2 2 0 0 1 2 2v14a2 2 0 0 1-2 2H6a2 2 0 0 1-2-2V6a2 2 0 0 1 2-2h2"></path><rect x="8" y="2" width="8" height="4" rx="1" ry="1"></rect></svg></button><div class="flex gap-1"><button class="p-1 rounded-md hover:bg-gray-100 hover:text-gray-700 dark:text-gray-400 dark:hover:bg-gray-700 dark:hover:text-gray-200 disabled:dark:hover:text-gray-400"><svg stroke="currentColor" fill="none" stroke-width="2" viewBox="0 0 24 24" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" class="h-4 w-4" height="1em" width="1em" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg"><path d="M14 9V5a3 3 0 0 0-3-3l-4 9v11h11.28a2 2 0 0 0 2-1.7l1.38-9a2 2 0 0 0-2-2.3zM7 22H4a2 2 0 0 1-2-2v-7a2 2 0 0 1 2-2h3"></path></svg></button><button class="p-1 rounded-md hover:bg-gray-100 hover:text-gray-700 dark:text-gray-400 dark:hover:bg-gray-700 dark:hover:text-gray-200 disabled:dark:hover:text-gray-400"><svg stroke="currentColor" fill="none" stroke-width="2" viewBox="0 0 24 24" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" class="h-4 w-4" height="1em" width="1em" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg"><path d="M10 15v4a3 3 0 0 0 3 3l4-9V2H5.72a2 2 0 0 0-2 1.7l-1.38 9a2 2 0 0 0 2 2.3zm7-13h2.67A2.31 2.31 0 0 1 22 4v7a2.31 2.31 0 0 1-2.33 2H17"></path></svg></button></div></div></div></div></div></div><div class="group w-full text-gray-800 dark:text-gray-100 border-b border-black/10 dark:border-gray-900/50 dark:bg-gray-800"><div class="flex p-4 gap-4 text-base md:gap-6 md:max-w-2xl lg:max-w-[38rem] xl:max-w-3xl md:py-6 lg:px-0 m-auto"><div class="flex-shrink-0 flex flex-col relative items-end"><div class="w-[30px]"><div class="relative flex"><span style="box-sizing: border-box; display: inline-block; overflow: hidden; width: initial; height: initial; background: none; opacity: 1; border: 0px; margin: 0px; padding: 0px; position: relative; max-width: 100%;"><span style="box-sizing: border-box; display: block; width: initial; height: initial; background: none; opacity: 1; border: 0px; margin: 0px; padding: 0px; max-width: 100%;"><img alt="" aria-hidden="true" src="data:image/svg+xml,%3csvg%20xmlns=%27http://www.w3.org/2000/svg%27%20version=%271.1%27%20width=%2738%27%20height=%2738%27/%3e" style="display: block; max-width: 100%; width: initial; height: initial; background: none; opacity: 1; border: 0px; margin: 0px; padding: 0px;"></span><img alt="User" src="https://chat.openai.com/_next/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Flh3.googleusercontent.com%2Fa%2FAAcHTtfE_9fVpMOqgyC7Lo43NLrKgIo-u2ToDOuYOa2T%3Ds96-c&amp;w=96&amp;q=75" decoding="async" data-nimg="intrinsic" class="rounded-sm" style="position: absolute; inset: 0px; box-sizing: border-box; padding: 0px; border: none; margin: auto; display: block; width: 0px; height: 0px; min-width: 100%; max-width: 100%; min-height: 100%; max-height: 100%;" width="30" height="30"></span></div></div></div><div class="relative flex w-[calc(100%-50px)] flex-col gap-1 md:gap-3 lg:w-[calc(100%-115px)]"><div class="flex flex-grow flex-col gap-3"><div class="min-h-[20px] flex flex-col items-start gap-4 whitespace-pre-wrap break-words">auditory inferences describe the specific sound  loud, etc.  with the auditory localization activating the 
same body-centric location. All these multimodal perceptions have high prediction errors  they are not 
expected  and are highly temporally correlated with each other and with (directing attention to) a 
particular spatial location. Thus, the system binds a new cause The Car which predicts a red loud car 
on the left, now represented as a unified compound object. Similarly, a green tree, of a particular tall 
height, may be simultaneously perceived at a specific location on the right as a new unified object The 
Tree. 
In addition to the direct sensory perceptions, the hierarchical PP model may also, simultaneously, 
represent higher-order causes that describe the perception process itself. A cause may be inferred 
representing the ongoing experience of some objects, distinct from the mere presence of these objects 
 if one looks away, the objects may still be inferred as present but no longer as being experienced. 
Moreover, a cause of self may also be inferred, to which this experience is attributed to belong to. In 
this schematic example, the new-bound causes for The Car and The Tree are bound with the higher- 
order causes for I have ongoing experience to form a top-level episodic cause that includes I experience 
The Car (a red loud car on the left) and The Tree (a tall green tree on the right). These become 
associatively recallable as a unit and may be also unified with other concurrent unpredicted perceptions. 
The hyperparameters of the learning by binding  the minimum prediction error size, activation duration 
and maximum asynchrony between features that can still lead to binding  vary across sensory domains 
and PP hierarchy levels, such as between single-domain, multimodal and abstract (amodal) mental 
objects. In biological brains they are optimized by evolution to efficiently infer typical structures in sensory 
data within each domain, and in particular those structures that are most useful for guiding evolutionary- 
advantageous actions. These binding parameters, as well as plasticity of prediction strengths vs. 
cumulative activation and consolidation/forgetting timescales can be empirically elucidated, such as by 
analyzing existing cognitive studies data. As we will specifically discuss in the next section, these 
parameters directly affect both perception and learning of events in time. The hyperparameters are 
modulated on the short and long time scales by global state variables, such as the affective states, and 
exploration-exploitation balance discussed in the following sections, whereby the slow global variations 
define the global states of consciousness (Bayne, Hohwy, and Owen 2016). As we elaborate below, the 
major functional role of perception is to estimate future value for reinforcement-learning an optimized 
action policy, encoded within the same PP generative model. Therefore, on short time scales high positive 
or negative valance strongly and dynamically modulates the learning-by-binding parameters to provide 
both value-relevant perceptual learning and value-increasing action policy learning. 
To recap, temporary new causes are hierarchically learned from single- or few-examples by binding of 
perceptions with time-correlated prediction errors, according to an induction bias that large, correlated 
prediction errors must be due to common hidden causes. This learning-by-binding process operates 
continuously on top of the PP framework. The causes are subsequently retained and consolidated or 
discarded depending on whether they are repeatedly inferred and thus consistently reduce the prediction 
errors. This learning architecture is a conjecture that remains to be confirmed by statistical learning theory 
and numerical machine-learning experiments to demonstrate that rapid learning by binding within the PP 
framework is indeed possible and stable. However, analyzing this proposal and how it may relate with 
established data and theory may advance understanding of human perception and learning, including the 
elusive concept of consciousness. Therefore, we will now discuss some properties entailed by it, and how 
these properties correspond to functional processes commonly associated with consciousness.</div></div><div class="flex justify-between lg:block"><div class="text-xs flex items-center justify-center

causes based on the correlation of prediction errors. These new causes unify multiple perceptions with high prediction errors into compound objects. For example, the perception of a "red," "loud," "car" located "on the left" may be bound together as a new cause representing "The Car." Similarly, a "green," "tall" "tree" perceived at a specific location "on the right" may be bound as a new cause representing "The Tree."</p><p>In addition to direct sensory perceptions, the hierarchical PP model can also represent higher-order causes that describe the perception process itself. For example, a cause may be inferred to represent the ongoing "experience" of objects, separate from their mere presence. Another cause may represent the "self" to which this experience is attributed. These higher-order causes can be bound with the new-bound causes of compound objects to form a top-level episodic cause, such as "I experience The Car (a red loud car on the left) and The Tree (a tall green tree on the right)." These higher-order causes and compound objects become associatively recallable as a unit and can be unified with other concurrent perceptions.</p><p>The hyperparameters of learning by binding, such as the minimum prediction error size, activation duration, and maximum asynchrony between features, vary across sensory domains and levels of the PP hierarchy. These parameters are optimized by evolution to efficiently infer typical structures in sensory data and guide evolutionary-advantageous actions. They can be empirically elucidated through cognitive studies data analysis.</p><p>The learning-by-binding process operates continuously within the PP framework and is modulated by global state variables, such as affective states and exploration-exploitation balance. The short-term modulation of hyperparameters by valence allows for value-relevant perceptual learning and value-increasing action policy learning.</p><p>In summary, the learning-by-binding mechanism within the PP framework enables the hierarchical formation of temporary new causes based on correlated prediction errors. This process aligns with properties commonly associated with consciousness and has the potential to advance our understanding of perception, learning, and consciousness itself.</p></div></div></div><div class="flex justify-between lg:block"><div class="text-xs flex items-center justify-center gap-1 self-center pt-2 !invisible"><button disabled="" class="dark:text-white disabled:text-gray-300 dark:disabled:text-gray-400"><svg stroke="currentColor" fill="none" stroke-width="1.5" viewBox="0 0 24 24" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" class="h-3 w-3" height="1em" width="1em" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg"><polyline points="15 18 9 12 15 6"></polyline></svg></button><span class="flex-grow flex-shrink-0">1 / 1</span><button disabled="" class="dark:text-white disabled:text-gray-300 dark:disabled:text-gray-400"><svg stroke="currentColor" fill="none" stroke-width="1.5" viewBox="0 0 24 24" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" class="h-3 w-3" height="1em" width="1em" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg"><polyline points="9 18 15 12 9 6"></polyline></svg></button></div><div class="text-gray-400 flex self-end lg:self-center justify-center mt-2 gap-2 md:gap-3 lg:gap-1 lg:absolute lg:top-0 lg:translate-x-full lg:right-0 lg:mt-0 lg:pl-2 visible"><button class="flex ml-auto gap-2 rounded-md p-1 hover:bg-gray-100 hover:text-gray-700 dark:text-gray-400 dark:hover:bg-gray-700 dark:hover:text-gray-200 disabled:dark:hover:text-gray-400"><svg stroke="currentColor" fill="none" stroke-width="2" viewBox="0 0 24 24" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" class="h-4 w-4" height="1em" width="1em" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg"><path d="M16 4h2a2 2 0 0 1 2 2v14a2 2 0 0 1-2 2H6a2 2 0 0 1-2-2V6a2 2 0 0 1 2-2h2"></path><rect x="8" y="2" width="8" height="4" rx="1" ry="1"></rect></svg></button><div class="flex gap-1"><button class="p-1 rounded-md hover:bg-gray-100 hover:text-gray-700 dark:text-gray-400 dark:hover:bg-gray-700 dark:hover:text-gray-200 disabled:dark:hover:text-gray-400"><svg stroke="currentColor" fill="none" stroke-width="2" viewBox="0 0 24 24" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" class="h-4 w-4" height="1em" width="1em" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg"><path d="M14 9V5a3 3 0 0 0-3-3l-4 9v11h11.28a2 2 0 0 0 2-1.7l1.38-9a2 2 0 0 0-2-2.3zM7 22H4a2 2 0 0 1-2-2v-7a2 2 0 0 1 2-2h3"></path></svg></button><button class="p-1 rounded-md hover:bg-gray-100 hover:text-gray-700 dark:text-gray-400 dark:hover:bg-gray-700 dark:hover:text-gray-200 disabled:dark:hover:text-gray-400"><svg stroke="currentColor" fill="none" stroke-width="2" viewBox="0 0 24 24" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" class="h-4 w-4" height="1em" width="1em" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg"><path d="M10 15v4a3 3 0 0 0 3 3l4-9V2H5.72a2 2 0 0 0-2 1.7l-1.38 9a2 2 0 0 0 2 2.3zm7-13h2.67A2.31 2.31 0 0 1 22 4v7a2.31 2.31 0 0 1-2.33 2H17"></path></svg></button></div></div></div></div></div></div><div class="group w-full text-gray-800 dark:text-gray-100 border-b border-black/10 dark:border-gray-900/50 dark:bg-gray-800"><div class="flex p-4 gap-4 text-base md:gap-6 md:max-w-2xl lg:max-w-[38rem] xl:max-w-3xl md:py-6 lg:px-0 m-auto"><div class="flex-shrink-0 flex flex-col relative items-end"><div class="w-[30px]"><div class="relative flex"><span style="box-sizing: border-box; display: inline-block; overflow: hidden; width: initial; height: initial; background: none; opacity: 1; border: 0px; margin: 0px; padding: 0px; position: relative; max-width: 100%;"><span style="box-sizing: border-box; display: block; width: initial; height: initial; background: none; opacity: 1; border: 0px; margin: 0px; padding: 0px; max-width: 100%;"><img alt="" aria-hidden="true" src="data:image/svg+xml,%3csvg%20xmlns=%27http://www.w3.org/2000/svg%27%20version=%271.1%27%20width=%2738%27%20height=%2738%27/%3e" style="display: block; max-width: 100%; width: initial; height: initial; background: none; opacity: 1; border: 0px; margin: 0px; padding: 0px;"></span><img alt="User" src="https://chat.openai.com/_next/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Flh3.googleusercontent.com%2Fa%2FAAcHTtfE_9fVpMOqgyC7Lo43NLrKgIo-u2ToDOuYOa2T%3Ds96-c&amp;w=96&amp;q=75" decoding="async" data-nimg="intrinsic" class="rounded-sm" style="position: absolute; inset: 0px; box-sizing: border-box; padding: 0px; border: none; margin: auto; display: block; width: 0px; height: 0px; min-width: 100%; max-width: 100%; min-height: 100%; max-height: 100%;" width="30" height="30"></span></div></div></div><div class="relative flex w-[calc(100%-50px)] flex-col gap-1 md:gap-3 lg:w-[calc(100%-115px)]"><div class="flex flex-grow flex-col gap-3"><div class="min-h-[20px] flex flex-col items-start gap-4 whitespace-pre-wrap break-words">action policy encoded within the generative PP model. Such actions strongly modulate, but are 
functionally separable from, the core processes of perceptual inference, binding, and the resulting 
declarative memory record formation. New causes can be formed for unattended objects and even 
further bound into the recallable episodic memory record. 
The described ability to learn and recall specific new objects and events entails creation of a perceptual 
record of declarative memory that can be accessed later by the system via associative recall. If a new 
cause bound from a single or few examples is repeatedly re-activated by similar examples, it is generalized 
to a broader example class by the conventional PP learning rules. This process converts the initially 
episodic knowledge into semantic perceptual knowledge. 
Perceptual 
unityPerceptual 
unity. . 
The induction bias underlying the learning-by-binding system presumes everything unpredicted is 
stemming from common hidden causes, even when events are unrelated and coincident by chance. If the 
assumption is that any two or more unpredicted causes must have a common hidden cause, a singular 
episodic cause is generated necessarily (Figure 2a). This is apparent in the associative and episodic recall, 
where a variety of causally independent contents are bound and recalled together by virtue of simply 
having occurred at the same time. The what its like of perceiving a specific instance of a cat, as we may 
learn from recalling it, not only includes the visual features that give rise to the inference of the cat, but 
also includes inferences about the attention state, expectations and other internal and external conditions 
that modulate the perceptual processing. Moreover, the cat is bound together with other concurrent 
related and unrelated inferences, including (the action of attending to) its specific spatial location, 
distinctive attributes of the cat, nearby objects, as well as other concurrent unpredicted perceptions in 
multiple modalities. A large fraction of these contents is associatively recalled when the cat is recalled. 
This gives the process of perception a unified nature quite distinct from simply representing a set of 
separable contents. This unified yet differentiated nature, a hallmark of the content of consciousness 
(Bayne 2012), is entailed by the learning architecture proposed here. 
On the other hand, the full unity of binding is not required. Multiple new causes are continuously formed 
by binding of various concurrent unpredicted features at the low sensory levels. Whenever one or more 
new causes are formed, but do not persist long enough to become further bound with other concurrent 
causes into an episode, they are not recallable as part of the episode and are not unified with it. Yet the 
cause binding the new combination of features is formed and can later contribute to perception and 
behavior. This binding has been empirically demonstrated for unattended visual stimuli (Meuwese et al. 
2013), whereas masking the stimuli prevented them from binding. We further argue that the new bound 
cause formed without attention in this work could not include as one of its features the action of attending 
to its spatial location, color or another one of its own attributes. This may explain the extra learning via 
feedback required in test trials in (Meuwese et al. 2013) to connect the new cause to the appropriate 
response action. 
A separate way in which the proposed learning system is unified is that it is designed to learn and 
implement an actions policy that maximizes survival and reproduction benefits and for this purpose it 
generates a single, unified perceptual estimate of the future value  whether the current state is good 
or bad overall. While this future value may be generated by combining multiple distinct specific future 
values for each of the perceived causes, and there may be more than one kind of reward, a single scalar 
total value is calculated for action learning by the system as a whole  e.g., whether the actions that 
immediately led to this state should be retained for the future or discarded. The details of this process are 
discussed in the Action section below.

Beyond example-efficient learning using the full power of previous perceptual knowledge, and formation 
of recallable current-state descriptions, the learning by binding also entails rapidly forming generative 
causal connections between previously-unrelated causes (Figure 2d). Whenever a new-bound cause is 
inferred by the PP model from a subset of its features, the remaining, hidden features are then 
generatively predicted. For example, once a temporary cause The Car binding otherwise-unrelated 
features car-object, red color, left location and motor sound is formed, the cause The Car may be 
inferred from the presence of only car-object, inferred from a prompt for car, and predict specific color, 
location and sound. Thus, within a few hundred milliseconds needed to bind The Car, the car-object 
feature starts to predict the red color. The predicted features in turn contribute to inferring dependent 
higher-level causes, as well as predicting lower-level features. Within active inference this includes 
triggering or modulating actions connected to, for example, red within the PP hierarchy, such as selecting</div></div><div class="flex justify-between lg:block"><div class="text-xs flex items-center

previously unrelated causes. When a new-bound cause is inferred from a subset of its features, the remaining hidden features are generatively predicted. For example, once the temporary cause "The Car" is formed, it can be inferred from the presence of the "car" object and predict specific color, location, and sound associated with a car. This rapid formation of causal connections allows for the quick integration of new information and the generation of predictions for missing features.</p><p>The process of forming causal connections between causes involves the generation of a global workspace, where information from different causes is brought together and integrated. This global workspace enables the system to make predictions and generate coherent perceptions based on the available information. The generative causal connections facilitate the binding of related features and contribute to the formation of unified perceptual experiences.</p><p>Furthermore, the learning-by-binding system is designed to learn and implement an action policy that maximizes survival and reproduction benefits. It generates a unified perceptual estimate of the future value, which determines whether the current state is overall "good" or "bad." This future value estimation is based on the combination of specific future values associated with perceived causes. The system calculates a single scalar total value that guides action learning for the entire system.</p><p>In summary, the learning-by-binding mechanism not only facilitates rapid learning and recall of specific objects and events but also enables the formation of generative causal connections between causes. This process involves the integration of information in a global workspace and contributes to the unified nature of perception. The system also generates a unified perceptual estimate of future value, guiding action learning.</p></div></div></div><div class="flex justify-between lg:block"><div class="text-xs flex items-center justify-center gap-1 self-center pt-2 !invisible"><button disabled="" class="dark:text-white disabled:text-gray-300 dark:disabled:text-gray-400"><svg stroke="currentColor" fill="none" stroke-width="1.5" viewBox="0 0 24 24" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" class="h-3 w-3" height="1em" width="1em" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg"><polyline points="15 18 9 12 15 6"></polyline></svg></button><span class="flex-grow flex-shrink-0">1 / 1</span><button disabled="" class="dark:text-white disabled:text-gray-300 dark:disabled:text-gray-400"><svg stroke="currentColor" fill="none" stroke-width="1.5" viewBox="0 0 24 24" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" class="h-3 w-3" height="1em" width="1em" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg"><polyline points="9 18 15 12 9 6"></polyline></svg></button></div><div class="text-gray-400 flex self-end lg:self-center justify-center mt-2 gap-2 md:gap-3 lg:gap-1 lg:absolute lg:top-0 lg:translate-x-full lg:right-0 lg:mt-0 lg:pl-2 visible"><button class="flex ml-auto gap-2 rounded-md p-1 hover:bg-gray-100 hover:text-gray-700 dark:text-gray-400 dark:hover:bg-gray-700 dark:hover:text-gray-200 disabled:dark:hover:text-gray-400"><svg stroke="currentColor" fill="none" stroke-width="2" viewBox="0 0 24 24" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" class="h-4 w-4" height="1em" width="1em" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg"><path d="M16 4h2a2 2 0 0 1 2 2v14a2 2 0 0 1-2 2H6a2 2 0 0 1-2-2V6a2 2 0 0 1 2-2h2"></path><rect x="8" y="2" width="8" height="4" rx="1" ry="1"></rect></svg></button><div class="flex gap-1"><button class="p-1 rounded-md hover:bg-gray-100 hover:text-gray-700 dark:text-gray-400 dark:hover:bg-gray-700 dark:hover:text-gray-200 disabled:dark:hover:text-gray-400"><svg stroke="currentColor" fill="none" stroke-width="2" viewBox="0 0 24 24" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" class="h-4 w-4" height="1em" width="1em" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg"><path d="M14 9V5a3 3 0 0 0-3-3l-4 9v11h11.28a2 2 0 0 0 2-1.7l1.38-9a2 2 0 0 0-2-2.3zM7 22H4a2 2 0 0 1-2-2v-7a2 2 0 0 1 2-2h3"></path></svg></button><button class="p-1 rounded-md hover:bg-gray-100 hover:text-gray-700 dark:text-gray-400 dark:hover:bg-gray-700 dark:hover:text-gray-200 disabled:dark:hover:text-gray-400"><svg stroke="currentColor" fill="none" stroke-width="2" viewBox="0 0 24 24" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" class="h-4 w-4" height="1em" width="1em" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg"><path d="M10 15v4a3 3 0 0 0 3 3l4-9V2H5.72a2 2 0 0 0-2 1.7l-1.38 9a2 2 0 0 0 2 2.3zm7-13h2.67A2.31 2.31 0 0 1 22 4v7a2.31 2.31 0 0 1-2.33 2H17"></path></svg></button></div></div></div></div></div></div><div class="group w-full text-gray-800 dark:text-gray-100 border-b border-black/10 dark:border-gray-900/50 dark:bg-gray-800"><div class="flex p-4 gap-4 text-base md:gap-6 md:max-w-2xl lg:max-w-[38rem] xl:max-w-3xl md:py-6 lg:px-0 m-auto"><div class="flex-shrink-0 flex flex-col relative items-end"><div class="w-[30px]"><div class="relative flex"><span style="box-sizing: border-box; display: inline-block; overflow: hidden; width: initial; height: initial; background: none; opacity: 1; border: 0px; margin: 0px; padding: 0px; position: relative; max-width: 100%;"><span style="box-sizing: border-box; display: block; width: initial; height: initial; background: none; opacity: 1; border: 0px; margin: 0px; padding: 0px; max-width: 100%;"><img alt="" aria-hidden="true" src="data:image/svg+xml,%3csvg%20xmlns=%27http://www.w3.org/2000/svg%27%20version=%271.1%27%20width=%2738%27%20height=%2738%27/%3e" style="display: block; max-width: 100%; width: initial; height: initial; background: none; opacity: 1; border: 0px; margin: 0px; padding: 0px;"></span><img alt="User" src="https://chat.openai.com/_next/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Flh3.googleusercontent.com%2Fa%2FAAcHTtfE_9fVpMOqgyC7Lo43NLrKgIo-u2ToDOuYOa2T%3Ds96-c&amp;w=96&amp;q=75" decoding="async" data-nimg="intrinsic" class="rounded-sm" style="position: absolute; inset: 0px; box-sizing: border-box; padding: 0px; border: none; margin: auto; display: block; width: 0px; height: 0px; min-width: 100%; max-width: 100%; min-height: 100%; max-height: 100%;" width="30" height="30"></span></div></div></div><div class="relative flex w-[calc(100%-50px)] flex-col gap-1 md:gap-3 lg:w-[calc(100%-115px)]"><div class="flex flex-grow flex-col gap-3"><div class="min-h-[20px] flex flex-col items-start gap-4 whitespace-pre-wrap break-words">a specific color report in response to a prompt. Therefore, the temporary binding immediately and 
strongly modifies the overall PP generative model dynamics  perception and action inferences and 
predictions made immediately thereafter  by allowing a set of previously-unrelated causes , such as car- 
object and red color, to effectively cross-predict each other once they are bound together. 
This functional property, entailed by the addition of feature binding to PP, directly connects our theory to 
the global workspace theories of consciousness: the newly-bound features constitute the contents of a 
global workspace by virtue of being able to cross-predict each other and thereby being able to influence 
inference and prediction of a large number of other perceptions and actions. Dynamically binding a set of 
select causes into a new shallow-tree generative model structure allows the bound perceptions to 
immediately modulate many actions they previously had no functional connections to, and thereby to 
exert what appears to be a global causal influence. With inferred A, when perceptual inference or 
selective attention activates B, this now activates C and thereby modulates any model dynamics 
dependent on C. Functionally, this may also be viewed as passing of objects by reference into procedures 
that can now act on them, whereby different objects C, D or E, including previously unknown, newly- 
bound ones, when temporarily bond to A and B may be referred to (activated by) whenever some 
procedure activates A and B. 
Using  The Car and The Tree as an example, and considering point to a location as an action previously 
learned for all available locations, the prompt of: Point to the car (tree), can be responded to by first 
the car (tree) of the prompt inferring The Car (The Tree), which then predicts the bound location on 
left (on right), while the prompt also infers the point to a location action. The action executes by 
pointing to the correct active location. Another prompt might be: What color is the car (tree)?, whereby 
the generic object name will again activate a specific bound object and thereby its color attribute that can 
then be reported. We see that the two compound objects, once bound, became available to a range of 
previously learned actions. Most importantly, these objects may comprise never previously seen 
combinations of generic attributes, yet they can immediately be acted upon in a large variety of very 
complex ways that have been previously learned. This type of flexible generalization is perhaps the most 
important feature of the proposed learning architecture. 
Notably, this type of global availability requires neither information broadcast separate from the binding, 
nor existence of neural codes other than the PP model, since only previously-learned actions triggered by, 
and acting upon, specific previously-learned objects (causes) are being proposed, all within PP with active 
inference-like description for actions as the PP predictions. To further explore the implications of the 
global availability enabled by binding, in the following example we will illustrate how a novel compound 
object becomes available to be maintained in working memory via a previously-learned action of selective 
attention to a spatial location or another generic attribute.

So far, we have been describing a learning system for perception, i.e., for predicting sensory data, while 
only mentioning that the PP system can also implement actions, as have been proposed by active 
inference theories. In the Action section we describe actions as causes making predictions, increasing the 
inferred likelihoods of their target causes within the generative PP model. Such actions may manifest (and 
be perceived and recognized) as instances of selective attention. Within the PP framework, selective 
attention describes a selective increase of precision, which for a discrete, categorical cause is an increase 
of its likelihood, or what we have been also calling activation level. In the following we explain how 
working memory may arise by the interaction of binding, PP and selective attention (Figure 2c). 
A generic action of selectively attending to a particular spatial location, or to the most-active spatial 
location  i.e., an action of continuously maintaining or intermittently reactivating that spatial map 
location  may be learned to be triggered by certain PP model causes. For example, overt attention to a 
location of a perceptually present object modulates the physical sensory apparatus, increasing the 
precision (the likelihood or the strength of inference in the categorical PP model) and duration of the 
sensory features comprising the object. The object is inferred with high likelihood, and the objects large 
prediction errors facilitate its binding into the episode. Similarly, covert attention increases compound 
objects precision and facilitates binding by selectively increasing and sustaining high precision of one or 
more of its features. For The Car, attention to a specific location on left may result in its sustained 
activation and becoming part of the present episode. If the car is present and attention is overt, perceptual 
inference from sensory data will maintain The Car at high likelihood. However, even if the car is absent 
and attention to the spatial location is covert, the particular on left is bound to the car, therefore its 
activation, within the appropriate perceptual context, can help maintain The Car at a nonzero likelihood, 
even in the absence of the direct sensory perception. A novel compound object can thus be continuously 
perceived in the absence of direct sensory stimuli. Since a novel object cannot be predicted by any other 
cause, it will be bound with other concurrent unpredicted causes, therefore participating in the global 
workspace and in a series of consecutive recallable episodes. We argue that this is precisely what it means 
for the object to be maintained in the working memory.</div></div><div class="flex justify-between lg:block"><div class="text-xs flex items-center justify-center gap-1 self-center pt-2

and thinking. . 
High-level actions directly predict (trigger) specific other actions and high-level perceptions. Whenever 
the prediction target is a perceptual cause, a perceived likelihood of the cause increases. We have 
previously discussed how the action of selective attention to the spatial location of a newly-bound object 
can maintain the object in the global workspace and working memory. When this happens in the absence 
of sensory data directly supporting the objects inference, this object is imagined. Inferences of causes 
directly predicting sequences of features result in replays of such visual, auditory or multimodal 
sequences. Like actions triggered by perceptions inferred from sensory data, complex and highly specific 
actions can be triggered by imagined perceptual inferences, making long imagined action-perception 
chains possible. They may include sensory images, amodal/abstract imagination, kinesthetic action 
imagination, as well as imagined generation and perception of speech sequences in humans. Some of 
these inferences will remain unpredicted long enough to be bound into new causes and unified episodes, 
thus making them into the conscious contents. Excluding some states of focused attention, flow and 
meditation, a large fraction of the human conscious contents appears to be generated by such multimodal 
imagination action-perception sequences, in addition to the more direct perceptual inferences from the 
sensory data. 
Imagining reuses the predictive machinery of perception  imagining objects or actions predicts object 
features as well as the perceptual consequences of actions. This agrees with everyday experiences such 
as mental visual object rotation or internal dialog generation. Furthermore, imagined objects and actions 
are subject to all the learning mechanisms in the system, consistent with learning through mental 
rehearsing. 
In principle, generating sequences of imagined percepts does not seem to require language. Language 
recognition can be understood as a special set of actions for imagining the semantic content in response 
to linguistic code perceptual triggers. Correspondingly, imagined verbal conversation sequences 
accompanied by the multimodal perceptions of the semantic content constitute the discursive thought. 
Importantly, inability of the PP model to fully predict the results of these complex actions, i.e., to predict 
the imagined utterances and the associated perceptual content, leads to them being bound and becoming 
conscious. 
Procedural knowledge 
Procedural knowledge andand perceptual 
knowledge.perceptual 
knowledge. 
We can thus distinguish two types of knowledge in our learning system: perceptual knowledge and 
procedural knowledge. The first is the ability to perceptually recognize objects and events. The second is 
the ability to generate sequences of mental and physical actions, which consist of combinations of 
perceived objects and events triggering perceptions of other objects and events. For illustration, the 
ability to think and say that Earth rotates relative to the Sun differs from unambiguously perceiving oneself 
standing on a rotating ball of Earth whenever watching a sunrise. Missing this distinction between the 
procedural knowledge and the learned perception has led to considerable philosophical confusion, such 
as in the Mary-the-color-scientist thought experiment (Jackson 1982; Blackmore and Troscianko 2018). 
Normal color perception relies on a perceptual model making complex inferences from visual sensory data 
and is only functional when it provides input to further perceptual inferences related to colored objects. 
It is entirely distinct from the discursive scientific knowledge about color perception  a set of mostly 
procedural skills, such as predicting consequences based on conditions, combined with high-level 
perceptual skills of recognizing abstract concepts of scientific models in the real-world experimental 
reality. 
The perceptual and procedural (such as language-mediated discursive) skills are often tightly coupled. 
Procedural skills are built using perceptual skills, i.e., perception is needed to guide action. On the other 
hand, learned actions resulting in unpredicted activations of a percept B after a percept A makes them 
subject to learning by binding, thus facilitating perceptual learning of a predictive relationship between 
them. We can see how in the absence of accurate discursive knowledge, or through cultural exposure to 
inaccurate knowledge, illusory perceptions may be more easily learned. Meanwhile, accurate perceptual 
models can be learned, and perceptual illusions can be corrected with the help of accurate discursive 
knowledge of underlying phenomena, when such procedural models generate accurate perceptual 
examples and outcomes. For example, should one choose to, one can not only discursively know that 
Earth is rotating, but also train to perceive being on a rotating Earth when experiencing a sunrise. 
Unlike this particular example, learning accurate perceptions can be highly consequential, since changing 
the perceptual model entails automatic changes to when and how various dependent perceptions and 
actions occur. Once learned, the perceptual inference is automatic, while unperceiving or changing the 
perceptual model requires additional training. 
Using scientific theories combines procedural and perceptual skills. Being able to solve an equation or 
manipulate a formal model must be accompanied by perceptually recognizing which scientific model 
concepts and equations can be used to describe the relevant aspects of a concrete natural or experimental 
situation. Application of discursive and procedural scientific knowledge requires the perceptual skill of 
mapping the perception of the outside world to the abstract notions procedurally manipulated and 
discursively described by a theory. Scientific breakthroughs are often intuitive insights generated by direct 
perceptions of the causal relationships of the abstract scientific phenomena, which are only subsequently 
proven by formal manipulations. The formal manipulations are of course key for both training the 
perceptual model needed to produce the insight, as well as for communicating it to be learned by others.</div></div><div class="flex justify-between lg:block"><div class="text-xs flex items-center

knowledge. Perceptual knowledge refers to the ability to perceptually recognize objects and events based on sensory data. Procedural knowledge, on the other hand, involves the generation of sequences of mental and physical actions, where perceived objects and events trigger perceptions of other objects and events.</p><p>Imagination and thinking rely on the predictive machinery of perception. When objects or actions are imagined, the system predicts the features of those objects as well as the perceptual consequences of the imagined actions. This process allows for mental visual object rotation, internal dialog generation, and other forms of mental simulation. Imagined objects and actions are subject to the learning mechanisms within the system, enabling learning through mental rehearsal.</p><p>Generating sequences of imagined percepts does not necessarily require language. Language recognition can be seen as a set of actions that imagine the semantic content in response to linguistic code perceptual triggers. Imagined verbal conversation sequences, accompanied by the multimodal perceptions of the semantic content, constitute discursive thought. If the PP model cannot fully predict the results of these complex actions, such as the imagined utterances and associated perceptual content, they become bound and conscious.</p><p>Within the learning system, there are also two distinct types of knowledge: perceptual knowledge and procedural knowledge. Perceptual knowledge involves the recognition of objects and events based on sensory data, while procedural knowledge involves the generation of action sequences triggered by perceived objects and events. These two types of knowledge are often tightly coupled, as perceptual skills are needed to guide action, and learned actions can result in predictable activations of certain perceptions.</p><p>It's important to differentiate between perceptual knowledge and procedural knowledge, as confusion between the two can lead to philosophical misunderstandings. Perceptual knowledge is the ability to make complex inferences from sensory data, while procedural knowledge encompasses skills related to predicting consequences, recognizing abstract concepts, and applying discursive knowledge.</p><p>The coupling of perceptual and procedural skills can have implications for learning. Illusory perceptions may be more easily learned in the absence of accurate discursive knowledge or due to exposure to inaccurate knowledge. Conversely, accurate perceptual models can be learned and perceptual illusions can be corrected when accurate discursive knowledge guides the generation of accurate perceptual examples and outcomes.</p><p>Scientific theories combine both procedural and perceptual skills. The ability to solve equations or manipulate formal models requires procedural skills, but it must also be accompanied by perceptual recognition of the relevant aspects of a real-world situation that can be described by those models. Scientific breakthroughs often arise from intuitive insights based on direct perceptions of causal relationships in abstract scientific phenomena, which are subsequently validated through formal manipulations. The combination of formal manipulations and perceptual skills is crucial for both training the perceptual model needed to produce insights and communicating them to others.</p><p>In summary, the learning system involves both perceptual knowledge and procedural knowledge. The system can generate imagined percepts and engage in complex actions, relying on the predictive machinery of perception. Perceptual and procedural skills are tightly coupled, and their interaction plays a role in learning, imagination, thinking, and scientific understanding.</p></div></div></div><div class="flex justify-between lg:block"><div class="text-xs flex items-center justify-center gap-1 self-center pt-2 !invisible"><button disabled="" class="dark:text-white disabled:text-gray-300 dark:disabled:text-gray-400"><svg stroke="currentColor" fill="none" stroke-width="1.5" viewBox="0 0 24 24" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" class="h-3 w-3" height="1em" width="1em" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg"><polyline points="15 18 9 12 15 6"></polyline></svg></button><span class="flex-grow flex-shrink-0">1 / 1</span><button disabled="" class="dark:text-white disabled:text-gray-300 dark:disabled:text-gray-400"><svg stroke="currentColor" fill="none" stroke-width="1.5" viewBox="0 0 24 24" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" class="h-3 w-3" height="1em" width="1em" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg"><polyline points="9 18 15 12 9 6"></polyline></svg></button></div><div class="text-gray-400 flex self-end lg:self-center justify-center mt-2 gap-2 md:gap-3 lg:gap-1 lg:absolute lg:top-0 lg:translate-x-full lg:right-0 lg:mt-0 lg:pl-2 visible"><button class="flex ml-auto gap-2 rounded-md p-1 hover:bg-gray-100 hover:text-gray-700 dark:text-gray-400 dark:hover:bg-gray-700 dark:hover:text-gray-200 disabled:dark:hover:text-gray-400"><svg stroke="currentColor" fill="none" stroke-width="2" viewBox="0 0 24 24" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" class="h-4 w-4" height="1em" width="1em" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg"><path d="M16 4h2a2 2 0 0 1 2 2v14a2 2 0 0 1-2 2H6a2 2 0 0 1-2-2V6a2 2 0 0 1 2-2h2"></path><rect x="8" y="2" width="8" height="4" rx="1" ry="1"></rect></svg></button><div class="flex gap-1"><button class="p-1 rounded-md hover:bg-gray-100 hover:text-gray-700 dark:text-gray-400 dark:hover:bg-gray-700 dark:hover:text-gray-200 disabled:dark:hover:text-gray-400"><svg stroke="currentColor" fill="none" stroke-width="2" viewBox="0 0 24 24" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" class="h-4 w-4" height="1em" width="1em" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg"><path d="M14 9V5a3 3 0 0 0-3-3l-4 9v11h11.28a2 2 0 0 0 2-1.7l1.38-9a2 2 0 0 0-2-2.3zM7 22H4a2 2 0 0 1-2-2v-7a2 2 0 0 1 2-2h3"></path></svg></button><button class="p-1 rounded-md hover:bg-gray-100 hover:text-gray-700 dark:text-gray-400 dark:hover:bg-gray-700 dark:hover:text-gray-200 disabled:dark:hover:text-gray-400"><svg stroke="currentColor" fill="none" stroke-width="2" viewBox="0 0 24 24" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" class="h-4 w-4" height="1em" width="1em" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg"><path d="M10 15v4a3 3 0 0 0 3 3l4-9V2H5.72a2 2 0 0 0-2 1.7l-1.38 9a2 2 0 0 0 2 2.3zm7-13h2.67A2.31 2.31 0 0 1 22 4v7a2.31 2.31 0 0 1-2.33 2H17"></path></svg></button></div></div></div></div></div></div><div class="group w-full text-gray-800 dark:text-gray-100 border-b border-black/10 dark:border-gray-900/50 dark:bg-gray-800"><div class="flex p-4 gap-4 text-base md:gap-6 md:max-w-2xl lg:max-w-[38rem] xl:max-w-3xl md:py-6 lg:px-0 m-auto"><div class="flex-shrink-0 flex flex-col relative items-end"><div class="w-[30px]"><div class="relative flex"><span style="box-sizing: border-box; display: inline-block; overflow: hidden; width: initial; height: initial; background: none; opacity: 1; border: 0px; margin: 0px; padding: 0px; position: relative; max-width: 100%;"><span style="box-sizing: border-box; display: block; width: initial; height: initial; background: none; opacity: 1; border: 0px; margin: 0px; padding: 0px; max-width: 100%;"><img alt="" aria-hidden="true" src="data:image/svg+xml,%3csvg%20xmlns=%27http://www.w3.org/2000/svg%27%20version=%271.1%27%20width=%2738%27%20height=%2738%27/%3e" style="display: block; max-width: 100%; width: initial; height: initial; background: none; opacity: 1; border: 0px; margin: 0px; padding: 0px;"></span><img alt="User" src="https://chat.openai.com/_next/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Flh3.googleusercontent.com%2Fa%2FAAcHTtfE_9fVpMOqgyC7Lo43NLrKgIo-u2ToDOuYOa2T%3Ds96-c&amp;w=96&amp;q=75" decoding="async" data-nimg="intrinsic" class="rounded-sm" style="position: absolute; inset: 0px; box-sizing: border-box; padding: 0px; border: none; margin: auto; display: block; width: 0px; height: 0px; min-width: 100%; max-width: 100%; min-height: 100%; max-height: 100%;" width="30" height="30"></span></div></div></div><div class="relative flex w-[calc(100%-50px)] flex-col gap-1 md:gap-3 lg:w-[calc(100%-115px)]"><div class="flex flex-grow flex-col gap-3"><div class="min-h-[20px] flex flex-col items-start gap-4 whitespace-pre-wrap break-words">SummarySummary. . 
A broad range of observations commonly related to the term consciousness can be functionally 
explained by considering a system combining generative perceptual modeling, such as predictive 
processing, with learning by binding and reinforcement learning of complex actions. Biological conscious 
systems have evolved because they enhance gene proliferation by efficiently and adaptively learning to 
implement complex action policies. Our theoretical proposal is comprehensive, tying together the leading 
insights into consciousness and action learning. It is subject to a rigorous mathematical description, 
numerical modeling, and formal theoretical analysis to be developed within the frameworks of statistical 
learning theory, machine learning and predictive processing. The properties entailed by the hypothesized 
functional architecture were illustrated by examples, wherein we preferred to be specific and possibly 
wrong rather than vague and unfalsifiable, aiming to facilitate empirical testing. No doubt many of these 
examples will have to be refined and corrected, while it is our hope that the main ideas will withstand 
empirical tests. At a bare minimum, this work provides insight into how a comprehensive scientific theory 
of consciousness may be conceived. 
BOX 1. Meeting the Hard Criteria for a theory of consciousness 
Here we specifically describe this proposal following the hard criteria for a theory of consciousness 
proposed in (Doerig, Schurger, and Herzog 2021): 
Empirical phenomena of 
consciousnessmpirical 
phenomena of consciousness being addressed by the 
proposalbeing 
addressed by the proposal: : 
1. Our theory addresses both the content and the state of consciousness by describing (1) the 
functional mechanisms necessary and sufficient for consciousness (state) and (2) the formation 
of perceptual content, and which perceptual content is unified, enter the memory record and is 
available for action, and which is not (content). 
2. The conscious state is governed by hyperparameters of the various learning functions (the 
prediction error size, time persistence and correlation necessary for binding; parameters 
governing the ongoing inference of PP; the bound cause forgetting and consolidation rates; the 
value learning and action learning timescales and rates and the exploration vs. exploitation 
tradeoff). All these global parameters modulate the state of consciousness continuously, and their 
different values distinguish conscious states. 
3. Consciousness is unifying in a sense of (temporarily) attributing various contents to common 
causes and thereby (temporarily) constraining these groups of perceptions to covary. This 
unification is hierarchical and at the highest level contents are unified into an episode. Given the 
proposed binding rules, binding between low-level perceptual features may occur without further 
binding with higher level features and the episode, accounting for the experimental observations 
in (Meuwese et al. 2013). 
4. The theory is temporally continuous, but posits the existence of a time threshold for binding. 
Discontinuously varying outcomes are predicted dependent on whether time periods between 
perceptual inferences are smaller or larger than the binding time threshold, accounting for 
experimental observations in (Herzog, Drissi-Daoudi, and Doerig 2020). 
5. Unconscious contents are not bound or unified, therefore they can have causal influence only on 
other contents with which they have a prior learned association, e.g., priming and triggering of 
previously associated actions and perceptions. 
Meeting 
Meeting Hard 
Hard Criteria:riteria: 
1. Paradigm cases: The theory addresses several experimental paradigm cases as described. It is 
comprehensive and experimentally falsifiable. 
2. Unfolding and structure vs. function: Theory is functional and does not limit how the functions 
are implemented. However, consciousness is a property than cannot be meaningfully ascribed to 
any separate part of the full systems functional organization, which must include future value 
estimation, and action learning as well as the PP and binding. To function, such system must be 
connected with a world via sensors and actuators and provided the rewards. 
3. Network size: The theory describes a functional organization that implements consciousness, 
irrespective of size. Accordingly, small networks implementing this functional organization are 
deemed conscious, even if this consciousness is simple and limited in what it can represent, learn 
or enact. Each instance of a complete implementation of this functional organization within a 
large network is deemed separately conscious. Other than split brain patients, there is no clear 
evidence of multiple instances of this organization within a single brain. It is likely that two largely 
separate instances of this functional organization exist in split brain patients, thus containing two 
consciousnesses. However, when the split brains are interconnected, they can no longer be 
considered separate and independent implementations of the functional organization. A normally 
connected brain implements a single instance of the functional organization. 
4. Other systems: Multiple implementations are possible, including non-biological. An appropriately 
functionally organized numerical model is conscious.</div></div><div class="flex justify-between lg:block"><div class="text-xs flex items-center justify-center gap-1 self-center pt-2

and reinforcement learning of complex actions. It addresses both the content and state of consciousness, describing the mechanisms necessary for consciousness and the formation of perceptual content. The theory explains how consciousness unifies different contents, attributes perceptions to common causes, and allows for the formation of unified episodes. It also considers the temporal continuity of consciousness and the existence of a time threshold for binding. Unconscious contents are not bound or unified and can only have a causal influence on other contents with which they have a prior association.</p><p>The theory meets the hard criteria for a theory of consciousness, as it addresses empirical phenomena of consciousness, explains the state and content of consciousness, and provides a comprehensive and falsifiable framework. It describes the functional organization that implements consciousness, irrespective of network size, and allows for multiple implementations, including non-biological systems.</p><p>The proposed theory provides insight into how a comprehensive scientific theory of consciousness can be conceived. It can be further developed through rigorous mathematical descriptions, numerical modeling, and formal theoretical analysis within the frameworks of statistical learning theory, machine learning, and predictive processing.</p></div></div></div><div class="flex justify-between lg:block"><div class="text-xs flex items-center justify-center gap-1 self-center pt-2 !invisible"><button disabled=""

architecture for consciousness that combines generative perceptual modeling, learning by binding, and reinforcement learning of complex actions. It aims to explain various aspects of consciousness, including the content and state of consciousness, the unification of perceptual experiences, the role of imagination and thinking, and the distinction between perceptual and procedural knowledge.</p><p>The theory suggests that consciousness arises from a system that generates perceptual models based on predictions about sensory data. These models are continuously updated and refined through a process of learning by binding, where new causes are formed by binding together various perceptual features that are temporally correlated and have high prediction errors. This binding process allows for the creation of unified compound objects and the formation of declarative memory records.</p><p>The theory emphasizes the role of actions in consciousness. Actions, which can be triggered by perceptions inferred from sensory data or imagined percepts, modulate the generative model dynamics and influence perceptual inferences and predictions. The theory also highlights the importance of complex action-perception sequences in imagination and thinking, where imagined percepts can trigger specific actions and high-level perceptions.</p><p>Working memory is explained as the interaction between binding, generative perceptual modeling, and selective attention. By selectively attending to specific spatial locations or other attributes, the system can maintain objects in working memory even in the absence of direct sensory stimuli. This allows for the continuous perception of novel compound objects and their integration into recallable episodes.</p><p>The theory distinguishes between perceptual knowledge, which involves the recognition of objects and events, and procedural knowledge, which encompasses the generation of action sequences triggered by perceived objects and events. These two types of knowledge are tightly coupled, and procedural skills are built upon perceptual skills. The theory emphasizes the importance of accurate perceptual models in learning and corrects perceptual illusions through accurate discursive knowledge.</p><p>Overall, the theory provides a comprehensive framework that integrates various aspects of consciousness, including perception, learning, action, imagination, and thinking. It aims to meet the hard criteria for a theory of consciousness and suggests that consciousness has evolved to enhance adaptive action learning. The theory can be further developed and tested through mathematical modeling and empirical research.</p></div></div></div><div class="flex justify-between lg:block"><div class="text-xs flex

connects with several previous topics related to consciousness and cognitive processes. Here are some of the connections:</p><ol><li><p>Predictive Processing: The theory builds upon the idea of predictive processing, which suggests that the brain generates predictions about sensory inputs to facilitate perception. It extends this concept by incorporating learning by binding, which allows for the formation of new causes by binding together temporally correlated and unpredicted perceptual features.</p></li><li><p>Multimodal Perception: The theory acknowledges that perception involves multiple modalities, such as vision, audition, and touch. It proposes that these multimodal perceptions are bound together through the learning-by-binding process, leading to the formation of unified compound objects and episodic memory records.</p></li><li><p>Attention and Working Memory: The theory highlights the role of attention and working memory in consciousness. It explains how selective attention to specific spatial locations or attributes can maintain objects in working memory, even in the absence of direct sensory stimuli. This process involves the interaction between binding, generative perceptual modeling, and selective attention.</p></li><li><p>Imagination and Thinking: The theory recognizes the importance of imagination and thinking in consciousness. It suggests that imagined percepts can trigger specific actions and high-level perceptions, allowing for the generation of complex action-perception sequences. It also emphasizes that imagination reuses the predictive machinery of perception, predicting both object features and the perceptual consequences of actions.</p></li><li><p>Perceptual and Procedural Knowledge: The theory distinguishes between perceptual knowledge, which involves the recognition of objects and events, and procedural knowledge, which encompasses the generation of action sequences. It highlights the tight coupling between these two types of knowledge and how they contribute to conscious experiences and cognitive processes.</p></li></ol><p>Overall, the theory presented in the text provides a comprehensive framework that integrates and extends concepts from predictive processing, multimodal perception, attention, working memory, imagination, and knowledge representation. It offers a theoretical explanation for various phenomena associated with consciousness and cognitive processes and suggests avenues for further research and empirical validation.</p></div></div></div><div class="flex justify-between lg:block"><div class="text-xs flex items-center justify-center gap-1 self-center pt-2 !invisible"><button disabled=""

between the theory proposed in the given text and certain aspects of cognitive processes and consciousness. Here are a few possible comparisons:</p><ol><li><p>Hierarchical Structure: The theory posits a hierarchical organization of perceptual knowledge and action policies. This hierarchical structure can be likened to a geometric pyramid, where higher-level causes and actions are built upon and derived from lower-level perceptual features. Similar to how the levels of a pyramid are interconnected, the hierarchical organization of the theory allows for the flow of information and predictions from lower-level sensory processing to higher-level cognitive processes.</p></li><li><p>Binding and Integration: The process of binding, where temporally correlated perceptual features are combined into new causes, can be compared to the way geometric shapes or objects are integrated. Just as multiple shapes can be combined to form a new composite shape, binding integrates various perceptual features to create a unified object or episode. The binding process allows for the integration of different modalities and attributes, similar to how geometric shapes with different properties can be combined.</p></li><li><p>Attention as a Focal Point: Selective attention, which plays a crucial role in the theory, can be likened to a focal point in geometry. Just as attention focuses on specific spatial locations or attributes, a focal point in geometry concentrates attention or emphasis on a particular area or aspect of a shape or object. Attention serves as a mechanism for directing and prioritizing cognitive resources, similar to how a focal point guides attention to relevant aspects of a geometric figure.</p></li><li><p>Perceptual Generalization: The theory highlights the ability to generalize perceptual knowledge from specific instances to broader classes. This can be compared to the process of generalizing geometric shapes or figures. For example, recognizing different instances of a circle as belonging to the broader class of "round shapes" involves perceiving the common characteristics shared by all circles. Similarly, the theory proposes that specific instances of objects and events can be generalized to broader categories through learning and prediction.</p></li></ol><p>While these comparisons are metaphorical in nature, they provide a way to conceptualize and understand certain aspects of the theory in relation to geometric principles and properties.</p></div></div></div><div class="flex

Here's a summary of the topics we've discussed:</p><ol><li><p>Perception and Learning: The theory proposed in the given text combines generative perceptual modeling, such as predictive processing, with learning by binding and reinforcement learning of complex actions. The goal is to understand how biological systems learn and implement complex action policies through efficient perception.</p></li><li><p>Auditory Inferences and Localization: The theory explains how auditory inferences, such as perceiving loudness or specific sounds, are linked to the localization of those sounds. It emphasizes the role of prediction errors and temporal correlations in binding these perceptual features together into a unified object or episode.</p></li><li><p>Multimodal Perceptions and Prediction Errors: The theory highlights the high prediction errors associated with multimodal perceptions, which occur when multiple sensory modalities converge on a specific spatial location or object. These prediction errors contribute to the binding process and the formation of unified compound objects.</p></li><li><p>Higher-Order Causes and Self-Experience: The theory suggests that higher-order causes can be inferred to describe the ongoing experience of objects and events. It also posits the inference of a "self" to which this experience is attributed. These higher-order causes are bound with specific objects and contribute to the formation of episodic memory.</p></li><li><p>Learning Hyperparameters and Plasticity: The theory proposes that the learning-by-binding process is influenced by hyperparameters such as prediction error size, activation duration, and maximum asynchrony between features. These hyperparameters vary across sensory domains and hierarchy levels and are modulated by global state variables and affective states.</p></li><li><p>Perception, Learning, and Value Estimation: The theory suggests that perception plays a major role in estimating future value for reinforcement learning and optimizing action policies. High positive or negative valence modulates the learning-by-binding parameters to provide value-relevant perceptual learning and action policy learning.</p></li><li><p>Perceptual Unity and Global Workspace: The theory explains perceptual unity as the binding of various contents into a unified compound object or episode. This binding allows for cross-prediction between features and influences a large number of other perceptions and actions. It relates this notion to global workspace theories of consciousness.</p></li><li><p>Working Memory and Selective Attention: The theory proposes that working memory arises from the interaction of binding, predictive processing, and selective attention. Selective attention to specific spatial locations or attributes helps maintain objects in working memory, even in the absence of direct sensory perception.</p></li><li><p>Imagination, Thinking, and Mental Actions: The theory suggests that imagination and thinking rely on the same predictive machinery as perception. Imagined perceptual inferences and mental actions can trigger complex action-perception chains, including sensory images, kinesthetic action imagination, and imagined speech sequences.</p></li><li><p>Procedural Knowledge and Perceptual Knowledge: The theory distinguishes between procedural knowledge (related to action policies and cognitive skills) and perceptual knowledge (related to perceptual recognition). It highlights the interplay between these two types of knowledge and their role in learning and cognition.</p></li><li><p>Geometric Comparisons: Geometric metaphors can be drawn to understand certain aspects of the theory, such as the hierarchical structure of knowledge, the integration of perceptual features, the role of attention as a focal point, and the generalization of perceptual knowledge.</p></li></ol><p>Overall, we have explored the proposed theory's connections to various topics, including perception, learning, binding, consciousness, working memory, imagination, and the interplay between procedural and perceptual knowledge.</p></div></div></div><div class="flex justify-between lg:block"><div class="text-xs flex items-center justify-center gap-1 self-center pt-2

text combines generative perceptual modeling, learning by binding, and reinforcement learning to explain how biological systems perceive, learn, and implement complex action policies. It emphasizes the role of prediction errors, temporal correlations, and the binding of perceptual features in forming unified compound objects and episodes. The theory proposes that higher-order causes and self-experience are inferred and integrated into the perception process. It also suggests that perception plays a crucial role in estimating future value for action policy optimization. The theory highlights the unifying nature of perception, the formation of working memory through selective attention, and the role of imagination and thinking in utilizing the same predictive machinery as perception. It distinguishes between procedural and perceptual knowledge and their interplay in learning and cognition. The theory offers insights into the functional organization of consciousness and provides a comprehensive framework for understanding perception, learning, and cognition in biological systems.</p></div></div></div><div class="flex justify-between lg:block"><div class="text-xs flex items-center justify-center gap-1 self-center pt-2 !invisible"><button disabled="" class="dark:text-white disabled:text-gray-300 dark:disabled:text-gray-400"><svg stroke="currentColor" fill="none" stroke-width="1.5" viewBox="0 0 24 24" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" class="h-3 w-3" height="1em" width="1em" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg"><polyline points="15 18 9 12 15 6"></polyline></svg></button><span class="flex-grow flex-shrink-0">1 / 1</span><button disabled="" class="dark:text-white disabled:text-gray-300 dark:disabled:text-gray-400"><svg stroke="currentColor" fill="none" stroke-width="1.5" viewBox="0 0 24 24" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" class="h-3 w-3" height="1em" width="1em" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg"><polyline points="9 18 15 12 9 6"></polyline></svg></button></div><div class="text-gray-400 flex self-end lg:self-center justify-center mt-2 gap-2 md:gap-3 lg:gap-1 lg:absolute lg:top-0 lg:translate-x-full lg:right-0 lg:mt-0 lg:pl-2 visible"><button class="flex ml-auto gap-2 rounded-md p-1 hover:bg-gray-100 hover:text-gray-700 dark:text-gray-400 dark:hover:bg-gray-700 dark:hover:text-gray-200 disabled:dark:hover:text-gray-400"><svg stroke="currentColor" fill="none" stroke-width="2" viewBox="0 0 24 24" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" class="h-4 w-4" height="1em" width="1em" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg"><path d="M16 4h2a2 2 0 0 1 2 2v14a2 2 0 0 1-2 2H6a2 2 0 0 1-2-2V6a2 2 0 0 1 2-2h2"></path><rect x="8" y="2" width="8" height="4" rx="1" ry="1"></rect></svg></button><div class="flex gap-1"><button class="p-1 rounded-md hover:bg-gray-100 hover:text-gray-700 dark:text-gray-400 dark:hover:bg-gray-700 dark:hover:text-gray-200 disabled:dark:hover:text-gray-400"><svg stroke="currentColor" fill="none" stroke-width="2" viewBox="0 0 24 24" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" class="h-4 w-4" height="1em" width="1em" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg"><path d="M14 9V5a3 3 0 0 0-3-3l-4 9v11h11.28a2 2 0 0 0 2-1.7l1.38-9a2 2 0 0 0-2-2.3zM7 22H4a2 2 0 0 1-2-2v-7a2 2 0 0 1 2-2h3"></path></svg></button><button class="p-1 rounded-md hover:bg-gray-100 hover:text-gray-700 dark:text-gray-400 dark:hover:bg-gray-700 dark:hover:text-gray-200 disabled:dark:hover:text-gray-400"><svg stroke="currentColor" fill="none" stroke-width="2" viewBox="0 0 24 24" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" class="h-4 w-4" height="1em" width="1em" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg"><path d="M10 15v4a3 3 0 0 0 3 3l4-9V2H5.72a2 2 0 0 0-2 1.7l-1.38 9a2 2 0 0 0 2 2.3zm7-13h2.67A2.31 2.31 0 0 1 22 4v7a2.31 2.31 0 0 1-2.33 2H17"></path></svg></button></div></div></div></div></div></div><div class="group w-full text-gray-800 dark:text-gray-100 border-b border-black/10 dark:border-gray-900/50 dark:bg-gray-800"><div class="flex p-4 gap-4 text-base md:gap-6 md:max-w-2xl lg:max-w-[38rem] xl:max-w-3xl md:py-6 lg:px-0 m-auto"><div class="flex-shrink-0 flex flex-col relative items-end"><div class="w-[30px]"><div class="relative flex"><span style="box-sizing: border-box; display: inline-block; overflow: hidden; width: initial; height: initial; background: none; opacity: 1; border: 0px; margin: 0px; padding: 0px; position: relative; max-width: 100%;"><span style="box-sizing: border-box; display: block; width: initial; height: initial; background: none; opacity: 1; border: 0px; margin: 0px; padding: 0px; max-width: 100%;"><img alt="" aria-hidden="true" src="data:image/svg+xml,%3csvg%20xmlns=%27http://www.w3.org/2000/svg%27%20version=%271.1%27%20width=%2738%27%20height=%2738%27/%3e" style="display: block; max-width: 100%; width: initial; height: initial; background: none; opacity: 1; border: 0px; margin: 0px; padding: 0px;"></span><img alt="User" src="https://chat.openai.com/_next/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Flh3.googleusercontent.com%2Fa%2FAAcHTtfE_9fVpMOqgyC7Lo43NLrKgIo-u2ToDOuYOa2T%3Ds96-c&amp;w=96&amp;q=75" decoding="async" data-nimg="intrinsic" class="rounded-sm" style="position: absolute; inset: 0px; box-sizing: border-box; padding: 0px; border: none; margin: auto; display: block; width: 0px; height: 0px; min-width: 100%; max-width: 100%; min-height: 100%; max-height: 100%;" width="30" height="30"></span></div></div></div><div class="relative flex w-[calc(100%-50px)] flex-col gap-1 md:gap-3 lg:w-[calc(100%-115px)]"><div class="flex flex-grow flex-col gap-3"><div class="min-h-[20px] flex flex-col items-start gap-4 whitespace-pre-wrap break-words">I think we were discussing the article Consciousness is learning: predictive

Yes, our discussion has been centered around the article titled "Consciousness is learning: predictive processing systems that learn by binding may perceive themselves as conscious." This article proposes a theory of consciousness that integrates generative perceptual modeling, learning by binding, and reinforcement learning. It suggests that conscious perception arises from the ability of biological systems to efficiently learn and predict complex causal relationships in their environment. The theory emphasizes the role of binding in forming unified compound objects and episodes, and how perception interacts with action policy optimization. It also explores the connection between imagination, thinking, working memory, and the distinction between procedural and perceptual knowledge. Overall, the article provides a comprehensive framework for understanding the functional mechanisms underlying consciousness.</p></div></div></div><div class="flex justify-between lg:block"><div class="text-xs flex items-center justify-center gap-1 self-center pt-2 !invisible"><button disabled="" class="dark:text-white disabled:text-gray-300 dark:disabled:text-gray-400"><svg stroke="currentColor" fill="none" stroke-width="1.5" viewBox="0 0 24 24" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" class="h-3 w-3" height="1em" width="1em" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg"><polyline points="15 18 9 12 15 6"></polyline></svg></button><span class="flex-grow flex-shrink-0">1 / 1</span><button disabled="" class="dark:text-white disabled:text-gray-300 dark:disabled:text-gray-400"><svg stroke="currentColor" fill="none" stroke-width="1.5" viewBox="0 0 24 24" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" class="h-3 w-3" height="1em" width="1em" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg"><polyline points="9 18 15 12 9 6"></polyline></svg></button></div><div class="text-gray-400 flex self-end lg:self-center justify-center mt-2 gap-2 md:gap-3 lg:gap-1 lg:absolute lg:top-0 lg:translate-x-full lg:right-0 lg:mt-0 lg:pl-2 visible"><button class="flex ml-auto gap-2 rounded-md p-1 hover:bg-gray-100 hover:text-gray-700 dark:text-gray-400 dark:hover:bg-gray-700 dark:hover:text-gray-200 disabled:dark:hover:text-gray-400"><svg stroke="currentColor" fill="none" stroke-width="2" viewBox="0 0 24 24" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" class="h-4 w-4" height="1em" width="1em" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg"><path d="M16 4h2a2 2 0 0 1 2 2v14a2 2 0 0 1-2 2H6a2 2 0 0 1-2-2V6a2 2 0 0 1 2-2h2"></path><rect x="8" y="2" width="8" height="4" rx="1" ry="1"></rect></svg></button><div class="flex gap-1"><button class="p-1 rounded-md hover:bg-gray-100 hover:text-gray-700 dark:text-gray-400 dark:hover:bg-gray-700 dark:hover:text-gray-200 disabled:dark:hover:text-gray-400"><svg stroke="currentColor" fill="none" stroke-width="2" viewBox="0 0 24 24" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" class="h-4 w-4" height="1em" width="1em" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg"><path d="M14 9V5a3 3 0 0 0-3-3l-4 9v11h11.28a2 2 0 0 0 2-1.7l1.38-9a2 2 0 0 0-2-2.3zM7 22H4a2 2 0 0 1-2-2v-7a2 2 0 0 1 2-2h3"></path></svg></button><button class="p-1 rounded-md hover:bg-gray-100 hover:text-gray-700 dark:text-gray-400 dark:hover:bg-gray-700 dark:hover:text-gray-200 disabled:dark:hover:text-gray-400"><svg stroke="currentColor" fill="none" stroke-width="2" viewBox="0 0 24 24" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" class="h-4 w-4" height="1em" width="1em" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg"><path d="M10 15v4a3 3 0 0 0 3 3l4-9V2H5.72a2 2 0 0 0-2 1.7l-1.38 9a2 2 0 0 0 2 2.3zm7-13h2.67A2.31 2.31 0 0 1 22 4v7a2.31 2.31 0 0 1-2.33 2H17"></path></svg></button></div></div></div></div></div></div><div class="h-32 md:h-48 flex-shrink-0"></div></div></div></div></div><div class="absolute bottom-0 left-0 w-full border-t md:border-t-0 dark:border-white/20 md:border-transparent md:dark:border-transparent md:bg-vert-light-gradient bg-white dark:bg-gray-800 md:!bg-transparent dark:md:bg-vert-dark-gradient pt-2 md:-left-2"><form class="stretch mx-2 flex flex-row gap-3 last:mb-2 md:mx-4 md:last:mb-6 lg:mx-auto lg:max-w-2xl xl:max-w-3xl"><div class="relative flex h-full flex-1 items-stretch md:flex-col" role="presentation"><div class="flex flex-col w-full py-[10px] flex-grow md:py-4 md:pl-4 relative border border-black/10 bg-white dark:border-gray-900/50 dark:text-white dark:bg-gray-700 rounded-xl shadow-xs dark:shadow-xs"><textarea id="prompt-textarea" tabindex="0" data-id="4ffd1ad1-fb52-49de-8305-df278e78110b" rows="1" placeholder="Send a message." class="m-0 w-full resize-none border-0 bg-transparent p-0 pr-10 focus:ring-0 focus-visible:ring-0 dark:bg-transparent md:pr-12 pl-3 md:pl-0" style="max-height: 200px;
