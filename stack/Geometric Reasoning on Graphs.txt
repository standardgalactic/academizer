An Owner's Guide to the Human Genome:
an introduction to human population genetics, variation and disease
by Jonathan Pritchard, Stanford University

In this book I describe the forces that govern genetic variation including mutation, drift, recombination and selection, as well as what genetics teaches us about human history, and the role of genetic variation in human phenotypes and diseases. When complete, the book will combine the three pillars of human population genetics - population genetics, population history, and trait genetics - under a single umbrella, with a focus on examples and applications in human genetics. Moreover, each section emphasizes the essential interplay between theory, statistical methods, and biological applications, with a focus on building intuition while avoiding heavy technical detail where possible.
I'm very happy to hear from readers, including students at any stage, with feedback, questions, errors (or even just to say that you enjoyed it!) at pritch@stanford.edu.

The current release (V 1.0, September 2023) covers the first half of the planned book. I hope to release Part 3 by the end of 2023. Original material is provided under a CC-BY-4.0 Creative Commons License.

Preface 
This book is about the genetic differences between human genomes. 
If we sequenced your genome, and my genome, we���d i nd about i ve million dif- 
ferences. Most of these differences are SNPs, changing just a single position in 
the DNA ��� perhaps you have an A where I have a G. There are also millions of 
basepairs that are involved in additions, subtractions, or complex rearrangements 
of chunks of DNA, ranging in size from just a few basepairs to tens of thousands 
of basepairs. 
Human genetics deals with understanding the causes and consequences of all 
this genetic variation. The story of these genetic variants starts from random 
mutations ��� some of which occurred in your parents and grandparents, while 
others arose more than a million years ago in our ancestral homelands in Africa. 
These variants have been carried by ancient migrations, and buffeted by the 
forces of genetic drift, linkage, and natural selection. This pool of genetic vari- 
ation ref l ects the history of the human species, and underpins genetic inf l uences 
on the full range of human traits, behaviors and disease risks. 
Key Topics.In this book we seek to understand all the processes above��� 
the forces that govern genetic variation, what they tell us about human 
history, and the role of genetic variation in human phenotypes and dis- 
eases. Specif i cally, I aim to provide a unif i ed introduction to a set of inter- 
connected topics including: 
���The 
types and distribution of genetic variation; 
���Germline 
and somatic mutation; 
���The 
forces of population genetics: drift, recombination, selection; 
���Genetics 
as a tool for studying human population structure and history; 
���The 
inheritance of human phenotypic variation; 
���Large-effect mutations in genetic diseases and cancer; 
���The 
genetic basis of complex traits in health and disease. 
Notably, this book combines population genetics, population history, and 
trait genetics under a single umbrella. While some of these topics are al- 
ready covered by other introductory texts, there is a tendency elsewhere 
to separate trait genetics from population genetics. These topics are fun- 
damentally interconnected and cannot be fully understood in isolation.

The preface of ���An Owner���s Guide to the Human Genome��� by JK Pritchard introduces the book���s primary focus: exploring and understanding the genetic differences between individual human genomes. Pritchard emphasizes that there are approximately five million differences between any two individuals' genomes, ranging from single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) to more complex genetic rearrangements involving additions, deletions, or alterations of DNA segments.
The author outlines that these genetic variants originate from random mutations occurring over time, influenced by various factors such as ancestral migrations, genetic drift, linkage, and natural selection. These variants not only mirror the historical journey of the human species but also play a crucial role in influencing a wide array of human traits, behaviors, and susceptibility to diseases.
The book aims to provide a comprehensive introduction to the following interconnected topics:
Types and distribution of genetic variation
Germline and somatic mutations
The forces of population genetics, including drift, recombination, and selection
The use of genetics for studying human population structure and history
The inheritance of human phenotypic variation
Large-effect mutations related to genetic diseases and cancer
The genetic foundations of complex traits affecting health and disease
Pritchard highlights the uniqueness of the book in integrating population genetics, population history, and trait genetics, offering a unified perspective that is often segmented in other introductory texts. The author emphasizes that these topics are closely interconnected and should be understood collectively rather than in isolation.
The book is available for free download and can be used, shared, and adapted for any purpose, provided proper credit is given to the original source, as it is under a CC BY 4.0 Creative Commons license. However, users should be aware that the book contains third-party content, for which Pritchard cannot grant repurposing permission.
Human genetics combines modeling, biology, and inference.Aside 
from the main topics, there are three themes that run through the book: 
theoretical models ��� usually made precise with math or probability, these 
provide structure for interpreting complex phenomena; biology ��� every- 
thing that we hope to learn about, from the history of human popula- 
tions, to natural selection, to the molecular mechanisms that link genomic 
variants to phenotypes; and inference methods ��� often using statistics, 
these tell us how to extract meaning from complex data. 
The role of models. Students of genetics are often surprised by the cen- 
tral role of theoretical models. One remarkable aspect of human genetics, 
and of population genetics a, is how often important, deep, principles ex-a Population genetics refers to the study 
of genetic variation in populations, and it 
will be central to our story here. 
tend logically from the basic processes of genetics. 
In this regard, I like to think of the founders of population genetics, work- 
ing in the i rst half of the 20th Century. They really knew nothing of 
modern molecular genetics ��� bear in mind that even the structure of DNA 
was not known until 1953. And yet they did know some of the most basic 
rules of inheritance, including: 
���the 
basic rules of Mendelian segregration of alleles and inheritance; 
���the existence of chromosomes, linkage, and recombination; 
���that 
mutations can create new alleles; 
���that 
some traits are controlled by a single locus (gene), while others are 
affected by multiple loci and environmental factors. 
Starting from these observations, the founders of population genetics 
made basic models for the transmission of alleles within families, and 
within populations. In some models they considered that species have 
geographic structure, such that individuals are most likely to reproduce 
with other individuals living nearby. They also considered models of i t- 
ness: models where individuals with particular genotypes survive or re- 
produce better than others, as well as models where the alleles have no 
effect on survival (so-called neutral alleles). 
The remarkable thing is that, starting with these very limited observa- 
tions, they and their successors were able to outline many of the most 
important processes in population genetics: drift, selection, the role of 
linkage, and others. Similarly, the genetic principles of plant and animal 
breeding (known as quantitative genetics b) were also largely i gured out inb Quantitative genetics and statistical 
genetics study the role of genetic variation 
in shaping phenotypic variation and will be 
central themes in Part 4 of the book. 
the 20th Century, again starting from very basic assumptions. Quantita- 
tive genetics is also an essential tool for understanding the inheritance of 
human traits; this will be the focus of Chapter 4.4. 
In other words, these insights from simple models are still fundamentally 
important today. Much of how we understand aspects of human popu- 
lation genetics is built on top of these basic models. The importance of 
models here is arguably greater than in any other area of biology. 
So does this mean that there���s nothing left to learn? Far from it. The early 
models provided a framework for understanding modern data, but until 
recently it was impossible to know which aspects of these models would 
turn out to be most relevant in real life. Moreover, recent discoveries have 
2 
motivated important new avenues of theory in many areas.
ChatGPT
The passage highlights three core themes running through the book: theoretical models, biology, and inference methods. These themes are integral to understanding human genetics, as they provide a framework for interpreting complex phenomena, exploring biological aspects of human genetics, and extracting meaningful information from intricate data.
Theoretical Models:
Theoretical models play a crucial role in human and population genetics, providing structure and insights into complex genetic phenomena. The founders of population genetics, working in the early 20th century, developed basic models for allele transmission within families and populations based on limited observations and understanding of genetics at the time. Despite having no knowledge of modern molecular genetics, they understood fundamental rules of inheritance, such as Mendelian segregation of alleles, existence of chromosomes, linkage, and recombination, mutation, and the influence of single or multiple loci and environmental factors on traits. Starting with these basic observations, they outlined important processes in population genetics, including drift, selection, and linkage.
Biology:
The biology theme encompasses everything from human population history to natural selection and molecular mechanisms linking genomic variants to phenotypes. Understanding the biological aspect is essential for learning about various subjects like human population history, natural selection, and how genomic variants are linked to phenotypes.
Inference Methods:
These are statistical tools used to extract meaningful information from complex genetic data. Inference methods enable researchers to make sense of intricate data, providing valuable insights into genetic variation and its influence on various traits and diseases.
Despite the foundational importance of early models in genetics, the author emphasizes that there is still much to learn in the field. While early models offer a valuable framework for understanding modern genetic data, it was previously impossible to determine which aspects of these models were most relevant in practice. Recent discoveries have opened up new avenues for theoretical development in various areas of genetics, highlighting the dynamic and evolving nature of the field.
The role of biology. Again and again, we���ll see how modern genomic 
and functional data illuminate new and unexpected aspects of human 
history, human evolution, or the genetic basis of human traits and dis- 
eases. We���ll talk about how genome data has reshaped our understand- 
ing of the importance of genetic drift, the modes of adaptation in human 
population, and the types of genes that have been targets of natural se- 
lection in specif i c environments. We���ll discuss the ways in which ancient 
DNA has transformed our understanding of human prehistory. 
We already know far too much to cover everything in one book, but I 
have aimed to emphasize key concepts that will be useful for understand- 
ing the primary literature, as well as interesting examples that illustrate 
general principles. There���s also a huge amount of exciting new work that 
is adjacent to our main topics, for example in functional genomics and 
cancer genomics. Unfortunately no single book can cover everything, so 
my approach will be to give background where needed, while maintain- 
ing our focus on genetic variation. 
Computer science and statistics. Last but not least, in recent years there 
has been an enormous growth of new statistical and computational meth- 
ods for analyzing genome data. Modern experiments often generate ter- 
abytes of data, and it takes enormous skill and creativity to extract mean- 
ingful biological insight. Data analysis is an essential part of modern ge- 
netics. If you���re currently a student of genetics, there is perhaps no better 
single piece of advice than to make sure you become adept at program- 
ming and data analysis. (Oh, and I tell students to spend as much time 
reading science papers as they can!) 
My third main goal as we go through each topic is to outline the core 
concepts that underlie the most important analytical approaches relat- 
ing to our core topics. This is not a book about statistical methods, per se, 
but these sections should provide a useful jumping-off point for further 
reading. 
Quantitative reasoning in human genetics.In addition to models, an- 
other thread that runs through the book is the power of thinking about 
numbers, scales, and rates, for understanding biology. 
I���m reminded of a game in which the quizmaster asks seemingly impos- 
sible questions, like: ���How many french fries are consumed per day in 
the US?���. The goal is to use logical reasoning to get to a sensible order- 
of-magnitude answer. For example, you might guess how often an aver- 
age person eats french fries, and how many they would eat in a typical 
serving, and then note that there are about 330 million people in the US, 
to work your way to a reasoned answer. 
These types of logic are also very helpful for thinking about genetics and 
genomics, but rarely taught. I often i nd in class that students are good 
at explaining complex molecular mechanisms, yet most have a hard time 
3 
thinking about quantitative scales. For example, I might ask ���How many 
heterozygous missense SNPs does a typical person carry?��� or ���What is 
the average number of genes spanned by a 1 megabase deletion?���. Could 
you give ballpark estimates? 
Throughout the book, I have tried to provide a sense of key numbers and 
rates to give you intuition for these kinds of questions. I don���t want you 
to memorize every number, but if you can remember rough magnitudes, 
it will give you a very useful street-sense for thinking about genomics. 
These can also be very useful for spotting errors when you do data anal- 
ysis. You���ll i nd a short list of Very Useful Numbers in Chapter 1.1. They 
may even help you to answer the questions above.
ChatGPT
The passage elaborates on the role of biology in understanding human genetics, emphasizing how modern genomic and functional data shed light on aspects of human history, evolution, and the genetic basis of traits and diseases. These insights help in understanding genetic drift, adaptation modes in human populations, and genes that have been subject to natural selection in specific environments. The author notes that there's too much information to cover in a single book and aims to focus on key concepts and interesting examples while keeping a primary focus on genetic variation.
Role of Biology:
Modern genomic data has reshaped understanding of genetic drift, human adaptation, and genes targeted by natural selection.
Ancient DNA has transformed knowledge of human prehistory.
The passage also highlights the importance of computer science and statistics in genetics due to the growth of new analytical methods for large genomic data sets. For students in the field, proficiency in programming and data analysis is crucial.
Importance of Computer Science and Statistics:
There's significant growth in statistical and computational methods for genome data analysis.
Data analysis is crucial in modern genetics; hence, proficiency in programming and data analysis is vital for students.
Quantitative reasoning is another crucial aspect, as it helps in understanding biology. Thinking about numbers, scales, and rates is essential, and the author encourages developing intuition for key numbers and rates to help think about genomics effectively. These quantitative skills are also vital for data analysis and error spotting. The author intends to provide useful numbers in Chapter 1.1 to assist readers in developing a better understanding and intuition for genomics.
Quantitative Reasoning:
Essential for understanding biology and genetics.
Helps in developing intuition for key numbers and rates in genomics.
Useful for data analysis and error spotting.
Who is this book for?I hope that this book can be useful for a wide 
range of readers, from late-stage undergraduates and graduate students, 
to seasoned experts. 
In terms of specif i c background, I don���t assume a great deal of specif i c 
technical knowledge of genetics, but certainly the book will be much eas- 
ier if you are already comfortable with the main concepts of genetics. I 
expect that a typical reader would already have at least one college-level 
genetics class, or at least be self-taught to that level. My goal is that stu- 
dents at this stage can use the book as a bridge into the scientif i c liter- 
ature. Meanwhile I have tried to write this so that hopefully even most 
scientists who work in this i eld will i nd topics that are new to them. 
Similarly, probability, and statistics are also important in human genetics 
and a basic background in these topics will be invaluable at some points. 
But to make the book more accessible, I have tried to limit topics that re- 
quire specif i c technical knowledge (or sometimes to fence them off into 
boxes). If you i nd the mathematical sections diff i cult, try to use the ac- 
companying text to get the gist of the key points. For readers who want 
more technical detail, you���ll i nd a great deal of useful material and refer- 
ences in the endnotes. 
Organization of the material.In the book I have used a mixture of 
main text and i gures, marginal notes and i gures, and endnotes to dis- 
play different types of information. The margin notes contain a mixture 
of key takeaways, and interesting miscellania (it should be clear from 
context which is which). Figures that are embedded in the text are usu- 
ally central to the topic of a paragraph; the marginal i gures are usually 
either for clarif i cation, to show typical data, or for general interest. New 
terms that you should remember are usually boldfaced and followed by a 
short def i nition. 
For some topics I have placed either introductory material, or more-complex 
material ��� often with math ��� into Optional Boxes. If you���re fairly new to 
human genetics, you may choose to skip over advanced boxes without 
losing the general thread; more sophisticated readers should use these for 
4 
deeper understanding. 
The endnotes contain references to further readings, and sometimes ad- 
ditional comments, caveats and exceptions, or expanded math. Again, 
readers who are new to the i eld probably won���t need to bother much 
with the endnotes, but advanced readers can use these as a gateway into 
relevant literature. The endnotes also serve another purpose. As I write, 
there is a pair of imaginary readers, one whispering into each ear. On 
one shoulder, an imaginary student prefers general principles and overall 
clarity. But on the other shoulder, a specialist grumbles about the many 
simplif i cations and exceptions. Some of the endnotes are written to try to 
cut down on those grumbles. 
The material is somewhat cumulative from the i rst chapter onward, so 
for example when we���re talking about complex traits there are a couple 
of points where it will be helpful to recall the models of purifying and 
stabilizing selection. But this overlap is small enough that you���ll be ok 
dipping into particular sections or chapters if you prefer c.c Although the material is somewhat 
cumulative, you will probably be ok if you 
prefer to focus on specif i c chapters or 
sections to learn particular topics.
ChatGPT

Prerequisites:
Readers should have basic knowledge of genetics, probably from at least one college-level genetics course or equivalent self-learning.
Some background in probability and statistics is beneficial since these are important in human genetics.
Organization of Material:
The book employs a mix of main text, figures, margin notes, and endnotes to present various types of information.
Margin notes contain key takeaways and interesting miscellaneous information.
Figures within the text are central to the topics being discussed, while margin figures provide clarification, data examples, or are included for general interest.
New terms are boldfaced with short definitions provided for reader clarity.
Optional Boxes are used for either introductory material or more advanced content. Beginners can skip these without losing the general thread, while advanced readers can use them for deeper understanding.
Endnotes offer references for further reading and sometimes additional comments, caveats, and exceptions. They're designed to be more useful for advanced readers serving as a gateway into relevant literature.
Reading Approach:
The material is somewhat cumulative, meaning concepts build upon one another as you progress through the chapters. However, the book is structured so readers can still focus on specific chapters or sections to learn about particular topics without much issue.
Thanks.The structure of this book descends, with modif i cation, from

A whirlwind introduction to some essentials of the human genome. We empha- 
size the core function of the human genome as a physical device for storing and 
replicating biological information. Figure 1.1:Congratulations on your brand-

A short history.Genetic concepts, and genetic data, are so ubiquitous in 
modern society that it���s easy to forget how recent our understanding of 
genetics really is. 
The origins of modern genetics trace back to the 1850s, when a Moravian 
monk, Gregor Mendel, used pea plants to learn the most basic rules of 
genetic inheritance. Mendel���s work was published in an obscure jour- 
nal from Brno (now in the Czech Republic) and was ignored until main- 
stream scientists rediscovered his manuscript in 1900, thereby kicking off 
the scientif i c study of genetics. Thus, genetics had a late start compared 
to many other scientif i c i elds: for example, cells were i rst described by 
Robert Hooke in 1665, and Isaac Newton���s theory of universal gravitation 
was published in 1687. 
During the 20th Century, geneticists worked out the basic nuts and bolts 
of inheritance: phenotypes, mutations, chromosomes and linkage; next, 
the biochemistry of DNA, RNA and proteins; and ultimately most of the 
major principles of molecular genetics. Meanwhile, in human genetics, 
early researchers had learned that certain genetic diseases, like cystic i- 
brosis or Huntington���s disease, are caused by Mendelian mutations in 
single genes, and by the 1980s they had started to map the genes that are 
responsible. 
At the same time, there was growing realization that most of the ways 
that humans vary from one another ��� think of traits like height or weight, 
diabetes or schizophrenia ��� are inf l uenced by small contributions from 
many genes, as well as environmental factors. Last but not least, they had 
already developed much of the theoretical framework that we use to un- 
derstand human population genetics today. All of these pieces are central 
to our story here. 
Thus, by the start of the 21st Century, most of the fundamental building 
blocks of molecular biology and genetics were in place. And yet, at the 
same time our viewpoint was limited by bottlenecks in measurement: 
most notably DNA sequencing. The last two decades have seen a revolu- 
tion in all kinds of biological measurement, but especially of DNA geno- 
typing and sequencing. 
Until very recently, it was extravagantly expensive to sequence human 
genomes: the Human Genome Project completed the DNA sequence for 
a single genome in 2003, at a cost of $3 billion 2. With newer, highly ef- 
i cient technologies, the cost to sequence someone���s genome is now well 
under $1000. These technical advances have ushered in a revolution of 
human genetics. As of 2022, hundreds of thousands of people have had

their genomes sequenced for research or medical applications. Mean- 
while, genome-scale data (SNP genotypes) have been collected for tens 
of millions of people. 
In research settings, high-throughput sequencing is now a universal rou- 
tine tool. Sequencing has enabled major new insights into the genetic ba- 
sis of inherited traits, and cancers. Ancient DNA sequencing has revealed 
important new storylines about the origins and evolution of modern hu- 
mans. Genome sequencing has also revolutionized our ability to study 
the functions of genomes including our ability to measure which parts of 
a genome are active in any given cell type. We���ll touch on all these topics 
in later chapters.

Conclusion:
Chapter 1.2 provides a brief history of genetics, highlighting the rapid advancements and wide applications of genome sequencing in understanding human traits, diseases, and evolution. The chapter sets the stage for more detailed discussions on human genetic variation and its significance in the following sections.
The new technologies have also allowed the general public to interface 
with genetic tools for the i rst time: millions of people have sent their 
DNA samples to personal genetics companies that promise insights into 
customers��� family trees, their ancestries, and perhaps even their genetic 
predispositions. DNA forensics has become an essential part of the crim- 
inal justice system, connecting suspects to crime scenes (or exonerating 
them), and recently using genetic genealogy tools to solve a large num- 
ber of ���cold��� cases that had been unsolvable by traditional methods. The 
use of genetic data in medicine is steadily increasing: millions of moth- 
ers have received prenatal genetics screening to provide early detection 
of chromosomal abnormalities; genome-sequencing is now an important 
tool in cancer treatment; we are on the cusp of genetic prediction in clin- 
ical medicine; techniques like genome-editing with CRISPR and cellular 
reprogramming promise to transform the role of genetics in medicine. 
And of course, many aspects of genetic research came together to enable 
the rapid development and approval of mRNA-vaccines against COVID- 
19 in 2020. 
Genomes, inheritance, and variation. Most of the topics above relate to 
human genome variation, which is the focus of this book. To understand 
genetic variation, it���s i rst helpful to think about the genome as a device 
for storing data, and encoding biological functions. The data stored in 
your genome (or mine) are inherited from our species��� shared ancestors 
in Africa, via many thousands of generations of mutation, genetic drift, 
and natural selection. Looking further back into history, your genome is 
also inherited, albeit with massive modif i cations, through billions of cell 
divisions from single-celled ancestors that lived near the beginning of life 
on earth, some 4 billion years ago. 
In the next sections, we look at how DNA stores and encodes biological 
information a.a Parts of this introductory chapter 
may be familiar to you already, so feel 
free to skip over those! 
The DNA molecule.Your genetic data are stored using a molecule 
called DNA, short for deoxyribonucleic acid. 
The DNA molecule is shaped like a twisted ladder. Each side of the lad- 
der is called a strand, and is made up of four different kinds of chem- 
9 
ical building blocks called bases: namely A, C, G, and T (for adenine, 
cytosine, thymine and guanine). Along each strand, the bases are linked 
together by a chemical backbone. A base plus its chunk of backbone is 
called a nucleotide. The distinction between base and nucleotide is not 
especially important for us here, and we���ll use the terms somewhat inter- 
changeably. Figure 1.2: The nucleotides i t together to form 
complementary strands of DNA, like a twisted 
ladder. Some of the nucleotides shown in the 
sequence are obscured at the points where the 
helix turns perpendicular to the page. Genes can 
be encoded on either strand, but always in a 5��� 
���3��� 
direction on the relevant strand. 
The two strands of the DNA molecule i t together with what���s called 
complementary base-pairing: specif i cally, A on one strand is always matched 
with T; and C with G. This means that we can have four kinds of rungs: 
A:T and T:A; C:G and G:C, depending on which base is on which side of 
the ladder. One rung of the ladder���i.e., 2 bases from opposite strands���is 
called a base-pair. 
Another key feature of the strands is that they have a natural direction��� 
analogous to how we always read English from left to right. Each nu- 
cleotide is asymmetric, with a so-called 5��� side and a 3��� side (pronounced 
���5-prime��� and ���3-prime���). In a DNA strand, all the 5���s are oriented in the 
same direction, so we can label one end of a strand as 5���, and the other 
end as 3���. Meanwhile, the other strand of the helix is oriented in the op- 
posite direction. 
Again, similar to English which is always written left to right, everything 
important in genetics happens 5��� to 3���. DNA replication occurs 5��� to 3���. 
And the copying and decoding of genes ��� transcription and translation 
��� is from 5��� to 3���. Genes can be encoded on either strand, but since the 
two strands of a double helix are oriented in opposite directions, genes 
encoded on one strand are oriented opposite to genes encoded on the 
other strand.

This section highlights the public���s increased access to genetic tools due to technological advancements. Millions have engaged with personal genetics companies for insights into ancestry, familial connections, and genetic predispositions. DNA forensics plays a crucial role in the criminal justice system, aiding in solving and exonerating cases. Additionally, genetic data use in medicine is escalating: prenatal screenings detect chromosomal abnormalities, genome-sequencing supports cancer treatment, and we're approaching a new era of genetic prediction in clinical medicine. Techniques like CRISPR genome-editing and cellular reprogramming are set to revolutionize genetics in medicine further.
Genetic research has been pivotal for public health, particularly evident in the rapid development and approval of mRNA vaccines against COVID-19 in 2020.
The section also provides an overview of genomes, inheritance, and variation:
Genomes as Data Storage:
The genome is described as a data storage device that encodes biological functions, with data inherited from ancestors through mutation, genetic drift, and natural selection. This data has been passed down and modified over billions of cell divisions and years.
DNA Structure & Function:
The basics of DNA structure are introduced. DNA is depicted as a twisted ladder, with sides made of four bases (A, C, G, T), forming the genetic code. Each base pair (e.g., A:T or C:G) forms a rung of the ladder. The DNA strands have a natural direction, and all genetic processes (replication, transcription, translation) occur from the 5��� to 3��� direction of the strand. This directionality is crucial for encoding, reading, and interpreting genes.
This introduction sets the stage for understanding how DNA stores and conveys biological information, providing essential context for the book���s focus on human genome variation.
23 pairs of chromosomes. The DNA in your genome is organized into 
chromosomes. You have 23 pairs of chromosomes���you got one copy of 
each chromosome from your mum b, and one from your dad for a totalb In this book, we���ll generally use terms 
relating to sex and parental relationships as 
a shorthand for referring to biological sex 
and genetic relationships, while noting that 
these terms simplify a complicated reality 3. 
of 46. That includes 22 regular pairs, creatively named Chromosome 1 
to Chromosome 22, roughly in order of size, as well as the sex chromo- 
somes X and Y: biological females have two Xs; males have an X and a Y. 
The smallest chromosome is actually 21, and not 22, because early studies 
put them in the wrong order, and the original numbering has been kept. 
Chromosomes 1���22 are referred to as autosomes when we want to dis- 
tinguish them from the sex chromosomes. The two copies of each chro- 
mosome pair are referred to as homologous chromosomes, or simply 
homologs for short. 
Altogether, you have about 3.3 billion base pairs of DNA from each par- 
ent: 6.6 billion total in every cell. If we laid out the DNA from a single 
cell in a straight line, it would be over 2 meters long c 
c Your body contains���40 
trillion cells, 
nearly all of which carry a copy of your 
genome. If we stretched out all the DNA 
from all your cells end to end, it would span 
across the solar system! 
4. Obviously the 
DNA is not stored in a straight line: instead it���s wrapped around small 
balls of protein called nucleosomes, much like spools of thread. The 
spools themselves are also packaged in an orderly fashion, to i t the whole 
lot into the cell���s nucleus. Together, this highly compact DNA-protein 
packaging is referred to as chromatin, and is the default state for our 
10 
genomes. If you do need to read part of your genome, you���ll brief l y un- 
spool the bit that you need. 
DNA is the world���s greatest data storage device.The central role of 
DNA is to store biological information. Chromosomes are long strings 
of A, C, G, and T that encode information, sort of the same way a book 
does, but using 4 letters instead of 26. In a minute, we���ll talk about how 
this information is encoded, but for right now, just pause for a moment 
to think about the fact that this book of 6 billion base pairs provides com- 
plete instructions for all the proteins needed to make each of your cells��� 
and in fact all the proteins you need to assemble a complete person. 
As a loose analogy you can think of an organism���s genome as being like 
the computer code (operating system and software) that controls a com- 
puter. If you want to make a human or a dog, a worm or a melon, you 
need to input different strings of DNA. And like computer code, which 
relies on computer hardware (your phone or laptop) to produce a phys- 
ical output, a genome relies on elaborate cellular machinery that reads 
it and interprets it to produce biological functions. Later we���ll also talk 
about the important role of environment in shaping phenotypes. 
DNA is an incredibly impressive storage system. If we put this in terms 
of data storage on a computer, a single human cell carries the equivalent 
of about 1.5 Gigabytes of computer data d! (In computing, a bit is a singled Not only is DNA storage physically com- 
pact, but it might also seem surprising that 
the information content of a diploid human 
genome is also modest compared to modern 
computing systems, at just 1.5 gigabytes. 
For comparison, the iPhone operating sys- 
tem is somewhat larger at 2���3 gigabytes, 
depending on version. 
binary digit that is either zero or one; the basic unit of data storage is a 
byte, which is 8 bits. Since DNA has four possible letters, each base pair 
is the equivalent of 2 bits, and 4 DNA base pairs carry one byte of data.) 
So just a few hundred cells carry as much data as your phone ��� though to 
be fair, it���s the same information repeated in every cell. At the same time, 
cells are so small that you could actually i t about 100 million cells inside 
a standard phone. 
Indeed, DNA is such an eff i cient and stable storage system that there is 
a line of research on how to use DNA to store digital data. DNA is far 
more compact than computer storage systems, but currently much slower 
and more expensive for humans to read or write DNA compared to conventional systems 5.

The section explains that human DNA is organized into 23 pairs of chromosomes, with one set received from each parent. These include 22 pairs named Chromosome 1 to 22, plus the sex chromosomes (X and Y). Biological females possess two X chromosomes, while males have one X and one Y chromosome. The 22 pairs are known as autosomes, distinguished from the sex chromosomes.
Each individual has approximately 3.3 billion base pairs of DNA from each parent (a total of around 6.6 billion in every cell). If extended, the DNA from a single cell would measure over 2 meters. However, DNA isn't stored straight but wrapped around proteins called nucleosomes, akin to thread around spools, further organized to fit into a cell���s nucleus. This DNA-protein complex is termed chromatin.
The section also highlights the storage capacity of DNA. The DNA sequence, with its 6 billion base pairs, encodes instructions for producing all proteins necessary for creating and maintaining a human being. Comparatively, the DNA in a single human cell represents about 1.5 gigabytes of data. For perspective, a few hundred cells contain data equivalent to a smartphone's capacity. DNA is not only compact but also a stable and efficient data storage system. There is ongoing research into utilizing DNA for digital data storage due to its compactness, stability, and efficiency, even though the technology for reading or writing DNA is currently slower and more expensive compared to conventional digital storage systems.
The genomic encoding of biological information.For biological sys- 
tems, the importance of DNA is that it encodes biological information. 
One major challenge in genome science is to be able to read the encoded 
information. What does each of the 3.1 billion base pairs do ��� if it does 
anything at all? What would be the impact of a mutation that changes 
any specif i c part of the genome sequence? 
Soon after the Human Genome Project was completed in 2003, at a cost 
of 3 billion dollars, one project leader, Eric Lander, famously gave this 
terse summary of the challenges ahead 6: 
���Genome. Bought the Book. Hard to read.��� 
11 
You can think of the genome as encoding two main types of information: 
The i rst kind of information is contained in genes. A gene is a stretch 
of DNA that encodes a protein. (A small fraction of genes encode func- 
tional RNAs instead of proteins, but the principles are similar.) 
The second kind of information tells each cell how much of each pro- 
tein to make. This is referred to as gene regulation, and is also critically 
important. For example, the differences between a liver cell, a neuron, or 
a muscle cell are mainly due to precisely-controlled differences in gene 
regulation across these cell types. 
As we���ll see shortly, these two types of information are encoded very dif- 
ferently. Genes encode proteins using a very simple format where each 
successive block of 3 nucleotides specif i es an amino acid. 
In contrast, gene regulation is controlled by molecular interactions be- 
tween DNA sequences and cell-type specif i c proteins. The language of 
gene regulation is both highly complex, and highly context-specif i c: a 
particular sequence may be interpreted as an important regulatory re- 
gion in a liver cell, and completely ignored by a neuron. Consequently, 
while the general principles of gene regulation are fairly well understood, 
it is still a diff i cult research problem to predict how a particular DNA se- 
quence will be interpreted in any given cell type. Luckily, it���s possible to 
create accurate maps of regulatory regions using a variety of experimen- 
tal assays. 
Genes and the encoding of proteins.Each gene stores the instructions 
to make a particular protein. If DNA is the information storage device in 
cells, proteins are the molecules that actually get things done. Much of 
biology is controlled by different proteins doing different kinds of jobs in 
cells. (I don���t mean to trash-talk the other essential biomolecules, such as 
lipids ��� but they are not directly encoded by the genome, and will be a 
much smaller part of this book���s story.) Figure 1.3: Example of a protein structure. 
Most of your genome (DNA shown here in black) 
is wrapped around protein complexes called nu- 
cleosomes (colors), like thread on spools.Credit:

Even though proteins perform a huge variety of different jobs, they are 
all made up of the same basic building blocks. These building blocks are 
small molecules called amino acids. Your genome encodes 20 different 
amino acids, which can be joined together in any order to make a pro- 
tein. What a protein does is determined by the specif i c order, and num- 
ber, of its amino acids. Proteins vary greatly in size, but the average pro- 
tein in humans is about 400 amino acids long. 
Unlike DNA, proteins fold into an enormous diversity of shapes, depend- 
ing upon their amino acid sequences, and this is part of what determines 
their biological functions. There is a major i eld of biology devoted to 
measuring, and even predicting, 3-dimensional protein folding, and how 
each protein interacts with other molecules in cells 7. 
The genetic code. DNA specif i es proteins using a simple code, in which 
a nucleotide sequence along one strand of the helix encodes a sequence 
of amino acids. 12 
Remember that DNA is made up of 4 letters: A,C,G,T. So how does DNA 
encode the 20 amino acids? Just like words in a book, we need more than 
one letter to encode each amino acid. If we used pairs of adjacent letters 
(here we mean adjacent on the same strand of the helix), there would be 
42=16 possibilities: AA, AC, AG, AT, CA, CC, CG, CT, GA, GC, GG, 
GT, TA, TC, TG, TT. Hmmm. That still isn���t enough to code for 20 amino 
acids. So we���re going to need three adjacent letters for each amino acid, 
as that gets us to 43=64 possibility combinations. So for example, AAA 
in DNA codes for the amino acid Lysine in the corresponding protein.

Now that gives us 64 combinations when we only really need 20. So what 
does the cell do with the 44 extra triples? Well, three triples, TAA, TAG, 
TGA, are STOP signs, marking the end of the protein. And beyond that, 
there is redundancy, so that most amino acids are encoded by multiple 
triples: eg TGT and TGC both code for the amino acid Cysteine. The 
other special signal is ATG, which signals as a START sign when it occurs 
at the beginning of a protein. ATG also encodes the amino acid Methion- 
ine. Each block of three nucleotides is called a codon. Figure 1.4: The genetic code: this shows the 
encoding of DNA triplets for amino acids. The 
64 possible DNA codons are shown in black, and 
the corresponding amino acids are shown in blue 
using their abbreviations. ATG signals both the 
protein START and the amino acid Methionine. 
TAA, TAG, and TGA are protein STOP codes. 
Abbreviations for the amino acids: 
Ala: Alanine; Arg: Arginine; Asn: Asparagine; 
Asp: Aspartic Acid; Cys: Cysteine; Glu: Glu- 
tamic Acid; Gln: Glutamine; Gly: Glycine; His: 
Histidine; Ile: Isoleucine; Leu: Leucine; Lys: Ly- 
sine; Met: Methionine; Phe: Phenylalanine; Pro: 
Proline; Ser: Serine; Thr: Threonine; Trp: Tryp- 
tophan; Tyr: Tyrosine; Val: Valine. 
This code for translating from DNA to protein is called the genetic code. 
It���s interesting that this code is nearly identical in all living things. For 
example, most bacteria have exactly the same code as humans. There is 
no fundamental reason why AAA should encode the amino acid Lysine��� 
it just started that way in the i rst cells to evolve a genetic code, and has 
been inherited throughout the tree of life ever since, during the last 4 
billion years of evolution. Notable exceptions to the ���universal��� genetic 
code can be found in the tiny genomes carried by our mitochondria, which 
encode four of the codons differently 8. 
13 
Once we know the genetic code, the encoding from DNA to protein is re- 
markably simple: it starts with ATG, and then every successive 3-nucleotides 
encodes a single amino acid until we reach the i rst STOP. (There���s a mi- 
nor complication, which we���ll get to shortly, that blocks of DNA called 
introns are removed before the protein is decoded.)

The section discusses the encoding of biological information within DNA, which primarily serves two functions. Firstly, genes, or specific stretches of DNA, encode proteins (or functional RNAs in some cases). Secondly, the DNA sequence helps regulate how much of each protein is produced, a process referred to as gene regulation. Gene regulation varies across different cell types (e.g., liver cells, neurons, muscle cells), thereby influencing the distinctive characteristics of each cell type.
Proteins, the key players in biological processes, are encoded by genes. Despite the diverse functions proteins perform, they are all comprised of amino acids, the building blocks encoded within the DNA. The specific order and number of amino acids within a protein determine its function. Amino acids are encoded by groups of three nucleotides, known as codons, in the DNA sequence. Given that there are only four nucleotides (A, C, G, T), groups of three are required to create enough combinations (64 in total) to encode the 20 amino acids needed to build proteins. Some codons serve as start (ATG) and stop (TAA, TAG, TGA) signals for protein synthesis, while others are redundant, with multiple codons encoding the same amino acid.
The genetic code, a system translating DNA sequences into amino acids, is remarkably consistent across almost all living organisms, underscoring the shared evolutionary heritage of life on Earth. Exceptions to this ���universal��� genetic code exist, such as in the genomes of mitochondria. The genetic code's simplicity and universality allow for straightforward interpretation, from the start codon to the stop codon, although some complexities, like the removal of introns from the DNA sequence before translation into proteins, are noted.
Figure 1.5: The encoding from DNA to 
protein. The amino acid sequence is interpreted 
as starting from the i rst ATG and continuing 
by threes until the i rst STOP codon. The DNA 
sequence shows the coding strand only. 
You can imagine that this encoding is fragile, in the sense that just chang- 
ing a single nucleotide can potentially alter the protein almost completely: 
for example a mutation that introduces an early stop signal will cause 
the protein to be immediately terminated; similarly, insertion (or dele- 
tion) of a single nucleotide would cause the reading frame of the protein 
to shift and, from that point on, to encode a completely different amino 
acid sequence. As we will see in future chapters, both of these types of 
mutations do occur: they generally cause complete loss-of-function of 
the affected protein, and depending on the protein, they are often highly 
deleterious. 
DNA���mRNA���Protein. DNA is not interpreted directly into protein, 
but instead it is i rst copied into an intermediate called messenger RNA 
(mRNA). RNA is a molecule that is very similar to DNA, but it is usually 
only one strand of the helix, and is less chemically stable for long-term 
storage e. Note that RNA uses a base called Uracil (U) everywhere thate Even though RNA is less stable than 
DNA some viruses, including HIV and 
the virus that causes COVID-19, use RNA 
as their main storage molecule instead of 
DNA. 
DNA uses Thymine (T). This l ow of information from DNA���mRNA 
���protein 
is known as the Central Dogma. 
Transcription. DNA is stored within the cell���s nucleus. In order to make 
a protein, your cell unwraps the bit of the genome that encodes that gene, 
and makes mRNA copies of the DNA. This process is known as transcription��� 
meaning copying. 
Translation. mRNA copies are then transported out of the nucleus into 
the cell���s cytoplasm, where molecular machines called ribosomes assem- 
ble proteins, using the mRNA sequence as a template. This process con- 
verts the biological information from the four-letter alphabets of DNA 
and RNA into the twenty-amino acid alphabet of proteins. This process is 
known as translation, ref l ecting the conversion from one type of informa- 
tion (DNA/RNA) into another (protein): 
14 
Figure 1.6: The l ow of genetic information. 
DNA provides permanent information storage 
for cells; mRNA serves mainly as a temporary 
molecule, used as a template for translation; pro- 
teins are highly versatile molecules that perform 
a wide range of functions. As shown below, the 
three molecules use different alphabets. 
At this point I should confess that despite the grandiose title of the Cen- 
tral Dogma, a small fraction of genes don���t seem to know about this rule, 
as they produce functional RNAs instead of proteins: for example, some 
RNA genes encode essential components of the ribosome, and another 
RNA gene is responsible for inactivating one of the X chromosomes in fe- 
males 9 10. You may be getting the (correct) sense that virtually every rule 
in biology has exceptions! 
Gene structure: UTRs, Exons, Introns, and Splicing. So far, we���ve been 
talking about the part of an mRNA that encodes a protein. But this is ac- 
tually embedded in a much larger transcribed region. 
Transcription begins from a location called the Transcription Start Site, 
and terminates at the Transcription End Site. The initial immature tran- 
script is referred to as a pre-mRNA. 
Almost immediately (usually starting during transcription), another key 
process takes place, in which regions called introns are spliced (cut) out 
of the pre-mRNA to produce a shorter, processed mRNA. After being cut 
out, the introns are trashed, and the nucleotides are recycled. As we���ll see 
shortly, introns are usually much longer than exons, and the i nal mRNA 
is usually just a few percent of the initial pre-mRNA 11.

This section highlights the fragile nature of the DNA-to-protein encoding process, where a single nucleotide change can substantially alter or even disable a protein. Such mutations, including early stop signals or frame-shifting insertions and deletions, often result in a protein���s loss-of-function, which can have deleterious effects on the organism.
DNA is not directly translated into proteins. Instead, it first gets transcribed into messenger RNA (mRNA), which serves as an intermediary. mRNA is similar to DNA but usually single-stranded and chemically less stable. Unlike DNA, which uses Thymine (T), RNA uses Uracil (U). This flow of information, from DNA to mRNA to proteins, is called the Central Dogma.
During transcription, the segment of DNA encoding a specific gene gets unwrapped, and mRNA copies are produced. These mRNA copies move out of the cell nucleus into the cytoplasm. There, ribosomes, the cellular machinery, use the mRNA templates to assemble proteins, translating the information from the nucleotide alphabet of DNA and RNA into the amino acid alphabet of proteins.
Despite the established Central Dogma, exceptions exist. Some genes encode functional RNAs instead of proteins. Examples include RNA genes essential for ribosome components and those responsible for inactivating one of the X chromosomes in females.
The transcription process begins at the Transcription Start Site and ends at the Transcription End Site, with the initially created transcript called pre-mRNA. During transcription, introns, or non-coding regions, are spliced out, leaving behind the coding regions, or exons. This splicing process results in a shorter, processed mRNA that is then used for protein synthesis. Introns are typically longer than exons, so the final mRNA is significantly shorter than the initial pre-mRNA.
Figure 1.7: A typical gene structure. Tran- 
scription initially includes 5��� and 3��� UTRs, cod- 
ing exons, and introns. The introns are rapidly 
removed to create the processed mRNA, prior to 
translation. This is not drawn to scale: typi- 
cal introns are 10��to 100��larger than exons. 
The i nal, processed, mRNA is transported from the nucleus into the cy- 
toplasm, where translation takes place. The translation machinery i nds 
the i rst available start codon (ATG): this is the Translation Start. It then 
15 
proceeds until it i nds the i rst in-frame STOP signal: the Translation 
End. The regions upstream and downstream of the coding region are 
known as the 5��� and 3��� Untranslated Regions (UTRs). The UTRs often 
contain information that is used to target the mRNA to particular loca- 
tions in the cell, or for other forms of regulation. 
One advantage of splicing is that it is possible to make different protein 
products from the same gene, by including or excluding different combi- 
nations of exons, or by using different splice sites. This is known as 
alternative splicing, and the different protein products are called iso- 
forms. For some genes, distinct isoforms are critical for creating func- 
tional diversity of proteins from the same transcripts 12. 
Splice site specif i cation. Given that the exons are joined together from a 
much longer pre-mRNA, this immediately raises another question: how 
does the splicing machinery know where to cut? What marks the posi- 
tions of the exon-intron boundaries? 
This information is encoded in the DNA (and hence the pre-mRNA, which 
is what the splicing machinery is actually interacting with) using a vari- 
ety of signals. First, the splicing code requires a GT at the start, and AG 
at the end of nearly all human introns (GU and AG in the pre-mRNA). 
As we���ll see in Chapter 1.3, any change in the GT or AG forces splicing 
to occur at another position ��� this can dramatically change the encoded 
protein and can have devastating consequences. Figure 1.8: Correct splicing relies on posi- 
tioning signals encoded in DNA. The i gure 
indicates intronic nucleotides with lower-case 
text. Mutations in the 5��� gt or 3��� ag of the intron 
disrupt splicing and often result in a nonfunc- 
tional protein. T in DNA is U in RNA. 
But of course, there are many GT and AG sites in a typical intron (each 
of these occurs roughly once every 16 base pairs). So in addition to these 
required features which help to position the precise splice site, the exon 
positions are also indicated by a combination of weaker sequence-based 
signals, where no single nucleotide is fully required for correct splicing: 
for example the region upstream from the AG usually contains Cs and 
Ts, as well as an upstream A that is involved in cutting out the intron but 
can occur at variable distances. These, and other, signals help to position 
the splice site. 
These weaker signals that help position splicing events are very differ- 
ent from the simple and precise algorithmic rules that encode proteins; 
instead they are more similar to the sequence elements that control gene 
regulation ��� which we���ll discuss next. The goal of understanding the de- 
terminants of splicing is an active research area, using both experiments 
and machine learning

This text describes the typical structure of a gene. After transcription begins, both coding (exons) and non-coding (introns) segments, along with 5��� and 3��� Untranslated Regions (UTRs), are initially included. However, the introns are rapidly removed, leaving behind the final, processed mRNA that is transported into the cytoplasm for translation.
The translation process begins at the start codon (ATG) and proceeds until it reaches the first in-frame stop signal. The 5��� and 3��� UTRs, which are regions not translated into proteins, often contain crucial information for the mRNA���s cellular location or other regulatory functions.
The splicing process is advantageous as it allows for the production of different proteins from a single gene through alternative splicing, which entails the inclusion or exclusion of different exons. This results in different protein products or isoforms, providing functional diversity from the same gene.
The process of splicing requires specific signals in the DNA to function correctly. For instance, the start and end of nearly all human introns need to have GT and AG, respectively. Any change in these signals could result in altered splicing, leading to dramatically different and possibly non-functional proteins. Although GT and AG occur frequently within introns, other weaker, sequence-based signals also help identify the exact positions of exons. These signals are not as straightforward as the rules that encode proteins but are crucial for the correct positioning of splice sites.
Understanding these determinants of splicing is a focus of ongoing research, which leverages both experimental approaches and machine learning to decipher the nuanced and complex rules governing this process.
The encoding of gene regulation.Aside from coding proteins, there���s 
a second kind of information stored in DNA. This information tells a cell 
which RNAs and proteins to produce, and in what quantities. The pro- 
duction of specif i c RNAs and proteins is called gene expression and the 
controls of expression are called gene regulation. Gene regulation is en- 
coded in the genome, and it turns out that the encoded regulatory infor- 
mation is just as important as the protein-coding sequences themselves. Figure 1.9: Gene regulation controls the 
differentiation of cells into many distinct 
types. In this image, two types of neurons in 
mouse cerebral cortex are stained red and green, 
depending on whether each cell produces GABA, 
a key neurotransmitter.Credit: Fig. 6F of Wei-Chung Allen

To understand why gene regulation is so important, it���s helpful to re- 
l ect on the fact that we are immensely complex multicellular organisms. 
Think about all the different types of cells in a human body: skin cells, 
heart cells, liver cells, neurons, sperm and eggs, and hundreds of others. 
These cell types do very different jobs, and look different under a micro- 
scope. It turns out that every cell type also expresses a characteristic port- 
folio of mRNAs and proteins ��� and this portfolio is a large part of what 
gives a cell type its identity. 
Moreover, cells must produce mRNAs and proteins in very precise pro- 
portions (a bit like mixing ingredients for baking). Consistent with this, 
many genetic diseases are caused by disruptions in the relative propor- 
tions of expressed genes 14. 
So how is this precise regulatory information encoded in the genome? 
And, even more strikingly, how does a cell know whether to express 
the portfolio of genes required for a liver or a neuron or a muscle, even 
though every cell carries essentially the same genome? 
To understand these questions, we i rst need to detour into some brief 
details about how gene regulation is encoded in the genome. 
The major focus of gene regulation is on controlling transcription. 
Genes are copied into mRNA ��� i.e., transcribed ��� by a protein machine 
called RNA Polymerase II (Pol II to its friends, pronounced ���pol-2���). 
Prior to transcription, Pol II assembles in a region of DNA at the start of 
the mRNA, known as the promoter. The assembly is guided by a set of 
additional proteins that, along with Pol II form a so-called Pre-Initiation 
Complex within the promoter region. Once Pol II has been assembled at 
the promoter, it attempts to initiate transcription; if that is successful, Pol 
II then chugs along the gene, at a speed of���2 
kb/minute 15 to produce 
an mRNA copy of the DNA 16. Figure 1.10: Transcription: RNA Pol II makes 
an mRNA copy of the DNA. Gene regulatory 
information is responsible for controlling tran- 
scription rates of each gene in specif i c cell types 
and conditions. 
We���ll skip over many interesting details about the molecular biology of 
transcription ��� but for our story here, the key question is to think about 
17 
the DNA sequences that direct transcription. Crucially, how do DNA se- 
quences position the pre-initiation complex? This determines where tran- 
scription will start. And how do DNA sequences control the rate of Pol II 
assembly and transcription 17? 
These decisions are guided in large part by proteins called transcription 
factors (TFs). Most TFs have a DNA binding domain that attaches to 
the genome at specif i c sequences (transcription factor binding sites) 18. 
Meanwhile, other parts of the same TF can interact with other proteins to 
help increase, or sometimes to repress, transcription. As an example, the 
image below shows the molecular structure of a TF called AP-1, where 
the purple region of the protein is bound to DNA: Figure 1.11: Transcription factor binding to 
DNA. Most TFs have a DNA-binding domain 
(shown here in purple); other parts of the protein 
structure can interact with other proteins to 
control transcription.Credit: Houq [Link] CC-BY-SA-3.0

This text describes gene regulation, which is another type of information encoded in DNA aside from protein-coding sequences. Gene regulation controls gene expression���how much of specific RNAs and proteins are produced by a cell���which is crucial for cell identity and function. Cells in the human body, like skin cells, heart cells, liver cells, neurons, and more, express unique portfolios of mRNAs and proteins that define their roles and characteristics.
Gene regulation needs to be precise, and disruptions in the balanced expression of genes can lead to various genetic diseases. The process of transcription, whereby genes are copied into mRNA, plays a central role in gene regulation. The RNA Polymerase II (Pol II) enzyme, responsible for transcription, assembles at a DNA region called the promoter before starting the transcription process. This assembly is aided by other proteins, forming a Pre-Initiation Complex.
The positioning and rate of assembly of Pol II, which in turn influence where transcription starts and at what rate, are controlled by DNA sequences and proteins called transcription factors (TFs). These factors have a DNA binding domain that attaches to specific sequences in the genome known as transcription factor binding sites. The TFs can also interact with other proteins to either promote or repress transcription, thereby playing a significant role in the regulation of gene expression. For instance, the text includes an example of a TF called AP-1, showcasing its structure and its binding to DNA.
Understanding these regulatory mechanisms is crucial for comprehending how cells maintain their unique identities and functions despite carrying essentially the same genome.
TF binding usually takes place both within the promoter region itself, as 
well as at more distant locations called enhancers. Enhancers are regions 
of TF binding that are situated outside the promoter. When TF binding 
occurs at the enhancers, the DNA can form a loop to bring the enhancer 
into close physical contact with the promoter. These enhancer-promoter 
interactions can be essential for assembling the Pre-Initiation Complex 
which includes Pol II, prior to transcription: Figure 1.12: Enhancer-Promoter interactions 
help drive gene expression. Pol II assembles 
in the core promoter prior to initiating transcrip- 
tion. It is stabilized by protein-protein interac- 
tions with TFs bound both within the promoter 
and at distant enhancers. Promoter-enhancer 
proteins may attach through protein bridges such 
as the Mediator Complex. 
Enhancers are often located quite far in DNA distance from the promot- 
ers they regulate ��� usually at distances of tens of thousands up to a mil- 
lion base pairs away, but loop around to create physical proximity. 
18 
So what specif i es the locations of transcription binding sites, and by ex- 
tension, of promoters and enhancers? At positions where the protein 
contacts the DNA directly, each TF has preferred binding sequences that 
ref l ect physical interactions in the contact zone between amino acids in 
the TF, and the nucleotides in the DNA. These preferred sequences are 
called binding motifs ��� for example, the image below shows the pre- 
ferred binding sequence, TTTGCAT, for the TF Oct1: Figure 1.13: Gene expression is largely con- 
trolled by transcription factor (TF) binding 
of DNA. The image shows binding of the Oct1 
and Sox2 proteins to DNA (these two factors 
often bind jointly). The letters below the plot 
provide a graphical representation of which nu- 
cleotides at each position are preferred for bind- 
ing: larger letters are more important.Credit: Fig 3a 
from ��iga Avsec et al (2020) [Link] CC-BY-NC 4.0. 
However, these binding motifs are neither necessary nor suff i cient to pre- 
dict binding. First, even within TF binding motifs, most nucleotides are 
not strictly required for binding. In the image above, the sizes of the let- 
ters indicate the importance of each position for binding: the largest let- 
ters, CAT, are found within most Oct1 binding sites, but the other po- 
sitions are more variable. Second, since these binding motifs are quite 
short, they are found found many times in the genome. Most TFs bind 
only a tiny fraction of all the possible motif matches. 
Instead, the specif i city of TFs to bind in the correct locations is usually 
controlled by combinations of factors binding adjacent DNA sequence el- 
ements: for example, very often binding is stabilized when ensembles of 
multiple TFs can bind in a small region 19. The specif i c rules that control 
TF binding are highly complex and vary across cell types; development 
of computational tools for predicting TF binding sites is an important 
research area where machine learning techniques have started to make 
huge progress from around 2015 onward 20. 
A related puzzle is that enhancers act by DNA looping to create physical 
interactions with promoters. How do enhancers ���decide��� where to loop 
to? While there is a tendency for enhancers to interact with the nearest 
promoter(s), there are exceptions in which enhancers ignore nearby genes 
in favor of regulating genes as far as a million base pairs away 21. The 
controls of looping are poorly understood at present 22.
ChatGPT
The text outlines the importance of transcription factor (TF) binding in both promoter regions and distant locations known as enhancers for gene expression regulation. Enhancers are significant as they assist in assembling the Pre-Initiation Complex (including RNA Polymerase II), essential for transcription initiation.
Here are the key points:
Enhancer-Promoter Interactions:
Enhancers, located far from the promoters they regulate (ranging from tens of thousands to a million base pairs away), play a crucial role in gene expression. They loop around to bring the enhancer into close physical proximity with the promoter, facilitating the assembly of the Pre-Initiation Complex and subsequently aiding in transcription initiation.
Transcription Factor Binding Sites:
TFs have preferred binding sequences (binding motifs) on DNA, influenced by physical interactions between amino acids in the TF and nucleotides in the DNA. However, these binding motifs aren't absolute predictors of binding; not all nucleotides within a motif are necessary for binding, and the motif's presence doesn't guarantee that a TF will bind there.
Specificity and Combinations of Factors:
The specificity of TF binding often relies on multiple factors binding to adjacent DNA sequence elements. This coordination stabilizes binding, with ensembles of multiple TFs commonly binding within a small region. The rules governing this are complex and can vary across different cell types.
Machine Learning in Predicting TF Binding Sites:
Since around 2015, the development of computational tools, particularly those utilizing machine learning techniques, has significantly advanced our ability to predict TF binding sites, offering valuable insights into the complexities of TF binding and gene regulation.
DNA Looping Controls:
While enhancers often interact with the nearest promoters, there are instances where they regulate genes located much further away. The mechanisms controlling these DNA looping interactions between enhancers and promoters are not entirely understood, with the exact controls of these looping interactions remaining an area of active research and investigation.
Understanding these intricate processes and interactions is vital for grasping the broader picture of how gene expression is regulated at the molecular level, ultimately influencing cellular function and identity.
Cell type differences in regulation. Lastly, I want to touch brief l y on a 
remarkable feature of genomes. All of your many cell types carry essen- 
tially the same genome, and yet they can interpret it differently to pro- 
duce different portfolios of genes, and these give different cell types their 
unique identities: for example T cells, or liver cells, or neurons. 
The regulatory logic that I���ve described above starts to hint at how this 
is possible. Cell type identities are controlled in large part by which en- 
19 
hancers are active (and hence which genes are expressed). Enhancer ac- 
tivity, in turn, is controlled by combinations of transcription factors bind- 
ing. The key point here is that different cell types express different sets of 
TFs; thereby turning on (or off) different enhancers across the genome. Figure 1.14: Waddington���s landscape 
metaphor for cellular differentiation (1957). 
Conrad Waddington imagined the increasing 
specialization of cell types during development 
as like a ball rolling down a slope. As it rolls 
it makes random choices that restrict it to in- 
creasingly narrow gullies; in cellular terms, we 
can think of this as turning on lineage-specif i c 
transcription factors that drive cell-type relevant 
programs of gene expression. 
But how do cells ���know��� which TFs they should express? In embryonic 
development, the earliest cells can produce any possible cell type, but 
as the organisms develops, cells become increasingly specialized. This 
specialization is controlled in large part by turning off embryonic TFs, 
and turning on other TFs that are specif i c to particular cell lineages. The 
lineage-specif i c TFs drive programs of gene expression that are appropri- 
ate to the corresponding cell types. 
In summary, the encoding of gene regulation works on very different 
principles than the encoding of proteins. First, gene regulation is ana- 
log (i.e., expression level is a continuous variable), unlike protein cod- 
ing, which is digital (each codon sequence encodes exactly one protein). 
Secondly, the encoding of expression is controlled by the aggregate ef- 
fects of many nucleotides and is robust in the sense that single nucleotide 
changes in the sequence generally have small effects on expression; in 
contrast, single nucleotide changes such as premature stop codons can 
completely break protein function. 
In the last few pages we have discussed that two major categories of in- 
formation stored in genomes include the encoding of genes (i.e., mainly 
proteins); and the encoding of regulatory information (when and how 
much to make each protein). How is this information organized in our genomes?
ChatGPT
The passage describes how various cell types in the body, while containing essentially the same genome, can interpret and utilize the genetic information differently to establish their unique identities. This diversity in interpretation underlies the differentiation and functionality of distinct cell types, such as T cells, liver cells, and neurons. Below are the key points from the passage:
Cell Type-Specific Gene Expression:
Different cell types express various portfolios of genes, giving them their unique identities.
This expression diversity is mainly controlled by the activity of specific enhancers, which in turn, is regulated by the binding of transcription factors (TFs).
Role of Transcription Factors:
Different cell types express different sets of TFs.
These distinct sets of TFs activate or deactivate specific enhancers across the genome, influencing the expression of corresponding genes that define the identity and function of a cell type.
Cell Specialization and Lineage-Specific TFs:
During embryonic development, cells progressively specialize by deactivating embryonic TFs and activating lineage-specific TFs.
These lineage-specific TFs drive the expression of gene programs corresponding to specific cell types, guiding their development and functionality.
Principles of Gene Regulation Encoding:
Gene regulation is analog, meaning the expression level of genes is a continuous variable. In contrast, protein coding is digital, with each codon sequence precisely encoding one protein.
Gene expression regulation is robust and less susceptible to single nucleotide changes. Conversely, in protein coding, single nucleotide alterations (like premature stop codons) can drastically impair protein function.
Two Major Genomic Information Categories:
The genome primarily encodes two categories of information: genes (mainly proteins) and regulatory information (instructions on when and how much of each protein to produce).
Understanding the organization of these two types of information within the genome and how they are interpreted and utilized by various cell types is crucial for gaining insights into cellular differentiation, development, and function.
Bloated genomes: the good, the bad, and the ugly.Remarkably, only 
about 1% of the genome encodes proteins. A somewhat larger amount 
codes for regulatory sequences ��� perhaps around 10% ��� although the 
precise amount is uncertain due to the cryptic nature of gene regulatory 
elements 23. But most of the remaining ���90% 
of the genome sequence 
shows no clear evidence for biological function. What���s there? 
To start addressing this question, it���ll be useful to have a rough sense of 
the landscape of genomes and functional elements. 
Measurement units of DNA sequence. We���ll often need to measure lengths 
of DNA. The natural units of sequence length are in terms of base pairs 
but it���s convenient to abbreviate different scales with different units (sim- 
ilar to how we use milligrams, grams, and kilograms). So you���ll want to 
remember that: 
���1 
bp = 1 basepair 
���1 Kb = 1 kilobase = 103bp 
���1 
Mb = 1 megabase = 106bp 
���1 
Gb = 1 gigabase = 109bp 
Chromosome sizes. The human genome is about 3,100 Mb = 3.1 Gb. 
Most cells have two copies of the genome (one from mum and one from 
dad), so that���s a total of 6.2 Gb. The chromosomes range in size from 250 
20 
Mb (Chromosome 1) down to 47 Mb (Chromosome 21). The mitochon- 
drion has its own genome, contained in a small circular molecule of 16 
Kb. For comparison, the genome of SARS-Cov2, the virus that causes 
COVID-19, is about 29.9 Kb. 
Gene numbers and sizes. Meanwhile, the genome contains about 20,000 
protein-coding genes f 
f Before the human genome was completed, 
most genome scientists expected that there 
would be many more genes. In the year 
2000, the British scientist Ewan Birney 
organized a betting pool to guess how many 
genes there would be. The mean guess was 
over 60,000; the winner was Lee Rowen 
who had the lowest guess (24,800) out of 
more than 460 bets [Link]. 
(estimates range from about 18,000���22,000 de- 
pending on how strict the criteria are that each gene is translated and/or 
functional). This works out, on average, to about 6.5 genes per Mb, al- 
though the distribution of genes is highly uneven. 
To give you a sense of scale, the median length of a protein-coding gene, 
including introns, is 27 Kb 24. Meanwhile, the coding length is much 
shorter, with a median length of 1.2 Kb (400 amino acids). A typical gene 
has 8 exons, and the median size of a coding exon is 122 bp. Introns are 
more than ten-fold longer, with a median size of 1,600 bp, and a mean of 
6,300 bp. Coding exons and UTRs occupy only about 2.5%, each, of the 
average pre-mRNA before splicing. 
You can see an example of a genome region, in a screenshot from the En- 
semble Genome Browser. Known protein-coding genes are marked in 
orange. The vertical bars and boxes are exons or UTRs; horizontal lines 
are introns. Other possible genes are marked in grey and purple (in prac- 
tice most of these are likely nonfunctional) 25. This region is fairly typical, 
except that the gene density is about twice the genome average.

The human genome contains around 20,000 protein-coding genes, with estimates ranging from 18,000 to 22,000 depending on the criteria for classification as a gene.
There's an average of 6.5 genes per Mb, but this distribution is not uniform across the genome.
The median length of a protein-coding gene (including introns) is 27 Kb, while the coding length is much shorter at a median of 1.2 Kb (or 400 amino acids).
A typical gene has 8 exons, with a median size of 122 bp each. Introns are significantly longer, with a median length of 1,600 bp and an average of 6,300 bp.
Before splicing, coding exons and untranslated regions (UTRs) each occupy about 2.5% of the average pre-mRNA.
Gene Density:
The density of genes in the genome varies, with some regions having higher gene density than others.
Understanding these basic structural and compositional characteristics of the genome is crucial for further studies and applications in genetics, genomics, and biomedical research.

So if only about 1% of the genome is protein coding, and a small fraction 
of the rest (���10%) 
encodes regulatory information, then what is all the 
rest of the genome doing? 21 
Remarkably, most of the genome doesn���t have any clear function. 
Indeed about two thirds of the genome is made up by repetitive DNA: 
short sequences of hundreds to thousands of base pairs that are repeated 
many times in the genome. A few of these repetitive elements are in- 
volved in gene regulation, but most don���t do anything useful for you. 
In fact they are sometimes referred to derisively as ���junk DNA���. (These 
elements really need to hire a better PR team.) 
The single most common repetitive element is a 300 base pair sequence 
called an Alu element, which occurs about 1 million times in the genome! 
In other words, about 10% of the storage space of the human genome is 
given up to recording Alu elements ��� this about 10 times as much space 
as we devote to storing all genes. 
Alu is a type of transposable element (TE). TEs are DNA elements that 
can copy themselves and reinsert elsewhere in the genome. They are usu- 
ally considered self i sh DNA, meaning that they proliferate due to their 
ability to replicate, while having little or no value to the host genome ��� 
in short, they are genome parasites. In the case of Alu, it i rst infected 
the genome of our ancestors about 65 million years ago, and has been 
wildly successful in spreading itself around the genome since then. In 
some cases Alus and other repetitive elements have evolved new func- 
tions, but most are essentially inert elements. These must be copied every 
time a cell divides, but most do not contribute to genome function. 
It is outside our scope but there is fascinating work on mechanisms that 
have evolved to prevent transposable elements from spreading in the 
genome, and the ways that TEs evolve to evade those mechanisms 26. At 
the same time, there is great work on TEs that have been ���domesticated��� 
by host genomes to serve as protein domains or regulatory elements 27.
ChatGPT
This passage explains the composition and function (or lack thereof) of the majority of the human genome:
Majority Non-Coding
: While only about 1% of the genome codes for proteins and around 10% is involved in regulatory functions, a significant portion of the genome doesn���t have a known clear function.
Repetitive DNA
: About two-thirds of the genome consists of repetitive DNA, which are sequences ranging from hundreds to thousands of base pairs that are repeated multiple times. While some of these repetitive elements play a role in gene regulation, many appear not to have a direct, beneficial function for the organism.
Alu Elements
: Alu elements, which are around 300 base pairs long, are the most common repetitive elements, occurring approximately 1 million times in the genome. Remarkably, around 10% of the genome is composed of Alu elements, which is significantly more space than that occupied by genes. Alu elements are a type of transposable element (TE), which are capable of copying themselves and inserting the copies at different places in the genome.
Transposable Elements (TEs)
:
"Selfish DNA"
: Often termed ���selfish DNA���, TEs can proliferate within the genome, not necessarily providing value to the host organism. They are somewhat like ���parasites��� within the genome.
Alu Elements' History
: Alu elements first appeared in the genomes of human ancestors around 65 million years ago and have successfully multiplied since then.
Functionality
: While some TEs, including some Alu elements, have evolved to perform functions (like serving as regulatory elements or protein domains), most are inert and do not contribute to the known functions of the genome.
Control Mechanisms
: The passage also alludes to ongoing research and discoveries related to mechanisms that prevent TEs from unchecked spreading, as well as the ways TEs evolve to bypass these control mechanisms.
Domestication
: Some TEs have been ���domesticated��� by the genome, meaning they have been repurposed or co-opted over time to serve beneficial roles.
Implications and Research
: Understanding the dynamics and implications of these elements, including the ���junk��� or non-coding DNA, is crucial for comprehensive genomic research and understanding the complexities of genetic information and regulation. The passage indicates that this area is rich with fascinating and ongoing research.
Genome sizes and TEs. The genome sizes of different organisms vary 
enormously, as you can see in the table below. Notice the switch from 
measuring genomes in megabases (Mb) to gigabases (Gb) partway through 
the table. There���s about a 10,000-fold difference in genome size between 
E coli and Axolotol, even though the numbers of genes varies by less 
than a factor of 10. 
OrganismGenome SizeNumber of genes 
E. coli (bacterium)5 Mb4,000 
S. cerevisiae (yeast)12 Mb6,000 
C. elegans (nematode)101 Mb20,000 
A. thaliana (f l owering plant)135 Mb27,000 
D. melanogaster (f l y)175 Mb15,000 
human3.1 Gb20,000 
Picea abies (spruce tree)20 Gb28,000 
Axolotl (salamander)32 Gb23,000 
Table 1.1:Haploid genome sizes 
for representative organisms. No- 
tice the enormous range of genome size 
(by a factor of���104), 
while gene num- 
bers vary by less than a factor of 10. The 
largest genomes are cluttered with repeti- 
tive DNA. Gene numbers are approximate 
and are for protein-coding genes. 
Naively, one might perhaps have expected that the genome-sizes of or- 
22 
ganisms would ref l ect their complexity. While it���s true that single-celled 
organisms generally have smaller genomes and fewer genes than multi- 
celled organisms, there is no very clear pattern of genome-sizes beyond 
that. (It may not be entirely clear how to measure organismal complexity 
but, for many of us, it might hurt our feelings to be told that axolotls are 
ten-fold more complex than we are.) But actually a major determinant of 
genome-size is how active TEs have been in each evolutionary lineage.
ChatGPT
This passage provides insights into the wide disparities in genome sizes and the number of genes across different organisms:
Variations in Genome Sizes and Gene Numbers
: The passage provides a table showcasing the genome sizes and gene counts for various organisms, ranging from bacteria to humans. The genome sizes vary significantly���from 5 megabases (Mb) in E. coli to 32 gigabases (Gb) in Axolotl���while the number of genes does not show a comparable range of variation (from 4,000 in E. coli to 28,000 in Picea abies, a type of spruce tree).
Discrepancies Between Genome Size and Complexity
:
The genome size does not straightforwardly correlate with what might be perceived as an organism's complexity. For example, humans have a genome size of 3.1 Gb with approximately 20,000 genes, whereas Axolotl has a much larger genome of 32 Gb but with a similar number of genes (23,000).
While single-celled organisms generally possess smaller genomes and fewer genes, there is no clear, consistent increase in genome size as one moves to seemingly more complex, multicellular organisms.
Role of Transposable Elements (TEs)
:
A major determinant of an organism's genome size is the activity of transposable elements (TEs) within its evolutionary lineage. TEs are segments of DNA that can move around within the genome and are known to influence its size.
The passage implies that variations in genome size are significantly influenced by the extent to which TEs have been active and proliferating within a particular organism's genome over evolutionary time.
Implication
:
The passage challenges a na��ve expectation that genome size should reflect organismal complexity, highlighting that the number of genes doesn���t increase proportionally with genome size and that genome sizes vary dramatically due, in part, to the activity of TEs. These insights emphasize the complex and not fully understood relationship between genome size, gene count, and organism complexity.
The inheritance of genomes.So far we���ve been talking about genomes 
as a device for storing biological information. The next crucial feature is 
that genomes can be copied to make new cells and new individuals. 
In animals, there are two main forms of copying: mitosis, in which the 
genome of one cell is essentially copied to produce two identical genomes; 
and meiosis in which a diploid genome (two of each chromosome) is re- 
duced to haploid (one of each chromosome) to create gametes prior to 
fertilization. Figure 1.16: Human chromosomes, con- 
densed during mitosis.Credit: Steffen Dietzel. CC BY-SA 3.0

Genome copying: mitosis. Your body started from a single fertilized egg 
cell. Now that you���re reading this, your body contains some 40 trillion 
cells, each with nearly-identical copies of those original 46 chromosomes. 
For organisms to increase their number of cells ��� and to grow in size ��� 
the cells need to go through cell division. 
In cell division, a ���parent��� cell divides into two ���daughter��� cells. The 
parent cell copies each of its 46 chromosomes; then as the cell splits into 
two, each daughter cell inherits 46 chromosomes to match the genome of 
the parent. This process of i rst copying, and then correctly distributing 
the chromosomes into the daughter cells, is called mitosis (pronounced 
���my-toe-sis���) 28. 
Figure 1.17: Mitosis. For simplicity, we just show one chromosome; red and blue indicate the two versions of that chro- 
mosome carried by each cell (e.g., the chromosome that came from mum in red, and from dad in blue). The x-shaped struc- 
tures in the middle of the plot show that both the red and the blue versions have been made into pairs of identical copies; 
one red and blue copy is distributed to each daughter cell.
ChatGPT
This passage explains the process of genome copying in cells, focusing on mitosis:
Overview of Genome Copying
: Genomes carry biological information that can be copied to create new cells and individuals. Two main forms of genome copying in animals are mentioned: mitosis and meiosis.
Mitosis Process
:
Mitosis is essential for organism growth, allowing for an increase in the number of cells. It involves the division of a parent cell into two daughter cells, with the genome being copied to ensure that each daughter cell receives a nearly identical set of chromosomes as the parent.
Initially, the parent cell duplicates its chromosomes, creating two sets. As the cell divides, each daughter cell inherits one set of these duplicated chromosomes, resulting in two cells with nearly identical genomes.
The passage provides a simplified visual representation of mitosis, showing one chromosome (depicted in red and blue to indicate the different parental origins) being duplicated and then distributed to the daughter cells.
Importance of Mitosis
:
Mitosis is a crucial process allowing for the proliferation of cells in multicellular organisms, starting from a single fertilized egg cell to eventually forming an organism comprised of trillions of cells (as in the case of humans).
Visual Explanation
: Figures in the passage visually represent human chromosomes during mitosis and the mitotic process itself, helping readers visualize the chromosome duplication and distribution that occurs during cell division.
In summary, the passage provides a concise overview of mitosis, emphasizing its role in copying and distributing chromosomes during cell division to facilitate organismal growth. The explanation aids in understanding how each cell in a multicellular organism inherits a nearly identical set of chromosomes.
Genome reduction and shuff l ing: Meiosis. In contrast, we need a very 
different type of cell division to make gametes (i.e., sperm and eggs). 
23 
While ordinary cells carry 2��23 chromosomes, the gametes only carry 
1��23. 
This is so that when sperm and egg fuse, the fertilized egg have 
pairs of each chromosome like a regular cell: i.e., 2��23. 
The process of 
halving the chromosome numbers to make gametes is called meiosis 
(pronounced ���my-oh-sis���). 
Figure 1.18: Meiosis. Meiosis starts with DNA copying to make four copies of each chromosome. Next, these come to- 
gether to exchange pieces: recombination. Then, two stages of cell division result in four gametes, each with one copy of 
each chromosome. As above, we show one chromosome: red is the version of that chromosome inherited from mum, and 
blue the version from dad. In females, only one of the four resulting cells develops into an egg. 
Like mitosis, meiosis begins by doubling the amount of DNA in the cells, 
so that there are 4 copies of every chromosome. It then goes through two 
rounds of cell division to result in four gametes, each with 1 copy of each 
chromosome. 
Meiosis includes a crucial process called recombination, or crossing- 
over 29, which shuff l es segments of chromosomes between the mater- 
nal and paternal copies. In the i gure you can see that the red and blue 
chromosomes���originally red came from mum and blue from dad���have 
been shuff l ed to result in new combinations in each of the 4 gametes. 
Meiosis assigns a random 50% of the genome into each gamete. Meiosis 
is a fundamentally random process that produces a different outcome 
every time. This is in sharp contrast to mitosis, which is fully predictable: 
i.e., mitosis produces highly accurate copies of the parent cell every time. 
There are two stages of randomness in meiosis: i rst, recombination pro- 
duces a random shuff l ing of chromosomes. Later in the book we���ll come 
back to the importance of recombination. Second, the recombined chro- 
mosomes are assigned randomly to gametes. This combination of two 
levels of randomness means that every sperm or egg that you produce 
across your lifetime carries a random, and different, 50% of your genome. 
Figure 1.19: Sperm and egg fusing. 
Unknown author, Public Domain [Link]. 
Fertilization. Meiosis is used to create sperm in males, and eggs in fe- 
males. Each of the sperm and eggs now has a total of 23 chromosomes. 
Fertilization occurs when a single sperm cell inserts its 23 chromosomes 
24 
into the egg to create a fertilized egg that is back to the normal chromo- 
some number of 2��23. 
Mutation. The ultimate source of all genetic variation. We���ll discuss the 
types of mutations, mechanisms, and abundance of mutations. Genome 
replication is extraordinarily accurate, and a typical child carries only 
about 70 new single nucleotide mutations genomewide. This works out 
to an average human mutation rate of about 1.2��10���8per 
base pair per 
generation. Mutation rates are higher in males than in females, such that 
a typical child inherits about 3/4 of their new mutations from their dad.

This passage explains the process of genome reduction and shuffling through meiosis, as well as the importance of mutations:
Meiosis for Gamete Formation
:
In contrast to mitosis, which produces identical copies of cells, meiosis is a specialized form of cell division used to create gametes (sperm and eggs). Gametes carry half the number of chromosomes found in ordinary body cells to ensure that when they fuse during fertilization, the resulting fertilized egg has the correct chromosome pairs.
Meiosis is responsible for reducing the chromosome number in gametes from 2��23 (typical body cells) to 1��23.
Meiosis Process
:
Meiosis begins by doubling the amount of DNA in the cells, resulting in four copies of each chromosome.
The process involves two rounds of cell division, resulting in four gametes, each with one copy of each chromosome.
A crucial aspect of meiosis is recombination or crossing-over, which shuffles segments of chromosomes between maternal and paternal copies. This shuffling creates new combinations of genetic material in the gametes.
Randomness in Meiosis
:
Meiosis introduces randomness into the distribution of genetic material. Recombination shuffles chromosomes randomly, and the assignment of recombined chromosomes to gametes is also random.
This inherent randomness means that each sperm or egg produced during an individual's lifetime carries a unique and random 50% of their genome. Meiosis is a fundamentally random process.
Fertilization
:
After meiosis, each sperm and egg carries 23 chromosomes.
Fertilization occurs when a single sperm cell, with its 23 chromosomes, combines with an egg, also containing 23 chromosomes. This fusion restores the normal chromosome number of 2��23 in the fertilized egg.
Mutation
:
Mutations are discussed as the ultimate source of genetic variation.
Various types of mutations, mechanisms, and mutation rates are briefly mentioned.
Genome replication is highly accurate, but mutations do occur.
A typical child inherits around 70 new single nucleotide mutations genomewide, with an average human mutation rate of approximately 1.2��10^(-8) per base pair per generation.
It's noted that mutation rates are higher in males than in females, with children typically inheriting about three-quarters of their new mutations from their fathers.
This passage provides an overview of meiosis, highlighting its role in creating gametes with reduced chromosome numbers and the introduction of genetic variation through random processes. It also touches on the significance of mutations in genetic diversity.
Major data resources for human genetics.In the last part of this chap- 
ter we turn our attention to a short description of some of the key re- 
sources that are widely used in human genetics. Some combination of 
these resources were used in virtually all of the modern studies described 
in this book. 
A standard paradigm for research is that if I am interested in a specif i c 
research question X, I might collect data relating to X, but I will analyze 
my new data in the context of other existing data sets. For example, a 
project that collects any kind of human sequencing data will usually map 
the sequence reads onto the human Reference Genome, will probably 
rely on standard gene annotations, and will likely also make use of other 
more-specialized data sets. Figure 1.20:A production line for auto- 
mated sample preparation, built at the 
Whitehead Institute for use by the HGP. 
Equivalent work could now be performed on 
a single benchtop.Credit: International Human Genome 
Sequencing Consortium (2001) [Link]. Used with permission. 
In addition to these large-scale public data sets, researchers also bene- 
i t from an enormous number of smaller data sets that analyze specif i c 
samples or questions. It���s been a huge boon to science that during the 
last two decades, there has been a strong shift toward making data freely 
available without preconditions 30. This is part of a larger movement to- 
ward open science, which emphasizes the value of making all the results 
and tools of research publicly available as far as possible 31. It���s now 
widely recognized that anyone who publishes research in a scientif i c 
journal has a responsibility to make the underlying data publicly avail- 
able 32. 
The Human Reference Genome. The central data set that underlies ev- 
erything practically everything else is the human Reference Genome. For 
example, in virtually any project that involves sequencing, the i rst step 
of data analysis is usually to map reads to the Reference Genome. This 
genome sequence was the main product of the Human Genome Project 
(HGP), a huge, $3 Billion international effort that ran from 1990 to 2003, 
including teams from the US, Britain, Japan, France, Germany, and China. 
By the mid-1980s techniques for mapping and sequencing DNA had 
reached a point where a number of leading scientists started to argue 
for a ���moonshot��� type of project to sequence the human genome. Early 
on, this audacious goal was highly controversial: critics said that it would 
be purely technical and scientif i cally uninteresting; that it would divert 
money from more-focused research; that it is wasteful to sequence the 
25 
99% of the genome that is noncoding; that we wouldn���t know how to in- 
terpret the i nished sequence anyway; and that the project would con- 
tribute to misconceptions of genetic determinism 33. 
Despite the controversy, the genome project was greenlighted by the US 
Congress in 1990 g. During the early years it developed physical andg This came the year after one of the all- 
time great presidential malapropisms, when

genetic maps of the chromosomes and sequenced several much smaller 
genomes including the worm C. elegans and the l y D. melanogaster. Dur- 
ing this time frame the costs of sequencing also dropped steadily due to 
technical advances. But in 1998 a privately funded company named Cel- 
era announced a plan to beat the public project to completion using a 
different strategy, thus spurring the Human Genome Project into a much 
faster timeline 35. 
In the end, the public project and Celera battled to a negotiated draw, 
announcing simultaneous completion of draft genomes in the year 2000. 
The completion was a major international news event, and the announce- 
ment was made by US President Bill Clinton and British Prime Minis- 
ter Tony Blair in a White House ceremony [Link]. The genome was an- 
nounced complete three years later 36. Although the project was contro- 
versial at the time, modern biology could not exist in anything like its 
current form without genomes.

In this passage, the author discusses major data resources for human genetics:
Central Role of Data Resources
:
The passage emphasizes the importance of data resources in human genetics research. Researchers often collect new data while analyzing it within the context of existing datasets and resources.
Shift Towards Open Science
:
The last two decades have seen a shift towards open science, where data is made freely available without preconditions. This open approach promotes transparency and collaboration in scientific research.
The Human Reference Genome
:
The Human Reference Genome is a fundamental dataset that serves as the foundation for many genetic studies. Researchers often use it as a reference for mapping sequencing reads.
It was a result of the Human Genome Project (HGP), a massive international effort that ran from 1990 to 2003, involving teams from various countries.
History of the Human Genome Project
:
The passage briefly mentions the history of the HGP, which began as an audacious goal to sequence the entire human genome. It faced controversy and skepticism initially.
Despite the challenges and criticism, the project was approved by the US Congress in 1990. It developed genetic maps and utilized technical advances to sequence the genome.
Private company Celera also entered the competition, which accelerated the public project's timeline.
The public project and Celera announced simultaneous completion of draft genomes in 2000. The final genome was completed three years later.
Impact of the Human Genome Project
:
The completion of the Human Genome Project marked a significant milestone in genetics. The announcement was made by world leaders, including US President Bill Clinton and British Prime Minister Tony Blair.
While the project was controversial in its early stages, it has since become an indispensable resource for modern biology and genetics research.
This passage highlights the pivotal role of data resources in human genetics research and provides a brief overview of the history and impact of the Human Genome Project.
Given that everyone���s genome is unique, you might wonder what exactly 
is in the Reference Genome. In a quirk of history, the sequence is based 
on a mixture of anonymous donors who were recruited by a newspaper 
ad in Buffalo, New York, in 1997. At any given position, the reference 
genome ref l ects the sequence of a single donor; thus, at many positions, 
the Reference Genome carries rare, and sometimes even deleterious, al- 
leles 37. About 70% of the Reference Genome comes from just one of the 
Buffalo donors, denoted RP-11. Analysis of sequences from RP-11 shows 
that he had mixed African and European ancestry in roughly equal pro- 
portions. Most of the rest of the Reference Genome is derived from ten 
other donors of East Asian or European ancestry 38. Figure 1.21:Ad in the Buffalo News, 
1997. The donors for the Human Genome 
Project were recruited using this ad, 
placed in the Buffalo (NY) newspaper on 
3/23/1997, by Pieter de Jong of the Roswell 
Park Cancer Institute. 
Since the end of the Human Genome Project, a group called the Genome 
Reference Consortium has continued to update the Reference, by i x- 
ing assembly errors and providing alternate builds in certain regions 
with high levels of structural variation. You can download the genome, 
or browse specif i c regions using genome browsers at UCSC [Link] or 
Ensembl [Link]. Genomes for hundreds of other species can also be ac- 
cessed through the same websites. 
While the genome was announced complete in 2003, ���complete��� was 
used as a term of art that didn���t actually mean complete. At that time, ex- 
isting techniques were unable to span the most repetitive regions of the 
genome, including the centromeric and telomeric repeat regions, huge 
arrays of ribosomal DNA genes, and recent segmental duplications. The 
2003 genome only covered 2.8 Gb (out of about 3.1 Gb) and included an 
estimated 341 gaps. The essential problem was that these regions of the 
genome contain large blocks of highly repetitive DNA that could not be 
26 
assembled: imagine trying to assemble a jigsaw puzzle with huge repet- 
itive blocks and a mixture of many pieces randomly sampled from each 
block. During the next 15 years, even while genome sequencing became 
massively cheaper (by a factor of 105-fold), the sequence reads didn���t get 
longer and most of these regions remained untouchable. 
However, by the late 2010s, advances in ultra-long read sequencing using 
technologies developed by companies called PacBio and Oxford NanoPore 
enabled extraordinarily long reads that can bridge right across these repet- 
itive elements. Using a mixture of these technologies, the Telomere-to- 
Telomere Consortium announced the i rst fully assembled human genome 
in 2021 39. We can expect that their work will usher in a new generation 
of genome sequencing in humans and many other species. 
Functional annotation. Of course knowing the genome sequence is only 
a i rst step toward understanding the information encoded in it. Since 
the 1990s there has been a huge amount of work to identify the genes 
and regulatory elements and to understand their functions. Annotations 
showing the locations of genes and exons, and their splicing patterns, 
have been developed by two major projects: RefSeq and GENCODE. As 
we discussed above, a more challenging problem is to interpret the regu- 
latory information encoded in genomes. The main approach to this uses 
a variety of experimental assays; much of this work has been performed 
and analyzed by the ENCODE Consortium. Gene expression prof i les for 
different tissues and cell types are available from GTEx and Human Cell 
Atlas, respectively. Information about gene functions can be obtained 
from many sources, including comprehensive databases from UniProt, 
and GeneCards. 
Human genetic variation. The Reference Genome only provides a single 
DNA sequence, and thus doesn���t tell us anything about genetic variation 
across individuals. Thus, as the Human Genome Project was ending, it 
was recognized that the Genome would be much more powerful if we 
also had a good catalog of which sites in the genome are variable. 
To address this need, from 2002 to 2010, the International HapMap Con- 
sortium created cell lines from around 100 individuals each from 11 global 
populations intended to represent some of the world���s largest groups. 
Each individual was genotyped at up to about 3 million known single 
nucleotide variants across the genome. This landmark work created the 
i rst genomewide maps of genetic variation, and paved the way for a 
huge range of studies. 
Subsequently, from 2008 to 2015, the 1000 Genomes Project performed 
genome sequencing of a total of 3,200 individuals from 26 human popu- 
lations. All of the data are freely available for browsing or bulk download.

Origin of the Human Reference Genome
:
The Human Reference Genome is based on a mix of anonymous donors recruited through a newspaper ad in Buffalo, New York, in 1997. This sequence reflects the genetic makeup of these donors.
Diversity in the Reference Genome
:
The Reference Genome is derived from multiple donors, with about 70% coming from one individual (RP-11) with mixed African and European ancestry.
The rest of the Reference Genome is derived from ten other donors of East Asian or European ancestry.
Continual Updates by the Genome Reference Consortium
:
The Genome Reference Consortium has been responsible for maintaining and updating the Reference Genome. They correct assembly errors and provide alternate builds for regions with high structural variation.
Genome Browsers and Access to Genomes
:
Researchers and the public can access the genome sequence through genome browsers like UCSC and Ensembl.
These resources also provide access to genomes of hundreds of other species.
Challenges in Completing the Genome
:
The term "complete" in the context of the 2003 Human Genome Project announcement did not mean fully comprehensive.
Some regions of the genome, particularly highly repetitive areas like centromeres and telomeres, remained uncharted due to technical limitations.
Advances in Ultra-Long Read Sequencing
:
Recent advances in ultra-long read sequencing technologies, such as those by PacBio and Oxford NanoPore, have enabled the sequencing of highly repetitive regions.
The Telomere-to-Telomere Consortium achieved the first fully assembled human genome in 2021 using these technologies, which promises to revolutionize genome sequencing.
Functional Annotation and Understanding Genomes
:
Beyond sequencing, efforts have been made to annotate genes, exons, and regulatory elements in the genome.
Projects like RefSeq, GENCODE, and ENCODE have played significant roles in these annotations.
Additional resources include gene expression profiles from GTEx and Human Cell Atlas, as well as databases like UniProt and GeneCards for gene function information.
Human Genetic Variation
:
The Reference Genome provides a single DNA sequence and doesn't capture genetic variation among individuals.
Initiatives like the International HapMap Consortium and the 1000 Genomes Project aimed to create catalogs of genetic variation across populations, enabling extensive genetic studies.
This passage underscores the ongoing efforts to improve and expand our understanding of human genetics by combining the Reference Genome with genetic diversity data, functional annotations, and other valuable resources.

96 Phase 1 population from the 1000 Genomes Project 
Final release population from the 1000 Genomes Project 
A population that was collected in diaspora 
Four of these populations are often used as example populations for data 
analysis and i gures, so it���s worth remembering their sample codes: YRI 
is a group of Yoruba individuals (a west-African ethnic group) sampled 
in Ibadan, Nigeria; CEU is a group of west-European descent individuals 
sampled in Utah; CHB and JPT are Chinese Han and Japanese individu- 
als sampled from Beijing and Tokyo, respectively. 
While the 1000 Genomes is an essential resource for many purposes, it 
has poor coverage of some human populations, especially smaller indige- 
nous groups. For example, some groups including southern Africans, 
Papuans, Pacif i c Islanders, and Native Americans, are poorly covered 
by the 1000 Genomes Project. In contrast, the Human Genome Diver- 
sity Panel (HGDP) and a later extension, the Simons Genome Diversity 
Panel (SGDP), provide much broader sampling of indigenous popula- 
tions, albeit with fewer individuals 40. These panels have helped to reveal 
wonderful insights into human history that would not have been possible 
with 1000 Genomes alone; we���ll return to these especially in Part 3 of the 
book. Figure 1.23: The Simons Genome Diversity 
Project (shown here) consists of 300 genomes 
from 142 human populations. The HGDP con-

Lastly, another important study design involves cataloging genetic varia- 
tion by sequencing extremely large samples, such as gnomAD and 
TOPMed 41. 
The genotype-phenotype relationship. Our i nal category of data sets 
aim to measure the effects of genotype on phenotype. The most inf l u- 
ential of these is an extraordinary dataset collected by the UK Biobank, 
which has collected genome-wide genotypes, and a huge array of phe- 
notypic measures on about 500,000 British residents. Enrollment began 
in 2006, targeting an age range of 40���69, and continuing to track those 
individuals through middle and old age. Any qualif i ed researcher can 
go through an application process to get access to the de-identif i ed data. 
Due to the relative ease of data access, and the richness of information 
available, the UK Biobank has had a huge impactful on our understand- 
ing of human genetics. It���s not a large exaggeration to say that the UK 
28 
Biobank has managed to get all of the world���s human geneticists study- 
ing the British population. 
Other very large cohorts have replicated aspects of the UK Biobank, in- 
cluding Biobank Japan, the China Kadoorie Biobank, FinnGen, the Esto- 
nian Biobank, the Million Veteran Program and All of Us (the latter are 
both in the US). These other cohorts either have less data at present, or 
are less accessible to outside researchers than UK Biobank. There are also 
disease-specif i c projects, such as the Psychiatric Genetic Consortium, that 
aggregate case-control data for focused study of particular diseases. One 
important concern about current cohorts is that, in aggregate, individu- 
als of recent European descent are over-represented across these studies. 
This challenges human geneticists to ensure that the future benef i ts of ge- 
netic research can be shared equitably among people from all ancestries 
42. 
In this i rst chapter we have given an overview of some important background 
that will be helpful before we dive more deeply into the main areas of human ge- 
netics. We next turn to a more focused description of human genetic variation.
ChatGPT
In this section, the text discusses various resources and initiatives related to human genetics:
1000 Genomes Project
:
The 1000 Genomes Project provides a crucial reference dataset of human genomes from 26 different human populations.
Populations from the International HapMap Project are included in this dataset.
It highlights that some populations, particularly smaller indigenous groups, are not well-represented in the 1000 Genomes Project.
Example Populations
:
Four populations from the 1000 Genomes Project are often used as examples in data analysis and figures: YRI (Yoruba), CEU (Utah residents of European descent), CHB (Chinese Han), and JPT (Japanese).
Human Genome Diversity Panels
:
The Human Genome Diversity Panel (HGDP) and the Simons Genome Diversity Panel (SGDP) provide broader sampling of indigenous populations, although with fewer individuals.
These panels have contributed significant insights into human history and genetic diversity.
Large-Scale Sequencing Initiatives
:
Large-scale sequencing projects like gnomAD and TOPMed focus on cataloging genetic variation in extremely large samples.
Genotype-Phenotype Relationships
:
The UK Biobank is a significant dataset containing genome-wide genotypes and extensive phenotypic measures from around 500,000 British residents.
Other large cohorts, such as Biobank Japan, the China Kadoorie Biobank, and others, replicate aspects of the UK Biobank but may have varying accessibility to researchers.
Disease-specific projects like the Psychiatric Genetic Consortium aggregate case-control data for the study of specific diseases.
Representation in Cohorts
:
The text notes a concern that individuals of recent European descent are over-represented in current cohorts and highlights the importance of ensuring equitable representation in genetic research across all ancestries.
This information provides an overview of the diverse resources and initiatives that researchers utilize to study human genetics and its impact on various populations and phenotypes.
1.3Human genome variation and why it matters. 
In the last chapter, we discussed the standard human Reference Genome. But 
in practice everyone���s genome is unique, and differs from the Reference at 
millions of sites. Here we introduce the concept of genome variation and how it 
can change the information encoded in genomes. 
SNPs.The most abundant type of genetic variation a are SNPs (Sin- a In this chapter we���ll see many differ- 
ent types of ways that sites or regions of 
the genome can differ among individuals. 
We can refer to these genetic differences as 
variants. 
gle Nucleotide Polymorphisms, pronounced snips). These are simple se- 
quence differences that affect a single nucleotide: for example in a short 
stretch of genome your maternal chromosome might read ATCGAAGCC, 
and your paternal chromosome ATCGGAGCC. Although four nucleotides 
would be possible at any given position, the vast majority of SNPs only 
have two alleles 43: Figure 1.24: Illustration of an A/G SNP. 
A has a sample frequency of 40%. 
Allele frequency. In the i gure above, we show the genotypes for ten in- 
dividuals at an A/G SNP (i.e., a SNP where the two possible alleles are 
A and G). Since each person carries two copies of this sequence, they can 
either be AA, AG, or GG. In this examples there are 8 copies of A out of 
20: this gives a frequency of p=0.4 for A, and q=0.6 for G. 
We will often use p and q to indicate the frequencies of two alternative 
alleles, where p+q=1. 
If you���re analyzing data it���s important to be keep track of which strand 
of the DNA the SNP refers to; in the example above we would consider 
this an A/G SNP if we���re looking at one strand, but a T/C SNP on the 
other strand. This is especially tricky for transition mutations (A/T ver- 
sus T/A or C/G vs G/C as both alleles are found on both strands). SNPs 
are usually labeled with respect to the strand used in the Reference Genome, 
or occasionally with respect to the direction of translation if the focus is 
on protein-coding variation. 
Once we���ve solved the strand issue, it���s also useful to have generic ways 
of referring to alleles so that we don���t have to remember that this partic- 
ular SNP is A/G and that G is more common. When you read papers, 
you���ll see this done using one of three different naming conventions 44: 
���Reference/Alternate allele: The reference allele is the allele listed at that 
position in the Human Reference Genome. 
���Minor/Major 
allele: The minor allele is the less common allele in a pop- 
ulation (frequency<50%). MAF stands for Minor Allele Frequency. 
An Owner���s Guide to the Human Genome, by JK Pritchard. September 30, 2023. Original material distributed under a CC BY 4.0 license. 
30 
���Ancestral/Derived allele: The ancestral allele is the allele that was present 
in the common ancestor of humans (this can be inferred if one allele matches 
the nucleotide found at this position in other great apes), while the de- 
rived allele is inferred to have arisen by mutation within the human pop- 
ulation. DAF stands for Derived Allele Frequency. 
Some authors reserve the term SNP for variants where both alleles are 
fairly ���common��� ��� often def i ned as MAF>1% ��� and use the term SNV 
(single nucleotide variant) to include sites with rarer variation. But since 
the cutoff is arbitrary, here we use the term SNP throughout.
ChatGPT
In this section, the text introduces the concept of genome variation, focusing on Single Nucleotide Polymorphisms (SNPs):
SNPs (Single Nucleotide Polymorphisms)
:
SNPs are the most common type of genetic variation.
They involve single-nucleotide differences in DNA sequences, such as changing one base pair from A to G.
SNPs typically have two alleles, and individuals can be homozygous (carrying two identical alleles) or heterozygous (carrying two different alleles) for a given SNP.
Allele Frequency
:
Allele frequency refers to the proportion of a specific allele in a population.
In the example given, an A/G SNP has a frequency of p=0.4 for allele A and q=0.6 for allele G.
The sum of the allele frequencies (p + q) equals 1.
Strand Orientation
:
When analyzing SNP data, it's essential to consider the strand orientation of DNA.
SNPs are usually labeled based on the strand used in the Human Reference Genome or with respect to the direction of translation if they involve protein-coding variation.
Naming Conventions for Alleles
:
Authors use different naming conventions for alleles to simplify reference.
Common conventions include:
Reference/Alternate allele: The reference allele corresponds to the allele listed in the Human Reference Genome.
Minor/Major allele: The minor allele is the less common allele in a population (frequency < 50%).
Ancestral/Derived allele: The ancestral allele is the one present in the common ancestor of humans, while the derived allele is inferred to have arisen by mutation within the human population.
SNP vs. SNV
:
Some authors use the term "SNV" (Single Nucleotide Variant) to refer to sites with rarer variation, typically with MAF (Minor Allele Frequency) less than 1%, while "SNP" is used for more common variants. However, the cutoff is somewhat arbitrary.
This section provides a foundational understanding of SNPs and the ways in which they are named and categorized in genetic research.

Reasoning on Graphs: Faithful and Interpretable Large Language Model Reasoning
Linhao Luo, Yuan-Fang Li, Gholamreza Haffari, Shirui Pan
Large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated impressive reasoning abilities in complex tasks. However, they lack up-to-date knowledge and experience hallucinations during reasoning, which can lead to incorrect reasoning processes and diminish their performance and trustworthiness. Knowledge graphs (KGs), which capture vast amounts of facts in a structured format, offer a reliable source of knowledge for reasoning. Nevertheless, existing KG-based LLM reasoning methods only treat KGs as factual knowledge bases and overlook the importance of their structural information for reasoning. In this paper, we propose a novel method called reasoning on graphs (RoG) that synergizes LLMs with KGs to enable faithful and interpretable reasoning. Specifically, we present a planning-retrieval-reasoning framework, where RoG first generates relation paths grounded by KGs as faithful plans. These plans are then used to retrieve valid reasoning paths from the KGs for LLMs to conduct faithful reasoning. Furthermore, RoG not only distills knowledge from KGs to improve the reasoning ability of LLMs through training but also allows seamless integration with any arbitrary LLMs during inference. Extensive experiments on two benchmark KGQA datasets demonstrate that RoG achieves state-of-the-art performance on KG reasoning tasks and generates faithful and interpretable reasoning results

This research paper, titled "Reasoning on Graphs: Faithful and Interpretable Large Language Model Reasoning," addresses the limitations of Large Language Models (LLMs) in complex reasoning tasks. While LLMs excel in many areas, they often lack up-to-date knowledge and may produce incorrect results during reasoning. To address this, the paper introduces a method called "reasoning on graphs" (RoG) that combines LLMs with Knowledge Graphs (KGs) to enable more faithful and interpretable reasoning.
Key points of the paper include:
LLMs often suffer from knowledge gaps and errors during reasoning tasks.
Knowledge Graphs (KGs) provide structured knowledge, but existing methods don't fully utilize their structural information for reasoning.
RoG introduces a planning-retrieval-reasoning framework that generates relation paths from KGs to guide LLMs in reasoning tasks.
RoG also enhances LLMs' reasoning ability through training and allows seamless integration with different LLMs during inference.
Extensive experiments demonstrate that RoG achieves state-of-the-art performance in KG reasoning tasks and produces reliable and interpretable results.
In summary, this paper presents RoG as a promising approach to improving the reasoning capabilities of Large Language Models, especially in tasks involving Knowledge Graphs, by leveraging both structured knowledge and LLMs' language abilities.
1INTRODUCTION 
Large language models (LLMs) have shown great performance in many NLP tasks (Brown et al., 
2020; Bang et al., 2023). What���s especially striking is their ability to handle complex tasks through 
reasoning (Wei et al., 2022; Huang & Chang, 2023). To further unleash LLMs��� reasoning ability, the 
plan-and-solve paradigm (Wang et al., 2023c) has been proposed, in which LLMs are prompted to 
generate a plan and execute each reasoning step. In this way, LLMs decompose complex reasoning 
tasks into a series of sub-tasks and solve them step by step (Khot et al., 2022). 
Despite their success, LLMs are still limited by the lack of knowledge and prone to hallucinations 
during reasoning, which can lead to errors in reasoning processes (Hong et al., 2023; Wang et al., 
2023b). For example, as shown in Figure 1, LLMs do not have the latest knowledge and hallucinate 
an incorrect reasoning step: ���has a daughter���. These issues largely diminish the performance and 
trustworthiness of LLMs in high-stakes scenarios, such as legal judgment and medical diagnosis. 
To tackle the issues, knowledge graphs (KGs) have been incorporated to improve the reasoning 
ability of LLMs (Pan et al., 2023; Luo et al., 2023). KGs capture abundant factual knowledge in a 
structured format, which provides a faithful knowledge source for reasoning. As a typical reasoning

task, knowledge graph question answering (KGQA) aims to obtain answers based on knowledge 
from KGs (Sun et al., 2019; Hu et al., 2023). Previous works that jointly use KGs and LLMs for 
KGQA reasoning can be broadly divided into two categories: 1) semantic parsing methods (Lan 
& Jiang, 2020; Ye et al., 2022), which use LLMs to convert questions into logical queries that are 
executed on KGs to obtain answers; and 2) retrieval-augmented methods (Li et al., 2023; Pan et al., 
2022), which retrieve triples from KGs as knowledge context and uses LLMs to obtain the i nal 
answers. 
Although semantic parsing methods can generate more accurate and interpretable results by lever- 
aging reasoning on KGs, the generated logical queries can often be non-executable and yield no 
answers, due to syntax and semantic limitations (Yu et al., 2022a). Retrieval-augmented methods 
are more l exible and exploit the ability of LLMs for reasoning. However, they only treat KGs as 
factual knowledge bases and overlook the importance of their structural information for reasoning 
(Jiang et al., 2022). For instance, as shown in Figure 1, a relation path, which is a sequence of rela- 
tions, ���child of���has son��� can be used to obtain answers to the question ���Who is the brother 
of Justin Bieber?���. Therefore, it is essential to enable LLMs to directly reason on KGs to achieve 
faithful and interpretable reasoning. 
In this paper, we propose a novel method called reasoning on graphs (RoG) that synergizes LLMs 
with KGs to conduct faithful and interpretable reasoning. To address the issues of hallucinations and 
lack of knowledge, we present a planning-retrieval-reasoning framework, where RoG i rst generates 
relation paths grounded by KGs as faithful plans via the planning module. These plans are then used 
to retrieve valid reasoning paths from KGs to conduct faithful reasoning by the retrieval-reasoning 
module. In this way, we not only retrieve the latest knowledge from KGs but also consider the 
guidance of KG structure for reasoning and explanations. Moreover, the planning module of RoG 
can be plug-and-play with different LLMs during inference to improve their performance. Based on 
this framework, RoG is optimized by two tasks: 1) planning optimization, where we distill knowl- 
edge from KGs into LLMs to generate faithful relation paths as plans; and 2) retrieval-reasoning 
optimization, where we enable LLMs to conduct faithful reasoning based on retrieved paths and gen- 
erate interpretable results. We conduct extensive experiments on two benchmark KGQA datasets, 
and the results demonstrate that RoG achieves state-of-the-art performance on KG reasoning tasks 
and generates faithful and interpretable reasoning results.

This paper focuses on improving the reasoning abilities of Large Language Models (LLMs) by addressing issues such as lack of knowledge and hallucinations during reasoning. LLMs have shown impressive performance in various Natural Language Processing (NLP) tasks, including complex reasoning tasks. However, these models can make errors due to outdated information and incorrect reasoning steps.
To enhance LLMs' reasoning, the paper proposes a method called "reasoning on graphs" (RoG) that combines LLMs with Knowledge Graphs (KGs). KGs store structured factual knowledge, which can serve as a reliable source for reasoning. RoG introduces a planning-retrieval-reasoning framework, where it generates relation paths grounded in KGs as faithful plans. These plans guide the retrieval of valid reasoning paths from KGs, enabling LLMs to conduct more faithful and interpretable reasoning.
Key points and contributions of RoG include:
Addressing the limitations of LLMs, such as outdated knowledge and hallucinations during reasoning.
Leveraging KGs to improve the reliability of LLMs in reasoning tasks.
Introducing a planning module that generates relation paths as plans.
Retrieving reasoning paths from KGs based on the plans to guide LLMs' reasoning.
Optimization tasks for planning and retrieval-reasoning to enhance LLMs' performance and generate interpretable results.
The experimental results on KGQA datasets demonstrate that RoG achieves state-of-the-art performance in KG reasoning tasks, making it a promising approach for enhancing the reasoning capabilities of LLMs in various applications.
2RELATEDWORK 
LLM Reasoning Prompt. Many studies have been proposed to harness the reasoning ability of 
LLMs to handle complex tasks through prompting (Wei et al., 2022; Wang et al., 2022; Yao et al., 
2023; Besta et al., 2023). Plan-and-solve (Wang et al., 2023c) prompts LLMs to generate a plan and 
conduct reasoning based on it. DecomP (He et al., 2021) prompts LLMs to decompose the reasoning 
task into a series of sub-tasks and solve them step by step. However, the problem of hallucinations 
and lack of knowledge affect the faithfulness of LLMs��� reasoning. ReACT (Yao et al., 2022) treats 
LLMs as agents, which interact with the environment to get the latest knowledge for reasoning. 
To explore faithful reasoning, FAME (Hong et al., 2023) introduces the Monte-Carlo planning to 
2 
generate faithful reasoning steps. RR (He et al., 2022) and KD-CoT Wang et al. (2023b) further 
retrieve relevant knowledge from KGs to produce faithful reasoning plans for LLMs. 
Knowledge Graph Question Answering (KGQA). Conventional embedding-based methods rep- 
resent the entities and relations in embedding space and design special model architectures (e.g., 
Key-Value memory networks, sequential models, and graph neural networks) to reason answers 
(Miller et al., 2016; He et al., 2021; Yasunaga et al., 2021). To integrate LLMs for KGQA, retrieval- 
augmented methods aim to retrieve the relative facts from the KGs to improve the reasoning per- 
formance (Li et al., 2023; Karpukhin et al., 2020). Recently, UniKGQA (Jiang et al., 2022) which 
unif i esthe graphretrieval andreasoning processinto asinglemodel withLLMs, achievesSTOA per- 
formance. Semantic parsing methods convert the question into a structural query (e.g., SPARQL) 
by LLMs, which can be executed by a query engine to reason the answers on KGs (Sun et al., 2020; 
Lan & Jiang, 2020). However, these methods heavily rely on the quality of generated queries. If the 
query is not executable, no answers will be generated. DECAF (Yu et al., 2022a) combines semantic 
parsing and LLMs reasoning to jointly generate answers, which also reach salient performance on 
KGQA tasks. 
3PRELIMINARY 
Knowledge Graphs (KGs) contain abundant factual knowledge in the form of a set of triples: G = 
{(e,r,e���)|e,e������ E,r ��� R}, where E and R denote the set of entities and relations, respectively. 
Relation Paths are a sequence of relations: z = {r1,r2,...,rl}, where ri��� R denotes the i-th 
relation in the path and l denotes the length of the path. 
Reasoning Paths are the instances of a relation path z in KGs: wz= e0 
r1 
��� ��� e1 
r2 
��� ��� ... 
rl 
��� ��� el, 
where ei��� E denotes the i-th entity and ridenotes 
the i-th relation in the relation path z. 
Example 1. Given a relation path: z = marry to ��� father of, a reasoning path instance 
could be: wz= Alice 
marry to 
��� ��� ��� ��� ��� ��� ��� Bob 
father of 
��� ��� ��� ��� ��� ��� ��� Charlie, which denotes ���Alice��� is married to 
���Bob��� and ���Bob��� is the father of ���Charlie���. 
Knowledge Graph Question Answering (KGQA) is a typical reasoning task based on KGs. Given 
a natural language question q and a KG G, the task aims to design a function f to predict answers 
a ��� Aqbased on knowledge from G, i.e., a = f(q,G). Following previous works (Sun et al., 2019; 
Jiang et al., 2022), we assume the entities eq��� Tqmentioned in q and answers a ��� Aqare 
labeled 
and linked to the corresponding entities in G, i.e., Tq,Aq��� E.

I know it might seem unrelated, but any connections to our earlier discussion on the human genome and genetics?
ChatGPT
While the discussion on the human genome and genetics is distinct from the topic of large language models and knowledge graphs, there is a potential connection between the two fields. Here's how they might relate:
Data Integration:
In both genetics and natural language processing (NLP), there is a growing interest in integrating diverse datasets. In genetics, researchers integrate various genomic data sources to better understand human genetic variation. In NLP, knowledge graphs are used to integrate information from different domains, including genetics, to enhance language models' understanding of complex topics.
Interdisciplinary Research:
Both genetics and NLP are interdisciplinary fields. Geneticists often collaborate with computational biologists and data scientists to analyze and interpret genomic data. Similarly, in NLP, researchers may collaborate with experts in specific domains, such as genetics, to improve the performance of language models in understanding and generating text related to genetic research.
Knowledge Transfer:
Knowledge graphs, which play a role in the RoG method discussed earlier, can be used to store structured information, including genetic knowledge. This knowledge can then be leveraged to enhance language models' understanding of genetics-related questions and texts.
Scientific Communication:
Language models trained on a wide range of scientific literature, including genetics research papers, can assist researchers in summarizing and understanding complex genetic findings. This can facilitate communication and knowledge dissemination in the field of genetics.
While these connections exist, it's important to note that the fields of genetics and NLP are quite specialized, and researchers in each domain typically focus on their own unique challenges and methodologies. Nonetheless, interdisciplinary collaborations and advancements in NLP techniques can contribute to better understanding and communicating genetic research findings.
I wound say that they both rely on conceptual blending of category and perhaps the connotations of words as directions in vector possibility space and the inhibitory and activation effect on genes might be like the sentiment analysis of connections to the connotations of other words in vector spaces like word2vec
ChatGPT
Your observation about the conceptual blending of categories and the potential parallels between linguistic vector spaces (such as Word2Vec) and genetic interactions is intriguing. Let's explore this idea further:
Conceptual Blending:
In both genetics and natural language processing, conceptual blending plays a crucial role. In genetics, researchers often blend various genetic concepts, such as genes, alleles, and pathways, to understand how they interact and influence traits. Similarly, in NLP, language models blend semantic concepts to comprehend and generate human language. Both fields involve abstracting and combining concepts to derive meaning or insights.
Vector Spaces:
Word2Vec and related word embedding models map words or phrases into high-dimensional vector spaces. These vector spaces capture semantic relationships between words based on their co-occurrence patterns in large corpora. In genetics, you can draw a parallel by considering the concept of gene expression profiles. Genes and their interactions can be represented as vectors, and the relationships between genes can be explored in a multidimensional space. Analyzing these vectors can reveal how genes interact and influence biological processes.
Sentiment Analysis vs. Genetic Regulation:
Sentiment analysis in NLP aims to understand the sentiment or emotion associated with a piece of text. Similarly, the concept of "activation" and "inhibition" in genetics relates to how genes regulate one another's expression. You can draw an analogy where the sentiment analysis of words in vector spaces resembles the analysis of how genes activate or inhibit each other in a genetic regulatory network.
Network Analysis:
Network analysis techniques are used in both fields. In NLP, you have semantic networks representing word relationships. In genetics, you have gene regulatory networks or protein-protein interaction networks. Analyzing these networks involves understanding how nodes (words or genes) are connected and how information flows through the network.
Overall, your comparison highlights the potential for interdisciplinary insights by drawing parallels between genetic interactions and linguistic vector spaces. While these fields have different goals and methodologies, there are common principles related to information processing, abstraction, and network analysis that can lead to cross-disciplinary insights and applications.
4.1REASONING ONGRAPHS: PLANNING-RETRIEVAL-REASONING 
Recently, many techniques have been explored to improve the reasoning ability of LLMs by plan- 
ning, which i rst prompts LLMs to generate a reasoning plan and then conduct reasoning based on it 
(Wang et al., 2023c). However, LLMs are known for having hallucination issues, which are prone to 
generating incorrect plans and leading to wrong answers (Ji et al., 2023). To address this issue, we 
present a novel planning-retrieval-reasoning framework, which makes the reasoning plans grounded 
by KGs and then retrieves faithful reasoning paths for LLM reasoning. 
Relation paths, which capture semantic relations between entities, have been utilized in many rea- 
soning tasks on KGs (Wang et al., 2021; Xu et al., 2022). Moreover, compared to the dynamically 
updated entities, the relations in KGs are more stable (Wang et al., 2023a). By using relation paths, 
we can always retrieve the latest knowledge from KGs for reasoning. Therefore, relation paths can 
serve as faithful plans for reasoning the answer to KGQA task.

plan: z = marry to ��� father of. This relation path expresses the plan: 1) i nd the person that

Figure 2: The overall framework of reasoning on graphs (RoG). 1) given a question, we i rst prompt 
LLMs to generate several relation paths that are grounded by KGs as plans. 2) Then, we retrieve 
reasoning paths from KGs using the plans. 3) Finally, we conduct faithful reasoning based on the 
retrieved reasoning paths and generate answers with interpretable explanations. The orange and red 
rectangles denote the entities mentioned in the question and answer, respectively. 
���Alice��� is married to; 2) i nd the child of that person. We can execute the plan (relation path) by 
retrieving a reasoning path from KGs as: wz= Alice 
marry to 
��� ��� ��� ��� ��� ��� ��� Bob 
father of 
��� ��� ��� ��� ��� ��� ��� Charlie. Finally, 
we can answer the question based on the reasoning path, which is ���Charlie���. 
By treating relation paths as plans, we can make sure the plans are grounded by KGs, which enables 
LLMs to conduct faithful and interpretable reasoning on graphs. In a nutshell, we formulate our 
RoG as an optimization problem that aims to maximize the probability of reasoning the answer from 
a knowledge graph G w.r.t the question q by generating relation paths z as the plan: 
P��(a|q,G) = X 
z���Z P��(a|q,z,G)P��(z|q),(1) 
where �� denotes the parameters of LLMs, z denotes the relation paths (plans) generated by LLMs, 
and Z denotes the set of possible relation paths. The latter term P��(z|q) is the probability of gen- 
erating a faithful relation path z grounded by KG, given the question q, which is realized by the 
planning module. The former term P��(a|q,z,G) is the probability of reasoning an answer a given 
the question q, relation path z, and KG G, which is computed by the retrieval-reasoning module.

The concept of "faithful plans" in the RoG framework, where relation paths are generated and grounded by knowledge graphs (KGs) to enable faithful reasoning, can be related to certain aspects of genetics and genomics:
Genomic Pathways:
In genetics, researchers often study biological pathways, which are sequences of molecular interactions that play a role in various cellular processes. These pathways are akin to "relation paths" in the RoG framework, as they represent a series of interactions between genes, proteins, and other molecules. These pathways serve as plans for understanding how specific biological processes are executed.
Interactions in Genomic Networks:
Genes, proteins, and other biomolecules interact with each other in intricate ways within the cell. These interactions can be thought of as a network, where nodes represent genes or proteins, and edges represent interactions. The "faithful plans" generated by RoG can be compared to understanding how genes interact within such networks to execute specific biological functions.
Knowledge Integration:
Just as RoG aims to integrate knowledge from KGs for reasoning, geneticists also integrate data from various sources, including genomics databases, experimental results, and literature. This integration is crucial to ensure that the plans or pathways used for genetic analysis are grounded in the latest knowledge and are faithful representations of biological processes.
Inference and Interpretation:
In both RoG and genetics, the ultimate goal is to infer meaningful insights or answers. RoG aims to answer questions based on relation paths, while geneticists seek to understand the biological implications of specific gene interactions or mutations. Both fields require interpreting complex information to derive conclusions.
While RoG focuses on natural language understanding and reasoning using KGs, drawing parallels to genetic research highlights the broader concept of knowledge integration, pathway analysis, and reasoning with complex biological data. These parallels emphasize the importance of structured data and plans in both fields to enable accurate and interpretable reasoning.
4.2OPTIMIZATIONFRAMEWORK 
Despite the advantage of generating relation paths as plans, the LLMs have zero knowledge of the 
relations contained in KGs. Therefore, LLMs cannot directly generate relation paths grounded by 
KGs as faithful plans. Moreover, LLMs might not understand the reasoning paths correctly and 
conduct reasoning based on them. To address these issues, we design two instruction tuning tasks: 
1) planning optimization, which distills the knowledge from KGs into LLMs to generate faithful 
relation paths as plans; 2) retrieval-reasoning optimization, which enables LLMs to reason based on 
the retrieved reasoning paths. 
The objective function in equation 1 can be optimized by maximizing the evidence lower bound 
(ELBO) (Jordan et al., 1999), which is formulated as 
logP(a|q,G) ��� Ez���Q(z)[logP��(a|q,z,G)] ��� DKL(Q(z)���P��(z|q)),(2) 
4 
where Q(z) denotes the posterior distribution of faithful relation paths grounded by KGs. The 
latter term minimizes the KL divergence between the posterior and the prior, which encourages 
LLMs to generate faithful relation paths (planning optimization). The former term maximizes the 
expectation that retrieval-reasoning module generates correct answers based on the relation paths 
and KGs (retrieval-reasoning optimization). 
Planning optimization. In planning optimization, we aim to distill the knowledge from KGs into 
LLMs to generate faithful relation paths as plans. This can be achieved by minimizing the KL 
divergence with the posterior distribution of faithful relation paths Q(z), which can be approximated 
by the valid relation paths in KGs. 
Given a question q and answer a, we could i nd the path instances wz(eq,ea) = eq 
r1 
��� ��� e1 
r2 
��� ��� 
... 
rl 
��� ��� eaconnecting eqand eain KGs. The corresponding relation path z = {r1,r2,...,rl} can 
be considered valid and serve as a faithful plan for answering the question q. Therefore, the posterior 
distribution Q(z) can be formally approximated as 
Q(z) ��� Q(z|a,q,G) = ?1,���w 
z(eq,ea) ��� G, 
0,else. (3) 
where ���wz(eq,ea) ��� G denote the existence of a path instance connecting the question eqand 
answer eaentities in G. To reduce the number of valid relation paths, we only consider the shortest 
paths between eqand eain KGs (Zhang et al., 2022). Therefore, the KL divergence can be calculated 
as Lplan= DKL(Q(z)���P��(z|q)) = DKL(Q(z|a,q,G)���P��(z|q)) 
= Ez���Q(z|a,q,G)Q(z|a,q,G)[logQ(z|a,q,G) ��� logP��(z|q)] 
= ���Ez���Q(z|a,q,G)Q(z|a,q,G)logP��(z|q) + CONST 
= ��� X 
z���Q(z|a,q,G) logP��(z|q). 
(4) 
By optimizing the equation 4, we maximize the probability of LLMs generating faithful relation 
paths through distilling the knowledge from KGs. 
Retrieval-reasoning optimization. In retrieval-reasoning optimization, we aim to enable LLMs to 
conduct reasoning based on the retrieved reasoning paths. For the retrieval-reasoning module, we 
follow the FiD framework (Izacard & Grave, 2021), which allows reasoning on multiple retrieved 
reasoning paths, formulated as P��(a|q,Z,G) = Y 
z���Z P��(a|q,z,G).(5) 
By approximating the expectation with K sampled plans ZK, 
the objective function of reasoning 
optimization can be written as 
Lreason= Ez���Q(z|a,q,G)[logP��(a|q,z,G)] = logP��(a|q,ZK,G).(6)

The i nal objective function of RoG is the combination of the planning optimization and retrieval-

From equation 7, we can see that we adopt the same LLM for both planning and reasoning, which 
are jointly trained on two instruction-tuning tasks, i.e., (planning and retrieval-reasoning). We will 
discuss the implementation details of these two tasks in the following subsections.
ChatGPT
The optimization framework of RoG, particularly the two instruction tuning tasks (planning optimization and retrieval-reasoning optimization), can be conceptually linked to aspects of genetics and genomics:
Planning Optimization (Distilling Knowledge):
In genetics, researchers often seek to distill knowledge from vast datasets and biological networks to generate meaningful hypotheses and plans for further study. This process can be likened to RoG's planning optimization, where knowledge from KGs is distilled into LLMs to generate faithful relation paths as plans. In genetics, this might involve distilling information from genomic databases and research literature to create pathways or hypotheses for gene function or disease mechanisms.
Retrieval-Reasoning Optimization (Reasoning Based on Retrieved Paths):
Geneticists frequently rely on retrieval and reasoning processes to interpret complex genomic data. For example, they may retrieve sequences, pathways, or known associations from databases and then reason about how these elements relate to a specific genetic question or disease phenotype. The retrieval-reasoning optimization in RoG aligns with this process, where LLMs aim to generate correct answers based on the retrieved reasoning paths. In genetics, this corresponds to the process of deriving insights and conclusions from retrieved biological data.
Integration of Knowledge for Inference:
Both RoG and genetic research emphasize the importance of integrating diverse sources of knowledge. RoG combines KGs and language understanding to perform inference, while geneticists integrate data from various sources, such as genomic databases, experimental results, and literature, to draw meaningful conclusions about genes, mutations, and biological processes.
Joint Training:
RoG trains LLMs on two instruction-tuning tasks, planning, and retrieval-reasoning, which are jointly optimized to improve reasoning. In genetics, researchers often engage in joint analyses of multiple data types (genomic, transcriptomic, proteomic, etc.) to gain a comprehensive understanding of biological systems and processes.
While the contexts are different, the optimization framework of RoG shares some conceptual similarities with the processes used in genetics and genomics research. Both fields aim to distill knowledge, reason based on retrieved information, integrate diverse data sources, and perform joint analyses to draw meaningful insights. These parallels highlight the importance of structured data and reasoning in complex research domains.
4.3PLANNINGMODULE 
The planning module aims to generate faithful relation paths as plans for answering the question. To 
utilize the instruction-following ability of LLMs (Wei et al., 2021), we design a simple instruction 
template that prompts LLMs to generate relation paths: 
Planning Prompt Template 
Please generate a valid relation path that can be helpful for answering the following question: 
<Question> 
where <Question> indicates the question q. The question together with the instruction template 
is fed into LLMs to generate the relation paths, which are structurally formatted as a sentence: 
z = <PATH> r1<SEP> r2<SEP> ... <SEP> rl</PATH> 
where <PATH>, <SEP>, </PATH> are special tokens indicating the start, separator, and end of the 
relation path, respectively2. 
Therefore, the optimization of Lplancan 
be achieved as 
argmax 
�� X 
z���Q(z|a,q,G) 
logP��(z|q) = X 
z���Q(z|a,q,G) 
log 
|z| Y 
i=1 P��(ri|r<i,q),(8) 
where P��(z|q) denotes the prior distribution of generating faithful relation path z, and P��(ri|r<i,q) 
denotes the probability of each token in z generated by LLMs. 
4.4RETRIEVAL-REASONINGMODULE 
Retrieval. Given a question q and a relation path as plan z, the retrieval module aims to retrieve the 
reasoning paths wzfrom KG G. The retrieval process can be conducted by i nding paths in G that 
start from the question entities eqand follow the relation paths z, formulated as 
Wz= {wz(eq,e���)|wz(eq,e���) 
= eq 
r1 
��� ��� e1 
r2 
��� ��� ... 
rl 
��� ��� ea���,wz(eq,e���) ��� G}.(9) 
We adopt a constrained breadth-f i rst search to retrieve the reasoning paths wzfrom KGs. In exper- 
iments, all retrieved paths are used for reasoning. The detailed retrieval algorithm can be found in 
Appendix A.2. 
Despite we can utilize the retrieved reasoning paths and directly get the answers with majority 
voting. The retrieved reasoning paths could be noisy and irrelevant to the questions, which leads to 
incorrect answers (He et al., 2021; Zhang et al., 2022). Therefore, we propose a reasoning module 
to explore the ability of LLMs to identify the important reasoning paths and answer the questions 
based on them. 
Reasoning. The reasoning module takes the question q and a set of reasoning paths Wzto 
generate 
answers a. Similarly, we design a reasoning instruction prompt to guide LLMs to conduct reasoning 
based on the retrieved reasoning paths Wz: 
Reasoning Prompt Template 
Based on the reasoning paths, please answer the given question. Please keep the answer as simple as 
possible and return all the possible answers as a list. 
Reasoning Paths: 
<Reasoning Paths> 
Question: 
<Question> 
2The relation name r��� could be split into multiple tokens. For example, ���born in��� could be split into 
���born��� and ��� in��� by tokenizer. In this way, we could fully utilize the semantic information in relation names 
and generalize to different KGs. 6 
where <Reasoning Paths> denotes the retrieved reasoning paths Wzwhich 
are also formatted 
as a series of structural sentences. The detailed of prompts can be found in Appendix A.9.

ChatGPT
RoG's planning and retrieval-reasoning modules can be analogously related to aspects of genetics and genomics:
Planning Module (Generating Hypotheses):
In genetics, scientists often generate hypotheses or plans for experiments based on existing knowledge and data. This can be compared to RoG's planning module, where LLMs generate relation paths as plans for answering questions. Geneticists generate hypotheses based on known relationships between genes, proteins, and pathways, similar to how RoG generates relation paths from knowledge graphs.
Retrieval Module (Data Retrieval):
Retrieval of data from genetic databases and repositories is a common task in genetics and genomics. Geneticists retrieve sequences, gene expressions, and other data relevant to their research questions. In RoG, the retrieval module retrieves reasoning paths from knowledge graphs, which can be likened to the retrieval of genetic data for analysis.
Reasoning Module (Interpreting Data):
Geneticists engage in data interpretation and reasoning to draw conclusions about the genetic basis of diseases or biological processes. RoG's reasoning module, guided by retrieved reasoning paths, parallels this process by allowing LLMs to reason based on the retrieved information to generate answers. Both involve interpreting data to arrive at meaningful conclusions.
Instruction-Based Guidance:
RoG uses instruction prompts to guide LLMs in generating relation paths and reasoning based on retrieved paths. Similarly, genetic research often involves following established protocols and guidelines to conduct experiments or analyses. Instructions provide guidance in both RoG and genetic research to ensure correct procedures are followed.
Optimization:
RoG optimizes LLMs' performance by jointly training them on planning and retrieval-reasoning tasks. Similarly, genetic researchers continually optimize their experimental protocols and analytical approaches to improve the accuracy and reliability of their findings.
While the specifics differ, the general concepts of generating hypotheses, retrieving data, conducting reasoning, following instructions, and optimizing performance are relevant in both RoG's optimization framework and genetics research. These connections highlight the importance of structured reasoning and data interpretation in both domains.
5EXPERIMENT 
In our experiments, we aim to answer the following research questions: 
��� RQ1: Can RoG achieve state-of-the-art performance on the KGQA tasks? 
��� RQ2: Can the planning module of RoG be integrated with other LLMs to improve their 
performance? 
��� RQ3: Can RoG be i netuned and effectively transferred to other knowledge graphs? 
��� RQ4: Can RoG conduct faithful reasoning and generate interpretable reasoning results? 
5.1EXPERIMENTSETTINGS 
Datasets.We evaluate the reasoning ability of RoG on two benchmark KGQA datasets: 
Table 1: Statistics of datasets. 
Datasets#Train#TestMax #hop 
WebQSP2,8261,6282 
CWQ27,6393,5314 
WebQuestionSP (WebQSP) (Yih et al., 2016) and Com- 
plex WebQuestions (CWQ) (Talmor & Berant, 2018), 
which contain up to 4-hop questions.The statistic of 
the datasets are given in Table 1. Freebase (Bollacker 
et al., 2008) is the background knowledge graph for both 
datasets, which contains around 88 million entities, 20 
thousand relations, and 126 million triples. The details of 
the datasets are described in Appendix A.3. 
Baselines.We compare RoG with 21 baselines grouping into 5 categories:1) Embedding- 
based methods, 2) Retrieval-augmented methods, 3) Semantic parsing methods, 4) LLMs, and 5) 
LLMs+KGs methods. The details of each baseline are described in Appendix A.4. 
Evaluation Metrics. Following previous works, we use Hits@1 and F1 as the evaluation metrics. 
Hits@1 measures the proportion of questions whose top-1 predicted answer is correct. Since a 
question may correspond to multiple answers, F1 considers the coverage of all answers, which 
balances the precision and recall of the predicted answers. 
Implementations. ForRoG,weuseLLaMA2-Chat-7B(Touvronetal.,2023)astheLLMbackbone, 
which is instruction i netuned on the training split of WebQSP and CWQ as well as Freebase for 3 
epochs. We generate the top-3 relation paths using beam-search for each question. Since UniKGQA 
(Jiang et al., 2022) and DECAF (Yu et al., 2022a) are state-of-the-art methods, we directly refer their 
results and those of the other baselines reported in their papers for comparisons. For LLMs, we use 
zero-shot prompting to conduct KGQA. The detailed settings are described in Appendix A.5. 
5.2RQ1: KGQA PERFORMANCECOMPARISON 
Main Results. In this section, we compare RoG with other baselines on KGQA tasks. The results 
are shown in Table 2. Our method achieves the best performance on both datasets across most 
metrics. Specif i cally, compared to the SOTA method DECAF (Yu et al., 2022a) on WebQSP, our 
method improves Hits@1 by 4.4%. On the CWQ dataset, which is more challenging due to multi- 
hop questions, our method improves both Hits@1 and F1 by 22.3% and 14.4% against the SOTA 
model UniKGQA (Jiang et al., 2022). These results demonstrate the superior reasoning ability of 
our method in KGQA. 7

ChatGPT
Here are the key findings from the experiments evaluating RoG on KGQA tasks:
State-of-the-Art Performance:
RoG achieves state-of-the-art performance on both KGQA datasets (WebQSP and CWQ). It outperforms other baselines, including recent state-of-the-art models such as DECAF and UniKGQA, by a significant margin. For example, on the CWQ dataset, RoG improves Hits@1 by 22.3% and F1 by 14.4% compared to UniKGQA, demonstrating its superior reasoning ability.
Multihop Question Handling:
RoG performs exceptionally well on the CWQ dataset, which contains multi-hop questions. This indicates that RoG is effective at handling complex questions that require reasoning over multiple steps within the knowledge graph.
Category-Based Performance Comparison:
The baselines are categorized into Embedding-based methods, Retrieval-augmented methods, Semantic parsing methods, LLMs, and LLMs+KGs methods. RoG consistently outperforms all categories of baselines, highlighting its effectiveness across various KGQA approaches.
These results suggest that RoG's planning-retrieval-reasoning framework, which leverages relation paths and knowledge graphs, enables it to conduct faithful and interpretable reasoning, leading to superior performance on KGQA tasks.
Furthermore, using random plans achieves worse performance than removing the planning module, 
highlighting the importance of a planning module who generates faithful reasoning plans. Using 
a simple majority vote reasoning can improve the results which also demonstrate the necessity of 
reasoning module. 
5.3RQ2: PLUG-AND-PLAYROG PLANNINGMODULE 
In this section, we evaluate the effectiveness of integrating the planning module of RoG with differ- 
ent LLMs during inference to improve their performance. Specif i cally, we i rst adopt the planning 
module of RoG to generate relation paths and feed the retrieved reasoning paths as context into dif- 
ferent LLMs for reasoning. The results are presented in Table 4. To account for the fact that it is 
diff i cult to extract the number of answers from LLM���s output. We only report the Hits@1 and Recall 
metrics. 
From the results, we can notice that the performance of all LLMs is substantially improved by 
integrating the planning module of RoG. Specif i cally, the Hits@1 of ChatGPT, Alpaca, LLaMA2, 
and Flan-T5 are improved by 8.5%, 15.3%, and 119.3%, respectively. This demonstrates that the 
planningmoduleofRoGcanbeseamlesslyintegratedwithotherLLMstoimprovetheirperformance 
without retraining. 
5.4RQ3: TRANSFERABILITY TOOTHERKGS 
We also evaluate the transferability of RoG to other KGs. We select the MetaQA-3hop dataset 
(Zhang et al., 2018) which is based on Wiki-Movies KGs3. We select 1000 samples from the training 
split and utilize two training strategies to i netune RoG: 1) training from scratch, where we directly 
optimize RoG with 1000 samples; 2) transfer from Freebase, where we conduct a further i netuning 
based on RoG trained for Freebase. The results are shown in Table 5. From results, we can see that

QuestionWhat type of government is used in the country with Northern District? 
AnswerParliamentary system 
ChatGPT + CoTTo determine what type of government is used in a country with a Northern District, we 
need more specif i c information. The term ���Northern District��� does not specify the name 
of any particular country or provide enough context to identify its government type. Could 
you please provide additional details or clarify the specif i c country you are referring to? 
Reasoning PathsNorthern District ��� location.administrative division.f i rst level division of ��� Israel ���

RoG 
The type of government used in the country with the Northern District is a Parliamentary 
system. 
Explanations: 
1. Northern District ��� location.administrative division.f i rst level division of ��� Israel: 
The Northern District is a part of Israel. 
2. Israel ��� government.form of government.countries ��� Parliamentary system: Israel has 
a Parliamentary system of government. 
So, by following the reasoning paths provided, we can conclude that the country with the 
Northern District, which is Israel, uses a Parliamentary system of government. 
transfer from Freebase achieves better performance than training from scratch, which demonstrates 
the transferability of RoG to other KGs. 
5.5RQ4: FAITHFUL REASONING AND INTERPRETABLE RESULTS 
Quantitative Results. To evaluate the faithfulness of the relation paths, we illustrate the quantita- 
tive results in Figure 3. In experiments, we sweep the number of top-K relation paths generated 
by RoG. From results, we can see that the number of retrieved reasoning paths increases with K, 
which also leads to more answers to be covered (recall). This demonstrates the faithfulness of the 
relation paths by retrieving the answers. However, more retrieved reasoning paths also lead to more 
noise and retrieval time (shown in Appendix A.6.1), which decreases the precision and makes little 
contribution to the i nal results (reasoning-f1). Therefore, we set K = 3 in experiments.
ChatGPT
Here are the findings from the experiments for Research Questions 2, 3, and 4:
RQ2: Plug-and-Play RoG Planning Module
Integrating the planning module of RoG with different LLMs during inference substantially improves the performance of all LLMs.
For ChatGPT, Alpaca, LLaMA2, and Flan-T5, the Hits@1 metric is improved by 8.5%, 15.3%, and 119.3%, respectively, demonstrating the ability of RoG's planning module to enhance LLMs' performance without retraining.
RQ3: Transferability to Other KGs
RoG's transferability to other knowledge graphs is evaluated using the MetaQA-3hop dataset based on Wiki-Movies KGs.
RoG is effective in transferring knowledge from Freebase to Wiki-Movies KGs. Training from scratch on Wiki-Movies yields lower performance compared to transfer learning from Freebase, demonstrating RoG's capability to adapt to different KGs through transfer learning.
RQ4: Faithful Reasoning and Interpretable Results
The faithfulness of relation paths generated by RoG is illustrated quantitatively.
The number of retrieved reasoning paths increases with K (the number of top-K relation paths generated by RoG), leading to improved recall and faithfulness of relation paths.
However, increasing K also introduces more noise and retrieval time, reducing precision and having a limited contribution to the final results. K is set to 3 in experiments to balance recall and precision.
These results demonstrate the effectiveness and flexibility of RoG, not only in improving LLMs' performance but also in its ability to transfer knowledge to different knowledge graphs while maintaining faithful and interpretable reasoning paths.
Case studies. We also illustrate two case studies in Table 6 and Table 7. In Table 6, we can 
i nd that ChatGPT+CoT suffers from the lack of knowledge issue and cannot answer the question.

The reasoning path leads us to the St. Louis Cardinals as the team that won the 1946 
World Series, and Busch Stadium is the stadium associated with the St. Louis Cardinals. 
Therefore, Busch Stadium is the home stadium of the team that won the 1946 World Series 
championship. 
On the contrary, RoG can generate faithful relation paths and retrieve valid reasoning paths from 
KGs for reasoning. Besides, RoG can provide interpretable explanations based on the reasoning 
paths. In Table 7, we can see that ChatGPT+CoT suffers from hallucinations and generates incorrect 
answers. In contrast, although the retrieved reasoning paths contain noises, the reasoning module 
can identify the correct reasoning paths and conduct faithful reasoning. These results demonstrate 
the effectiveness of RoG in conducting faithful reasoning and generating interpretable results. More 
cases can be found in Appendices A.7 and A.8. 
6CONCLUSION 
In this paper, we propose a novel method called reasoning on graphs (RoG) that synergizes LLMs 
with KGs to conduct faithful and interpretable reasoning. To address the issues of hallucinations 
and lack of knowledge, we present a planning-retrieval-reasoning framework, which allows LLMs 
to access the latest knowledge while reasoning based on faithful plans on graphs. RoG not only en- 
hances the reasoning capability of LLMs by distilling knowledge from KGs through training but also 
enables seamless integration with any LLMs during inference. Extensive experiments on two bench- 
mark KGQA datasets demonstrate the superiority of RoG in reasoning ability and interpretability.
ChatGPT
In the case studies provided in Table 6 and Table 7, RoG demonstrates its ability to conduct faithful reasoning and generate interpretable results compared to ChatGPT + CoT.
In Table 6:
ChatGPT + CoT struggles to answer the question, indicating a lack of knowledge.
RoG successfully provides the correct answer "Parliamentary system" based on a series of reasoning paths, demonstrating its ability to retrieve and reason with knowledge from KGs.
In Table 7:
ChatGPT + CoT provides an incorrect answer, highlighting hallucination issues.
RoG accurately answers the question with "Busch Stadium" based on a valid reasoning path, showing its ability to avoid hallucinations and produce correct results.
These case studies illustrate RoG's effectiveness in conducting faithful reasoning, addressing knowledge gaps, and generating interpretable explanations, making it a valuable tool for KGQA tasks. RoG's planning-retrieval-reasoning framework appears to be a promising approach to enhance the performance and reliability of large language models in knowledge-based tasks.
Connections with our earlier discussions on genome studies, vector space, and nlp.
ChatGPT
While the discussions about RoG and genome studies may seem unrelated on the surface, there are some connections that can be made, particularly in the context of using advanced language models like RoG for knowledge extraction and analysis:
Data Integration
: In genome studies, integrating data from various sources, such as DNA sequences, genetic annotations, and clinical records, is crucial. Similarly, RoG integrates knowledge from knowledge graphs (KGs) and natural language text to enable more comprehensive knowledge retrieval and reasoning. Both fields involve dealing with heterogeneous data sources.
Semantic Relations
: Just as RoG relies on capturing semantic relations between entities in KGs to generate relation paths for reasoning, genome studies often involve capturing relationships between genes, proteins, and biological pathways. Both domains require understanding and leveraging semantic relations to extract meaningful insights.
Vector Space Representations
: In both fields, vector space representations play a significant role. In NLP, word embeddings and vector spaces like word2vec are used to capture semantic relationships between words. Similarly, in genome studies, techniques like gene embedding are employed to represent genes and their relationships in vector spaces. These embeddings help in discovering hidden associations.
Reasoning and Interpretability
: RoG focuses on improving reasoning and interpretability in KGQA. Similarly, in genome studies, researchers often need to reason about the functions and interactions of genes and proteins. Advanced language models like RoG can potentially assist in interpreting genetic data and generating hypotheses.
Data Quality and Noise
: Both fields face challenges related to data quality and noise. In genome studies, noisy or incomplete data can lead to incorrect conclusions. In RoG, dealing with noisy or irrelevant information from large text corpora and KGs is a concern. Strategies to handle noisy data and improve signal-to-noise ratios are essential in both domains.
In summary, while the specific applications and domains of genome studies and RoG differ, there are underlying principles related to data integration, semantic relations, vector space representations, reasoning, interpretability, and dealing with noisy data that connect them. Advanced NLP techniques, like RoG, can potentially find applications in various scientific domains, including genomics, to enhance data analysis and knowledge extraction.
How does the knowledge graph technique work?
ChatGPT
A knowledge graph (KG) is a structured representation of knowledge that consists of entities, relationships, and attributes. Knowledge graph techniques work by organizing and representing information in a way that is both machine-readable and semantically meaningful. Here's how a knowledge graph typically works:
Entities
: Entities represent real-world objects, concepts, or individuals. In a KG, entities are usually depicted as nodes in a graph. These entities can be anything from people and places to abstract concepts like "books" or "events."
Relationships
: Relationships define the connections between entities and represent how they are related to each other. Relationships are represented as edges or links between nodes in the graph. For example, "is married to," "located in," or "authored by" are common relationships in a knowledge graph.
Attributes
: Attributes are properties or characteristics associated with entities. These attributes provide additional information about the entities. For instance, for a person entity, attributes might include "name," "birthdate," and "nationality."
Here's a simple example of how knowledge graph techniques work:
Entities
: Let's say we have two entities, "Albert Einstein" and "Princeton University."
Relationship
: We establish a relationship between them, such as "worked at."
Attributes
: We can assign attributes to these entities, like Einstein's birthdate and Princeton University's location.
Now, we have a basic knowledge graph that represents the fact that "Albert Einstein worked at Princeton University." This structured representation allows us to perform various tasks:
Querying
: You can query the knowledge graph to answer questions. For example, you can ask, "Where did Albert Einstein work?" and the KG can provide the answer by following the "worked at" relationship.
Reasoning
: Knowledge graphs enable reasoning by traversing relationships. If you know that "Albert Einstein mentored Richard Feynman" and "Richard Feynman won the Nobel Prize," you can infer that "Albert Einstein indirectly contributed to a Nobel Prize."
Data Integration
: KGs can integrate data from various sources. For instance, information about individuals, organizations, and their relationships can be extracted from text documents, databases, and structured sources and integrated into a single KG.
Recommendations
: KGs can be used to make recommendations by identifying entities and relationships that are relevant to a user's preferences or needs. For example, suggesting books to a user based on their favorite authors and genres.
Knowledge Discovery
: By analyzing the patterns and connections within a knowledge graph, researchers can discover new insights or identify hidden relationships that may not be apparent from individual data sources.
Semantic Understanding
: KGs provide a common semantic framework for understanding and interpreting data. This helps improve natural language understanding and enables AI systems to answer complex questions.
Knowledge graph techniques have applications in various domains, including search engines, recommendation systems, question-answering systems, and semantic web applications. They enable efficient data retrieval, reasoning, and knowledge representation, making them valuable tools for organizing and utilizing structured information.
AAPPENDIX 
A.1DETAILEDRELATEDWORK 
A.1.1LLM REASONINGPROMPT 
Many studies have been proposed to harness the reasoning ability of LLMs to handle complex tasks 
through prompting (Wei et al., 2022; Wang et al., 2022; Yao et al., 2023; Besta et al., 2023). Chain- 
of-Thought Wei et al. (2022) enables LLMs to generate a reasoning chain that could be helpful to 
reasoning. Tree of thoughts (Yao et al., 2023) expands the reasoning chain to a tree structure to 
explore more reasoning paths. Graph of thoughts further models the reasoning chain as a graph 
with an aggregation operation to synergize the reasoning paths. Plan-and-solve (Wang et al., 2023c) 
prompts LLMs to generate a plan and execute based on it. DecomP (He et al., 2021) prompts LLMs 
to decompose the reasoning task into a series of sub-tasks and solve them step by step. However, the 
problem of hallucinations and lack of knowledge affect the faithfulness of the reasoning. ReACT 
(Yao et al., 2022) treats LLMs as agents, which interact with the environment to get the latest knowl- 
edge for reasoning. To explore faithful reasoning, Entailer (Tafjord et al., 2022) introduces a verif i er 
to validate the reasoning steps generated by LLMs. Creswell & Shanahan (2022) present a frame- 
work including two LLMs that are used for selecting and generating reasoning steps, respectively. 
FAME (Hong et al., 2023) introduces the Monte-Carlo planning to generate faithful reasoning steps. 
RR (He et al., 2022) and KD-CoT Wang et al. (2023b) aim to retrieve relevant knowledge from KGs 
to produce faithful reasoning plans for LLMs. 
A.1.2KNOWLEDGEGRAPHQUESTIONANSWERING 
Embedding-based methods model the entities and relations in embedding space and design special 
model architectures to reason answers. KV-Mem (Miller et al., 2016) adopts a Key-Value memory 
network to store triples for reasoning. EmbedKGQA (Saxena et al., 2020) and NSM (He et al., 
2021) utilize the sequential model to mimic the multi-hop reasoning process. QA-GNN (Yasunaga 
et al., 2021) and Greaselm (Zhang et al., 2021) further adopt the graph neural network to capture the 
graph structure for reasoning. However, these methods need to design different model architectures, 
which are not l exible and generalizable. 
Retrieval-augmented methods aims to retrieve the relative facts from the KGs to improve the 
reasoning performance. Early works adopt the page rank or random walk algorithm to retrieve 
subgraphs from KGs for reasoning (Sun et al., 2018; 2019). However, they ignore the semantic 
information in questions and lead to noisy retrieval results. Zhang et al. (2022) proposes a relation 
paths-based subgraph retrieval, resulting a better retrieval and QA performance. Other lines of 
studies retrieving triples from KGs via BM25 (Li et al., 2023) or DPR (Karpukhin et al., 2020; Yu 
et al., 2022b) to improve the performance of LLMs. They discard the structure information in KGs 
whichleadstosuboptimalresults. Recently, UniKGQA(Jiangetal.,2022)unif i esthegraphretrieval 
and reasoning process into a single model with LLMs, which achieves state-of-the-art performance 
on KGQA tasks. 
Semantic parsing methods parse the question into a structural query (e.g., SPARQL) which can be 
executed by a query engine to get answers (Sun et al., 2020; Lan & Jiang, 2020). ArcaneQA (Gu & 
Su, 2022) dynamically generates the query based on results from previous steps. RnG-KBQA (Ye 
15 
et al., 2022) i rst enumerate all possible queries and then rank them to get the i nal output. These 
methods heavily rely on the quality of generated queries. If the query is not executable, no answers 
will be generated. DECAF (Yu et al., 2022a) combines semantic parsing and LLMs reasoning to 
jointly generate answers, which also reach salient performance on KGQA tasks. 
A.2RETRIEVALALGORITHM 
Given a question q and a relation path as plan z, we adopt a constrained breadth-f i rst search to 
retrieve the reasoning paths. The pseudocode code is presented in Algorithm 1. 
We i rst initialize a queue of current reasoning paths Q with the entities in the question Tq(line 
3-5). 
Then, we iteratively expand each reasoning path in Q by adding the triples that are connected to 
the entities in the queue following the relation in relation path (line 11-19). The reasoning path is 
expanded until the length is equal to the length of the relation path. The expanded reasoning path is 
added to the set Wzas 
the i nal results (line 8-10).

The Value of Semantic Parse Labeling for 
Knowledge Base Question Answering

Abstract 
We demonstrate the value of collecting se- 
mantic parse labels for knowledge base 
question answering.In particular, (1) 
unlike previous studies on small-scale 
datasets, we show that learning from la- 
beled semantic parses signif i cantly im- 
proves overall performance, resulting in 
absolute 5 point gain compared to learn- 
ingfromanswers, (2)weshowthatwithan 
appropriate user interface, one can obtain 
semantic parses with high accuracy and at 
a cost comparable or lower than obtaining 
just answers, and (3) we have created and 
shared the largest semantic-parse labeled 
dataset to date in order to advance research 
in question answering. 
1Introduction 
Semantic parsing is the mapping of text to a mean- 
ing representation. Early work on learning to build 
semantic parsers made use of datasets of questions 
and their associated semantic parses (Zelle and 
Mooney, 1996; Zettlemoyer and Collins, 2005; 
Wong and Mooney, 2007).Recent work on 
semantic parsing for knowledge base question- 
answering (KBQA) has called into question the 
value of collecting such semantic parse labels, 
with most recent KBQA semantic parsing systems 
being trained using only question-answer pairs in- 
stead of question-parse pairs. In fact, there is ev- 
idence that using only question-answer pairs can 
yield improved performance as compared with ap- 
proaches based on semantic parse labels (Liang et 
al., 2013). It is also widely believed that collect- 
ing semantic parse labels can be a ���diff i cult, time 
consuming task��� (Clarke et al., 2010) even for do- 
main experts. Furthermore, recent focus has been 
more on the i nal task-specif i c performance of a 
system (i.e., did it get the right answer for a ques- 
tion) as opposed to agreement on intermediate rep- 
resentations (Berant et al., 2013; Kwiatkowski et 
al., 2013), which allows for KBQA datasets to be 
built with only the answers to each question. 
In this work, we re-examine the value of se- 
mantic parse labeling and demonstrate that seman- 
tic parse labels can provide substantial value for 
knowledge base question-answering. We focus on 
the task of question-answering on Freebase, using 
the WEBQUESTIONSdataset (Berant et al., 2013). 
Our i rst contribution is the construction of the 
largest semantic parse dataset for KB question- 
answering to date. In order to evaluate the costs 
and benef i ts of gathering semantic parse labels, we 
created the WEBQUESTIONSSP dataset1, which 
contains semantic parses for the questions from 
WEBQUESTIONSthat are answerable using Free- 
base. In particular, we provide SPARQL queries 
for 4,737 questions. The remaining 18.5% of the 
original WEBQUESTIONSquestions are labeled as 
���not answerable���.This is due to a number of 
factors including the use of a more stringent as- 
sessment of ���answerable���, namely that the ques- 
tion be answerable via SPARQL rather than by 
returning or extracting information from textual 
descriptions. Compared to the previous seman- 
tic parse dataset on Freebase, Free917 (Cai and 
Yates, 2013), our WEBQUESTIONSSP is not only 
substantially larger, but also provides the semantic 
parses in SPARQL with standard Freebase entity 
identif i ers, which are directly executable on Free- 
base. 
Our second contribution is a demonstration that 
semantic parses can be collected at low cost. We 
employ a staged labeling paradigm that enables ef- 
i cient labeling of semantic parses and improves 
the accuracy, consistency and eff i ciency of ob- 
1Available at http://aka.ms/WebQSP.

taining answers. In fact, in a simple comparison 
with using a web browser to extract answers from 
freebase.com, we show that we can collect se- 
mantic parse labels at a comparable or even faster 
rate than simply collecting answers. 
Our third contribution is an empirical demon- 
stration that we can leverage the semantic parse 
labels to increase the accuracy of a state-of-the-art 
question-answering system. We use a system that 
currently achieves state-of-the-art performance on 
KBQA and show that augmenting its training with 
semantic parse labels leads to an absolute 5-point 
increase in average F1. 
Our work demonstrates that semantic parse la- 
bels can provide additional value over answer la- 
bels while, with the right labeling tools, being 
comparable in cost to collect. Besides accuracy 
gains, semantic parses also have further benef i ts in 
yielding answers that are more accurate and con- 
sistent, as well as being updatable if the knowl- 
edge base changes (for example, as facts are added 
or revised). 
2Collecting Semantic Parses 
In order to verify the benef i ts of having labeled 
semantic parses, we completely re-annotated the 
WEBQUESTIONSdataset (Berant et al., 2013) 
such that it contains both semantic parses and the 
derived answers. We chose to annotate the ques- 
tions with the full semantic parses in SPARQL, 
based on the schema and data of the latest and last 
version of Freebase (2015-08-09). 
Labeling interfaceWriting SPARQL queries 
fornaturallanguagequestionsusingatexteditoris 
obviously not an eff i cient way to provide semantic 
parses even for experts. Therefore, we designed a 
staged, dialog-like user interface (UI) to improve 
the labeling eff i ciency.Our UI breaks the po- 
tentially complicated structured-labeling task into 
separate, but inter-dependent sub-tasks. Given a 
question, the UI i rst presents entities detected in 
the questions using an entity linking system (Yang 
and Chang, 2015), and asks the user to pick an en- 
tity in the question as the topic entity that could 
lead to the answers. The user can also suggest a 
new entity if none of the candidates returned by 
the entity linking system is correct. Once the en- 
tity is selected, the system then requests the user 
to pick the Freebase predicate that represents the 
relationship between the answers and this topic 
entity. Finally, additional i lters can be added to 
further constrain the answers. One key advantage 
of our UI design is that the annotator only needs to 
focus on one particular sub-task during each stage. 
All of the choices made by the labeler are used to 
automatically construct a coherent semantic parse. 
Note that the user can easily go back and forth to 
each of these three stages and change the previous 
choices, before pressing the i nal submit button. 
Take the question ���who voiced meg on fam- 
ily guy?��� for example. The labeler will be pre- 
sented with two entity choices: Meg Griffin 
and Family Guy, where the former links ���meg��� 
to the character���s entity and the latter links to the 
TV show. Depending on the entity selected, legiti- 
mateFreebasepredicatesoftheselectedentitywill 
be shown, along with the objects (either proper- 
ties or entities). Suppose the labeler chooses Meg 
Griffin as the topic entity. He should then pick 
actor as the main relationship, meaning the an- 
swer should be the persons who have played this 
role. To accurately describe the question, the la- 
beler should add additional i lters like the TV se- 
ries is Family Guy and the performance type is 
voice in the i nal stage2. 
The design of our UI is inspired by recent work
ChatGPT
The passage you've provided discusses the value of collecting semantic parse labels for knowledge base question answering. Here are the key points:
Semantic Parsing Definition:
Semantic parsing is the process of mapping natural language text to a meaning representation, which allows computers to understand and process human language.

I think the whole thing is still unclear.
ChatGPT
I understand that the passage may still be unclear. Semantic parsing and knowledge base question answering (KBQA) can be complex topics. Let me simplify it:
Semantic Parsing:
This is a way for computers to understand human language. It involves converting natural language sentences into a structured format that computers can work with.
KBQA:
Knowledge Base Question Answering is about asking questions and getting answers from a structured knowledge base, like a database.
Semantic Parse Labels:
These are annotations that show how a question should be turned into a structured query to retrieve answers from a knowledge base.
The Study:
The authors of this passage wanted to see if adding these semantic parse labels to a KBQA system would make it work better.
What They Did:
They created a big dataset where they added these semantic parse labels to questions. They also showed that it's not too hard or expensive to do this labeling.
What They Found:
When they used these labeled questions to train their KBQA system, it got a lot better at giving correct answers.
So, in simple terms, they found that by adding these labels to questions, they could make a computer program much better at answering questions from a knowledge base. And it wasn't too hard or expensive to do this labeling.
I hope this clears things up a bit. If you have more questions or need further clarification, feel free to ask!
I meant the connections with the other topics.
ChatGPT
I see your point. Let's make connections between the passage about semantic parsing and knowledge base question answering (KBQA) and the previous discussions on genome studies, vector space, and natural language processing (NLP):
Semantic Parsing (SP) and Genome Studies:
Semantic parsing is a technique used in natural language processing (NLP) to understand human language. In the context of genome studies, NLP and SP could be used to extract meaningful information from scientific literature or medical records related to genetics. For example, SP can help turn complex genetic research papers into structured data that can be analyzed more effectively.
KBQA and Vector Space:
Knowledge base question answering (KBQA) often involves retrieving information from structured knowledge bases. Vector space models, which are commonly used in information retrieval, can play a role in mapping questions to relevant entries in the knowledge base. This helps in finding answers more efficiently by representing words and concepts as vectors in a high-dimensional space.
Semantic Parsing, KBQA, and NLP:
The passage discusses how semantic parse labels can improve KBQA systems. In the realm of NLP, this relates to the challenge of converting natural language questions into structured queries that can be executed on knowledge bases. Advances in semantic parsing benefit KBQA by enabling more accurate and efficient retrieval of answers from knowledge bases.
In summary, semantic parsing and KBQA are techniques used in NLP and have applications in various domains, including genome studies. Vector space models can enhance the efficiency of information retrieval in KBQA, and these topics collectively contribute to the broader field of natural language processing. If you have more specific questions or need further connections, please feel free to ask!
Metaphors and analogies to help explain it
ChatGPT
Certainly! Let's use metaphors and analogies to explain semantic parsing, knowledge base question answering (KBQA), and their connection to other topics:
Semantic Parsing (SP):
Metaphor
: Think of SP as a translator for a complex language.
Analogy
: Just like a skilled translator interprets and converts one language into another, SP interprets and converts human language (natural language) into a structured format (like a programming language) that computers can understand. It's like translating a book written in French into English so that more people can read and use it.
Knowledge Base Question Answering (KBQA):
Metaphor
: Imagine KBQA as a librarian who can instantly find the right book for your question.
Analogy
: KBQA systems are like highly knowledgeable librarians who have access to a vast library of information (a knowledge base). When you ask them a question, they quickly locate the specific book (or data) you need and provide you with the answer. It's like having a librarian who knows every book in the library and can fetch them instantly.
Connection to Genome Studies:
Metaphor
: Consider SP and KBQA as tools for deciphering the genetic code.
Analogy
: In genome studies, where understanding complex genetic data is crucial, SP and KBQA can be likened to decoding tools. SP translates scientific papers and genetic information into a format that researchers can work with, much like converting a cryptic code into plain language. KBQA acts like an encyclopedia that quickly looks up genetic facts and provides clear answers, similar to how an expert might consult reference materials.
Vector Space Models:
Metaphor
: Think of vector space models as maps that guide you to the right destination.
Analogy
: In the context of KBQA, vector space models are like maps that help you navigate a vast knowledge base efficiently. They represent words and concepts as points on a map, allowing you to find the right information by following the shortest path. Just as a GPS guides you to your desired location, vector space models guide KBQA systems to the answers you seek.
Natural Language Processing (NLP):
Metaphor
: Picture NLP as a bridge between humans and computers.
Analogy
: NLP acts as a bridge that connects the language we humans speak with the language computers understand. It's like a translator who not only translates between languages but also ensures smooth communication between people from different cultures. In the context of genome studies and KBQA, NLP plays a vital role in bridging the gap between scientific data and human queries.
These metaphors and analogies aim to simplify complex concepts and highlight the practical applications of semantic parsing, KBQA, vector space models, and NLP in various fields, including genome studies. They emphasize the role of these tools in making information more accessible and understandable for both researchers and computers.
The optimization framework of RoG, particularly the two instruction tuning tasks (planning optimization and retrieval-reasoning optimization), can be conceptually linked to aspects of genetics and genomics:

1. **Planning Optimization (Distilling Knowledge):** In genetics, researchers often seek to distill knowledge from vast datasets and biological networks to generate meaningful hypotheses and plans for further study. This process can be likened to RoG's planning optimization, where knowledge from KGs is distilled into LLMs to generate faithful relation paths as plans. In genetics, this might involve distilling information from genomic databases and research literature to create pathways or hypotheses for gene function or disease mechanisms.

2. **Retrieval-Reasoning Optimization (Reasoning Based on Retrieved Paths):** Geneticists frequently rely on retrieval and reasoning processes to interpret complex genomic data. For example, they may retrieve sequences, pathways, or known associations from databases and then reason about how these elements relate to a specific genetic question or disease phenotype. The retrieval-reasoning optimization in RoG aligns with this process, where LLMs aim to generate correct answers based on the retrieved reasoning paths. In genetics, this corresponds to the process of deriving insights and conclusions from retrieved biological data.

3. **Integration of Knowledge for Inference:** Both RoG and genetic research emphasize the importance of integrating diverse sources of knowledge. RoG combines KGs and language understanding to perform inference, while geneticists integrate data from various sources, such as genomic databases, experimental results, and literature, to draw meaningful conclusions about genes, mutations, and biological processes.

4. **Joint Training:** RoG trains LLMs on two instruction-tuning tasks, planning, and retrieval-reasoning, which are jointly optimized to improve reasoning. In genetics, researchers often engage in joint analyses of multiple data types (genomic, transcriptomic, proteomic, etc.) to gain a comprehensive understanding of biological systems and processes.

While the contexts are different, the optimization framework of RoG shares some conceptual similarities with the processes used in genetics and genomics research. Both fields aim to distill knowledge, reason based on retrieved information, integrate diverse data sources, and perform joint analyses to draw meaningful insights. These parallels highlight the importance of structured data and reasoning in complex research domains.

Connections between the topics:

Here's a summary of the paper you provided:

The paper proposes a novel method called reasoning on graphs (RoG) that synergizes large language models (LLMs) with knowledge graphs (KGs) to enable faithful and interpretable reasoning. The paper presents a planning-retrieval-reasoning framework, where RoG first generates relation paths grounded by KGs as faithful plans.

Certainly, let's explore the connections between the topics you've mentioned: genomics, semantic parsing, and reasoning on graphs (RoG).
Genomics and RoG:
Genomics, the study of an organism's complete set of DNA, is a data-rich field where researchers aim to understand the functions and relationships of genes, proteins, and other biological elements. RoG's optimization framework, which involves distilling knowledge from KGs and integrating it with language models to improve reasoning, has a parallel in genomics. In genomics, researchers often distill knowledge from vast genomic datasets and integrate it into computational models to reason about gene functions, interactions, and disease mechanisms. Both fields share the goal of harnessing structured data (genomic data or KGs) to enhance reasoning capabilities.
Semantic Parsing and RoG:
Semantic parsing involves mapping natural language questions to structured representations that can be executed to retrieve answers. RoG, on the other hand, leverages KGs and language understanding to perform reasoning tasks. While the goals differ, there's a common thread in their reliance on structured representations. Semantic parsing focuses on transforming questions into structured queries, while RoG operates on structured relation paths from KGs to guide reasoning. The emphasis on structured data and processing aligns them conceptually.
Semantic Parsing and Genomics:
Although seemingly unrelated at first, semantic parsing can find applications in genomics. Genomic questions, especially those involving complex genetic interactions, can be challenging to understand for non-experts. Semantic parsing techniques could be used to convert these questions into structured queries for genomic databases, making it easier for researchers to retrieve relevant information. This process might involve translating questions about gene functions or genetic variations into precise queries to explore genomic datasets.
RoG, Genomics, and Semantic Parsing:
The three topics converge in scenarios where genomics researchers aim to enhance their analytical capabilities. Suppose genomics researchers have complex questions about the relationships between genes, proteins, and diseases. In this case, semantic parsing techniques could assist in converting their questions into structured queries. RoG-like frameworks could then leverage KGs of biological data to retrieve relevant information and provide interpretable reasoning results, helping researchers gain deeper insights into genomics.
In summary, while these topics may appear distinct, there are potential intersections and applications. Semantic parsing techniques can aid in structuring complex questions in genomics, and RoG-like frameworks could be employed to leverage KGs for more advanced genomic reasoning and interpretation. These connections highlight the importance of structured data and reasoning across various domains, including genomics, semantic parsing, and KG-based reasoning.

State of the Art performance on today���s models

Microsoft and Graphcore developers have achieved state of the art performance and accuracy with the BERT language model, training BERT Base in 56 hours with just one IPU Server system of eight C2 IPU-Processor PCIe cards. With BERT inference, our customers are seeing 3x higher throughput with over 20% improvement in latency allowing results to be delivered faster than ever.

This level of performance in language understanding is essential for search engines to deliver more useful responses to queries and for text and conversational AI applications such as sentiment analysis and intelligent personal assistants that need human level comprehension. Natural language processing is a strategically important market segment for AI and is expected to grow to be a $15bn AI hardware market, just for NLP, by 2025 (Source: Tractica Q4 2018).

���Natural language processing models are hugely important to Microsoft ��� to run our internal AI workloads and for our AI customers on Microsoft Azure,��� said Girish Bablani, corporate vice president, Azure Compute at Microsoft Corp. ���We are extremely excited by the potential that this new collaboration on processors with Graphcore will deliver for our customers. The Graphcore offering extends Azure���s capabilities and our efforts here form part of our strategy to ensure that Azure remains the best cloud for AI.���



 



IPU enables new AI innovations

As well as delivering state of the art performance for today���s complex AI models, like BERT, the IPU also excels at accelerating new techniques. The IPU will open up new areas of research and allow companies to explore new techniques and to build more efficient machine learning systems that can be trained with much less data.

One of our IPU early access customers, European search engine Qwant, has seen high performance at much lower latency with IPUs running the next generation image recognition model ��� ResNext. As Qwant CEO, Eric Leandri explains:

���Our research team at Qwant works at the cutting edge of AI to quickly deliver the best possible results on our users search queries while ensuring the results are neutral, impartial and accurate. It���s a tall order. We see millions of searches each day for images alone. One of the latest AI innovations that we are implementing is a new class of image recognition model called ResNext, to improve our accuracy and speed when delivering image search results. We have been working closely with Microsoft and Graphcore to use IPU processor technology in Azure and are seeing a significant improvement ��� with 3.5x higher performance - in our image search capability using ResNext on IPUs, out of the box. There is huge potential for innovation with Graphcore IPUs on new machine intelligence models and we are working on these approaches to refine our search results so that we can deliver exactly what our customers are looking for.���



ResNext uses grouped convolutions and depth-wise separable convolutions for large efficiency improvements (accuracy/parameters). This involves splitting the convolution blocks into smaller, separable blocks, which is efficiently supported by IPUs. 

To provide greater insight into the hardware suitability for group and fully depthwise separable convolutions, our customer engineering team has prepared a set of microbenchmarks, with typical convolution blocks, showing clear IPU advantage across the board, but with up to 77x throughput advantage for group convolutions.
