Astronomers have found a background din of exceptionally long-wavelength gravitational waves pervading the cosmos. The cause? Probably supermassive black hole collisions, but more exotic options can't be ruled out.

Introduction
Astronomers have found an extra-low hum rumbling through the universe.

The discovery, announced today, shows that extra-large ripples in space-time are constantly squashing and changing the shape of space. These gravitational waves are cousins to the echoes from black hole collisions first picked up by the Laser Interferometer Gravitational-Wave Observatory (LIGO) experiment in 2015. But whereas LIGO's waves might vibrate a few hundred times a second, it might take years or decades for a single one of these gravitational waves to pass by at the speed of light.

The finding has opened a wholly new window on the universe, one that promises to reveal previously hidden phenomena such as the cosmic whirling of black holes that have the mass of billions of suns, or possibly even more exotic (and still hypothetical) celestial specters.

"It's beautiful," said Chiara Caprini, a theoretical physicist at the University of Geneva and CERN in Switzerland who was not directly involved in the work. "A new era in the observation of the universe has opened up."

The results come from studies that stretch back more than a decade by four teams based in the U.S., Europe, Australia and China. Today, in a coordinated data release, the teams present evidence for a background "hum" of gravitational waves that were detected by tracking changes in the impossibly regular beats of objects called pulsars.

As long-wavelength gravitational waves pass through our cosmic neighborhood, they distort the space-time around us, which changes the arrival time of a pulsar's pulses. Researchers had to map the correlations of these arrival times across dozens of different pulsars for decades in order to pick up the signal. "I had butterflies when I first saw this," said Stephen Taylor, an astrophysicist at Vanderbilt University and chair of the team known as the North American Nanohertz Observatory for Gravitational Waves, or NANOGrav. "I'm so excited we can finally talk about it."

Introduction
Most likely, the gravitational waves come from pairs of supermassive black holes that are spiraling around each other inside merging galaxies. But we might be seeing something else entirely, perhaps something exotic such as ruptures in space-time itself resulting from loops of energy called cosmic strings.

"Finding for the first time the suggestion of background gravitational waves is fascinating," said Juan García-Bellido, a theoretical cosmologist from the Autonomous University of Madrid who was not involved in the work. "It's really Nobel Prize-winning research."

A Galaxy-Size Hack
There's two ways to start the story of this discovery. The first, as usual, is with Albert Einstein. His general theory of relativity in 1915 suggested that the universe is an ocean of space-time on which objects like black holes and stars sit. Movements of these objects would send ripples across this space-time ocean — gravitational waves.

The other place to start the story is in 1967, with a graduate student from Lurgan, Northern Ireland, named Jocelyn Bell. Using a radio telescope that she helped build near Cambridge, U.K., she spotted an unusual signal in space that repeated every second. She and other astronomers later classified these signals as a new class of celestial object known as pulsars — the rapidly spinning cores of dead stars. Today, some are known to spin exceedingly fast, emitting regular pulses of radio waves hundreds or even thousands of times per second.

The stopwatch-like regularity of pulsars makes them valuable cosmic timekeepers. In 1983, the U.S. astronomers Ron Hellings and George Downs suggested a novel way to put them to use: If gravitational waves were squeezing and stretching space-time, that motion would change the arrival time of the pulsars' radio flashes.

The key is to look at many pairs of pulsars and compare their time delays. "If they're close together on the sky, they're both going to be early or late," said Sarah Vigeland, an astrophysicist at the University of Wisconsin, Milwaukee and chair of NANOGrav's Gravitational Wave Detection Working Group. "As you pull them apart, they become out of sync, but in a way you can predict."

To catch these fluctuations, pulsar timing arrays such as NANOGrav use multiple radio telescopes to observe many pulsars over many years. These projects are cosmic cousins of LIGO and other earthbound observatories that detect gravitational waves by looking for tiny changes in the relative lengths of its two arms.

While LIGO's arms are each four kilometers long, pulsar timing arrays effectively use the distance from Earth to each pulsar as a much larger arm — one hundreds or thousands of light-years in length. "What we've essentially done is hack the entire galaxy to make a giant gravitational wave antenna," Taylor said.

This longer distance makes pulsar timing arrays sensitive to a different variety of gravitational wave. Whereas LIGO can detect high-frequency gravitational waves, which might occur when star-size black holes orbit each other tens or hundreds of times a second before merging, pulsar timing arrays are sensitive to processes occurring across years or even decades. That's one reason why pulsar timing arrays need many years of data — if it takes a decade for a single wave to pass by, you can't detect it in just a few months.

Of the four groups releasing data today, NANOGrav is the most confident in its result. The project was founded in 2007 and has largely used the Green Bank Telescope in West Virginia and the Arecibo radio telescope in Puerto Rico (which collapsed in late 2020, near the end of NANOGrav's 15 years of data collection). "We're still mourning the loss of Arecibo," Taylor said.

Separate pulsar timing array projects were also established in different parts of the globe. The four teams, which together form the International Pulsar Timing Array, coordinated today's announcements, but they have not yet performed a combined data analysis. "It's complex," said Andrew Zic, an astronomer at the Commonwealth Scientific and Industrial Research Organization in Australia and part of that country's Parkes Pulsar Timing Array team. "We're ready to move towards being a more unified thing."

In 2020, NANOGrav released preliminary data from 12.5 years of observations. Those showed a tentative hint of gravitational waves affecting the pulses of some 45 pulsars.

Now they've added a few more years of data, along with data from nearly two dozen more sources, and a more consistent pattern has emerged. "It really jumps out to us," Vigeland said.

"We're looking at deviations in time that are a couple of hundred nanoseconds," said Scott Ransom, an astronomer at the National Radio Astronomy Observatory and a founding member of NANOGrav. They've detected a particular pattern in the data, called the Hellings-Downs curve, that makes them confident that what they're seeing is the gravitational-wave background. "That's the smoking gun of gravitational waves."

The European team, which observed 25 pulsars over 25 years with six telescopes, sees similar hints of timing delays but is less certain of their results. "The Americans are very confident," said Michael Keith, an astrophysicist at the Jodrell Bank Center for Astrophysics and part of the European team. The Australian team is reporting observations from 32 pulsars over 18 years, while the Chinese team has observed 57 pulsars for a little more than three years.

Supermassive Dances
So what's causing these waves? The most likely sources are supermassive black holes — behemoths millions to billions of times the mass of our sun. These are found at the center of massive galaxies such as our own Milky Way. When two galaxies collide, as sometimes happens, the supermassive black holes at their centers may also begin to orbit each other, twirling around at a cosmically ponderous rate, and perturbing space-time as they do.

"If you have a rotating distribution of mass that's not symmetric" — even something small, like a spinning pen — "gravitational waves are coming out," Keith said. On big enough scales, with supermassive black holes, the low and steady rumble of these waves becomes detectable as they permeate space.

Introduction
NANOGrav can't yet make out individual gravitational wave sources. Instead, the team has found evidence for the background hum of all low-frequency gravitational waves. It's like a buoy bouncing up and down in a busy harbor — it can't distinguish the wake of a single boat, but its motion can reveal that there are some big objects slicing through the water.

Supermassive black holes, however, are not the only possible explanation for the background hum. Another possibility is cosmic strings. First predicted in the 1970s, these would essentially be cracks in space-time caused by the expansion of the universe. The cracks would emit gravitational waves as they spun around in loops.

"The idea of cosmic strings is you have some extension of the Standard Model [of particle physics] in which, in addition to pointlike particles, you can get strings of energy stretching out across the universe," said John Ellis, a theoretical physicist at King's College London and CERN who is a proponent of cosmic strings. "Those strings of energy move around and can collide, spawning loops of string that eventually collapse by emitting gravitational waves."

While the idea is somewhat extravagant, the observations so far from NANOGrav and the other teams are consistent with what we'd expect to see from cosmic strings. "They'd be constantly wriggling, and from time to time they crack like a whip and send out gravitational wave bursts," said Patrick Brady, an astrophysicist at the University of Wisconsin, Milwaukee. If the pulsar timing arrays don't see individual sources start to emerge from their upcoming data, that could point toward this exotic physics beyond the Standard Model. "Cosmic strings will give you a much smoother signal," Ellis said.

But while strings and other exotic phenomena can't be ruled out, for now supermassive black holes are the favored explanation. "From an Occam's razor point of view, we know galaxies merge and almost all galaxies have supermassive black holes," Ransom said. "So we think it's probably most likely that the signal we're seeing is from supermassive black holes. But we could be wrong."

Discovering a population of supermassive black hole pairs would help answer open questions in astrophysics. For example, what happens when two orbiting supermassive black holes get relatively close to each other? There were reasons to think that instead of merging, as smaller black holes do, supermassive black holes just rotate around each other forever. "This is called the last-parsec problem," Caprini said; a parsec is a unit of distance measuring 3.26 light-years across. "It is an unsolved problem." If pulsar timing arrays are seeing gravitational waves from these moments, however, it would be "a demonstration that two supermassive black holes do get close enough and merge," rather than remaining in distant orbits, Caprini said.

Just the existence of such a population has broad implications for our understanding of galactic evolution in the universe. "It would mean that at the center of some galaxies, there are massive black holes that are not just alone," Caprini said. "We can probe, through the history of the universe, how galaxies collide and the rate of collisions."

Such work would require the discovery of individual supermassive black hole pairs, and so is not yet feasible. But as researchers combine the data sets from the different teams and take more observations over the next few years, individual sources may start to emerge, perhaps allowing astronomers to pinpoint binary supermassive black holes in space and time.

"Bright individual sources will start poking above this background hum," said Maura McLaughlin, an astrophysicist at West Virginia University and one of the founding members of NANOGrav. "We'll be able to say, in that direction, there is a supermassive black hole binary with [a certain] mass. We'll learn a whole lot about galaxy mergers."

What is clear is that these projects have given astronomers a completely new tool with which to study the cosmos. The rise of gravitational-wave astronomy "is like when Galileo first turned his telescope on the sky," Brady said. We now know that a background of ripples in space-time pervades the universe. An ocean of gravitational waves awaits.

This article discusses a fascinating new discovery in astrophysics. Scientists have detected a background "hum" of gravitational waves moving through the universe. This is likely caused by supermassive black hole collisions, but more exotic possibilities like ruptures in space-time caused by energy loops known as cosmic strings can't be excluded.
The discovery is based on the precise measurement of the timing of dozens of pulsars over the course of 15 years, mainly using the 100-meter Green Bank Telescope. This has shown that extra-large ripples in space-time are constantly reshaping space. These gravitational waves are like the ones first detected by the Laser Interferometer Gravitational-Wave Observatory (LIGO) in 2015, but are much longer and slower, taking years or even decades to pass by at the speed of light.
While the main hypothesis is that these gravitational waves come from pairs of supermassive black holes spiraling around each other inside merging galaxies, other possibilities like cosmic strings are also being considered. Cosmic strings are predicted as extensions of the Standard Model of particle physics that could generate gravitational waves as they move around and collide.
This discovery opens up a new window for observing the universe and could reveal previously hidden phenomena, such as the cosmic movement of supermassive black holes with the mass of billions of suns. It's also being hailed as potentially Nobel Prize-winning research, indicating the significance of this discovery in the scientific community.

The dozens of black hole collisions observed by the LIGO and Virgo gravitational wave detectors are changing our view of the universe.

Introduction
When the first black hole collision was detected in 2015, it was a watershed moment in the history of astronomy. With gravitational waves, astronomers were observing the universe in an entirely new way. But this first event didn't revolutionize our understanding of black holes — nor could it. This collision would be the first of many, astronomers knew, and only with that bounty would answers come.

"The first discovery was the thrill of our lives," said Vicky Kalogera, an astrophysicist at Northwestern University and part of the Laser Interferometer Gravitational-Wave Observatory (LIGO) collaboration that made the 2015 detection. "But you cannot do astrophysics with one source."

Now, gravitational wave physicists like Kalogera say they are entering a new era of black hole astronomy, driven by a rapid increase in the number of black holes they are observing.

The latest catalog of these so-called black hole binary mergers — the result of two black holes spiraling inward toward each other and colliding — has quadrupled the black hole merger data available to study. There are now almost 50 mergers for astrophysicists to scrutinize, with dozens more expected in the next few months and hundreds more in the coming years.

"Black hole astrophysics is being revolutionized by gravitational waves because the numbers are so big. And the numbers are allowing us to ask qualitatively different questions," said Kalogera. "We've opened a treasure trove."

On the strength of this data, new statistically driven studies are beginning to reveal the secrets of these enigmatic objects: how black holes form, and why they merge. This growing black hole inventory could also offer a novel way to probe cosmological evolution — from the Big Bang through the birth of the first stars and the growth of galaxies.

"I definitely didn't expect that we'd be looking at these questions so soon after the first detection," said Maya Fishbach, an astrophysicist at Northwestern. "The field has exploded."

Where Do Black Holes Come From?
Before black holes can be used to study the cosmos as a whole, astrophysicists must first figure out how they are made. Two theories have dominated the debate so far.

Some astronomers suggest that most black holes originate inside crowded clusters of stars — regions that are sometimes a million times denser than our own galactic backyard. Each time a very massive star explodes, it leaves behind a black hole that sinks to the middle of the star cluster. The center of the cluster becomes thick with black holes, which become entwined by gravity into a fateful cosmic dance. Astronomers call this "dynamical" black hole formation.

Others suggest that black hole binaries start out as pairs of stars in comparatively desolate areas of galaxies. After a long and chaotic life together, they too explode, creating a pair of "isolated" black holes that continue to orbit each other.

"There's been this perception that it's a fight between the dynamical and the isolated models," said Daniel Holz, an astrophysicist at the University of Chicago.

The tendency of many theorists to advocate for just one black hole binary formation channel partly stems from the practicalities of working with very little data. "Each event was lovingly analyzed, obsessed over and fussed over," said Holz. "We would make a detection and people would try to abstract very broad statements from a sample size of one or two black holes."

Indeed, astrophysicists used that first detection to argue for opposing conclusions. LIGO found its first black hole merger extremely quickly — before the official start of observation, in fact — which suggested that black hole binary systems are very common in the universe. Since isolated black holes can form in a broad range of astrophysical environments, theories that favor isolated black holes predict that we'll see a lot of mergers.

Others pointed out that the first merger featured unusually large black holes, and that the existence of these giants supported the dynamical theory. Such large black holes, they reasoned, could only be made in the early universe, when star clusters are also thought to have formed.

Yet with a sample size of one, such assertions could only be an "educated guess," said Carl Rodriguez, an astrophysicist at Carnegie Mellon University.

Now data from LIGO's latest catalog shows that black hole binaries are far less common than expected. In fact, the rate of merging black holes now observed could be "entirely explained" by star clusters, according to a paper posted by Rodriguez and his collaborators on the scientific preprint site arxiv.org late last month. (The paper's conclusion is more measured and suggests that both the dynamical and isolated processes are important.)

In addition, the new mergers have enabled a fresh approach to the puzzle of where black holes come from. Despite their elusive nature, black holes are very simple. Aside from mass and charge, the only trait a black hole can have is spin — a measure of how quickly it rotates. If a pair of black holes, and the stars from which they form, live their whole lives together, the constant push and pull will align their spins. But if two black holes happen to encounter each other later in life, their spins will be random.

After measuring the spin of the black holes in the LIGO data set, astronomers now suggest that the dynamic and isolated scenarios are almost equally likely. There is no "one channel to rule them all," wrote the astrophysicist Michael Zevin and collaborators in a recent preprint outlining an array of different pathways that together can explain this new and growing population of black hole binaries.

"The simplest answer is not always the correct one," said Zevin. "It's a more complicated landscape, and it's certainly a bigger challenge. But I think it's a more fun problem to address as well."

Young Black Holes
LIGO and its sister observatory Virgo have also grown more sensitive over time, which means they can now see colliding black holes that are much farther away from Earth and much further back in time. "We're listening to a really big chunk of the universe, out to when the universe was much younger than it is today," said Fishbach.

In a recent preprint, Fishbach and her collaborators found indications of differences in the types of black holes observed at different points in cosmic history. In particular, heavier black holes seem to be more common earlier in the universe's history.

This came as no surprise to many astrophysicists; they expect that the first stars in the universe formed from huge clouds of hydrogen and helium, which would make them much bigger than later stars. Black holes created from these stars should then also be huge.

But it's one thing to predict what happened in the early universe, and another to observe it. "You can really start to use [black holes] as a tracer of how the universe formed stars over cosmic time and how the galaxies that form those stars and star clusters are assembled. And that starts to get really cool," said Rodriguez.

The study is a first step toward using large data sets of black holes as a radical tool to explore the cosmos. Astronomers have created an astonishingly accurate model of how the universe evolved, known as Lambda-CDM. But no model is perfect. Gravitational waves offer a way to measure the universe that is completely independent of every other method in the history of cosmology, said Salvatore Vitale, an astrophysicist at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology. "If you get the same results, you'll sleep better at night. If you don't, that points to a potential misunderstanding."

Theorists are now building models that include multiple black hole formation scenarios and unscrambling how each one evolves across the universe's history. Gravitational wave physicists are hopeful that in the coming months and years they'll be able to answer these questions with confidence.

"We're just scratching the surface," said Kalogera. "The sample is still too small to give us a robust answer, but when we have 100 or 200 of these [mergers], then I think we'll have clear answers.

"We're not that far away."

This article discusses recent advancements in our understanding of black holes, particularly thanks to the work of the Laser Interferometer Gravitational-Wave Observatory (LIGO) and Virgo gravitational wave detectors. These observatories have enabled astrophysicists to detect gravitational waves from black hole collisions, thereby significantly increasing the observable data on black holes.
Astrophysicists have now observed almost 50 black hole mergers, which is four times the previously available data. This growing inventory of black holes allows for a novel way to study cosmological evolution, including the formation of black holes, and why they merge.
The main debate currently revolves around the origins of black holes. Some astrophysicists believe that black holes originate within dense star clusters, while others suggest they begin as pairs of stars in more isolated areas of galaxies. Both theories are supported by data from the LIGO catalog.
Black hole research is also shedding light on the early universe. LIGO and Virgo's increased sensitivity enables them to observe black hole collisions that are much farther away, which means these events occurred earlier in the universe's history. As a result, heavier black holes seem more common in the early universe, supporting the theory that the first stars in the universe were significantly larger than later ones.
Astrophysicists believe that as more data on black hole mergers becomes available, they will be able to study the cosmos more thoroughly and possibly refine the existing models of cosmic evolution. This research could potentially reveal misunderstandings in our current models and increase our knowledge of the universe's history.

Ripples in space-time have been detected a century after Einstein predicted them, launching a new era in astronomy.

As gravitational waves sweep past Earth, they alternately stretch and compress the arms of Advanced LIGO's twin detectors, located in Hanford, Wash. (pictured), and Livingston, La.

LIGO
Introduction
Ripples in space-time caused by the violent mergers of black holes have been detected, 100 years after these "gravitational waves" were predicted by Albert Einstein's theory of general relativity and half a century after physicists set out to look for them.

The landmark discovery was reported today by the Advanced Laser Interferometer Gravitational-Wave Observatory (Advanced LIGO) team, confirming months of rumors that have surrounded the group's analysis of its first round of data. Astrophysicists say the detection of gravitational waves opens up a new window on the universe, revealing faraway events that can't be seen by optical telescopes, but whose faint tremors can be felt, even heard, across the cosmos.

"We have detected gravitational waves. We did it!" announced David Reitze, executive director of the 1,000-member team, at a National Science Foundation press conference today in Washington, D.C.

Gravitational waves are perhaps the most elusive prediction of Einstein's theory, one that he and his contemporaries debated for decades. According to his theory, space and time form a stretchy fabric that bends under heavy objects, and to feel gravity is to fall along the fabric's curves. But can the "space-time" fabric ripple like the skin of a drum? Einstein flip-flopped, confused as to what his equations implied. But even steadfast believers assumed that, in any case, gravitational waves would be too weak to observe. They cascade outward from certain cataclysmic events, alternately stretching and squeezing space-time as they go. But by the time the waves reach Earth from these remote sources, they typically stretch and squeeze each mile of space by a minuscule fraction of the width of an atomic nucleus.


Gravitational waves alternately stretch and squeeze space-time both vertically and horizontally as they propagate.

Perceiving the waves took patience and a delicate touch. Advanced LIGO bounced laser beams back and forth along the four-kilometer arms of two L-shaped detectors — one in Hanford, Wash., the other in Livingston, La. — looking for coincident expansions and contractions of their arms caused by gravitational waves as they passed. Using state-of-the-art stabilizers, vacuums and thousands of sensors, the scientists measured changes in the arms' lengths as tiny as one thousandth the width of a proton. This sensitivity would have been unimaginable a century ago, and struck many as implausible in 1968, when Rainer Weiss of the Massachusetts Institute of Technology conceived the experiment that became LIGO.

"The great wonder is they did finally pull it off; they managed to detect these little boogers!" said Daniel Kennefick, a theoretical physicist at the University of Arkansas and author of the 2007 book Traveling at the Speed of Thought: Einstein and the Quest for Gravitational Waves.

The detection ushers in a new era of gravitational-wave astronomy that is expected to deliver a better understanding of the formation, population and galactic role of black holes — super-dense balls of mass that curve space-time so steeply that even light cannot escape. When black holes spiral toward each other and merge, they emit a "chirp": space-time ripples that grow higher in pitch and amplitude before abruptly ending. The chirps that LIGO can detect happen to fall in the audible range, although they are far too quiet to be heard by the unaided ear. You can re-create the sound by running your finger along a piano's keys. "Start from the lowest note on the piano and go to middle C," Weiss said. "That's what we hear."

Physicists are already surprised by the number and strength of the signals detected so far, which imply that there are more black holes out there than expected. "We got lucky, but I was always expecting us to be somewhat lucky," said Kip Thorne, a theoretical physicist at the California Institute of Technology who founded LIGO with Weiss and Ronald Drever, who is also at Caltech. "This usually happens when a whole new window's been opened up on the universe."

Eavesdropping on gravitational waves could reshape our view of the cosmos in other ways, perhaps uncovering unimagined cosmic happenings.

"I liken this to the first time we pointed a telescope at the sky," said Janna Levin, a theoretical astrophysicist at Barnard College of Columbia University. "People realized there was something to see out there, but didn't foresee the huge, incredible range of possibilities that exist in the universe." Similarly, Levin said, gravitational-wave detections might possibly reveal that "the universe is full of dark stuff that we simply can't detect in a telescope."

The story of the first gravitational-wave detection began on a Monday morning in September, and it started with a bang: a signal so loud and clear that Weiss thought, "This is crap. It's gotta be no good."

Fever Pitch
That first gravitational wave swept across Advanced LIGO's detectors — first at Livingston, then at Hanford seven milliseconds later — during a mock run in the early hours of Sept. 14, two days before data collection was officially scheduled to begin.

The detectors were just firing up again after a five-year, $200-million upgrade, which equipped them with new noise-damping mirror suspensions and an active feedback system for canceling out extraneous vibrations in real time. The upgrades gave Advanced LIGO a major sensitivity boost over its predecessor, "initial LIGO," which from 2002 to 2010 had detected "a good clean zero," as Weiss put it.

When the big signal arrived in September, scientists in Europe, where it was morning, frantically emailed their American colleagues. As the rest of the team awoke, the news quickly spread. According to Weiss, practically everyone was skeptical — especially when they saw the signal. It was such a textbook chirp that many suspected the data had been hacked.

Mistaken claims in the search for gravitational waves have a long history, starting in the late 1960s when Joseph Weber of the University of Maryland thought he observed aluminum bars resonating in response to the waves. Most recently, in 2014, an experiment called BICEP2 reported the detection of primordial gravitational waves — space-time ripples from the Big Bang that would now be stretched and permanently frozen into the geometry of the universe. The BICEP2 team went public with great fanfare before their results were peer-reviewed, and then got burned when their signal turned out to have come from space dust.

When Lawrence Krauss, a cosmologist at Arizona State University, got wind of the Advanced LIGO detection, "the first thought is that it was a blind injection," he said. During initial LIGO, simulated signals had been secretly inserted into the data streams to test the response, unbeknownst to most of the team. When Krauss heard from an inside source that it wasn't a blind injection this time, he could hardly contain his excitement.

On Sept. 25, he tweeted to his 200,000 followers: "Rumor of a gravitational wave detection at LIGO detector. Amazing if true. Will post details if it survives." Then, on Jan. 11: "My earlier rumor about LIGO has been confirmed by independent sources. Stay tuned! Gravitational waves may have been discovered!"


The first gravitational wave signal was observed seven milliseconds apart on Sept. 14 at Advanced LIGO's Hanford and Livingston detectors.

The team's official stance was to keep quiet about their signal until they were dead sure. Thorne, bound by a vow of secrecy, didn't even tell his wife. "I celebrated in private," he said. The team's first step was to go back and analyze in excruciating detail how the signal had propagated through the detectors' thousands of different measurement channels, and to see whether anything strange had happened at the moment the signal was seen. They found nothing unusual. They also ruled out hackers, who would have had to know more than anyone about the experiment's thousands of data streams. "Even the team that does the blind injections have not perfected their injections well enough not to leave behind lots of fingerprints," Thorne said. "And there were no fingerprints."

Another, weaker chirp showed up in the weeks that followed.

The scientists analyzed these first two signals as even more swept in, and they submitted their paper to Physical Review Letters in January; it appeared online today. Their estimate of the statistical significance of the first, biggest signal is above "5-sigma," meaning the scientists are 99.9999 percent sure it's real.

Listening for Gravity
Einstein's equations of general relativity are so complex that it took 40 years for most physicists to agree that gravitational waves exist and are detectable — even in theory.

Einstein first thought that objects cannot shed energy in the form of gravitational radiation, then changed his mind. He showed in a seminal 1918 paper which ones could: Dumbbell-like systems that rotate about two axes at once, such as binary stars and supernovas popping like firecrackers, can make waves in space-time.

Still, Einstein and his colleagues continued to waffle. Some physicists argued that even if the waves exist, the world will oscillate with them and they cannot be felt. It wasn't until 1957 that Richard Feynman put that question to rest, with a thought experiment demonstrating that, if gravitational waves exist, they are theoretically detectable. But nobody knew how common those dumbbell-like sources might be in our cosmic neighborhood, or how strong or weak the resulting waves would be. "There was that ultimate question of: Will we ever really detect them?" Kennefick said.

In 1968, "Rai" Weiss was a young professor at MIT who had been roped into teaching a class on general relativity — a theory that he, as an experimentalist, knew little about — when news broke that Joseph Weber had detected gravitational waves. Weber had set up a trio of desk-size aluminum bars in two different U.S. states, and he reported that gravitational waves had set them all ringing.

Weiss' students asked him to explain gravitational waves and weigh in about the news. Looking into it, he was intimidated by the complex mathematics. "I couldn't figure out what the hell [Weber] was doing — how the bar interacted with the gravitational wave." He sat for a long time, asking himself, "What's the most primitive thing I can think of that will detect gravitational waves?" An idea came to him that he calls the "conceptual basis of LIGO."

Imagine three objects sitting in space-time — say, mirrors at the corners of a triangle. "Send light from one to the other," Weiss said. "Look at the time it takes to go from one mass to another, and see if the time has changed." It turns out, he said, "you can do that quickly. I gave it to [my students] as a problem. Virtually the whole class was able to do that calculation."

In the next few years, as other researchers tried and failed to replicate the results of Weber's resonance-bar experiments (what he observed remains unclear, but it wasn't gravitational waves), Weiss began plotting a much more precise and ambitious experiment: a gravitational-wave interferometer. Laser light would bounce between three mirrors in an L-shaped arrangement, forming two beams. The spacing of the peaks and troughs of the light waves would precisely measure the lengths of the two arms, creating what could be thought of as x and y axes for space-time. When the grid was still, the two light waves would bounce back to the corner and cancel each other out, producing a null signal in a detector. But if a gravitational wave swept across Earth, it would stretch the length of one arm and compress the length of the other (and vice versa in an alternating pattern). The off-alignment of the two light beams would create a signal in the detector, revealing a fleeting tremor in space and time.

It seems you've pasted a comprehensive and detailed account of the discovery of gravitational waves, as announced by the Advanced Laser Interferometer Gravitational-Wave Observatory (LIGO) team back in 2016. This was indeed a groundbreaking event in the field of astrophysics, which confirmed a century-old prediction from Albert Einstein's theory of general relativity.
As described in the article, the discovery relied on the detection of ripples in space-time, specifically those caused by the violent merger of two black holes. The feat required state-of-the-art technology and exquisite sensitivity to measure changes in length as tiny as one thousandth the width of a proton.
The detection opened a new era in astronomy, allowing for the observation of cosmic events not detectable by conventional optical telescopes. Instead of relying on light, this form of astronomy relies on the detection of gravitational waves — essentially "listening" to the cosmos. The endeavor has the potential to provide a wealth of knowledge about black holes and other dense, massive objects, and could possibly reveal unknown cosmic phenomena.

Fellow physicists were skeptical at first, but the experiment soon found a champion in Thorne, whose theory group at Caltech studied black holes and other potential gravitational-wave sources and the signals they would produce. Thorne had been inspired by Weber's experiment and similar efforts by Russian physicists; after speaking with Weiss at a conference in 1975, "I began to believe that gravitational-wave detection would succeed," Thorne said, "and I wanted Caltech to be involved." He had Caltech hire the Scottish experimentalist Ronald Drever, who had also been clamoring to build a gravitational-wave interferometer. Thorne, Drever and Weiss eventually began working as a team, each taking on a share of the countless problems that had to be solved to develop a feasible experiment. The trio founded LIGO in 1984, and, after building prototypes and collaborating with a growing team, banked more than $100 million in NSF funding in the early 1990s. Blueprints were drawn up for a pair of giant L-shaped detectors. A decade later, the detectors went online.

In Hanford and Livingston, vacuums run down the center of each detector's four-kilometer arms, keeping the laser, the beam path and the mirrors as isolated as possible from the planet's constant trembling. Not taking any chances, LIGO scientists monitor their detectors with thousands of instruments during each data run, measuring everything they can: seismic activity, atmospheric pressure, lightning, the arrival of cosmic rays, vibrations of the equipment, sounds near the laser beam, and so on. They then cleanse their data of these various sources of background noise. Perhaps most importantly, having two detectors allows them to cross-check their data, looking for coincident signals.

Inside the vacuum, even with isolated and stabilized lasers and mirrors, "strange signals happen all the time," said Marco Cavaglià, assistant spokesperson for the LIGO collaboration. The scientists must trace these "koi fish," "ghosts," "fringy sea monsters" and other rogue vibrational patterns back to their sources so the culprits can be removed. One tough case occurred during the testing phase, said Jessica McIver, a postdoctoral researcher and one of the team's foremost glitch detectives. It was a string of periodic, single-frequency artifacts that appeared every so often in the data. When she and her colleagues converted the mirror vibrations into an audio file, "you could clearly hear the ring-ring-ring of a telephone," McIver said. "It turned out to be telemarketers calling the phone inside the laser enclosure."

The sensitivity of Advanced LIGO's detectors will continue to improve over the next couple of years, and a third interferometer called Advanced Virgo will come online in Italy. One question the data might help answer is how black holes form. Are they products of implosions of the earliest, massive stars, or do they originate from collisions inside tight clusters of stars? "Those are just two ideas; I bet there will be several more before the dust settles," Weiss said. As LIGO tallies new statistics in future runs, scientists will be listening for whispers of these black-hole origin stories.

Judging by its shape and size, that first, loudest chirp originated about 1.3 billion light-years away from the location where two black holes, each of roughly 30 solar masses, finally merged after slow-dancing under mutual gravitational attraction for eons. The black holes spiraled toward each other faster and faster as the end drew near, like water in a drain, shedding three suns' worth of energy to gravitational waves in roughly the blink of an eye. The merger is the most energetic event ever detected.

"It's as though we had never seen the ocean in a storm," Thorne said. He has been waiting for a storm in space-time ever since the 1960s. The feeling he experienced when the waves finally rolled in wasn't excitement, he said, but something else: profound satisfaction.

The "gravitational memory effect" predicts that a passing gravitational wave should forever alter the structure of space-time. Physicists have linked the phenomenon to fundamental cosmic symmetries and a potential solution to the black hole information paradox.

A black hole collision should forever scar space-time.

Alfred Pasieka / Science Source
Introduction
The first detection of gravitational waves in 2016 provided decisive confirmation of Einstein's general theory of relativity. But another astounding prediction remains unconfirmed: According to general relativity, every gravitational wave should leave an indelible imprint on the structure of space-time. It should permanently strain space, displacing the mirrors of a gravitational wave detector even after the wave has passed.

Since that first detection almost six years ago, physicists have been trying to figure out how to measure this so-called "memory effect."

"The memory effect is absolutely a strange, strange phenomenon," said Paul Lasky, an astrophysicist at Monash University in Australia. "It's really deep stuff."

Their goals are broader than just glimpsing the permanent space-time scars left by a passing gravitational wave. By exploring the links between matter, energy and space-time, physicists hope to come to a better understanding of Stephen Hawking's black hole information paradox, which has been a major focus of theoretical research for going on five decades. "There's an intimate connection between the memory effect and the symmetry of space-time," said Kip Thorne, a physicist at the California Institute of Technology whose work on gravitational waves earned him part of the 2017 Nobel Prize in Physics. "It is connected ultimately to the loss of information in black holes, a very deep issue in the structure of space and time."

A Scar in Space-Time
Why would a gravitational wave permanently change space-time's structure? It comes down to general relativity's intimate linking of space-time and energy.

First consider what happens when a gravitational wave passes by a gravitational wave detector. The Laser Interferometer Gravitational-Wave Observatory (LIGO) has two arms positioned in an L shape. If you imagine a circle circumscribing the arms, with the center of the circle at the arms' intersection, a gravitational wave will periodically distort the circle, squeezing it vertically, then horizontally, alternating until the wave has passed. The difference in length between the two arms will oscillate — behavior that reveals the distortion of the circle, and the passing of the gravitational wave.

According to the memory effect, after the passing of the wave, the circle should remain permanently deformed by a tiny amount. The reason why has to do with the particularities of gravity as described by general relativity.

The objects that LIGO detects are so far away, their gravitational pull is negligibly weak. But a gravitational wave has a longer reach than the force of gravity. So, too, does the property responsible for the memory effect: the gravitational potential.

In simple Newtonian terms, a gravitational potential measures how much energy an object would gain if it fell from a certain height. Drop an anvil off a cliff, and the speed of the anvil at the bottom can be used to reconstruct the "potential" energy that falling off the cliff can impart.

But in general relativity, where space-time is stretched and squashed in different directions depending on the motions of bodies, a potential dictates more than just the potential energy at a location — it dictates the shape of space-time.

"The memory is nothing but the change in the gravitational potential," said Thorne, "but it's a relativistic gravitational potential." The energy of a passing gravitational wave creates a change in the gravitational potential; that change in potential distorts space-time, even after the wave has passed.

How, exactly, will a passing wave distort space-time? The possibilities are literally infinite, and, puzzlingly, these possibilities are also equivalent to one another. In this manner, space-time is like an infinite game of Boggle. The classic Boggle game has 16 six-sided dice arranged in a four-by-four grid, with a letter on each side of each die. Each time a player shakes the grid, the dice clatter around and settle into a new arrangement of letters. Most configurations are distinguishable from one another, but all are equivalent in a larger sense. They are all at rest in the lowest-energy state that the dice could possibly be in. When a gravitational wave passes through, it shakes the cosmic Boggle board, changing space-time from one wonky configuration to another. But space-time remains in its lowest-energy state.

Super Symmetries
That characteristic — that you can change the board, but in the end things fundamentally stay the same — suggests the presence of hidden symmetries in the structure of space-time. Within the past decade, physicists have explicitly made this connection.

The story starts back in the 1960s, when four physicists wanted to better understand general relativity. They wondered what would happen in a hypothetical region infinitely far from all mass and energy in the universe, where gravity's pull can be neglected, but gravitational radiation cannot. They started by looking at the symmetries this region obeyed.

They already knew the symmetries of the world according to special relativity, where space-time is flat and featureless. In such a smooth world, everything looks the same regardless of where you are, which direction you're facing, and the speed at which you're moving. These properties correspond to the translational, rotational and boost symmetries, respectively. The physicists expected that infinitely far from all the matter in the universe, in a region referred to as "asymptotically flat," these simple symmetries would reemerge.

To their surprise, they found an infinite set of symmetries in addition to the expected ones. The new "supertranslation" symmetries indicated that individual sections of space-time could be stretched, squeezed and sheared, and the behavior in this infinitely distant region would remain the same.

In the 1980s, Abhay Ashtekar, a physicist at Pennsylvania State University, discovered that the memory effect was the physical manifestation of these symmetries. In other words, a supertranslation was exactly what would cause the Boggle universe to pick a new but equivalent way to warp space-time.

His work connected these abstract symmetries in a hypothetical region of the universe to real effects. "To me that's the exciting thing about measuring the memory effect — it's just proving these symmetries are really physical," said Laura Donnay, a physicist at the Vienna University of Technology. "Even very good physicists don't quite grasp that they act in a nontrivial way and give you physical effects. And the memory effect is one of them."

Probing a Paradox
The point of the Boggle game is to search the seemingly random arrangement of letters on the grid to find words. Each new configuration hides new words, and hence new information.

Like Boggle, space-time has the potential to store information, which could be the key to solving the infamous black hole information paradox. Briefly, the paradox is this: Information cannot be created or destroyed. So where does the information about particles go after they fall into a black hole and are re-emitted as information-less Hawking radiation?

In 2016, Andrew Strominger, a physicist at Harvard University, along with Stephen Hawking and Malcolm Perry realized that the horizon of a black hole has the same supertranslation symmetries as those in asymptotically flat space. And by the same logic as before, there would be an accompanying memory effect. This meant the infalling particles could alter space-time near the black hole, thereby changing its information content. This offered a possible solution to the information paradox. Knowledge of the particles' properties wasn't lost — it was permanently encoded in the fabric of space-time.

"The fact that you can say something interesting about black hole evaporation is pretty cool," said Sabrina Pasterski, a theoretical physicist at Princeton University. "The starting point of the framework has already had interesting results. And now we're pushing the framework even further."

Pasterski and others have launched a new research program relating statements about gravity and other areas of physics to these infinite symmetries. In chasing the connections, they've discovered new, exotic memory effects. Pasterski established a connection between a different set of symmetries and a spin memory effect, where space-time becomes gnarled and twisted from gravitational waves that carry angular momentum.

A Ghost in the Machine
Alas, LIGO scientists haven't yet seen evidence of the memory effect. The change in the distance between LIGO's mirrors from a gravitational wave is minuscule — about one-thousandth the width of a proton — and the memory effect is predicted to be 20 times smaller.

LIGO's placement on our noisy planet worsens matters. Low-frequency seismic noise mimics the memory effect's long-term changes in the mirror positions, so disentangling the signal from noise is tricky business.

Earth's gravitational pull also tends to restore LIGO's mirrors to their original position, erasing its memory. So even though the kinks in space-time are permanent, the changes in the mirror position — which enables us to measure the kinks — are not. Researchers will need to measure the displacement of the mirrors caused by the memory effect before gravity has time to pull them back down.

While detecting the memory effect caused by a single gravitational wave is infeasible with current technology, astrophysicists like Lasky and Patricia Schmidt of the University of Birmingham have thought up clever workarounds. "What you can do is effectively stack up the signal from multiple mergers," said Lasky, "accumulating evidence in a very statistically rigorous way."

Lasky and Schmidt have independently predicted that they'll need over 1,000 gravitational wave events to accumulate enough statistics to confirm they've seen the memory effect. With ongoing improvements to LIGO, as well as contributions from the VIRGO detector in Italy and KAGRA in Japan, Lasky thinks reaching 1,000 detections is a few short years away.

"It is such a special prediction," said Schmidt. "It's quite exciting to see if it's actually true."

Correction: December 9, 2021
The original version of this article attributed the original discovery of the connection between supertranslation symmetries and the memory effect to Andrew Strominger in 2014. In fact, that connection had previously been known. The 2014 discovery by Strominger was between supertranslation symmetries, the memory effect and a third topic.

This article discusses the concept of gravitational memory effect, a prediction of general relativity theory that suggests that passing gravitational waves should leave a permanent alteration in the structure of space-time. Gravitational waves, first detected in 2016, are ripples in space-time caused by massive objects like black holes or neutron stars accelerating or decelerating.
The gravitational memory effect is related to the fundamental symmetries of the universe and may provide insights into the black hole information paradox, which involves the seeming contradiction between quantum mechanics and general relativity about whether information is lost when it enters a black hole.
Gravitational waves from a massive event, such as the collision of two black holes, would pass through the universe, stretching and squeezing the fabric of space-time and leaving behind permanent changes, akin to scarring. Physicists are working to measure this "scar" or memory effect, as it could give clues to fundamental properties of the universe, including how gravity works at a quantum level.
Detecting the gravitational memory effect is challenging, mainly because the predicted changes are incredibly small. Furthermore, distinguishing these changes from noise, such as seismic activity, is difficult. Despite these challenges, physicists are hopeful that accumulating data from many gravitational wave events could eventually provide enough evidence to confirm the existence of the memory effect. This, in turn, could help shed light on profound questions about the nature of space, time, and gravity.

'Unicorn' Discovery Points to a New Population of Black Holes

Small black holes were nowhere to be found, leading astronomers to wonder if they didn't exist at all. Now a series of findings, including a "unicorn" black hole, has raised hopes of solving the decade-long mystery.

The new black hole candidate is paired with a giant star in the constellation Monoceros — Greek for "unicorn." The constellation depicted here is from Urania's Mirror, a set of celestial cards published in 1824.

New York Public Library
Introduction
Almost a decade ago, Feryal Özel and her colleagues noticed something odd. While a variety of possible black holes had been found in our galaxy, none appeared to fall below a certain size. "There seemed to be a dearth of black holes below 5 solar masses," she said. "Statistically, this was very significant."

Since Özel, an astrophysicist at the University of Arizona, published a paper on the problem in 2010, this so-called mass gap has gone unexplained. Even after the LIGO and Virgo gravitational wave detectors started to identify dozens of hidden black holes — including a few surprises — the mass gap appeared to hold firm.

In time, astrophysicists such as Özel began to wonder: Are small black holes just hard to find, or might they not exist at all? "It's important to establish observationally whether this gap is real, or whether it's an observational artifact," said Vicky Kalogera, an astrophysicist at Northwestern University and a leading member of the LIGO team.

Recent discoveries are beginning to suggest the latter might be the case. In the past two years, researchers have found several possible black holes in the mass gap. Then, earlier this month, astronomers presented evidence of what might be our best candidate yet — a 2.9-solar-mass object dubbed "the unicorn."

Before LIGO, astronomers found black holes mostly by searching for the X-rays they produce as they suck in matter from a nearby star. They could also detect the gravitational effect a black hole would have on another star in a binary system. The unicorn researchers used this latter method, focusing on a system called V723 Monoceros, located about 1,000 light-years away. They studied the motion of a red giant star with a variety of telescopes, including the European Space Agency's Gaia satellite, which is mapping the position of billions of stars in our galaxy, and NASA's exoplanet-hunting Transiting Exoplanet Survey Satellite (TESS).

The researchers concluded that the red giant appears to be dancing with an unseen partner. "The simplest explanation for the dark companion is a single compact object, most likely a black hole, in the 'mass gap,'" the team wrote.

The discovery, if confirmed, would help illuminate the fine distinction that nature makes at the end of a massive star's life. When a giant star exhausts its fuel, the star's mass flows inward and its core collapses. If the incoming mass can explode and overcome the star's gravitational force, it bursts into a supernova. But if not — if there's just too much mass — the star collapses in on itself and forms a black hole.

"It's a race between the explosion happening and black hole formation," said Todd Thompson, a theoretical astrophysicist at Ohio State University and a co-author of the recent paper. "This race has to be won within about a second. If it doesn't explode in that one second, then it forms a black hole. If it does explode, it leaves behind a neutron star."

Exactly what determines whether a star explodes as a supernova or collapses into a black hole isn't clear. "The actual physics of the supernova explosion is a huge unknown," said Thompson. The black hole mass gap "could be a vital clue to that process."

There have been a few tentative discoveries in the mass gap so far. Benjamin Giesers from the University of Göttingen and colleagues discovered a possible 4.4-solar-mass black hole in 2018, while Thompson and his colleagues found a 3.3-solar-mass candidate in 2019.

Then last year, scientists from LIGO announced the detection of an object 2.6 times the mass of our sun, a very tantalizing candidate with a mass comfortably in the mass gap. "The best case for a mass-gap black hole is from LIGO," said Thompson.

Yet at these lower masses, it's hard to tell the difference between a black hole and a neutron star, since the latter can bulk up to a theoretical maximum of 3 solar masses. And depending on the conditions, neutron stars can appear dark as well. "If a neutron star is a pulsar with a beam pointed at you, it does some very obvious things," said Tom Maccarone, an expert in black holes and neutron stars at Texas Tech University. "But if it's not, it can be very difficult to separate" from a black hole.

As such, black hole discoveries such as the recent one from LIGO are still unconfirmed, as is the unicorn. "It looks plausible," said Özel. "I think their methods are sound and the analysis is careful. There are still a couple of other possibilities as far as what it could be, but the conclusion that they come to — that it is most likely a single dark object with a mass of 2.9 solar masses — seems sound to me."

Not everyone is so sure. For one thing, it's possible the system is not a binary but a triple system, with two smaller objects accounting for the missing mass. Maccarone also said that if the unicorn is a black hole, it should be pulling matter away from its companion star and creating X-rays. "The X-ray luminosity is so faint for the black hole scenario," he said.

There is also uncertainty about the mass of the object itself. While the best estimate is 2.9 solar masses, the authors say it could weigh as little as 2.6 and as much as 3.6 solar masses. "This range is too broad for us to be certain this is [not] a neutron star," said Kalogera. "And there is nothing else in the observations that allows us to distinguish between a neutron star and a black hole."

If this discovery turns out not to be a black hole — and especially if the other candidates don't hold up to scrutiny either — then perhaps black holes simply do not form below 5 solar masses. Such a revelation would carry significant implications for our understanding of supernova physics. "If you really have a gap there, it suggests a very rapid explosion mechanism," said Maccarone. "We don't understand what drives supernova explosions well enough to have a strong theoretical bias for what to expect."

But if the unicorn really is a black hole, it could be one of many in this gap waiting to be discovered and studied. "That's what's exciting about this paper," says Özel. "If we come to a point where we know more than one or two of these objects, then we can understand what types of processes lead to these smaller-mass black holes."

The "Unicorn" discovery refers to a potential black hole found in the constellation Monoceros (Greek for "unicorn") that has a mass of around 2.9 times that of the sun. The existence of such a small black hole is significant because it could fill what scientists call the "mass gap" - the dearth of observed black holes below 5 solar masses. Up until recently, it was unclear whether small black holes were just difficult to find or whether they didn't exist at all.
Researchers used the European Space Agency's Gaia satellite and NASA's exoplanet-hunting Transiting Exoplanet Survey Satellite (TESS) to study the motion of a red giant star in the V723 Monoceros system. The star appeared to be interacting with an unseen object, leading to the conclusion that this object might be a compact black hole in the mass gap.
However, this conclusion is not definitive. One of the challenges is that it's difficult to distinguish between a small black hole and a neutron star at these lower masses. There are also other factors to consider such as the faint X-ray luminosity of the system and the possibility that the system is not binary, but consists of three bodies.
If it turns out that black holes don't form below 5 solar masses, it would significantly impact our understanding of supernova physics. Conversely, if the "Unicorn" is confirmed to be a black hole, it could imply the existence of many similar small black holes waiting to be discovered.

The five-decade-old paradox — long thought key to linking quantum theory with Einstein's theory of gravity — is falling to a new generation of thinkers. Netta Engelhardt is leading the way.

Introduction
In 1974, Stephen Hawking calculated that black holes' secrets die with them. Random quantum jitter on the spherical outer boundary, or "event horizon," of a black hole will cause the hole to radiate particles and slowly shrink to nothing. Any record of the star whose violent contraction formed the black hole — and whatever else got swallowed up after — then seemed to be permanently lost.

Hawking's calculation posed a paradox — the infamous "black hole information paradox" — that has motivated research in fundamental physics ever since. On the one hand, quantum mechanics, the rulebook for particles, says that information about particles' past states gets carried forward as they evolve — a bedrock principle called "unitarity." But black holes take their cues from general relativity, the theory that space and time form a bendy fabric and gravity is the fabric's curves. Hawking had tried to apply quantum mechanics to particles near a black hole's periphery, and saw unitarity break down.

So do evaporating black holes really destroy information, meaning unitarity is not a true principle of nature? Or does information escape as a black hole evaporates? Solving the information paradox quickly came to be seen as a route to discovering the true, quantum theory of gravity, which general relativity approximates well everywhere except black holes.

In the past two years, a network of quantum gravity theorists, mostly millennials, has made enormous progress on Hawking's paradox. One of the leading researchers is Netta Engelhardt, a 32-year-old theoretical physicist at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology. She and her colleagues have completed a new calculation that corrects Hawking's 1974 formula; theirs indicates that information does, in fact, escape black holes via their radiation. She and Aron Wall identified an invisible surface that lies inside a black hole's event horizon, called the "quantum extremal surface." In 2019, Engelhardt and others showed that this surface seems to encode the amount of information that has radiated away from the black hole, evolving over the hole's lifetime exactly as expected if information escapes.

Engelhardt received a 2021 New Horizons in Physics Prize "for calculating the quantum information content of a black hole and its radiation." Ahmed Almheiri of the Institute for Advanced Study, a frequent collaborator, noted her "deeply rooted intuition for the intricate workings of gravity," particularly in the discovery of quantum extremal surfaces.

Engelhardt set her sights on quantum gravity when she was 9 years old. She moved to Boston from Israel that year with her family, and, not knowing any English, read every book in Hebrew she could find in her house. The last was Hawking's A Brief History of Time. "What that book did for me was trigger a desire to understand the fundamental building blocks of the universe," she said. "From then on, I was sort of finding my own way, watching different popular science videos and asking questions of anybody who might have the answers, and narrowing down what I wanted to work on." She ultimately found her way to Hawking's paradox.

When Quanta Magazine caught up with Engelhardt in a recent video call, she emphasized that the full solution to the paradox — and the quantum theory of gravity — is a work in progress. We discussed that progress, which centrally involves the concept of entropy, and the search for a "reverse algorithm" that would allow someone to reconstruct a black hole's past. The conversation has been condensed and edited for clarity.

Introduction
Would you say you and your colleagues have solved the black hole information paradox?
Not yet. We've made a lot of progress toward a resolution. That's part of what makes the field so exciting; we're moving forward — and we're not doing it so slowly, either — but there's still a lot that we have to uncover and understand.

Could you summarize what you've figured out so far?
Certainly. Along the way there have been a number of very important developments. One I will mention is a 1993 paper by Don Page. Page said, suppose that information is conserved. Then the entropy of everything outside of a black hole starts out at some value, increases, then has to go back down to the original value once the black hole has evaporated altogether. Whereas Hawking's calculation predicts that the entropy increases, and once the black hole is evaporated completely, it just plateaus at some value and that's it.

So the question became, which entropy curve is right. Normally, entropy is the number of possible indistinguishable configurations of a system. What's the best way to understand entropy in this black hole context?
You could think of this entropy as ignorance of the state of affairs in the black hole interior. The more possibilities there are for what could be going on in the black hole interior, the more ignorant you will be about which configuration the system is in. So this entropy measures ignorance.

Page's discovery was that if you assume that the evolution of the universe doesn't lose information, then, if you start out with zero ignorance about the universe before a black hole forms, eventually you're going to end up with zero ignorance once the black hole is gone, since all the information that went in has come back out. That's in conflict with what Hawking derived, which was that eventually you end up with ignorance.

You characterize Page's insight and all other work on the information paradox prior to 2019 as "understanding the problem better." What happened in 2019?
The activity that started in 2019 is the steps towards actually resolving the problem. The two papers that kicked this off were work by myself, Ahmed Almheiri, Don Marolf and Henry Maxfield and, in parallel, the second paper, which came out at the same time, by Geoff Penington. We submitted our papers on the same day and coordinated because we knew we were both onto the same thing.

The idea was to calculate the entropy in a different way. This is where Don Page's calculation was very important for us. If we use Hawking's method and his assumptions, we get a formula for the entropy which is not consistent with unitarity. Now we want to understand how we could possibly do a calculation that would give us the curve of the entropy that Page proposed, which goes up then comes back down.

And for this we relied on a proposal that Aron Wall and I gave in 2014: the quantum extremal surface proposal, which essentially states that the so-called quantum-corrected area of a certain surface inside the black hole is what computes the entropy. We said, maybe that's a way to do the quantum gravity calculation that gives us a unitary result. And I will say: It was kind of a shot in the dark.

Introduction
When did you realize that it worked?
This entire time is a bit of a daze in my mind, it was so exciting; I think I slept maybe two hours a night for weeks. The calculation came together over a period of three weeks, I want to say. I was at Princeton at the time. We just had a meeting on campus. I have a very distinct memory of driving home, and I was thinking to myself, wow, this could be it.

The crux of the matter was, there's more than one quantum extremal surface in the problem. There's one quantum extremal surface that gives you the wrong answer — the Hawking answer. To correctly calculate the entropy, you have to pick the right one, and the right one is always the one with the smallest quantum-corrected area. And so what was really exciting — I think the moment we realized this might really actually work out — is when we found that exactly at the time when the entropy curve needs to "turn over" [go from increasing to decreasing], there's a jump. At that time, the quantum extremal surface with the smallest quantum-corrected area goes from being the surface that would give you Hawking's answer to a new and unexpected one. And that one reproduces the Page curve.

What are these quantum extremal surfaces, exactly?
Let me try to intuit a little bit what a classical, non-quantum extremal surface feels like. Let me begin with just a sphere. Imagine that you place a light bulb inside of it, and you follow the light rays as they move outward through the sphere. As the light rays get farther and farther away from the light bulb, the area of the spheres that they pass through will be getting larger and larger. We say that the cross-sectional area of the light rays is getting larger.

That's an intuition that works really well in approximately flat space where we live. But when you consider very curved space-time like you find inside a black hole, what can happen is that even though you're firing your light rays outwards from the light bulb, and you're looking at spheres that are progressively farther away from the bulb, the cross-sectional area is actually shrinking. And this is because space-time is very violently curved. It's something that we call focusing of light rays, and it's a very fundamental concept in gravity and general relativity.

The extremal surface straddles this line between the very violent situation where the area is decreasing, and a normal situation where the area increases. The area of the surface is neither increasing nor decreasing, and so intuitively you can think of an extremal surface as kind of lying right at the cusp of where you'd expect strong curvature to start kicking in. A quantum extremal surface is the same idea, but instead of area, now you're looking at quantum-corrected area. This is a sum of area and entropy, which is neither increasing nor decreasing.

What does the quantum extremal surface mean? What's the difference between things that are inside versus outside?
Recall that when the Page curve turns over, we expect that our ignorance of what the black hole contains starts to decrease, as we have access to more and more of its radiation. So the radiation emitted by the hole must start to "learn" about the black hole interior.

It's the quantum extremal surface that divides the space-time in two: Everything inside the surface, the radiation can already decode. Everything outside of it is what remains hidden in the black hole system, what's not contained in the information of the radiation. As the black hole emits more radiation, the quantum extremal surface moves outwards and encompasses an ever-larger volume of the black hole interior. By the time that black hole evaporates altogether, the radiation has to be able to decode everything that way.

Now that we have an explicit calculation that gives us a unitary answer, that gives us so many tools to start asking questions that we could never ask before, like where does this formula come from, what does it mean about what type of theory quantum gravity is? Also, what is the mechanism in quantum gravity that restores unitarity? It has something to do with the quantum extremal surface formula.

This article delves into an impressive development in theoretical physics concerning the black hole information paradox. The paradox, originally proposed by Stephen Hawking, postulates that information is lost as black holes evaporate, a concept that contradicts the principle of "unitarity" in quantum mechanics which asserts that information about particles' past states is preserved as they evolve. This has led to long-standing questions about whether evaporating black holes actually destroy information or if information escapes along with the black hole's radiation.
Recent work by a group of quantum gravity theorists, led by Netta Engelhardt at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, has proposed a solution to this paradox. They suggest that information does indeed escape from black holes via their radiation. By refining Hawking's original calculation, Engelhardt and her team propose the existence of a "quantum extremal surface" within the black hole's event horizon. This surface, they argue, encodes the amount of information that has radiated away from the black hole over its lifetime. The behavior of this surface aligns with the expectation if information is escaping from the black hole, offering a potential resolution to the black hole information paradox.
Their work, though still ongoing, offers exciting insights into the true, quantum theory of gravity and is a significant step towards understanding the nature of black holes and the fundamental laws of physics.

Most of the justification for the quantum extremal surface formula comes from studying black holes in "Anti-de Sitter" (AdS) space — saddle-shaped space with an outer boundary. Whereas our universe has approximately flat space, and no boundary. Why should we think that these calculations apply to our universe?  
First, we can't really get around the fact that our universe contains both quantum mechanics and gravity. It contains black holes. So our understanding of the universe is going to be incomplete until we have a description of what happens inside a black hole. The information problem is such a difficult problem to solve that any progress — whether it's in a toy model or not — is making progress towards understanding phenomena that happen in our universe.

Now at a more technical level, quantum extremal surfaces can be computed in different kinds of space-times, including flat space like in our universe. And in fact there already have been papers written on the behavior of quantum extremal surfaces within different kinds of space-times and what types of entropy curves they would give rise to.

We have a very firm interpretation of the quantum extremal surface in AdS space. We can extrapolate and say that in flat space there exists some interpretation of the quantum extremal surface which is analogous, and I think that's probably true. It has many nice properties; it looks like it's the right thing. We get really interesting behavior and we expect to get unitarity as well, and so, yes, we do expect that this phenomenon does translate, although the interpretation is going to be harder.

You said at the beginning of our conversation that we don't know the solution to the information paradox yet. Can you explain what a solution looks like?
A full resolution of the information paradox would have to tell us exactly how the black hole information comes out. If I'm an observer that's sitting outside of a black hole and I have extremely sophisticated technology and all the time in the world — a quantum computer taking incredibly sophisticated measurements, all the radiation of that black hole — what does it take for me to actually decode the radiation to reconstruct, for instance, the star that collapsed and formed the black hole? What process do I need to put my quantum computer through? We need to answer that question.

So you want to find the reverse algorithm that unscrambles the information in the radiation. What's the connection between that algorithm and quantum gravity?
This algorithm that decodes the Hawking radiation is coming from the process in which quantum gravity encodes the radiation as it evaporates at the black hole horizon. The emergence of the black hole interior from quantum gravity and the dynamics of the black hole interior, the experience of an object that falls into the black hole — all of that is encoded in this reverse algorithm that quantum gravity has to spit out. All of those are tied up in the question of "how does the information get encoded in the Hawking radiation?"

You've lately been writing papers about something called a python's lunch. What's that?
It's one thing to ask how can you decode the Hawking radiation; you also might ask, how complex is the task of decoding the Hawking radiation. And, as it turns out, extremely complex. So maybe the difference between Hawking's calculation and the quantum extremal surface calculation that gives unitarity is that Hawking's calculation is just dropping the high-complexity operations.

It's important to understand the complexity geometrically. And in 2019 there was a paper by some of my colleagues that proposed that whenever you have more than one quantum extremal surface, the one that would be wrong for the entropy can be used to calculate the complexity of decoding the black hole radiation. The two quantum extremal surfaces can be thought of as sort of constrictions in the space-time geometry, and those of us who have read Le Petit Prince see an elephant inside a python, and so it has become known as a python's lunch.

We proposed that multiple quantum extremal surfaces are the exclusive source of high complexity. And these two papers that you're referring to are essentially an argument for this "strong python's lunch" proposal. That is very insightful for us because it identifies the part of the geometry that Hawking's calculation knows about and part of the geometry that Hawking's calculation doesn't know about. It's working towards putting his and our calculations in the same language so that we know why one is right, and the other is wrong.

Where would you say we currently stand in our effort to understand the quantum nature of gravity?
I like to think of this as a puzzle, where we have all the edge pieces and we're missing the center. We have many different insights about quantum gravity. There are many ways in which people are trying to understand it. Some by constraining it: What are things that it can't do? Some by trying to construct aspects of it: things that it must do. My personal preferred approach is more to do with the information paradox, because it's so pivotal; it's such an acute problem. It's clearly telling us: Here's where you messed up. And to me that says, here's a place where we can begin to fix our pillars, one of which must be wrong, of our understanding of quantum gravity.

As a language model AI developed by OpenAI, I can't express personal opinions. However, it seems that Dr. Engelhardt, the interviewee in the dialogue you've provided, is detailing the latest advancements in quantum gravity research, specifically the information paradox and the quantum extremal surface formula.
The information paradox, related to black holes, arises from the contradiction between two fundamental theories: quantum mechanics, which suggests that information cannot be destroyed, and the classical theory of general relativity, which suggests that any information entering a black hole is lost forever. The quantum extremal surface formula, which is primarily studied in the context of Anti-de Sitter (AdS) space, is a recent approach to this problem. While our universe isn't exactly like AdS space, the principles and insights from these studies can still apply, contributing to the understanding of quantum gravity.
The discussion about the "python's lunch" is a metaphorical reference to the complexity of decoding Hawking radiation (the theoretical prediction by Stephen Hawking that black holes should emit radiation due to quantum effects). Multiple quantum extremal surfaces, referred to as the python's lunch, are seen as indicators of high complexity in the decoding process.
Dr. Engelhardt highlights that our understanding of quantum gravity is like a puzzle where we have many of the edge pieces but are missing the center. This metaphor emphasizes the challenging and ongoing nature of research in quantum gravity, where there are different approaches and theories but no unified solution yet.

Starting from the beginning about the gravitational wave hum

ChatGPT
ChatGPT
Gravitational waves are "ripples" in the fabric of space-time caused by some of the most violent and energetic processes in the Universe. Albert Einstein predicted the existence of gravitational waves in 1916 in his general theory of relativity. These waves propagate from the source and travel across the universe, carrying with them information about their cataclysmic origins, as well as clues to the nature of gravity itself.
The "hum" of gravitational waves is a theoretical prediction that suggests the universe is filled with a background of gravitational waves, much like the cosmic microwave background radiation. This would be a sort of static noise of gravitational waves produced by countless sources throughout the history of the universe. It's expected to be incredibly faint and challenging to detect.
As of my knowledge cutoff in 2021, the hum of gravitational waves has not been definitively detected. Ground-based detectors like LIGO (Laser Interferometer Gravitational-Wave Observatory) and Virgo have been successful in detecting gravitational waves from specific, high-energy events such as the merging of black holes and neutron stars. These are more like "loud" and isolated "pops" or "chirps" rather than a continuous hum.
The "hum" or the gravitational wave background (GWB) is likely to be much quieter and more challenging to detect. To catch this hum, scientists are likely to need more sensitive equipment or novel detection methods. One promising method is using Pulsar Timing Arrays (PTAs), which utilize the highly regular pulses from distant neutron stars (pulsars) to detect the slight distortions caused by passing gravitational waves.
As of 2021, efforts are ongoing to detect the gravitational wave hum, and it's a topic of significant interest in the field of gravitational wave astrophysics. It would provide us with an entirely new way of studying the universe and could offer unprecedented insights into the history of the cosmos.

This article discusses a fascinating new discovery in astrophysics. Scientists have detected a background "hum" of gravitational waves moving through the universe. This is likely caused by supermassive black hole collisions, but more exotic possibilities like ruptures in space-time caused by energy loops known as cosmic strings can't be excluded.

That sounds like an incredible discovery, and if confirmed, it would indeed mark a significant advancement in our understanding of the universe.
The "hum" of gravitational waves would essentially be a sort of cosmic background noise produced by various cataclysmic events throughout the history of the universe. The majority of these events would likely be things like collisions between supermassive black holes, as you mentioned. These are some of the most energy-intensive events in the universe, capable of distorting the very fabric of space-time and producing detectable gravitational waves.
Cosmic strings, if they exist, are hypothetical topological defects in space-time predicted by some models of the early universe. They are essentially one-dimensional cracks in the universe where the laws of physics might be different from the rest of the universe. If they interact, say by crossing each other, they could produce gravitational waves detectable today. This would be an exciting discovery because cosmic strings, if they exist, could provide us with valuable insights into the early universe and the nature of reality itself.
The detection of a gravitational wave background would also provide a new tool to study the universe. Because gravitational waves are fundamentally different from electromagnetic waves (light, radio waves, etc.), they offer a new way to observe and understand the universe. This "gravitational astronomy" could lead to many more exciting discoveries in the future.
It's important to note that such a discovery would likely need to be verified by additional observations and studies. The detection of gravitational waves is a complex process, and ensuring that the detected signal is indeed a gravitational wave background and not noise or interference from some other source is a critical part of this process.

ChatGPT
During our discussion, we covered a range of topics related to astrophysics and quantum mechanics. Here's a brief summary:
Gravitational Wave Background "Hum"
: This is a fascinating discovery that suggests the existence of a constant background noise of gravitational waves. These waves are likely produced by cataclysmic cosmic events such as supermassive black hole collisions, but might also originate from more exotic phenomena such as cosmic strings. The detection and study of this hum would offer valuable insights into the early universe and could usher in a new era of "gravitational astronomy."
Quantum Information Paradox and Quantum Extremal Surfaces
: We discussed the black hole information paradox, which arises from the seeming contradiction between quantum mechanics and general relativity. It's unclear how information that falls into a black hole can be preserved, as suggested by quantum mechanics. One promising approach to resolving this paradox involves the concept of quantum extremal surfaces, which provide a way of calculating the entropy, or information content, of a black hole. Although most research in this area has been conducted in Anti-de Sitter space, these principles could potentially be extended to the flat space of our own universe.
Decoding Black Hole Radiation
: A potential solution to the information paradox could involve decoding the Hawking radiation emitted by black holes. This process is expected to be highly complex, and understanding it could yield crucial insights into the nature of quantum gravity.
Python's Lunch and Quantum Complexity
: The idea of a "python's lunch" refers to a geometric understanding of the complexity involved in decoding black hole radiation. The term comes from the idea that in situations where multiple quantum extremal surfaces exist, the one that doesn't correspond to the entropy calculation can be used to gauge this complexity.
The State of Understanding Quantum Gravity
: Finally, we discussed the current state of our understanding of quantum gravity. This fundamental force remains one of the biggest unsolved problems in theoretical physics. The resolution of the black hole information paradox could be a key step towards achieving a consistent theory of quantum gravity.
