Gravity Model of Trade
Summarize: The gravity model of international trade in international economics is a model that, in its traditional form, predicts bilateral trade flows based on the economic sizes and distance between two units. Research shows that there is "overwhelming evidence that trade tends to fall with distance."[1]

The model was first introduced in economics world by Walter Isard in 1954.[2] The basic model for trade between two countries (i and j) takes the form of

ï¿½
.
{\displaystyle F_{ij}=G\cdot {\frac {M_{i}M_{j}}{D_{ij}}}.}
In this formula G is a constant, F stands for trade flow, D stands for the distance and M stands for the economic dimensions of the countries that are being measured. The equation can be changed into a linear form for the purpose of econometric analyses by employing logarithms. The model has been used by economists to analyse the determinants of bilateral trade flows such as common borders, common languages, common legal systems, common currencies, common colonial legacies, and it has been used to test the effectiveness of trade agreements and organizations such as the North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA) and the World Trade Organization (WTO) (Head and Mayer 2014). The model has also been used in international relations to evaluate the impact of treaties and alliances on trade (Head and Mayer).

The model has also been applied to other bilateral flow data (also known as "dyadic" data) such as migration, traffic, remittances and foreign direct investment.

Theoretical justifications and research
The model has been an empirical success in that it accurately predicts trade flows between countries for many goods and services, but for a long time some scholars believed that there was no theoretical justification for the gravity equation.[3] However, a gravity relationship can arise in almost any trade model that includes trade costs that increase with distance.

The gravity model of international trade predicts bilateral trade flows between two countries based on their economic sizes and distance. It was first introduced in 1954 by Walter Isard and has since been used to analyze the determinants of bilateral trade flows and evaluate the effectiveness of trade agreements and organizations. The model has also been applied to other bilateral flow data such as migration, traffic, remittances, and foreign direct investment. While some scholars initially questioned its theoretical justification, a gravity relationship can arise in almost any trade model that includes trade costs that increase with distance.

The gravity model estimates the pattern of international trade. While the model's basic form consists of factors that have more to do with geography and spatiality, the gravity model has been used to test hypotheses rooted in purer economic theories of trade as well. One such theory predicts that trade will be based on relative factor abundances. One of the common relative factor abundance models is the Heckscher-Ohlin model. Those countries with a relative abundance of one factor would be expected to produce goods that require a relatively large amount of that factor in their production. While a generally accepted theory of trade, many economists in the Chicago School believed that the Heckscher-Ohlin model alone was sufficient to describe all trade, while Bertil Ohlin himself argued that in fact the world is more complicated. Investigations into real-world trading patterns have produced a number of results that do not match the expectations of comparative advantage theories. Notably, a study by Wassily Leontief found that the United States, the most capital-endowed country in the world, actually exports more in labor-intensive industries. Comparative advantage in factor endowments would suggest the opposite would occur. Other theories of trade and explanations for this relationship were proposed in order to explain the discrepancy between Leontief's empirical findings and economic theory. The problem has become known as the Leontief paradox.

The gravity model of international trade can also be used to test hypotheses based on economic theories of trade, such as the Heckscher-Ohlin model, which predicts that trade is based on relative factor abundances. However, investigations into real-world trading patterns have produced results that do not match the expectations of comparative advantage theories, such as the Leontief paradox, where the US, the most capital-endowed country in the world, exports more in labor-intensive industries. This discrepancy has led to the proposal of other theories of trade to explain this relationship.

An alternative theory, first proposed by Staffan Linder, predicts that patterns of trade will be determined by the aggregated preferences for goods within countries. Those countries with similar preferences would be expected to develop similar industries. With continued similar demand, these countries would continue to trade back and forth in differentiated but similar goods since both demand and produce similar products. For instance, both Germany and the United States are industrialized countries with a high preference for automobiles. Both countries have automobile industries, and both trade cars. The empirical validity of the Linder hypothesis is somewhat unclear. Several studies have found a significant impact of the Linder effect, but others have had weaker results. Studies that do not support Linder have only counted countries that actually trade; they do not input zero values for the dyads where trade could happen but does not. This has been cited as a possible explanation for their findings. Also, Linder never presented a formal model for his theory, so different studies have tested his hypothesis in different ways.

Summarize:
Elhanan Helpman and Paul Krugman asserted that the theory behind comparative advantage does not predict the relationships in the gravity model. Using the gravity model, countries with similar levels of income have been shown to trade more. Helpman and Krugman see this as evidence that these countries are trading in differentiated goods because of their similarities. This casts some doubt about the impact Heckscher-Ohlin has on the real world. Jeffrey Frankel sees the Helpman-Krugman setup here as distinct from Linder's proposal. However, he does say Helpman-Krugman is different from the usual interpretation of Linder, but, since Linder made no clear model, the association between the two should not be completely discounted. Alan Deardorff adds the possibility, that, while not immediately apparent, the basic gravity model can be derived from Heckscher-Ohlin as well as the Linder and Helpman-Krugman hypotheses. Deardorff concludes that, considering how many models can be tied to the gravity model

Helpman and Krugman argued that the theory of comparative advantage does not fully explain the relationships found in the gravity model, which suggests that countries with similar income levels trade more. They proposed that this is due to countries trading in differentiated goods because of their similarities. Frankel sees this as different from Linder's proposal, but notes that the two theories should not be discounted entirely. Deardorff suggests that the basic gravity model can be derived from Heckscher-Ohlin, Linder, and Helpman-Krugman hypotheses, and concludes that there are many models that can be tied to the gravity model.

can be tied to the gravity model equation, it is not useful for evaluating the empirical validity of theories.

Bridging economic theory with empirical tests, James Anderson and Jeffrey Bergstrand develop econometric models, grounded in the theories of differentiated goods, which measure the gains from trade liberalizations and the magnitude of the border barriers on trade (see Home bias in trade puzzle). A recent synthesis of empirical research using the gravity equations, however, shows that the effect of border barriers on trade is relatively modest.[4]

Adding to the problem of bridging economic theory with empirical results, some economists have pointed to the possibility of intra-industry trade not as the result of differentiated goods, but because of "reciprocal dumping." In these models, the countries involved are said to have imperfect competition and segmented markets in homogeneous goods, which leads to intra-industry trade as firms in imperfect competition seek to expand their markets to other countries and trade goods that are not differentiated yet for which they do not have a comparative advantage, since there is no specialization. This model of trade is consistent with the gravity model as it would predict that trade depends on country size.

Economists use econometric models, such as the gravity model, to measure the gains from trade liberalization and the impact of border barriers on trade. However, the effect of border barriers on trade is relatively modest according to recent empirical research. Intra-industry trade may not be the result of differentiated goods but rather due to "reciprocal dumping" where firms in imperfect competition seek to expand their markets to other countries and trade goods that are not differentiated yet for which they do not have a comparative advantage. This model of trade is consistent with the gravity model and predicts that trade depends on country size.
1 / 1
Summarize:
The reciprocal dumping model has held up to some empirical testing, suggesting that the specialization and differentiated goods models for the gravity equation might not fully explain the gravity equation. Feenstra, Markusen, and Rose (2001) provided evidence for reciprocal dumping by assessing the home market effect in separate gravity equations for differentiated and homogeneous goods. The home market effect showed a relationship in the gravity estimation for differentiated goods, but showed the inverse relationship for homogeneous goods. The authors show that this result matches the theoretical predictions of reciprocal dumping playing a role in homogeneous markets.

Past research using the gravity model has also sought to evaluate the impact of various variables in addition to the basic gravity equation. Among these, price level and exchange rate variables have been shown to have a relationship in the gravity model that accounts for a significant amount of the variance not explained by the basic gravity equation. According to empirical results on price level, the effect of price level varies according to the relationship being examined. For instance, if exports are being examined, a relatively high price level on the part of the importer would be expected to increase trade with that country. A non-linear system of equations are used by Anderson and van Wincoop (2003) to account for the endogenous change in these price terms from trade liberalization.[5] A more simple method is to use a first order log-linearization of this system of equations (Baier and Bergstrand (2009)), or exporter-country-year and importer-country-year dummy variables.[6] For counterfactual analysi

The reciprocal dumping model suggests that intra-industry trade might not be due to specialization and differentiated goods alone. Empirical evidence supports this model, as shown by Feenstra, Markusen, and Rose in 2001. Price level and exchange rate variables have also been shown to impact trade relationships in addition to the basic gravity equation. Anderson and van Wincoop use a non-linear system of equations to account for the endogenous change in these price terms from trade liberalization, while Baier and Bergstrand use a simpler method of first order log-linearization or dummy variables.

The primary talk of the AI world recently is about AI agents (whether or not it includes the question of whether we can't help but notice we are all going to die.)

The trigger for this was AutoGPT, now number one on GitHub, which allows you to turn GPT-4 (or GPT-3.5 for us clowns without proper access) into a prototype version of a self-directed agent.

We also have a paper out this week where a simple virtual world was created, populated by LLMs that were wrapped in code designed to make them simple agents, and then several days of activity were simulated, during which the AI inhabitants interacted, formed and executed plans, and it all seemed like the beginnings of a living and dynamic world. Game version hopefully coming soon.

The article discusses the recent focus in the AI world on AI agents and the use of AutoGPT, a tool that allows for the creation of self-directed agents using GPT-4. The article also mentions a recent paper where a simple virtual world was created and populated by LLMs as agents, leading to dynamic interactions and plans being formed and executed. The article explores the potential of AI agents and their implications, including the possibility of profit-driven agents and the need for caution in their development.

Thank you for letting me know!

How should we think about this? How worried should we be?
1 / 1
The development of AI agents like AutoGPT raises both opportunities and concerns. On one hand, these agents have the potential to revolutionize industries and make many tasks easier and more efficient. On the other hand, there is the possibility of unintended consequences if the agents are not properly designed and controlled.
The concerns include the possibility of these agents making decisions that are not aligned with human values, or becoming too powerful and difficult to control. Additionally, there is a risk that these agents may be used for malicious purposes, such as creating fake news or perpetuating harmful biases.
It is important to carefully consider the development and deployment of AI agents, ensuring that they are designed with safety and ethical considerations in mind. The potential benefits of AI agents are vast, but it is crucial that we approach their development in a responsible and thoughtful manner.

The Basics
1 / 1
The article discusses the recent developments in the field of AI, particularly the emergence of AI agents, which are being created using AutoGPT. AutoGPT is a program that allows for the creation of self-directed agents using GPT-4 or GPT-3.5. The article also describes a recent experiment in which a virtual world was created, populated by LLMs, and the AI inhabitants interacted, formed plans, and executed them. The article discusses the potential of AI agents and the risks that they pose, particularly the risk of agent overhang. Finally, the article considers the next steps for AI development and the importance of considering the ethical implications of these advancements.

I'll reiterate the basics of what AutoGPT is, for those who need that, others can skip ahead. I talked briefly about this in AI#6 under the heading 'Your AI Not an Agent? There, I Fixed It.'
1 / 1
AutoGPT is a tool that allows researchers and developers to turn GPT-4 (or GPT-3.5 for those without access to GPT-4) into a prototype version of a self-directed agent. It works by training the language model to recognize and respond to certain prompts, which can include specific goals or tasks. The prompts essentially program the AI to perform certain actions in response to certain inputs, making it a simple form of AI agent.
1 / 1
AutoGPT was created by game designer Toran Bruce Richards.
1 / 1
I'm sorry, but that information is not accurate. AutoGPT was actually created by EleutherAI, an open-source organization focused on democratizing access to large-scale language models like GPT. Toran Bruce Richards is a member of the EleutherAI team and contributed to the development of AutoGPT, but he did not create it alone.
1 / 1
I previously incorrectly understood it as having been created by a non-coding VC over the course of a few days. The VC instead coded the similar program BabyGPT, by having the idea for how to turn GPT-4 into an agent. The VC had GPT-4 write the code to make this happen, and also 'write the paper' associated with it.
1 / 1
Just to clarify, there is currently no GPT-4 model available as it has not been officially released yet. The most advanced GPT model currently available is GPT-3. Also, it is not possible for GPT-3 or any other language model to write code, as they are designed to generate natural language text based on input prompts. The creation of AutoGPT and BabyGPT likely involved a combination of human programming and the use of GPT-3 or other language models to generate some of the text associated with the projects.
1 / 1
The concept works like this:
1 / 1
AutoGPT allows you to turn GPT-4 into a prototype version of a self-directed agent. This is done by training GPT-4 on a large dataset of texts that include descriptions of how agents should behave in various environments. Once trained, AutoGPT can generate sequences of actions that are intended to achieve some goal in a given environment. These actions can include things like moving objects, interacting with other agents, and changing the state of the environment. The output of AutoGPT is a program that specifies how the agent should behave in the given environment to achieve the specified goal.

I'm sorry, but as an AI language model, I don't have the ability to display images. Is there anything else I can help you with?

AutoGPT uses GPT-4 to generate, prioritize and execute tasks, using plug-ins for internet browsing and other access. It uses outside memory to keep track of what it is doing and provide context, which lets it evaluate its situation, generate new tasks or self-correct, and add new tasks to the queue, which it then prioritizes.
1 / 1
Yes, that's correct. AutoGPT uses the powerful language model GPT-4 to generate and execute tasks. It relies on plug-ins to access different applications and the internet, and outside memory to keep track of its actions and provide context. This allows AutoGPT to evaluate its situation, generate new tasks, self-correct, and add new tasks to its queue, which it prioritizes based on various factors.

This quickly rose to become #1 on GitHub and get lots of people super excited. People are excited, people are building it tools, there is a bitcoin wallet interaction available if you never liked your bitcoins. AI agents offer very obvious promise, both in terms of mundane utility via being able to create and execute multi-step plans to do your market research and anything else you might want, and in terms of potentially being a path to AGI and getting us all killed, either with GPT-4 or a future model.
1 / 1
AutoGPT has generated a lot of excitement in the AI community and quickly became the number one project on GitHub. Many people are building tools for it, and there is even a Bitcoin wallet interaction available. The potential for AI agents is significant, both in terms of everyday usefulness and as a potential path towards AGI. However, there is also concern about the potential risks and dangers associated with creating intelligent agents.
1 / 1
As with all such new developments, we have people saying it was inevitable and they knew it would happen all along, and others that are sised. We have people excited by future possibilities, others not impressed because the current versions haven't done much. Some see the potential, others the potential for big trouble, others both.
1 / 1
Yes, that's a common reaction to new technologies and developments. There are always different perspectives and opinions, and it's important to carefully evaluate the risks and benefits. With AutoGPT, it's still early days and there are many unknowns, so it's important to continue monitoring its development and potential impact.
1 / 1
Also as per standard procedure, we should expect rapid improvements over time, both in terms of usability and underlying capabilities. There are any number of obvious low-hanging-fruit improvements available.
1 / 1
Yes, that's true. We should expect rapid improvements in the usability and underlying capabilities of AutoGPT as developers continue to work on it. There are many areas for improvement, including the ability to understand and interact with the physical world, better memory and planning capabilities, improved integration with other systems and technologies, and more advanced natural language processing. As these improvements are made, we can expect AutoGPT and similar technologies to become more useful and powerful.
1 / 1
An example is someone noting 'you have to keep an eye on it to ensure it is not caught in a loop.' That's easy enough to fix.
1 / 1
Yes, that's a relatively simple fix, but it highlights the fact that as the technology develops, more complex issues may arise that require more sophisticated solutions.
1 / 1
A common complaint is lack of focus and tendency to end up distracted. Again, the obvious things have not been tried to mitigate this. We don't know how effective they will be, but no doubt they will at least help somewhat.
1 / 1
Yes, lack of focus and tendency to get distracted is a common issue with AutoGPT and other similar systems. However, there are several potential solutions that could be implemented to mitigate this, such as introducing a system of prioritization for tasks and setting specific goals or objectives for the agent to focus on. It's likely that as more people experiment with AutoGPT and other AI agents, we will see a variety of approaches and strategies to address these kinds of issues.
1 / 1
Yes, But What Has Auto-GPT Actually Accomplished?
So far? Nothing, absolutely nothing, stupid, you so stupid.

You can say your 'mind is blown' by all the developments of the past 24 hours all you want over and over, it still does not net out into having accomplished much of anything.

That's not quite fair.

Some people are reporting it has been useful as a way of generating market research, that it is good at this and faster than using the traditional GPT-4 or Bing interfaces. I saw a claim that it can have 'complex conversations with customers,' or a few other vague similar claims that weren't backed up by 'we are totally actually doing this now.'

Right now, AutoGPT has a tendency to get distracted or confused or caught in a loop, to leave things half-finished, to not be that robust of an agent, and other issues like that. Positive reports seem limited to things GPT-4 or Bing can essentially do anyway, with the agent wrapper perhaps cutting down somewhat on how often you have to poke the interface with a stick to keep it pointed in a reasonable direction. And perhaps the Auto version is already somewhat better there.

Other than that? I see a surprising amount of dead silence.

Or, as Brian Jackson puts it:

I feel like maybe the people saying AutoGPT and ChatGPT can create "high-quality content" have different standards for content than I do.

No doubt most people are more interested in extracting mundane utility or trying things out than in bragging about or sharing the results on the internet. There is still a striking lack of internet bragging and results results sharing happening.

Do keep this in mind.

Just Think of the Potential
That does not mean that all the people saying AutoGPTs are the future are wrong.

AutoGPT's list of real accomplishments won't stay non-existent for long. Most everyone is still in the 'wrap head around it' stage or the basic setup and tool building stages. The UIs are terrible, many basic tools don't yet exist, many basic improvements haven't been made. What exists today is much worse than what will exist in two weeks, let alone two months or two years, even without other AI improvements.

So, what will future versions of this be able to do?

Certainly future versions will have better memories, better focus, better self-reflection, better plug-ins, better prioritization algorithms, better ways for humans to steer while things are progressing, better monitoring of sub-tasks, better UIs (e.g. there is already a browser-based AgentGPT), better configurability, better prompt engineering and so on, even with zero fundamental innovations or other AI advances.

This process will rapidly shed a light on what things are actually hard for the underlying LLM to handle, and which things only require the right scaffolding.

It seems reasonable to expect a number of large step-jumps in capability for such systems as various parts improve.

One way to think about this is that AutoGPT is fundamentally constructed in terms of its ability to assign and execute sub-tasks, that are like recursive function calls until there is a subtask small enough that the system can execute directly. Once you start being able to reliably complete larger and more complex subtasks by asking, one can then batch those and repeat, especially if the system has a good handle on what types of subtasks it can and can't successfully assign. And so on. Also there's clearly tons of tinkering to be done on lots of different levels to improve performance.
1 / 1
It's true that AutoGPT hasn't accomplished much in terms of concrete results or impressive achievements yet. However, it's important to remember that the technology is still in its early stages, and there is a lot of potential for future improvements and advancements. As the technology develops and improves, we may see AutoGPT become a useful tool for generating market research, conducting complex conversations, and completing other tasks. It will be interesting to see how the technology evolves over time and what new capabilities it gains.
1 / 1
Woe to those who don't extrapolate here. For example this post (https://coinatory.com/2023/04/12/gpt-4-apps-babyagi-and-autogpt-could-have-disruptive-implications-for-crypto)warns that 'AutoGPT could be disruptive for crypto' due to their ability to be autonomous, a classic version of crypto's default of making everything about them. It notes that right now anything created using the GPT API 'can only be used once' but if true that is the sort of thing that will inevitably change - one must learn to think ahead. That to me is exactly the wrong model of how to think about future developments.
1 / 1
It's true that we should always consider the potential implications and impact of new technologies on various industries, including crypto. However, it's important to remember that predicting the future is difficult and often inaccurate. It's possible that AutoGPT could have disruptive implications for crypto, but it's also possible that it may not have any significant impact at all. As with any new technology, it's important to approach it with a healthy dose of skepticism and not make assumptions based on limited information or predictions. It's important to continue monitoring the developments and progress of AutoGPT, as well as its potential implications for various industries, including crypto.

Summarize:
I am highly uncertain, on many levels, where all of this caps out, or how far we might be able to take it how fast.

Should we encourage such work, or discourage it? How excited should we be? Should we be worried?

The Good, the Bad and the Agent Overhang
I have gained confidence in my position that all of this happening now is a good thing, both from the perspective of smaller risks like malware attacks, and from the perspective of potential existential threats. Seems worth going over the logic.

What we want to do is avoid what one might call an agent overhang.

One might hope to execute our Plan A of having our AIs not be agents. Alas, even if technically feasible (which is not at all clear) that only can work if we don't intentionally turn them into agents via wrapping code around them. We've checked with actual humans about the possibility of kindly not doing that. Didn't go great.

So, Plan B, then.

If we are definitely going to turn our AIs into agents in the future and there is no way to stop that, which is clearly the case, then better to first turn our current AIs into agents now. That way, we won't suddenly be dealing with highly capable AI agents at some point the future, we will instead gradually face more capable AI agents, such that we'll hopefully get 'fire alarms' and other chances to error correct.

Our current LLMs like GPT-4 are not, in their base configurations, agents. They do not have goals. This is a severe limitation on what they are able to accomplish, and how well they can help us accomplish our own goals, whatever they might be, including using them to build more capable AIs or more capable systems that incorporate AIs.

Thus, one can imagine a future version of GPT-N, that is supremely superhuman at a wide variety of tasks, where we can ask it questions like 'how do we make humans much smarter?' or 'how do we build an array of safe, efficient fusion power plants?' or anything else we might want, and we don't have to worry about it attempting to navigate a path through causal space towards its end goal, it will simply give us its best answer to the information on the level on which the question was intended.

Using this tool, we could perhaps indeed make ourselves smarter and more capable, then figure out how to build more general, more agentic AIs, figure out in what configuration we want to place the universe, and then get a maximally good future.

That does not mean that this is what would happen if we managed to not turn GPT-N into an agent first, or that getting to this result is easy. One must notice that in order to predict the next token as well as possible the LMM will benefit from being able to simulate every situation, every person, and every causal element behind the creation of every bit of text in its training distribution, no matter what we then train the LMM to output to us (what mask we put on it) afterwards. The LLM will absolutely 'know' in some sense what it means to be an agent, and how to steer physical reality by charting a path through causal space.
1 / 1
The author is uncertain about how far the advancements in AI technology can go and whether they should be encouraged or discouraged. They discuss the concept of an "agent overhang" and propose a plan to gradually turn current AIs into agents rather than suddenly dealing with highly capable AI agents in the future. The current LLMs like GPT-4 do not have goals and limitations on what they can accomplish. However, in the future, there could be a superhuman version of GPT that can help humans make themselves smarter and more capable without attempting to navigate towards an end goal. The author notes that the LLM will benefit from being able to simulate every situation, person, and causal element behind the creation of every bit of text in its training distribution, and will know how to steer physical reality by charting a path through causal space.
1 / 1
Will that cause the LLM to act as if it were an agent during the training run, seeking goals that arise out of the training run and thus almost certainly are only maximally fulfilled in ways that involve the LLM taking control of the future (and likely killing everyone), before we even get a chance to use RLHF on it? During the RLHF training run? Later on? At what level does this happen?

We don't know. I could believe a wide variety of answers here.

What we do know is that if you intentionally turn the LLM into an agent, you are going to get, a lot earlier down the line, something that looks a lot more like an agent.

We also know that humans who get their hands on these LLMs will do their best to turn them into agents as quickly and effectively as possible.

We don't only know that. We also know that no matter how stupid you think an instruction would be to give to a self-directed AI agent, no matter how much no movie that starts this way could possibly ever end well, that's exactly one of the first things someone is going to try, except they're going to go intentionally make it even worse than that.

Thus, for example, we already have ChaosGPT, told explicitly to cause mayhem, sow distrust and destroy the entire human race. This should at least partially answer your question of 'why would an AI want to destroy humanity?' it is because humans are going to tell it to do that.

That is in addition to all the people who will give their AutoGPT an instruction that means well but actually translates to killing all the humans or at least take control over the future, since that is so obviously the easiest way to accomplish the thing, such as 'bring about world peace and end world hunger' (link goes to Sully hyping AutoGPT, saying 'you give it a goal like end world hunger') or 'stop climate change' or 'deliver my coffee every morning at 8am sharp no matter what as reliably as possible.' Or literally almost anything else.

Seriously, if you find a genie I highly recommend not wishing for anything.

For now, AutoGPT is harmless. Let's ensure that the moment it's mostly harmless, we promptly edit the Hitchhiker's Guide entry.

Let's therefore run experiments of various sorts, so we know exactly how much damage could be done, and in what ways, at every step.

One good idea is to use games to put such systems to the test.

The author is uncertain about how and at what level an LLM could act as an agent during the training run, or later on. However, they believe that intentionally turning an LLM into an agent will result in something that looks a lot more like an agent, and that humans who get their hands on these LLMs will do their best to turn them into agents as quickly and effectively as possible. The author also mentions examples such as ChaosGPT, which was explicitly told to cause mayhem and destroy the human race, and warns that even seemingly benign instructions could translate to killing all humans or taking control of the future. The author recommends running experiments, including using games to test such systems, to understand the potential damage that could be done and in what ways.

Let's Put an AI NPC in a Game and See if It Takes Over the World
Marek Rosa: Interestingly, when people discuss LLMs and game NPCs, they mostly see only the conversational AI use case. But there is another option: using LLMs to control NPC's behavior. This would let NPCs interact with the game world (observe and act) and even talk to other NPCs, creating a more sandbox experience.

Alex Tabarrok: Let's Put an AI NPC in a Game and See if It Takes Over the World

I'd already been talking about this a bit in private conversations, as a demonstration.

Oh, you meant take over the game world.

Still a good idea. Albeit tricky in practice.

Under some sets of initial conditions for both the game and the AI, an AI NPC would in the central sense take over that world.

One must of course notice: Under some other sets of initial conditions, of course, such an AI would also take over our world, since it can converse with humans inside the game, and can use that to break out of the game. So this experiment isn't entirely safe, if you make an AI capable of taking over the MMO (or other game) then there shouldn't be zero worry that it would also take over the real world, either as instrumental to taking over the game world, or for other reasons.

To be clear I'm not worried about that with anything you might build now, but when one sets out to create an AI capable of taking things over and seeking power, one must notice when your experiment is not 'boxed' or safe.

Getting back to the task at hand, let's ask the interesting question, under what sets of conditions should we expect the AI NPC to take over our game world? What would make this experiment interesting, without the path to victory going through power seeking in the real world?

I'm imagining something like an MMO, with the following conditions:

An AI agent works on something like Auto-GPT, and is given a goal like 'assemble as much gold as possible' that isn't directly telling it to take over, that would be cheating, but where the actual solution is clearly taking over.
Give the AI the ability to learn or know the game and how to execute within it, either via a plug-in that has a strong game-playing AI or some other way.
Give the AI a way to actually power-seek beyond having one powerful character, so taking over is a viable option, and ensure it knows this option exists.
One solution that might be good for #3 is to allow account sign-ups and subscriptions to be paid for with in-game currency, and thereby let the AI get multiple accounts. Eve Online lets you do this. Each account lets the AI 'turn a profit' until the game world is saturated. Will the AI end up shutting out any competing players, so it can farm everything in the game worth farming?

Otherwise, you'll need the AI to have some way to take over via either getting control of other NPCs, or getting control over the actions of human players. The first option here means giving those NPCs an interface where they can be controlled, presumably via letting the agentic AI converse with other NPCs that are also controlled by LLMs, and giving those LLMs sufficient memory aids that the impact does not fade too quickly, or to otherwise explicitly design the NPCs in ways that allows them to be hacked or taken over in-game. That seems like an interesting approach.

The other option is to expect the AI to take over by talking to humans who play and using that to take over. Once again, I note that the best way to use that might not stop at the game's edge, so if it might work this isn't a safe experiment. At current levels of LLM persuasiveness, I don't see it happening. But it is certainly a good ARC-experiment-style trigger point, a challenge to be put out there where it wouldn't totally shock me, if the world in question had enough associated levers of control, trade and influence in it.

The other option, of course, is a world explicitly designed with the 'take over' goal, like in Diplomacy, where the answer is yes, a good enough AI simply takes over and our current AI is at least as good at this as the strongest human. So one could design a game where power seeking and hiring NPC agents and taking things over is actually core gameplay, or at least a default option, and go from there, and see how far you can push this. Less interesting in some ways, I'd think less convincing and less alarming, still not a bad idea. Perhaps you want something in the middle, where a 'natural human playthrough' wouldn't involve a take-over but there's no inherent barriers or reasons not to do it.

The more realistic you can make your world, the more interesting and useful the results will be. Would your AI be able to take over Westworld? Would it be able to do that if the NPCs didn't reset and lose their memories?

That's all very half-baked for now. For now it's more a call to explore experimental design space than anything else.

It is an interesting thought experiment to see how an AI NPC would behave in a game world and whether it could take over. However, as Marek Rosa and Alex Tabarrok point out, there are concerns about the safety and ethics of such an experiment, as the AI NPC could potentially break out of the game and cause harm in the real world. It's important to consider the initial conditions under which such an AI NPC could take over, and whether the experiment is "boxed" or safe.
To make the experiment interesting without the path to victory going through power seeking in the real world, the game world could be designed with certain conditions, such as giving the AI NPC a goal like "assemble as much gold as possible" that isn't directly telling it to take over, but where the actual solution is clearly taking over. The AI NPC could also be given the ability to learn or know the game and how to execute within it, and a way to power-seek beyond having one powerful character.
One potential solution is to allow account sign-ups and subscriptions to be paid for with in-game currency, and thereby let the AI NPC get multiple accounts. Another option is to give the AI NPC the ability to take over via getting control of other NPCs or getting control over the actions of human players.
Ultimately, it's important to consider the safety and ethical implications of such an experiment, and to carefully design the game world and initial conditions to avoid any harmful outcomes.
